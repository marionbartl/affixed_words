Exfoliation is a key part of any skin beautifying treatment .
But forget salt scrubs , rubs and foot files .
Why not try something far more efficient : the toothless mouths of hundreds of tiny , voraciously feeding fish ?
" Doctor fish " - so named for their ability to produce healthy , glowing results from even the most crusty or diseased epidermis - are the key ingredient in a spa and skin treatment becoming increasingly popular across Japan , China , Turkey and Europe .
The idea is that you immerse your feet , hands or , if you are brave enough , your entire body in a warm pool that swarms with hundreds of hungry minnow - sized feeders .
The fish zoom in on your most crusty , flaky or scabby skin and chomp away at it to reveal the fresh layer beneath .
According to the spas and their enthusiasts , you emerge refreshed , healthy , buffed and glowing .
Doctor fish are a species called garra rufa and originate in pools near two small Turkish towns , Kangal and Sivas .
They have long been known for their ability to treat the symptoms of skin conditions such as psoriasis .
The Kangal spa , the biggest of the two , has been a healing destination for more than 100 years and since 1988 has been a treatment centre for psoriasis sufferers from all over the world .
Affecting around 2 % of people in the UK , psoriasis is a recurrent skin condition which causes sufferers to develop raised red patches of skin covered with silvery scales - " psoriatic plaques " - that can be very sore or itchy ; the playwright Dennis Potter famously struggled with a severe form of the condition .
In Kangal , the water 's high temperature makes it difficult for any nutrients to survive ; the doctor fish are therefore ravenous .
Handily , they also have a penchant for dead , diseased or scabby skin .
With their gummy mouths they strike and lick the psoriatic plaques , eating away the scaly skin that has been softened by the warm spa pool .
Their nibbles can cause minor bleeding , which the selenium - rich water and high - altitude Turkish sunlight then heals .
" We have about 3,000 visitors every year suffering from skin conditions such as psoriasis , " says Koray Altan , manager of psoriasisfishcure.com , the company that organises bookings .
" The combination of the doctor fish , the chemical composition of the water and the heat of the water really works .
Every sufferer will go away with clear skin if they follow the treatment exactly [ they must spend eight hours a day for 21 days in the water ] . "
However , this is not a permanent cure .
" The results will always be temporary , " Altan says .
" We encourage visitors to see this as the starting point in the battle against the condition . "
But does n't immersing yourself in a pool laced with fish that have been gorging on people 's scabs offer some chance of infection ?
The bleeding issue , alone , would surely be a big concern ?
" The HIV virus , for example , cannot survive outside the human body and fish cannot transmit the virus from one person to another , " says Altan .
For hygiene reasons , the centre advises patients to keep a distance from others in the pool and everyone has to bring their own slippers and towels .
Dr Tim Clayton , a consultant dermatologist at Alder Hey Children 's Hospital in Liverpool , agrees that the treatment is safe .
" I 've known of a few patients trying the treatment , " he says .
" The overall idea that the fish feed on the thickened dead skin cells found on the surface of skin is sound .
It is certainly a novel and interesting way of alleviating thickened psoriasis .
It 's unlikely to be a cure , but may help improve the skin surface .
A good holiday and the sunshine also probably helps , since psoriasis can be exacerbated by stress and ultraviolet light can improve the condition - but people should take care to avoid excessive sun exposure due to the risks of skin cancer . " .
Therese Dillon , who suffered from severe psoriasis for years and had tried everything to treat it , came across the Sivas spa while on holiday in Turkey .
" The first time I got in was very scary - hundreds of the fish came towards me .
My legs and back were very bad , and they were all over them .
I got straight out .
Eventually , I realised the fish were lovely - not at all aggressive . "
After just four days , " the effects were fantastic - my skin was clean " .
The results lasted four months .
Dillon was so convinced by the fish that she spent the next six years , with her Turkish husband , setting up a clinic - Skin Therapy Ireland - to treat psoriasis , dermatitis and eczema .
It opened at the end of last year and is the sixth doctor fish skin clinic in Europe ( the others are in Germany , Austria and Croatia ) .
The Kangal spa maintains that the chemical and mineral components in the water ( visitors drink it - from a clean source - as well as bathe in it ) are as important as the fish .
Dillon , however , believes that the saliva of doctor fish is the key to the treatment 's success .
In the absence of a clinical trial , the science is perhaps muddy .
But this , along with the " ick " factor of being eaten by fish , does not seem to deter people .
Dillon has been overwhelmed by inquiries and is already looking for an investor to expand her business .
The exfoliating efficiency - and novelty value - of doctor fish makes them hot property in the leisure market too .
In Japan enterprising spa owners have realised that as an exfoliation gimmick for healthy skin , this one has legs ( or fins ) .
They have begun to import buckets of doctor fish from entrepreneurial breeders and are promoting them as nature 's best pedicure .
Canadian journalist Thomasina Larkin , who lives in Tokyo , tried both the foot and hand fish exfoliating treatments at Ooedo Onsen , a trendy Japanese spa .
" I was totally freaked out .
I stayed in the pool for about 15 minutes , as long as I could bear , and the fish - about 500 minnow - sized feeders - continued to flock to my feet .
It felt like a cross between tweezers and suction cups pecking at me and tickled to the point where I had to pull them out several times . "
So , how does it compare with a standard foot file ?
" It was n't quite as relaxing as a usual exfoliation because it tickled too much for me to be able to just sit back and enjoy , " says Larkin .
Certainly , doctor fish seem happy to devour any old epidermis - in fact , the older and thicker the better ( if you put a child in the water next to an old person , the fish will apparently go for the old person ) .
However , despite spa claims that the fish offer a relaxing " micro- massage " , sticking your feet in a bucket of minnows is hardly swimming with dolphins .

Fraudulent listings on eBay continue to pile up , and the online auctioneer appears to be incapable of proactively putting an end to them .
Since Friday , we 've been typing " tour with a whore " into eBay 's search engine ( for purely research purposes , of course ) and have been returned with dozens ( in one case hundreds ) of results featuring pornographic images .
They are posted by established users with highly favorable feedback ratings - hallmarks of accounts that have been hijacked and then used to con unsuspecting buyers .
( eBay representatives stress the company 's security department continuously snuffs out graft and that phony postings comprise a tiny percentage of overall listings . )
Some fraudulent auctions contain links that direct would - be buyers to spoofed sites that attempt to phish their eBay credentials .
Others offer a special " buy - it - now " discount if the user contacts the seller via email .
We wanted to know how these buy - it - now scams work , so we took the bait .
The auction we responded to advertised a rare Scotty Cameron Del Mar 3 golf putter .
It was offered by a user with a 100 - percent favorable score from 77 users , ensuring a trust level that is highly coveted by fraudsters .
It is part of what eBay critics say is a rash of account take - overs over the past couple months .
What follows is a transcript of the email discussion that took place :

MPAA , RIAA Create Yet ANOTHER Lobbying Group ; Push For Stronger Laws
from the no , - seriously ?

" Our law enforcement resources are seriously misaligned .
If you add up all the various kinds of property crimes in this country , everything from theft , to fraud , to burglary , bank - robbing , all of it , it costs the country $ 16 billion a year .

Techdirt is one of the few remaining truly independent media outlets .
We do not have a giant corporation behind us , and we rely heavily on our community to support us , in an age when advertisers are increasingly uninterested in sponsoring small , independent sites — especially a site like ours that is unwilling to pull punches in its reporting and analysis .

At some point , you have to just wonder if the folks running the MPAA and the RIAA are just collectively pulling everyone 's leg .
If it was n't such a huge waste of taxpayer money while also limiting the economic possibilities of this country , it would almost be funny .
Remember just last month that the RIAA and MPAA were leading the charge with yet another new lobbying organization called the Copyright Alliance ?
That was amusing enough , since the RIAA and MPAA already had plenty of clout -- and their main purpose was lobbying anyway .
However , apparently they still do n't think it 's enough .
There 's nownew organization called the Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy .
Of course , it 's being headed up by the RIAA and the MPAA , along with the National Assn. of Manufacturers and the pharmaceuticals industry -- two other groups that apparently do n't already have enough lobbying clout .
This new group is pushing for an intellectual property czar , who will work directly from the White House to crack down on IP violations .
As Boing Boing points out , this new group certainly is n't going to shy away from ridiculous and totally unsupportable statements about why it needs stronger copyright laws .
They had NBC / Universal 's general counsel Rick Cotton state this outright fabrication :
First of all , even in the most ridiculously biased studies that have been put out by the industry itself have we seen any one that has said that losses total hundreds of billions of dollars .
Second of all , each of these industry sponsored reports are easy to prove incorrect .
They tend to count every copied content as a lost sale .
They tend to double , triple and quadruple count , by including ripple effects that count the same " lost dollar " many times over .
They never , ever account for the promotional value of the content and how those ripple effects actually can ( and often do ) increase market sizes and help companies sell more .
Unfortunately , the press and politicians do n't bother to report any of this .
They 'll just take Cotton 's completely unsupportable statement as fact .

A fresh wave of tornadoes ripped through southwest Kansas Saturday evening , a day after a tornado destroyed this town , killing nine and injuring dozens more .
The National Weather Service in Dodge City said it had received reports “ well into the double digits ” of twisters touching down in Stafford , Pratt , Comanche , Kiowa , Edwards and Pawnee counties .
Among them were a series of half - mile wide “ wedge ” tornadoes – similar to the one that destroyed Greensburg – including two northwest of St. John in western Stafford County , said meteorologist Mike Umscheid .
“ We ’re going to expect quite a lot of damage , ” Umscheid said .
Emergency management officials in Stafford County were immediately available for comment .
Earlier Saturday , emergency crews called off the search in Greensburg for victims as the weather deteriorated .
Umscheid said the slow - moving storm system would likely to spawn severe weather early into this morning .
“ It looks like it ’s going to be another long night , ” he said .
Greensburg residents spent Saturday picking through what was left of their community after the tornado that left most of their town in ruin .
Jackie Robertson , her husband and a friend spent Friday night in a cellar as the storm raged outside , killing at least nine people and injuring scores more .
On Saturday , she gathered what she could – some wedding photos , a wallet , a family quilt – and reflected on what was lost .
“ My heart just aches for everyone , ” she said .
“ It is so surreal .
This is where I live . ”
Gov. Kathleen Sebelius , who plans to tour Greensburg on Sunday , praised Kansans for their response to the disaster .
“ The outpouring of emergency response from state and local agencies and volunteers is just tremendous , ” Sebelius said .
“ We as Kansans are pulling together as we always do in times of crisis and adversity , and that ’s something we should all be proud of . ”
95 percent destroyed
Greensburg , a town of 1,500 best known as the home of the world ’s largest hand - dug well , emerged Saturday to a nightmare landscape of splintered homes and smashed vehicles , the air redolent with the strong smell of sap from trees stripped of bark .
City Administrator Steve Hewitt estimated 95 percent of the town was destroyed and predicted rescue efforts could take days as many survivors may still be trapped in basements and under rubble .
Among the only structures left standing was Bar H Tavern , the town ’s only bar .
It was converted into a makeshift morgue .
“ We want everybody to know , and I plead to the American people as well as the people here in Kansas , this is a huge catastrophe that has happened to our small town , ” Hewitt said during a news conference .
“ All my downtown is gone .
My home is gone .
My staff ’s homes are gone .
And we ’ve got to find a way to get this to work and come to work every day and get this thing back on its feet .
It ’s going to be tough . ”
State Rep. Dennis McKinney , the House minority leader and a Greensburg resident , said he hid in his basement with his daughter as the storm destroyed his house .
“ It was very loud , but not as loud as I thought it would be , ” McKinney said .
“ It was over in a minute or two , the devastation was so fast . ”
He said he spent the evening and early morning conferring with emergency officials and helping search homes for survivors , although he noted “ the inspections did n’t take that long because in the western part of town , there were n’t many homes left to inspect . ”
20 - minute warning
Residents said they heard the tornado warning sirens , a common feature of towns in “ Tornado Alley , ” about 20 minutes before the storm hit .
“ We had ample warning and that ’s why , with such huge devastation , that we ’re fortunate that we did n’t have more fatalities than we had , ” McKinney said .
Meteorologist Larry Ruthi said the path of damage was 1.4 miles wide and estimated that the tornado eventually will be classified an “ upper F - 4 or an F - 5 ” tornado , the strongest possible .
“ I ’m in downtown Greensburg .
There ’s really nothing left , ” Ruthi said .
Jose Peraza said he was driving his oil rig into town when he heard the tornado warning sirens and pulled over to escape driving hail .
He hid with several other people in a convenience store freezer .
He said the storm ripped the side off the freezer and when he came out , the twister had chucked his truck – with 40,000 pounds of oil – “ like nothing . ”
Dead and injured
Sharon Watson , a spokeswoman for the Kansas Adjutant General ’s Department , said eight bodies had been recovered so far in Greensburg .
She said a ninth victim was identified in Pratt County and officials are looking into reports of two other storm - related deaths .
Rescuers pulled about 30 people from a badly damaged hospital early Saturday with most of them suffering minor injuries , Watson said .
Scores of additional injured people were sent to hospitals as far away as Wichita , 110 miles away .
More than 70 went to Pratt Regional Medical Center about 30 minutes away from Greensburg , with all but 14 treated and released , said hospital spokeswoman Kim Stivers .
Watson earlier estimated about 16 people were in critical condition , but acknowledged that it was difficult to nail down specific numbers .
“ There is still a possibility we do not have all of the people accounted for in that town , ” she said .
“ That is something we will be working feverishly to do over the next several hours . ”
Dawn Kinsey , a FEMA spokeswoman , said the agency was preparing to help with such things as damage assessments if Kansas officials request the assistance .
“ We ’ve been in contact with them since the beginning , ” Kinsey said .
“ We have n’t officially been requested by the state to assist at this point but we are standing by .
We are positioning assets . ”
Search - and - rescue efforts were hampered by downed communications towers and telephone lines , said Trooper Ronald Knoefel of the Kansas Highway Patrol .
White House response
The White House said President Bush was briefed on the situation by White House homeland security adviser Frances Fragos Townsend .
Bush hoped to speak later with Sebelius , who already had consulted with Federal Emergency Management Agency Director R. David Paulison .
“ The president ’s thoughts and prayers are with the people of Greensburg and all of those who have suffered loss and injury , ” David Almacy , a White House spokesman , said Saturday .
Mandatory evacuation
Dazed residents walked the streets , looking for loved ones and taking in the sight of crumbled buildings and smashed cars .
Hewitt described massive damage : City Hall , the high school and junior high school , the water tower and most of the commercial district , all destroyed .
“ I do n’t think we have a business left downtown , ” he said .
He said a mandatory evacuation was ordered .
Sebelius declared a disaster emergency for Kiowa County , said her spokeswoman Nicole Corcoran .
“ It ’s possible that we could add five additional counties , ” Corcoran said .
“ But we ’re not sure yet at this point so right now I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that an emergency disaster has been declared for Kiowa County . ”
Ruthi , with the National Weather Service in Dodge City , said the storm system spawned at least three significant tornadoes , including the one that hit Greensburg .
He said there were likely other smaller twisters .
Emergency medical crews , law enforcement personnel and search and rescue teams from throughout western Kansas and as far east as Wichita raced toward Greensburg after the twister struck .
The Kansas National Guard sent 40 troops to assist with security .
Power and communications in the town of about 1,600 people were knocked out by the tornado .
Watson said the state transportation department sent its Communications on Wheels mobile unit to restore 911 service .
Roads into and out of Greensburg , including U.S. 54 , were closed for several hours to allow emergency vehicles to maneuver .
Some streets were left impassable by tangles of fallen cable .

TOM FAHEY , NEW HAMPSHIRE UNION LEADER :
Thanks ,
Wolf .
Governor Romney , I wanted to start by asking you a question on which every American has formed an opinion .
We have lost 3,400 troops , civilian casualties are even higher , and the Iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country .
Knowing everything you know right now , was it a mistake for us to invade Iraq ?
MITT ROMNEY , FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS :
Well , the question is , kind of , a non sequitur , if you will .
What I mean by that -- or a null set -- that is that if you 're saying let 's turn back the clock and Saddam Hussein had opening up his country to IAEA inspectors and they 'd come in and they 'd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction , had Saddam Hussein therefore not violated United Nations resolutions , we would n't be in the conflict we 're in .
But he did n't do those things , and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in .
I supported the president 's decision based on what we knew at that time .
I think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down Saddam Hussein .
By the way , Harry Reid was wrong .
We did not lose the war in Iraq .
And that 's not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harm 's way .
We did , however , not do a great job after we knocked down Saddam Hussein and won the war to take him down and his military .
And at this stage , the right thing for us to do is to see if we could possibly stabilize the central government in Iraq so that they can have stability , and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possible .
Not to do that adds an enormous potential risk that the whole region could be embroiled in a regional conflict .
BLITZER : Governor , thank you , but the question was , knowing what you know right now -- not what you knew then , what you know right now -- was it a mistake for the United States to invade Iraq ?
ROMNEY : Well , I answered the question by saying it's a non- sequitur .
It 's a non -- null set kind of question , because you can go back and say , " If we knew then what we know now , by virtue of inspectors having been let in and giving us that information , by virtue of if Saddam Hussein had followed the U.N. resolutions , we would n't be having this discussion . "
So it 's a hypothetical that I think is an unreasonable hypothetical .
And the answer is :
We did what we did .
We did the right thing based on what we knew at that time .
I think we made mistakes following the conduct or the collapse of Saddam 's government .
FAHEY : Mayor Giuliani , same question to you .
Knowing what you know right now , was it a good decision ?
RUDY GIULIANI , FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY : Absolutely the right thing to do .
It 's unthinkable that you would leave Saddam Hussein in charge of Iraq and be able to fight the war on terror .
And the problem is that we see Iraq in a vacuum .
Iraq should not be seen in a vacuum .
Iraq is part of the overall terrorist war against the United States .
The problem the Democrats make is they 're in denial .
That 's why you hear things like you heard in the debate the other night , that , you know , Iran really is n't dangerous ; it 's 10 years away from nuclear weapons .
Iran is not 10 years away from nuclear weapons .
And the danger to us is not just missiles .
The danger to us is a state like Iran handing nuclear weapons over to terrorists .
So it has to be seen in that light .
And we have to be successful in Iraq .
BLITZER : Senator McCain , arguably going to war is the most important decision a member of the Senate can make .
Did you read the national intelligence estimate , which included all the caveats on whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ?
SEN .
JOHN MCCAIN ( R ) , ARIZONA : I did not read that particular document .
I received hundreds of briefing , tens and hundreds of hours of study and background and information on it .
And the fact is that the sanctions were breaking down .
The sanctions were not going to hold .
We had a multi-billion dollar scandal in the form of oil for food .
The fact is that Saddam Hussein had used weapons of mass destruction before on his own people and on his enemies .
And if he'd gotten them again , he'd have used them again .
That was his commitment and his belief , that he was going to .
And we did the right thing .
The problem was the mismanagement of the conflict .
BLITZER : Thank you , Senator .
Senator Brownback , you 're also a member of the United States Senate .
Did you read that classified national intelligence estimate ?
SEN .
SAM BROWNBACK ( R ) , KANSAS : I do n't remember that report .
I had a number of briefings and I held a number of committee hearings .
At that time , I was chairing the Middle East Subcommittee on Foreign Relations .
And we held hearings on this topic and what was taking place and what Saddam was doing .
But the issue is that we 've got to put forward , now , a political plan .
And that 's something I 'm going to introduce tomorrow , a political plan to create a three - state solution in Iraq : a Kurdish state , a Sunni state , a Shia state .
Because Iraq is more three groups held together by exterior forces .
And that 's what we 've lacked is a political plan to get us moving forward in success .
BLITZER : Thank you , Senator .
Governor Gilmore , let me go to you .
You chaired this commission .
Do you think it was appropriate that members of Congress would authorize the president to go to war without reading that national intelligence estimate ?
JIM GILMORE , FORMER GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA :
You know , I think the people who are in Congress who are responsible for sending this country to war , with the enormous dangers that it has geopolitically and strategically , ought to read at least that kind of material .
I know they get a lot of stuff and they can't read everything .
But you know what , Wolf ?
I think the true business is this :
The interests of the United States is in creating as much stability as possible in the Middle East .
There is a very great danger to this country : our interests in Israel , our interests in energy and in other ways .
There is a giant danger of the Middle East becoming an unstable place .
Saddam Hussein was unstable , and so taking him out was good there .
But we certainly did n't anticipate the further instability that was to come after .
BLITZER : We 're going to bring all of you in , but I want to go to Scott Spradling of WMUR for the next question .
SCOTT SPRADLING , WMUR - TV :
Thanks ,
Wolf .
Senator McCain , we 've just spent a few minutes looking back .
I 'd ask you to look forward now , if you will .
Since June 1st there have been at least 17 confirmed deaths of American soldiers in Iraq .
Approximately 100 U.S. troops are dying there every month .
If our top military commander in Iraq , General Petraeus , reports back to Congress this September that the surge has n't significantly improved the situation on the ground , what then ?
MCCAIN : Well , let me say , first of all , I know how frustrated and saddened all Americans are .
This morning I was with the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfeboro , who sacrificed his life .
And our hearts and our sympathy goes out to all those who have sacrificed their lives in this conflict .
I ( inaudible ) think this strategy needs to be given a chance to succeed .
We have n't barely gotten the fifth brigade over there , which is part of this strategy .
I am convinced that if we fail and we have to withdraw , they will follow us home .
It will be a base for Al Qaida .
And we will be facing greater challenges and greater sacrifices than that already made by Matthew Stanley and his family .
There is no doubt in my mind that this will become a base for terrorism , there will be chaos in the region .
And when Senator Clinton says this is Mr. Bush 's war , that this is President Bush 's war -- when President Clinton was in power , I did n't say that Bosnia , our intervention there was President Clinton 's war .
When we intervened in Kosovo , I did n't say it was President Clinton 's war .
What Senator Clinton does n't understand that presidents do n't lose wars .
Political parties do n't lose wars .
Nations lose wars , and nations lose the -- have the consequences of failure .
BLITZER : Senator ...
MCCAIN : We must succeed in this conflict .
BLITZER : ... the question was , if General Petraeus says ...
( APPLAUSE )
... it 's not working so far in September , what do you do then ?
MCCAIN : Then you have to examine the options .
And I 'll tell you the options :
One is the division that Sam described .
You would have to divide bedrooms in Baghdad because Sunni and Shia are married to each other .
You have 2 million Sunni and 4 million Shia living in Baghdad together .
You would have to -- you withdraw to the borders and watch genocide take place inside Baghdad .
You watch the destabilization of Jordan .
You see further jeopardy of Israel because of the threats of Hezbollah and Iranian hegemony in the region .
All of the options I could run through with you .
My friend , none of them are good .
That 's why we must succeed and give it a chance to succeed .
BLITZER : All right .
Now , let me bring in Governor Thompson .
Go ahead , same question to you :
If General Petraeus says it 's not working in September , what should the U.S. do then ?
TOMMY THOMPSON , FORMER HHS SECRETARY :
The first thing the president should do is demand the al - Maliki government to vote as to whether or not they want the United States to stay in Iraq .
We 've been there four years .
Give the government the responsibility of voting .
If they vote " yes , " how are they going to help us win this war ?
If they vote " no , " we should redeploy our forces outside .
Secondly , there are 18 territories in Iraq , geographically defined .
Those 18 territories , just like 50 states in America , should elect their state leaders .
And if they do so , the Shiites will elect Shiites , Sunnis will elect Sunnis , Kurds will elect Kurds .
And you know something ?
People will go to those particular territories , and you get rid of this civil war internecine .
Number three ...
BLITZER : All right ...
THOMPSON : ... I would like to have the oil revenue proceeds -- very quickly -- oil revenue proceeds split : one - third to the federal government , one - third to the states , and one - third to every man , woman and child .
And that will get everybody a stake in their country .
BLITZER : Let me bring in Congressman Duncan Hunter .
Congressman , if it 's not working at that point , how much longer should the United States stay ?
REP .
DUNCAN HUNTER ( R ) , CALIFORNIA :
Well , Wolf , you know , I read that NIE report , and I held briefings before we made the vote to go in and invited everybody , Democrat and Republican , to get the classified information .
And this depends -- the turnover of the security apparatus depends on one thing : reliable Iraqi forces .
You 've got 129 Iraqi battalions .
We 've trained them up .
We 've got a lot of them in the fight .
Over the next three to four months , we need to get them all in the fight , get them that combat capability .
When they 're combat - hardened , we rotate them in , we displace American heavy combat forces off that battlefield , and Americans come home .
And , Wolf ...
BLITZER : Thank you .
HUNTER : ... I can tell you , as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for the last four years , I have the credentials to leave Iraq the right way .
BLITZER : Congressman Ron Paul , how much longer should the United States stay in Iraq ?
REP .
RON PAUL ( R ) , TEXAS :
The sooner we come home , the better .
If they declare there 's no progress in September , we should come home .
It was a mistake to go , so it 's a mistake to stay .
If we made the wrong diagnosis , we should change the treatment .
So we 're not making progress there and we should come home .
The weapons were n't there and we went in under U.N. resolutions .
And our national security was not threatened .
We 're more threatened now by staying .
BLITZER : Governor Huckabee , do you have confidence in the government of Iraq ...
( APPLAUSE )
... the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , that he 's going to do what needs to be done ?
MIKE HUCKABEE , FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS : I think there 's some real doubt about that , Wolf .
But I want to remind all of us on this stage and the people in the audience that there 's a reason that this is such a struggle .
And I think we miss it over here in the West .
Today 's the birthday of Ronald Reagan .
We all would believe that Ronald Reagan is the one who ended the Cold War and Ronald Reagan is the one who helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union .
But there 's a group of people who do n't believe that , and that 's the Taliban .
They believe they brought about the demise of the Soviet Union because of the way they fought in Afghanistan .
And what I want to just mention is that it is not the size of the dog in the fight , it is the size of the fight in the dog .
And we underestimate -- grossly underestimate how fierce this dog is and how determined they are to destroy every last one of us .
BLITZER : All right .
Congressman Tom Tancredo , what do you say ?
REP .
TOM TANCREDO ( R ) , COLORADO : I 'll tell you this , that if it comes to that point in that time that you described , that the surge is apparent that it is not working , I did support it .
I hope to God it does work .
I hope I 'm wrong .
I hope we pacify Iraq .
However , if it is apparent that we cannot , then we have to do and tell the Iraqis the exact same thing that Benjamin Franklin said when he came out of the convention in 1787 and somebody said to him , " Dr. Franklin , what have you given us ? "
And he said , " A republic , if you can keep it . "
It is exactly that time and it is exactly that thing that we have to say to the Iraqi government : " We have given you this .
We bought it with our blood and sweat .
It is now up to you to keep it . "
And I want the Iraqis to be in fact patrolling Baghdad .
If they need vehicles , you let them have the vehicles .
But I want them patrolling their city and putting their lives at risk .
Then we move out .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
( APPLAUSE )
I want to go to the next question .
I want to go back to Tom .
Tom , go ahead .
FAHEY : Senator Brownback , President Bush has stated that states that sponsor terrorism are no different than terrorists themselves .
Yet Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently met with Iranian officials to discuss security in Iraq .
Iran is a known support of Hezbollah , Hamas .
Did President Bush make the right call in opening a dialogue with Iran ?
BROWNBACK : I think he made a right call on saying that about terrorist states , particularly Iran .
But I think we have to at times talk with them in different situations .
Like , before we went into Afghanistan , we talked with Iran .
It was n't we were negotiating .
We did n't open up formal diplomatic relations and we should n't .
Iran is the lead sponsor of terrorism .
Ahmadinejad just this past week called for the destruction of Israel , continues to call for attacking of the United States .
On Iraq , I think we need to talk with them .
I think we have to confront them aggressively for what they are , which is the lead sponsor of terrorism in the world .
I think we need to push the sanctions forward more aggressively .
I think we need to work with the labor union movement that 's developing inside of Iran .
You had a bus driver strike that recently took place .
And I think we have to show that purpose and resolve , that we 're going to confront these guys and we 're going to stand with our allies like Israel , we 're going to stand against them oppressing and pushing us , and trying to fund terrorists against us .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
Congressman Hunter , let me bring ...
BROWNBACK : Senator , if you do n't mind .
BLITZER : Excuse me , Senator .
BROWNBACK : That 's OK .
BLITZER : Congressman Hunter , let me bring you back in .
Do you agree with Senator Brownback that President Bush made the right decision in opening a direct dialogue with Iran ?
HUNTER : With two conditions .
And I think that you do have a dialogue with everybody , whether they 're adversaries or friends .
The two conditions are : Number one , they are moving deadly equipment across the border that is killing Americans in Iraq .
We have license to utilize anything that we want to use : special operations , intelligence , whatever it takes to stop that deadly equipment from moving across the border and hitting Americans in Iraq .
And we do n't give that up with these talks .
Secondly , they 've got about 1,000 centrifuges now working , enriching the material that can make , at some point , a nuclear device .
The United States reserves the right to preempt , and we may have to preempt that nuclear weapons program .
We cannot allow them to have a nuclear device .
With those two caveats , talk to your enemies .
BLITZER : If it came down to a preemptive U.S. strike against Iran 's nuclear facility if necessary , would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons ?
HUNTER : I would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to preempt those particular centrifuges .
When the Osirak reactor was hit in ' 86 , when the six F - 18s came over the horizon and knocked that out , they did n't need anything but conventional weapons .
Probably it 's going to take a little more than that .
I do n't think it 's going to take tactical nukes .
BLITZER : What do you think , Mayor ?
Do you think , if you were president of the United States and it came down to Iran having a nuclear bomb , which you say is unacceptable , you would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons ?
GIULIANI : Part of the premise of talking to Iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the United States that they have nuclear power .
I think it could be done with conventional weapons , but you can't rule out anything and you should n't take any option off the table .
And during the debate the other night , the Democrats seemed to be back in the 1990s .
They do n't seem to have gotten beyond the Cold War .
Iran is a threat , a nuclear threat , not just because they can deliver a nuclear warhead with missiles .
They 're a nuclear threat because they are the biggest state sponsor of terrorism and they can hand nuclear materials to terrorists .
And we just saw it just last week in New York , an attempt by Islamist terrorists to attack JFK airport ; three weeks ago , an attempt to attack Fort Dix .
These are real problems .
This war is not a bumper sticker .
This war is a real war .
BLITZER : Thank you , Mayor .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Let me bring Governor Gilmore in .
What do you say about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons if that 's what it takes to go deep underground and destroy those Iraqi facilities ?
GILMORE : One of the central problems of the Middle East is the desire for Iran to dominate that portion of the world , because of what they are doing .
And that is why I believe that they are seeking this kind of nuclear capacity .
That is one of the reasons why we are , in fact , in Iraq .
And that 's why our soldiers , when they fight and die there , are in fact serving the interests of the United States .
Nobody ought to have any doubt about that .
With respect to Iran , the policy I would follow would be dual .
Number one , we need to work with our European allies in order to put in appropriate sanctions .
We need to communicate directly with the Iranians that we are going to offer them an opportunity to work with us .
But we are also going to say that having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable ; they need to understand it .
And all options are on the table by the United States in that instance .
BLITZER : All right .
Thank you , Governor .
Governor Romney , I want to get you on the record .
Do you agree with the mayor , the governor , others here , that the use of tactical nuclear weapons , potentially , would be possible if that were the only way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb ?
ROMNEY : You do n't take options off the table , but what you do is stand back and say , " What 's going on here ? "
You see what 's happening in Sudan and Afghanistan , in Iraq and Iran .
All over the world , we 're seeing the same thing happening , and that is people are testing the United States of America .
And we have to make sure they understand that we 're not arrogant ; we have resolve .
And we have the strength to protect our interests and to protect people who love liberty .
For that to happen , we 're going to have to not just attack each one of these problems one by one , but say , how do we help move the world of Islam so that the moderate Muslims can reject the extreme ?
And for that to happen , we 're going to have to have a strong military and an effort to combine with our allies in such a way , we combine for an effort to help move Islam toward modernity .
That 's what we 're going to have to do , instead of looking at each theater one by one and saying , " We 'll bomb here , we 'll attack here , we 'll go to Sudan . "
I watched the Democrats ...
BLITZER : Thank you .
ROMNEY : ... they do n't think there 's a war on terror .
BLITZER : Thank you .
ROMNEY : There 's a war going on , and we need a broad response to make sure that these people have a different vision .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor .
All of you are going to have an opportunity to weigh on all of these questions as well .
If you 're hearing some sounds out there , it 's lightning here in Manchester , New Hampshire .
Those are the crackling sounds that you 're hearing .
Let 's go back to Scott .
SPRADLING : Thanks ,
Wolf .
Congressman Tancredo , let 's talk immigration .
TANCREDO : OK .
SPRADLING :
You oppose the immigration reform compromise , calling it , quote , " the worst piece of legislation to come down the pike in a long time . "
Just this morning in Manchester , you vowed to oust any senator who supports the bill , including possibly New Hampshire 's senior Senator Judd Gregg , who 's undecided , and says to your comments that you are part of the know - nothing wing of the political spectrum .
In the meantime , the president says his plan is the last best chance for serious immigration reform .
He 's criticized conservatives for being obstructionists .
With that tension at stake , if this becomes law , what are the consequences for the country ?
TANCREDO :
They are incredible , and they are disastrous .
And that is exactly why I have said what I 've said , and that is why I have consistently tried to impress upon the American public the seriousness of this issue .
We 're not just talking about the number of jobs that we may be losing or the number of kids that are in our schools and impacting our school system or the number of people that are abusing our hospital system and taking advantage of the welfare system in this country .
We 're not just talking about that .
We 're talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation : whether or not we will actually survive as a nation .
And here 's what I mean by that .
What we 're doing here in this immigration battle is testing our willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of balkanized pieces .
We are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the English language , something that is the glue that is supposed to hold us together as a nation .
We are becoming a bilingual nation .
And that is not good .
And that is the fearful part of this .
The ramifications are much , much more significant than any that we 've been discussing so far .
And so , yes , I have said dramatic things .
And , yes , I am willing to do whatever is necessary to try to stop this piece of legislation .
And that includes go after any Republican that votes for it , because the Republicans can stop this .
BLITZER : Thank you .
Thank you , Congressman .
( APPLAUSE )
Mayor Giuliani , what do you think the consequences for the nation are if this immigration plan proposed by President Bush goes through ?
GIULIANI : The problem with this immigration plan is it has no real unifying purpose .
It 's a typical Washington mess .
It 's everybody compromises -- four or five compromises .
And the compromises leave you with the following conclusion :
The litmus test you should have for legislation is , is it going to make things better ?
And when you look at these compromises , it is quite possible it will make things worse .
The organizing purpose should be that our immigration laws should allow us to identify everyone who is in this country that comes here from a foreign country .
They should have a tamper - proof I.D. card .
It should be in a database that allows you to figure out who they are , why they 're here , make sure they 're not illegal immigrants coming here for a bad purpose , and then to be able to throw out the ones who are not in that database .
We can do that .
Credit card companies ...
BLITZER : Thank you .
GIULIANI : ... take care of data that is greater than that .
BLITZER : Thank you , Mayor .
I want to get to Senator McCain in a moment , but first , Governor Romney , Senator McCain has accused you of flip - flopping on this issue , in effect .
Yesterday in Miami , he said the following : " Pandering for votes on this issue while offering no solution to the problem amounts to doing nothing .
And doing nothing is silent amnesty . "
What do you say to Senator McCain ?
ROMNEY : Well , he 's my friend .
He campaigned for me two times .
I consider him a friend .
I 'm not going to make this a matter of personal politics .
It 's an issue that 's way too important for that .
My view is that we should enforce our immigration laws .
And this bill , unfortunately , has at least one provision that 's a real problem .
It 's the Z visa .
And what it allows is people who have come here illegally to stay here for the rest of their lives -- not necessarily as citizens ; they have to wait 13 years to become citizens .
That 's not the point .
The point is : Every illegal alien , almost every one , under this bill , gets to stay here .
That 's not fair to the millions and millions of people around the world that would love to come here , join with family members , bring skill and education that we need .
It 's simply not fair to say those people get put ahead in the line of all the people who 've been waiting legally to come to this country .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : All right , Senator McCain , this is your chance .
I 'd like you to respond as someone who is the co-author of this legislation .
MCCAIN : Well , first of all , I agree with Judd Gregg .
He 's a great senator .
( APPLAUSE )
Second of all , Rudy , you just described our legislation , so I 'd be glad to have further conversation with you , because it does account for people who are here illegally .
It does have an employment verification system .
And it weeds out those who should n't be here , and it gives others a chance to remain in this country .
Look , this is a national security issue , first and foremost .
Ever since 9/11 , it 's a national security issue .
People came to Fort Dix , New Jersey , from across our southern border and tried to kill our soldiers .
For us to do nothing is silent and de facto amnesty .
What we have done is what you expect us to do , my friends , and that 's come together with the president of the United States , the leader of our party , Democrat and Republican , conservative Republicans like Jon Kyl , Johnny Isakson , Saxby Chambliss and Trent Lott , and sit down and figure out an approach to this problem .
And it is a serious national security problem .
We need to act , my friends .
And if someone else has a better idea , I 'd love to have them pursue -- give it to us .
BLITZER : Thank you , Senator .
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
Hold on .
MCCAIN : That can get ...
BLITZER : Senator ...
( CROSSTALK )
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ... a better idea !
MCCAIN : That will get the support of enough people so that we can pass legislation .
This is n't the bill that I would have written , but it does ...
BLITZER : All right .
Thank you .
MCCAIN : ... it does satisfy our national security challenges , which are severe and intense .
And we cannot 12 million people washing around America illegally , my friends .
( CROSSTALK )
MCCAIN : And I hope you 'll examine the legislation .
BLITZER : Thank you , Senator .
MCCAIN : And I hope we can move forward with it .
And we can make it better .
BLITZER : All right .
MCCAIN : But it 's our job to do the hard things ...
BLITZER : Mayor , go ahead .
MCCAIN : ... not the easy things .
( APPLAUSE )
GIULIANI : I 've read the 400 pages .
And this is part of the problem in Washington :
They say things and then it's not in the legislation .
There are four or five different methods of identification , not one .
It does not provide information about who exited the United States .
Now , tell me how you 're going to figure out who's in the United States if you can't figure out who 's left the United States .
And finally , it does n't provide for a uniform database .
Many countries have this .
The United States does n't have it .
On September 11th , when we tried to figure out who was in this country , it took weeks to figure out who were the right people and who were n't , because there is n't such a database .
And that is a fatal flaw in this legislation .
And wishing it away does n't make it possible .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Governor Romney , what would you do with the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are , right now , in this country ?
ROMNEY : Well , one is to enforce the law as it exists .
The law that was passed in 1986 ...
( APPLAUSE )
The law passed in 1986 asked for us to secure the border and said also to put in place an employment verification system .
Neither one of those was done .
So let 's make sure that we enforce the law as it exists .
And if you want to improve this bill , well , one thing you could do to make it better is to take that Z visa and make it temporary instead of a permanent right to stay in America .
That 's simply just not fair .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : I want to stay on immigration .
Everybody 's going to have a chance to weigh in .
But let 's go back to Tom for another question on immigration .
FAHEY : Congressman Hunter , whether we like it or not , in cities across America , counties across America , including your district in San Diego , illegal immigrants are doing jobs that American citizens do n't want , working on farms , in hotels , restaurants .
If you have your way and they all leave this country , who 's going to fill those jobs ?
HUNTER : Well , first , I disagree with that premise , because when they made the sweep on the Swift plants -- those were the meat - packaging plants in Iowa ; took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago -- there were American citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour .
And let me tell you , this is a disastrous bill .
And John McCain is right in saying that this is a national security issue .
And it is : border enforcement .
Then the Hunter bill , which was signed by the president on the 26th of October , mandating 854 miles of double fence -- not that scraggly , little fence you show on CNN all the time , Wolf , that people get across so easily .
If they get across my fence , we sign them up for the Olympics immediately .
( LAUGHTER )
We 've got a big fence .
But 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed .
Homeland Security has a billion bucks , cash on hand .
It 's been six months , and they 've done 11 miles .
So this administration has a case of the slows .
And I think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time , put the two together , and the Bush - McCain - Kennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike .
It 's a bad bill .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
( APPLAUSE )
Senator Brownback , what do you say about this notion of a pathway toward citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now ?
Under what circumstances would you let them begin that path ?
BROWNBACK : I do n't think you create any new paths to citizenship .
But I also think you allow them to be able to use paths that they would currently qualify for , and to be able to get in the back of the line .
And that 's part of leadership and getting something resolved .
I think , you know , we can go on a lot of slogans here .
And I 've been around this issue for a while .
I was in Congress in 1994 , elected then .
We did the first immigration bill I was involved in then in 1996 .
You know what ?
That was an enforcement - only bill in 1996 .
And we had 7 million undocumented here in the country then .
We 're at 12 million to 20 million now .
The point of saying that -- and my colleagues and people up here , everybody is concerned that we get something done and get something right .
I think if you do exterior enforcement , border enforcement , you do aggressive interior enforcement , and then you work on a comprehensive solution interior , that 's something that a lot of people are going to be upset with but that can work and move us forward .
And it 's better than not doing anything .
BLITZER : Thank you .
So you support this pending compromise legislation ?
BROWNBACK : If we can hold together those things in it .
Those things have to be in it .
BLITZER : You 're with Senator McCain .
BROWNBACK : If those things are in it .
BLITZER : What about you , Governor Thompson ?
THOMPSON : Wolf , the first thing you have to do is you 've got to secure the border .
Securing the border is going to allow everything else to follow .
But unless you secure the border , it is not right to give 12 million individuals who have illegal rights in this country status before that border is protected .
There should be no amnesty .
And this bill , no matter how you cover it , is an amnesty bill .
And the people in this country do not believe in that bill .
And they believe very much that the best hope for us to have a secure border , just like Congressman Hunter has been talking about and every other Republican up here .
Have a secure border , then move on .
But do n't do it the other way .
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor .
Congressman Paul , I want you to weigh in on this as well .
I believe -- and correct me if I 'm wrong -- you voted to support that 700 - mile fence along the border between the United States and Mexico .
Did you ?
PAUL : I did .
BLITZER : What about Canada ?
Is there a need for a similar fence along the border between ...
PAUL : No .
BLITZER : ... the United States and Canada ?
PAUL : No , because that bill -- probably the fence was my weakest reason for doing that , but for other reasons , to enforce the law was important .
And border security is important .
And we talked about amnesty , which I 'm positively opposed to .
But one thing that has not been mentioned here , which I think is very , very important :
If you subsidize something , you get more of it .
So we subsidize illegal immigration .
We reward it by easy citizenship , either birthright or amnesty .
But we force our states and our local communities to pay for the health care , to pay for the education .
Why would n't they bring their families ?
And because of our economic conditions , we do need workers .
But if we had a truly free - market economy , the illegal immigrants would not be the scapegoat .
We would probably need them , and they would be acceptable .
But because of economic conditions , they have become the scapegoat .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : The other night , Sunday night , I asked the eight Democratic presidential candidates whether or not they thought English should be the official language of the United States .
Only one of them said English should be the official language of the United States .
If there 's someone here who does n't believe English should be the official language of the United States , please speak up right now .
MCCAIN : I think it 's fine .
I would like to remind you that we made treaties with Native Americans such as the Navajos in my state , where we respect their sovereignty and they use their native language in their deliberations .
It 's not a big deal .
But Native Americans are important to me in my state .
Everybody knows that English has to be learned if anyone ever wants to move up the economic ladder .
That is obvious .
And part of our legislation , by the way , is a requirement to learn English .
And by the way , 30 percent of the people who are in this country illegally never came across our borders , my friends .
They overstayed their visas .
That 's why it has to be a comprehensive approach .
And I 'm proud of the support of the president and his brother , Governor Jeb Bush , who was governor of the state of Florida .
People who have to deal with this issue every day understand we have to act , my friends .
And we can have our own ways to improve it .
But if we do n't address this issue , we are going to pay a heavy price .
Because something bad could happen when 12 million people are in this country illegally , 2 million of them having committed serious crimes .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : I see people raising their hands .
But the question was , I 'd only like those to speak up who believe that English should not necessarily be the official language of the United States .
Is there anyone else who stands with Senator McCain specifically on that question ?
All right .
We 're going to go back to Scott .
Go ahead , Scott .
( CROSSTALK )
BLITZER : Scott , go ahead .
HUNTER : Wolf , if I 've got -- if I have reservations in my district , can I speak up also ?
BLITZER : You 'll have an opportunity .
Go ahead , Scott .
SPRADLING : OK .
This question 's for Governor Gilmore .
Conservative credentials is the topic , sir .
You 've gotten a lot of mileage out of lumping Messrs .
Giuliani , McCain and Romney together by calling them Rudy McRomney .
( LAUGHTER )
Now , with former Senator Fred Thompson likely to join you at the next debate , in your opinion , is he conservative enough for America or are we changing the name now to Rudy McRomneyson ?
( LAUGHTER )
GILMORE : Well , we 've gotten a little mileage out of Rudy McRomney .
I know the mayor one time said that it would make a good ticket , and it would .
But it is n't a conservative ticket .
And we do n't know what Fred Thompson is either .
I think he 's a fine man .
He served in the Senate a term and a half .
Let 's see exactly what his views are .
I 'm coming forward and offering my views as a 40 - year battler for conservative values and conservative principles on behalf of the people of the United States .
And I have the record to back it up .
I 've been a prosecutor .
I 've been an attorney general .
I 've been a governor .
I governed as a conservative .
I cut taxes for the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia .
I 've stood by these principles for years and years .
The question is that when Fred Thompson comes into the race , as I believe he will -- and maybe even Speaker Gingrich may come into the race .
They 'll have to stand on their records and stand on their credentials and offer their ideas the same way that every person here on the stage is doing .
I look forward to that day , and I look forward to the debate .
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor .
Governor Thompson , is there a need for another Thompson in this race ?
( LAUGHTER )
THOMPSON : I think that anybody with a Thompson name should get involved if they want to get involved .
It 's a great name .
He 's a great candidate .
And I think it will help the Republican Party to have him in .
I just would like to say that if you 're talking about conservatism -- and that 's what you 're talking about -- there is n't a candidate on either side of the aisle that has had as many vetoes as I have .
Nobody has reduced taxes as much as I have .
And if you 're talking about a reliable conservative , it is this Thompson , Tommy Thompson , not the other , that 's the conservative .
( LAUGHTER )
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor .
Thank you , Governor .
Mayor Giuliani , there was some news here today .
A Catholic bishop in Rhode Island said some words about your position on abortion , suggesting that it was similar to Pontius Pilate 's personal opposition to Jesus Christ 's crucifixion , but allowing it to happen anyway .
How does that make you feel when you hear words like that from a Catholic bishop ?
GIULIANI : Well , Catholic bishop -- any religion ( inaudible ) .
BLITZER : That 's the lightning that 's having an effect on our system .
GIULIANI : I know .
( LAUGHTER )
I guess I 'm here by myself .
Look , for someone who went to parochial schools all his life , this is a very frightening thing that 's happening right now .
( LAUGHTER )
But the reality is I respect , you know , the opinion of Catholic ( inaudible ) and religious leaders of all kinds .
Religion is very important to me .
It 's a very important part of my life .
But ultimately , as ( inaudible ) been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law , I 've got to make the decisions that I think are the right ones in a country like ours .
And my view on abortion is that it 's wrong , but that ultimately government should not be enforcing that decision on a woman .
That is my view that I -- I consult my religion .
I consult my reading of the Constitution .
I consult my views of what I think are important in a pluralistic society , and the reality that we have to respect the fact that there are people that are equally as religious , equally as moral , that make a different decision about this , and should government put them in jail ?
BLITZER : You made , Governor Romney , this decision on abortion , opposing abortion , relatively recently .
Why should conservatives out there , people who oppose abortion , believe you ?
ROMNEY : Well , people can look at my record .
I 'm not going to apologize for the fact that I became pro-life .
I served as governor .
As I was governor , as we were debating cloning and as we were debating also embryo farming , I said Roe v. Wade has gone too far .
I want to make it very clear that I 'm pro-life .
People here in New Hampshire have seen that I fought for life .
I fought also for traditional marriage , to keep taxes down , to have education in our schools that includes abstinence education .
I 've fought for English immersion in our schools .
They know that I 've got conservative credentials .
And that 's one of the things that brings me to this race .
But there 's something bigger in conservatism that I do n't think we 've spoken about .
And that is that America is a land of opportunity .
And our future is going to be far brighter than our past , not just as we overcome these challenges , but as we take advantage of the new opportunity of the 21st century .
BLITZER : Thank you very much , Governor .
Let 's go back to Tom for the next question .
( APPLAUSE )
FAHEY : ( inaudible ) do not believe in evolution .
You 're an ordained minister .
What do you believe ?
Is it the story of creation , as it is reported in the Bible or described in the Bible ?
HUCKABEE :
It 's interesting that that question would even be asked of somebody running for president .
I 'm not planning on writing the curriculum for an 8th - grade science book .
I 'm asking for the opportunity to be president of the United States .
But you 've raised the question , so let me answer it .
In the beginning , God created the heavens and the Earth .
To me , it 's pretty simple .
A person either believes that God created this process or believes that it was an accident and that it just happened all on its own .
And the basic question was an unfair question , because it simply asked us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed , in my view , whether there is a God or not .
Well , let me be very clear : I believe there is a God .
I believe there 's a God who was active in the creation process .
Now , how did he do it and when did he do it and how long did he take , I do n't honestly know .
And I do n't think knowing that would make me a better or a worse president .
But I 'll tell you what I can tell this country :
If they want a president who does n't believe in God , there 's probably plenty of choices .
But if I 'm selected as president of this country , they 'll have one who believes in those words that God did create .
And as the words of Martin Luther , here I stand .
I can do no other .
And I will not take that back .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Governor , but I think the specific question is , do you believe literally it was done in six days and it occurred 6,000 years ago ?
HUCKABEE : No , I did answer that , Wolf .
I said , I do n't know .
My point is , I do n't know .
I was n't there .
( LAUGHTER )
But I believe , whether God did it in six days or whether he did it in six days that represented periods of time , he did it .
And that 's what 's important .
But , you know , if anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate , they are certainly welcome to do it .
I do n't know how far they will march that back .
But I believe that all of us in this room are the unique creations of a god who knows us and loves us , and who created us for his own purpose .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Senator Brownback , you recently elaborated on your position on this , and I wonder if you 'd want to spend 30 seconds and tell our audience out there where you stand on the issue of evolution .
BROWNBACK : I 'd be happy to .
And it 's interesting that we 're doing this here at St. Anselm 's , who this -- that saint had a philosophy of faith seeking reason .
And that 's the issue that 's missing here , if I could highlight that point , is that I believe that we are created in the image of God for a particular purpose .
And I believe that with all my heart .
And I 'm somebody , I 've had cancer in the past , I 've had a season to really look at this and study it and think about the end of life .
And I am fully convinced there 's a god of the universe that loves us very much and was involved in the process .
How he did it , I do n't know .
One of the problems we have with our society today is that we 've put faith and science at odds with each other .
They are n't at odds with each other .
If they are , check your faith or check your science , and we should have a discussion .
BLITZER : Thank you .
BROWNBACK : And we should engage faith and reason like St. Anselm did .
BLITZER : Thank you .
BROWNBACK : That 's something we should do .
BLITZER : Thank you , Senator Brownback .
( APPLAUSE )
Senator McCain , do you believe creationism should be taught alongside evolution in the nation 's schools ?
MCCAIN : No , I believe that that 's up to the school districts .
But I think that every American should be exposed to all theories .
But I can't say it more eloquently than Pastor Huckabee -- Governor Huckabee just did .
And I admire his description because I hold that view .
The point is that the time before time , there 's no doubt in my mind that the hand of God was in what we are today .
And I do believe that we are unique , and I believe that God loves us .
But I also believe that all of our children in school can be taught different views on different issues .
But I leave the curricula up to the school boards .
BLITZER : Thank you , Senator , for that .
Governor Romney , there was a recent poll here in New Hampshire .
Ten percent said they would n't vote for you because you 're a Mormon .
And last week , we saw that picture of that man who refused to shake your hand because you are a Mormon .
What would you like to say to the voters out there tonight about your faith , about yourself and about God ?
ROMNEY : Well , President Kennedy some time ago said he was not a Catholic running for president , he was an American running for president .
And I 'm happy to be a proud member of my faith .
You know , I think it 's a fair question for people to ask , what do you believe ?
And I think if you want to understand what I believe , you could recognize that the values that I have are the same values you 'll find in faiths across this country .
I believe in God , believe in the Bible , believe Jesus Christ is my savior .
I believe that God created man in his image .
I believe that the freedoms of man derive from inalienable rights that were given to us by God .
And I also believe that there are some pundits out there that are hoping that I 'll distance myself from my church so that that 'll help me politically .
And that 's not going to happen .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor , for that .
Congressman Paul , you ran for president once before as a libertarian .
What do you say about this whole issue of church and state and these issues that are coming forward right now ?
PAUL : Well , I think we should read the First Amendment , where it says , " Congress shall write no law , " and we should write a lot less laws regarding this matter .
It should n't be a matter of the president or the Congress .
It should be local people , local officials .
The state should determine so many of these things that we just do n't need more laws determining religious things or prayer in schools .
We should allow people at the local level .
That 's what the Constitution tells us .
We do n't need somebody in Washington telling us what we can do , because we do n't have perfect knowledge .
And that 's the magnificence of our Constitution and our republic .
We sort out the difficult problems at local levels , and we do n't have , you know , one - case - fit- all .
Because you have a Supreme Court ruling , like on Roe v. Wade , it ruined it for the whole country .
And that 's why we should n't have it at a central level .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
( APPLAUSE )
Let 's go back to another question from Tom .
FAHEY : This is for Mayor Giuliani .
Sea levels around the world are rising .
Average temperatures are increasing .
A U.N. report written by scientists from 113 countries recently said that climate change is very likely man-made and may affect us for centuries to come .
Is science wrong on global warming ?
And what , if any , steps would you take as president to address the issue of climate change ?
GIULIANI : I think we have to accept the view that scientists have , that there is global warming , and that human operation , human condition contributes to that .
And the fact is that there is a way to deal with it and to address it in a way that we can also accomplish energy independence , which we need as a matter of national security .
It 's frustrating and really dangerous for us to see money going to our enemies because we have to buy oil from certain countries .
We should be supporting all the alternatives .
We need a project similar to putting a man on the moon .
That project started with Eisenhower .
It was carried out by Kennedy and then Johnson and then Nixon .
And that was two Democrats and two Republicans working ( inaudible ) Democrats working in the national interest .
BLITZER : Thank you .
Thank you , Mayor .
I want Governor Romney to weigh in as well .
There 's a perception , at least among some , that Republicans are -- at least the Republican Party -- very close to big oil .
A lot of Americans are suffering now from the price of gasoline -- high price of gasoline .
What do you say to the audience out there who believes that there 's too much of an alliance , if you will , between the big oil companies and Republicans ?
ROMNEY : Well , first of all , Rudy Giuliani is right , in terms of an Apollo project to get us to energy independent .
And the effects of that on global warming are positive .
It 's a no-regrets policy .
It 's a great idea .
Secondly , with regards to big oil , big oil is making a lot of money right now .
And I 'd like to see them using that money to invest in refineries .
Do n't forget that when companies earn profit , that money 's supposed to be reinvested in growth .
And our refineries are old .
Someone said to me -- Matt Simmons , an investment banker down in Houston -- he said , " Our refineries today are rust , with paint holding them up . "
And we need to see these companies , if they 're making that kind of money , reinvest in capital equipment .
But let 's not forget that where the money is being made this year is not just -- and throughout these years -- is not just in Exxon and Shell and the major oil companies .
It 's in the countries that own this oil .
Russia last year took in $ 500 billion by selling oil .
Ahmadinejad , Putin , Chavez -- these people are getting rich off of people buying too much oil .
And that 's why we have to pursue , as a strategic imperative , energy independence for America .
And it takes that Apollo project .
It also takes biodiesel , biofuel , ethanol ...
BLITZER : Thank you .
ROMNEY : ... cellulosic ethanol , nuclear power , more drilling in ANWR .
We have to be serious also about efficiency .
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor .
ROMNEY : And that 's going to allow us to become energy - independent .
BLITZER : Senator McCain , do you have a problem at this time with these oil companies making these huge profits ?
MCCAIN : Sure .
I think we all do .
And they ought to be reinvesting it .
And one of the areas that they ought to be involved in is nuclear power .
Nuclear power is safe .
Nuclear power is green , does not emit greenhouse gases .
Nuclear power is used on Navy ships which have sailed around the world for 60 years without an accident .
And of course we ought to be investing in alternate energy sources .
Recently there was a group of retired military officers who said that climate change and energy independence is a national security issue .
It is .
We 've got to reduce our dependence on imported oil .
We can do it through a wide variety of alternative fuels .
But we have to be serious about it and we 're going to have to go to places where we have never gone before .
And nuclear power is one of the major issues , but also all kinds of ethanol as well .
BLITZER : Thank you , Senator .
Let me bring Congressman Paul back into this conversation .
In 2005 , President Bush signed an energy bill that provided billions of dollars in tax break subsidies to the oil companies , with the goal of boosting domestic production .
At a time of these record profits , do you believe these companies need a helping hand from the federal government ?
PAUL : I do n't think the profits is the issue .
The profits are OK if they 're legitimately earned in a free market .
What I object to are subsidies to big corporations when we subsidize them and give them R&D money .
I do n't think that should be that way .
They should take it out of the funds that they earn .
But also , you can't discuss energy without discussing our foreign policy .
Why do we go to the Middle East ?
We know the oil is very important about the Middle East and why we 're there .
Why did we , our government , help overthrow Mosaddeq in 1953 ?
It had to do with oil .
So , our foreign policy is designed to protect our oil interests .
The profits , that 's not the problem .
It 's the problem that we succumb to the temptation to protect oil interests by literally going out and fighting wars over oil .
BLITZER : Governor Gilmore , you agree ?
GILMORE : I agree that if you make profits of the open marketplace , that that 's an appropriate thing to do .
I also believe that they should be going in and putting this additional money into additional drilling , into additional exploration .
But it 's going to have to be bigger than that .
We 're going to have to in fact look to all sources : ethanol , biomass , coal , clean coal , the opportunities for natural gas , and nuclear power .
And by the way , nuclear power will help this whole issue of global warming .
And one more point in direct answer to your question :
The Kyoto treaty was , in fact , fatally flawed .
That was a treaty that in fact was going to basically just transfer our money directly to Russia for nothing , because they were going to get credits because simply that their economy had declined .
The truth is , we 're going to have to get a program in place , an international diplomatic answer , that is going to include every nation of the world in this entire project .
And that includes China and India .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor .
Let me bring Scott back for the next question .
SPRADLING : Congressman Paul , a question for you .
Most of our closest allies , including Great Britain and Israel , allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military .
Is it time to end do n't ask / do n't tell policy and allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the U.S. military ?
PAUL : I think the current policy is a decent policy .
And the problem that we have with dealing with this subject is we see people as groups , as they belong to certain groups and that they derive their rights as belonging to groups .
We do n't get our rights because we 're gays or women or minorities .
We get our rights from our creator as individuals .
So every individual should be treated the same way .
So if there is homosexual behavior in the military that is disruptive , it should be dealt with .
But if there 's heterosexual sexual behavior that is disruptive , it should be dealt with .
So it is n't the issue of homosexuality .
It 's the concept and the understanding of individual rights .
If we understood that , we would not be dealing with this very important problem .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Governor Huckabee , I want you to weigh in as well .
Do you believe it 's time to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the United States military ?
HUCKABEE : Wolf , I think it 's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct .
I think that 's what Congressman Paul was saying :
It 's about conduct ; it 's not about attitude .
But I 'd like to ask you .
You said a moment ago that you were going to all give us a chance to deal with the issue of immigration .
BLITZER : We 're going to come back to that .
HUCKABEE : And I hope you 'll do that .
BLITZER : We will .
We 'll come back to immigration .
HUCKABEE :
You held us to it , and now I want to hold you to it , so ...
BLITZER : We 're going to come back ...
HUCKABEE : ... if you could give us that opportunity .
BLITZER : We 're going to come back to immigration .
But right now , we 're talking about allowing gays to serve openly in the military .
But you 're opposed to that ?
HUCKABEE : I just said I think it 's a matter -- it 's not -- you do n't punish people for their attitudes ; you punish them if their behavior creates a problem .
And it 's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct .
BLITZER : So you would n't change existing policy .
HUCKABEE : What ?
BLITZER : You would n't change existing policy .
HUCKABEE : I do n't think that I would .
I think it 's already covered by the existing policy that we do have , in fact .
BLITZER : Mayor Giuliani , recently we 've learned that several talented trained linguists -- Arabic speakers , Farsi speakers , Urdu speakers -- trained by the U.S. government to learn those languages to help us in the war on terrorism , were dismissed from the military because they announced they were gays or lesbians .
Is that , in your mind , appropriate ?
GIULIANI : This is not the time to deal with disruptive issues like this .
Back in 1994 we went through this .
And it created a tremendous amount of disruption .
Colin Powell , I think , was still the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before he left at the beginning of the Clinton administration .
He came to the view that this was a good policy .
And I think in time of war , in a time where we 're trying to deal with this transition to a new kind of warfare that we have to be fighting -- and we have n't gotten all the way there yet .
We need a hybrid army , we need to look at nation - building as part of what we have to teach our military .
I do n't think this would be the right time to raise these issues .
BLITZER : Thank you .
GIULIANI : And I think we should rely on the judgment of our commanders in a situation like this .
They know what 's disruptive and what 's not .
And at a time of war , you do n't make fundamental changes like this .
BLITZER : Thank you , Mayor .
Governor Romney , the mayor referred to the do n't ask / do n't tell policy , which was implemented during the Clinton administration , after Bill Clinton became president .
In 1994 , you were quoted as saying that you advocated gays being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation 's military .
The question to you is , do you still feel that way ?
ROMNEY : No , actually when I first heard of the do n't ask / do n't tell policy I thought it sounded awfully silly and did n't think that 'd be very effective , and I turned out to be wrong .
It 's been the policy now in the military for , what , 10 , 15 years ?
And it seems to be working .
And I agree with what Mayor Giuliani said , that this is not the time to put in place a major change , a social experiment , in the middle of a war going on .
I would n't change it at this point .
We can look at it down the road .
But it does seem to me that we have much bigger issues as a nation that we ought to be talking about than that policy right now .
BLITZER : Senator McCain , you 've been involved in military matters virtually your whole life .
What do you say ?
MCCAIN : We have the best - trained , most professional , best - equipped , most efficient , most wonderful military in the history of this country .
And I 'm proud of every one of them .
( APPLAUSE )
There just are n't enough of them .
So I have to rely on our military leadership , in whom we place the responsibility to lead these brave young Americans in combat as we speak .
So I think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue .
It is working , my friends .
The policy is working .
And I am convinced that that 's the way we can maintain this greatest military .
As much as I revere the greatest generation , as much as I love my own generation , this is the very best .
Let 's not tamper with them .
BLITZER : Is there anyone here who believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the United States military ?
If you do , speak up now .
Scott , go ahead with your question .
SPRADLING : Gentlemen , last night , we asked Democrats , if they were elected , what role would they use former President Clinton ?
I 'm not going to ask you that .
( LAUGHTER )
But , Governor Thompson , I 'd like to know , seeing as how you were a member of President Bush 's Cabinet as health and human services secretary , how would you use George W. Bush in your administration ?
THOMPSON : I certainly would not send him to the United Nations .
( LAUGHTER )
I believe George W. Bush has tremendous characteristics .
He 's very honest .
He 's very straightforward .
I would put him out on a lecture series , talking to the youth of America about honesty , integrity , perseverance , passion , and serving the public .
George W. Bush believes very much in public service , as does his father , as does his brothers , as does his mother .
I think he could be a wonderful spokesperson , making sure that young people realize that public service is a very noble cause and something that young people should aspire to , like all the young people here on this campus should also have the opportunity to serve in public life .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Senator Brownback , same question to you :
If you 're elected president , what would you ask your predecessor to do ?
BROWNBACK : Well , I would talk with him about it first , and I would ask him about it .
I think he would probably take a position the way his dad did , saying , " You know , I think you need to have your time in the limelight .
And I will be willing to help out if you have a tragedy overseas . "
His father has been excellent , in the tsunami that hit Sri Lanka and other places , in helping fund - raising .
He 's been a wonderful ambassador in those sorts of situations .
And frankly , I think that 's the right role for an ex-president .
And I really think , in many respects , President Clinton has not assumed the right role of an ex-president , where he 's injected himself a lot more on policy issues that have n't been appropriate , and he really should defer more to the person that 's in the job .
There 's one person that 's president at a time , and that 's the way it should be .
BLITZER : Congressman Tancredo , I see you anxious to weigh in .
TANCREDO : Thank you .
Some time ago , in 2003 I think it was , that I got a call from Karl Rove , who told me that , because of my criticism of the president , I should never darken the doorstep of the White House .
I have been so disappointed in the president in so many ways since his -- actually for the last several years , not just the immigration issue , but several other things , including the No Child Left Behind and the massive increase in government that we call prescription drug -- Medicare prescription drug , that I 'm afraid I would have to tell the president of the United States -- I mean , as president , I would have to tell George Bush exactly the same thing Karl Rove told me .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
Governor Huckabee ...
( APPLAUSE )
... you served , as you reminded us , a long time as a governor , Republican governor of Arkansas .
Your old job is now in Democratic hands .
Here in New Hampshire , the GOP has suffered some significant losses as well .
And the Republicans lost the majority in the House and the Senate , as you well know .
Simple question :
What 's happened to the GOP ?
HUCKABEE : Lost credibility , because we did n't do what we were hired to do .
When you 're elected , you 're hired to do a job .
You 're hired to cut spending , lower taxes , bring more government back to the local people .
We did the polar opposite .
And the people fired us .
And I think , in many ways , though there were some good people that got caught up in the tsunami of the 2006 elections , the Republican Party , as a whole , deserved to get beat .
We 've lost credibility , the way we bungled Katrina , the fact that there was corruption that was unchecked in Washington , and the fact that there was a feeling that there was not a proper handling of the Iraqi war in all of its details , and the indifference to people pouring over our borders .
And let me just add this , Wolf .
There are a lot of people for whom the immigration issue is like a lot of them .
They see Washington not taking the kind of positions to build a fence , and they know that when they go to the airport to get on an airplane , they have to show photo I.D. , they have to go through layers of security , and they do n't understand why someone across an international border does n't have to do the same thing .
BLITZER : Thank you .
Thank you , Governor .
( APPLAUSE )
Congressman Hunter , I want to just -- because he raised the issue -- he raised the issue of corruption .
Do you think it would be appropriate for President Bush to pardon Lewis " Scooter " Libby , who was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for his role in the CIA leak case ?
HUNTER : You know , I think , Wolf , to make a determination on that , you 'd have to look at the transcript .
I 'll tell you a couple of transcripts I have looked at , and that 's the agents , Compean and Ramos , who were given 11 and 12 years respectively for stopping a drug dealer bringing 750 pounds of drugs across the border .
I 've looked at their transcript ; I would pardon Compean and Ramos right now .
( APPLAUSE )
And let me say , with respect to what Mike said , we 've got to bring back the Reagan Democrats to this party , because we need the Reagan Democrats for Republican leadership to work .
And we 're going to have to get a good trade bill that brings jobs back to this country .
We 're going to have to stop China from cheating on trade , build the middle class , build jobs , Wolf .
That 's what strengthens the Republican Party .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : I just want to do a quick " yes " or " no . "
And I 'm going to go down the rest of the group and let everybody just tell me " yes " or " no " : Would you pardon Scooter Libby ?
( UNKNOWN ) : No .
GILMORE : No .
I 'm steeped in the law .
I would n't do that .
BROWNBACK : No , not without reading the transcript .
HUCKABEE : Not without reading the transcript .
MCCAIN : He 's going through an appeal process .
We 've got to see what happens here .
GIULIANI : I think the sentence was way out of line .
I mean , the sentence was grossly excessive in a situation in which , at the beginning , the prosecutor knew who the leak was ...
BLITZER : So , yes or no , would you pardon him ?
GIULIANI : ... and he knew a crime was n't committed .
I recommended over a thousand pardons to President Reagan when I was associate attorney general .
I would see if it fit the criteria for pardon .
I 'd wait for the appeal .
I think what the judge did today argues more in favor of a pardon because ...
BLITZER : Thank you .
GIULIANI : ... this is excessive punishment .
BLITZER : All right .
GIULIANI : When you consider -- I 've prosecuted 5,000 cases .
BLITZER : I 'm trying to get a yes or no .
( LAUGHTER )
GIULIANI : Well , this is a very important issue .
This is a very , very important -- a man 's life is at stake .
And the reality is , this is an incomprehensible situation .
They knew who the leak was .
ROMNEY : Hey , Wolf , can I explain ...
GIULIANI : And ultimately , there was no underlying crime involved .
BLITZER : All right .
ROMNEY : This is one of those situations where I go back to my record as governor .
I did n't pardon anybody as governor , because I did n't want to overturn a jury .
But in this case , you have a prosecutor who clearly abused prosecutorial discretion by going after somebody when he already knew that the source of the leak was Richard Armitage .
He 'd been told that .
So he went on a political vendetta .
BLITZER : Was that a yes ?
ROMNEY : It 's worth looking at that .
I will study it very closely if I 'm lucky enough to be president .
And I 'd keep that option open .
BLITZER : Senator ?
BROWNBACK : Yes .
The basic crime here did n't happen .
What they were saying was that the identity of an agent ...
BLITZER : All right .
Governor ?
BROWNBACK : ... was revealed , but that agent has to be in the field for that to be a crime .
That did n't occur .
BLITZER : Governor ?
THOMPSON : Bill Clinton committed perjury at a grand jury , lost his law license .
Scooter Libby got 30 months .
To me , it 's not fair at all .
But I would make sure the appeal was done properly , and then I would examine the record .
BLITZER : Congressman ?
TANCREDO : Yes .
BLITZER : Yes .
All right .
We heard from all of them .
( APPLAUSE )
We 're ready to take -- go into part two of tonight 's debate right now , where voters from New Hampshire will have an opportunity to ask their questions .
We have some work to do here on the stage .
While we move some chairs around , move out the podiums , while we do all that , and you 'll be able to see it , viewers of WMUR are going to go back to their studios .
For the rest of you , I 'm going to bring in my colleagues , Larry King and Anderson Cooper , part of the best political team on television , to give us a sense of this debate so far .
Our debate here will resume in about three minutes .
( BREAK )
BLITZER : We 're now set for our voters here to ask questions .
Our pool of voters here are either registered Republicans or independents , but they 're likely -- likely to vote Republican in New Hampshire 's first - in - the - nation primary .
We brought them together with the help from the New Hampshire Political Library and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics .
CNN producers have interviewed all of them .
Working with me in this half of the debate is Jennifer Vaughn from our partner WMUR - TV .
Jennifer , who has the first question ?
JENNIFER VAUGHN , WMUR - TV : Thank you , Wolf .
And good evening to you all tonight .
I have Erin Flanagan with me tonight .
Hi , Erin .
QUESTION : Hi , Jennifer .
VAUGHN : You live in Bedford , New Hampshire .
QUESTION : I do .
VAUGHN : You have a question about the war in Iraq , which is something that is deeply personal to you .
QUESTION : It is .
Unfortunately , my beloved little brother , 1st Lieutenant Michael Joseph Cleary , was killed in action in Taji , Iraq , eight days before he was to return home on December 20th of 2005 .
He was the best of the best and answered the call to serve our country .
My family has been devastated by the loss .
As a member of an American family who has suffered so greatly at the choices made by the current administration , I desperately would like to know what you as commander in chief would do , both in the halls of the American government , to bring the parties together , as well as on the desert sands of the Middle East to bring this conflict to a point in which we can safely bring our troops home .
VAUGHN : Erin , thank you .
Congressman Hunter , let 's begin with you on that .
HUNTER : OK .
Absolutely .
The key to leaving -- and , incidentally , thank you for his service .
And I want to let you know , my son ...
( APPLAUSE )
I want to let you know that my son Duncan , the day after 9/11 , joined the Marine Corps , quit his job , did two tours in Iraq .
He 's in Afghanistan right now .
First , I want you to know that it 's worth it .
( APPLAUSE )
What he did was worth it .
And if we can achieve a country in Iraq that will not be an state sponsor of terrorism for the next 5 to 10 to 20 years , that will be a friend , not an enemy , of the United States , and will have a modicum of freedom , that is in the national interest of the United States , just like establishing a free Japan on the other side of the Pacific was in our interest after World War II , just like providing freedom and a protective shield for Salvador in Central America was in our interest .
So what I would do , and what we need to do right now , and we are doing , is standing up the Iraqi army .
There is 129 battalions of Iraqis that we 've trained and equipped .
We need to start moving them into the combat zones where they displace the heavy American combat forces .
Then we can pull our forces out .
We can bring them home or send them wherever Uncle Sam needs them again .
BLITZER : Thank you .
HUNTER : That 's how we leave Iraq the right way .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
Senator Brownback , I 'd like you to weigh in .
BROWNBACK : If I could .
And thank you for your family 's service and what your brother did .
That 's incredible and an incredible gift that he and your family have given us .
And I think you 've identified the right thing .
It 's not about leaving , and it 's not about being defeated .
It 's about getting the situation to a point that we can turn it over to Iraqis , and then us pull back from the front of the line .
That 's why I 'm putting forward tomorrow a bill , and this would be about a three - state solution in Iraq -- a Kurdish state , a Sunni state , a Shia state -- with Baghdad as the federal city , in a loose , weak , federated system ; oil revenues equally divided .
And it 's a bipartisan bill .
We will have bipartisan support .
We 've got to pull together here to win over there .
BLITZER : Senator ...
BROWNBACK : And we can do this together , but we have n't put yet forward , this administration , a political solution that will be long - term and durable .
BLITZER : Thank you .
Thank you , Senator .
BROWNBACK : That 's what we 've got to do .
BLITZER : Senator McCain , is that a good idea , to divide up Iraq into three separate ...
BROWNBACK : It 's not divided .
It 's three states , one country .
MCCAIN : It 's not -- ma'am , I want to tell you thank you for your brother 's service and sacrifice to our country .
We are proud of you and your endurance , and we 're proud of your sacrifice .
This war -- I 'm going to give you a little straight talk .
This war was very badly mismanaged for a long time .
And Americans have made great sacrifices , some of which were unnecessary because of this management of the war -- mismanagement of this conflict .
I believe we have a fine general .
I believe we have a strategy which can succeed , so that the sacrifice of your brother would not be in vain , that a whole 20 million or 30 million people would have a chance to live a free life in an open society , and practice their religion , no matter what those differences are .
And I believe that if we fail , it will become a center of terrorism , and we will ask more young Americans to sacrifice , as your brother did .
This is long and hard and tough .
But I think we can succeed .
And God bless you .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Thank you , Senator .
Jennifer , go ahead with your next question .
VAUGHN : Cynthia Kiernan is here with us tonight .
Cynthia , you live in Merrimack , New Hampshire .
QUESTION : Yes .
VAUGHN : You can go ahead and stand up .
And you brought your husband with you ?
QUESTION : Yes .
Michael served in Iraq .
And we have a question regarding the government in Iraq .
Everyone 's talking about , " Pull our troops out ; pull our troops out . "
Well , considering they 've lived under a dictatorship for the last 30 years or so , what are we going to do to make sure they have a government in place before we do pull our troops out and they 're able to help themselves ?
Otherwise , we 're just putting them in a position to accept another terrorist leader .
( APPLAUSE )
VAUGHN : Congressman Paul ?
PAUL : Well , we 've had four years to do this and it has n't worked .
The biggest incentive for them to take upon themselves the responsibility is just for us to leave .
PAUL : We do n't need to lose 100 men and women every month , more than a thousand per year .
And so , if you want it done , you want them to take over , you 've got to give them an incentive .
So I think we should immediately stop patrolling the streets .
That 's a policeman 's job .
It 's not the work of the Army .
We 're not fighting a military battle .
We 're in a different type of warfare right now .
So the sooner we recognize that , the sooner we can make sure that no more Americans will die .
We have a lot of goodness in this country .
And we should promote it , but never through the barrel of a gun .
We should do it by setting good standards , motivating people and have them want to emulate us .
But you can't enforce our goodness , like the necons preach , with an armed force .
It does n't work .
Woodrow Wilson was telling us about that , in promoting democracy a long time ago .
BLITZER : Thank you .
PAUL : It does n't work and we have to admit it .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
( APPLAUSE )
Let me bring Mayor Giuliani in .
I do n't know if you consider yourself a neocon , but go ahead and respond to what Congressman Paul said .
( LAUGHTER )
GIULIANI : Michael , thank you very much for serving us , and thank your family for their tremendous sacrifice .
I 'd like to put it in a slightly different context .
I believe that your service for us and your brother 's sacrifice is one of the reasons we 're safe now in the United States .
I believe that this terrorist war began way back in the 1970s .
They attacked us in 1993 in New York .
They attacked us again in 2001 in a horrible way .
And I believe that what we 're doing in Iraq , if we can get it right , is going to help reduce the risk for this country .
And if we get it wrong , this is going to be much , much worse for us .
And part of what we have to do and we have n't done right is take on that responsibility of nation - building .
We created that responsibility for ourselves when we overthrew Saddam Hussein , which we did very effectively .
It was one of the greatest military actions in American history , overthrowing Saddam Hussein .
But we did n't accomplish the second step .
People can only embrace democracy when they have an orderly existence .
And we have to help provide that .
We did n't want that role , but it is our role .
And we have to train our military to do it .
We should probably have an IraqStat program , in which we measure how many people are going to school , how many factories are open , how many people are going back to work .
We had to get into the nitty - gritty of putting an orderly society together in Iraq .
It is not too late to do it .
And I 'd just like to ask , I 'd just like to ask one question I did n't get to ask before , when you said , if General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things are n't going well , what are we going to do ?
But suppose General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things are going pretty well .
Are we going to report that with the same amount of attention that we would report the negative news ?
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Jennifer , go ahead .
VAUGHN : Kysa Crusco is here with us tonight .
Hi , Kysa .
QUESTION : Hi .
VAUGHN : You live in Manchester , New Hampshire .
You are an attorney .
QUESTION : I am .
VAUGHN : OK .
What 's your question tonight ?
QUESTION : My question is whether you believe that a conservative platform can also include a conservationist agenda .
And , if so , how ?
VAUGHN : Governor Gilmore ?
GILMORE : The question was whether or not a conservative agenda can also have a conservation agenda .
And I think that it can .
Certainly , when I was governor of the state of Virginia , we worked very hard in order to make Virginia a beautiful place and a place where we could in fact be welcoming to people , and that it would be a nice community for people to visit .
But at the end of the day , this is going to come down to the question of whether or not conservatism can match up with energy independence , which is a national security issue and it is a fundamental part of conservatism .
Conservatism means empowering people .
It means cutting taxes and controlling government spending .
It also means national security .
And national security means a lot of different elements right at this time .
And we 're discussing some of them tonight .
And I can assure the people who are families here tonight , their young people , young men and women who are on the battle lines , and people who are committing their lives , they are in fact serving the national interests of this country in a time of major crisis .
The other two issues , however , would also go to the issue of the immigration issue , which I want to come back to at some point , but also energy independence .
And energy independence also can serve the interests of conservation ...
BLITZER : All right .
GILMORE : ... particularly if we use nuclear power and other clean forms of energy so that we can in fact make this a clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation .
BLITZER : Thank you very much , Governor .
Congressman Tancredo , do you believe true conservatives should be doing more to protect the environment ?
TANCREDO : Yes .
I think that that 's absolutely imperative , and I think so because , frankly , you 've got a conservative model to pick from .
I mean , you know , Teddy Roosevelt , after all , put this stamp on that -- the whole issue of conserving the environment , creating the national parks system .
There 's nothing anti-conservative about doing anything like that .
And you know what else you can do in order to foster that ?
You do it through conservative principles .
You make it profitable for people to do exactly that , to put -- to make conservation an issue that hits people in the pocketbook , or they can profit by getting involved in conservation .
That 's one way the free market really works perfectly .
We 've seen it happen all over the world .
We can see and we will put conservation to work -- conservation practices to work in the United States through conservative principles .
We have a lock on that .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
Jennifer , go ahead .
VAUGHN : Good evening , sir .
You are Doug Hall .
QUESTION : Yes .
VAUGHN : I understand that you 're the town moderator for Chichester , New Hampshire .
QUESTION : I am .
VAUGHN : What 's your question tonight ?
QUESTION : I know a business owner in northern New Hampshire who was on vacation in Spain last year for about three weeks .
While he was there , he had to buy refills for prescription drugs , brand name drugs , and he discovered in buying those drugs that he could buy his refills there for $ 600 less than he could buy them here in New Hampshire .
So since then , he said he is going to take a trip over to Spain and get his vacation paid for to buy his drugs .
My question to you is , why is this ?
And if you are elected president , is there anything you would do to address it ?
VAUGHN : Mayor Giuliani ?
GIULIANI : What I would do is change the whole model that we have for health insurance in this country .
The problem with our health insurance is , it 's government and employer - dominated .
People do n't make individual choices .
It 's your health .
You should own your health insurance .
We should be giving you a major tax deduction , $ 15,000 for a family , so you can buy your own health insurance .
If you buy health insurance for $ 8,000 or $ 9,000 , you 'll save $ 5,000 or $ 6,000 in tax - free money .
Then we should have a health savings account , in which you can put some money aside to pay for your ordinary medical expenses .
Health insurance should become like homeowners insurance or like car insurance .
You do n't cover everything on your homeowners policy .
If you have a slight accident in your house , if you need to refill your oil with your car , you do n't cover that with insurance .
But that is covered in many of the insurance policies , because they 're government - dominated and they 're employer - dominated .
What the Democrats suggested on this stage two nights ago was socialized medicine .
There was a man in California who said to me , " When we make health insurance free , just wait and see how expensive it will become . "
And the reality is that we need a free market .
We need 100 million Americans making different decisions .
It will bring down the cost of health insurance .
It will bring down the cost of prescription medicines .
Free -market principles are the only things that reduce costs and improve quality .
Socialized medicine will ruin medicine in the United States .
BLITZER : Thank you , Mayor .
( APPLAUSE )
Congressman Hunter , you live on the border , San Diego , not far from Mexico .
A lot of Americans go to Mexico to buy cheaper prescription drugs .
A lot of Americans in this part of the country go to Canada to buy cheaper prescription drugs .
What should we here in the United States be doing to bring down the price of prescription drugs ?
HUNTER : And , Wolf , the fabulous Grampy , my father - in - law , who lives with us , is one of those people that trots down and goes through the border at Yuma and does that .
So lots of Americans do that .
But here 's what happens .
Eighty percent of the new drugs and new inventions that save our lives , that help preserve the lives of the relatives of everyone who 's in this particular room right now , 80 percent of those inventions are made in the United States because we have free enterprise , where people can go out , invest .
And maybe they drill three dry holes in trying to produce a good drug that will save somebody 's lives .
Then maybe they hit the jackpot and they produce something that will save people and help their health .
They then recover their money in the United States .
And what they have left over , in terms of market , they put into the Third World .
But Third World countries like Mexico could never provide the amount of money that it takes to make those inventions .
Otherwise , they would .
Here 's what we have to do :
We need to be able to buy our health care insurance across state lines , Wolf .
Right now the same single policy that can be purchased in Long Beach for $ 73 costs $ 334 in New Jersey .
The states lock up the insurance industry .
They wo n't let Americans buy across state lines , just like they do everything else .
If we 're able to do that ...
BLITZER : Thank you .
HUNTER : ... we 're going to bring down the cost of health insurance .
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
Jennifer , let 's go back to another question .
VAUGHN : Also on the topic of health care tonight , this is a question from our wmur .
gather.com blogger , who is Joshua Williamson .
Joshua asks , " Millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the current state of our health - care system , and U.S. employers are at a disadvantage due to the high cost of health insurance .
What would you do to fix the health - care system ?
And would you support implementing a single - payer system , in which the government acts as the insurer in order to save enough money to cover the millions of uninsured and to lower premiums for the rest of the U.S. population ? "
Governor Thompson , let 's have you weigh in on that .
THOMPSON : You know , I 've been here for two debates .
We never had one question on health care .
Thank that person for talking about health care .
Number one , we spend $ 2 trillion on health care .
That 's 16 percent of the gross national product .
Ninety - three percent of the cost of health care goes into waiting until after you become sick .
Only 7 percent of the money is used to keep you well in the first place .
We got to completely transform the health care system , make it a wellness system and make it a prevention system .
Secondly , we have 125 million Americans that have one or more chronic illnesses .
In order to change this , we have to educate the American people about tobacco , about diabetes , about cardiovascular and about obesity .
You do that , you 'll be able to change health care .
The third thing , 25 percent of Americans use two - thirds of the cost of health care .
If you manage those diseases , you can reduce that down to 50 percent and save lots of money .
Fourth , information technology , electronic medical record , a patient bill of rights and be able to have e-prescribing .
And if you do that , you 're going to be able to save billions of dollars .
If you just go paperless , ladies and gentlemen , you will save 10 percent of the cost of health care .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor , very much .
Governor Romney , you worked with the Democrats in the state legislature in your home state , the Commonwealth of Massachusetts .
You worked with Ted Kennedy to come up with a program that provides some -- mandates , in effect , the individual health insurance coverage .
Some conservatives say this is simply big government , more liberal involvement in people 's lives .
What do you say to those conservatives who are critical of the way you handled this issue in Massachusetts ?
ROMNEY : Well , I want to talk to the people , not just to those conservatives who are critical .
And the people of this country recognize they 've got some real concerns in health care .
And I learned after I was governor a short bit of time -- I talked to people and they say , " If I lose my job , I 'm going to lose my insurance .
And my insurance premiums are getting higher and higher and higher . "
And I talked to small - business people , and they said , " I ca n't afford the policies anymore . "
And we said , " You know , we 've got to find a way to get everybody insured .
And the last thing we want is to have the government take over health care , because anything they take over gets worse , not better .
" We 're going to turn to Washington , because Washington makes a mess .
Washington is all talk .
And we said , " We need to find a way to get everybody in our state insured with private insurance . "
The half a million who did n't have insurance , all the people worried that if they lost their job , they 'd lose insurance , we said , " We 've got to find a way to get them insured without raising taxes , without a government takeover . "
And that 's what we did .
It relies on personal responsibility .
This is a big issue for this country .
Every Democrat up there is talking about a form of socialized medicine , government takeover , massive tax increase .
We have to stand up and not just talk about it .
I 'm the guy who actually tackled this issue .
We get all of our citizens insured .
We get people that were uninsured with private health insurance .
We have to stand up and say , " The market works .
Personal responsibility works . "
We 're going to have insurance for all of our citizens they can afford , that 's theirs , that 's portable .
They never have to worry about losing it .
That 's the answer .
Thank you .
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor .
( APPLAUSE )
Jennifer , go ahead .
VAUGHN : Thank you , Wolf .
Next question comes from you , sir .
Your name is Max Latona .
QUESTION : Yes , it is .
VAUGHN : You live in Manchester , New Hampshire .
What do you do for a living , sir ?
QUESTION : I teach philosophy here at Saint Anselm College .
VAUGHN : And what 's your question tonight ?
QUESTION : My question is a simple one :
In your opinion , what is the most pressing moral issue facing this country today ?
And , if you 're elected president , how would you address that issue ?
VAUGHN : Governor Huckabee , you are an ordained minister .
What is the most pressing moral issue in this country ?
HUCKABEE : Well , it looks like I 'm getting all the moral questions tonight , and I guess that 's a good thing .
( LAUGHTER )
That 's better than getting the immoral questions .
So I 'm happy to get those .
( LAUGHTER )
HUCKABEE : I really believe that , if you define it a moral issue , it is our respect , our sanctity and our understanding of the value of every single human life .
Because that is what makes America a unique place on this planet :
We value every life of an individual as if it represents the life of us all .
Many of us who are pro-life , quite frankly , I think , have made the mistake of giving people the impression that pro-life means we care intensely about people as long as that child is in the womb .
But beyond the gestation period , we 've not demonstrated as demonstrably as we should that we respect life at all levels , not just during pregnancy .
We should n't allow a child to live under a bridge or in the backseat of a car .
We should n't be satisfied that elderly people are being abused and neglected in nursing homes .
It should never be acceptable to us that people are treated as expendable -- any people .
But the unique part of our country is that we elevate and we celebrate human life .
And if you look at us with a contrast to the Islamic jihadists , who would strap a bomb to the belly of their own child , march him into a crowded room , set the detonator and kill innocent people , they celebrate death ; we celebrate life .
It 's the fundamental thing that makes us unique , and it keeps us free .
I pray we never , ever abandon that basic principle .
BLITZER : Thank you , Governor .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Mayor Giuliani , what is the most pressing moral issue in America today ?
GIULIANI : I think the governor is correct .
I would put it in maybe a slightly different way .
We have great gifts in this country that come to us from God .
We have a country in which we have freedom of religion , freedom of press , freedom for the individual , the right to elect our own officials .
And the reality is that in some of the world , much of the world , that does n't exist .
And I think the challenge for our generation is going to be , are we able to share those gifts in an appropriate way with the rest of the world ?
If we can bring along the Middle East , if we can bring along those countries that are presently our enemies , and get them to see the values of these ideals , if we have the moral strength to be able to explain it to them in the way Ronald Reagan was able to do with communism , then we can end up having the peace that we want .
And we should not -- we should never become pessimistic about this .
Remember , this is the country that was at war with Vietnam just a short while ago .
We 're friends now .
BLITZER : All right .
GIULIANI : This was a country that was at war with Japan , Italy and Germany a generation ago .
They 're some of our best friends today .
We have great resources in this country .
And watching the strength of America when we believe in the essential ideals that we have -- they 're not just American ideals ; they come from God .
And I think it 's our moral obligation to find the right way to share that with the rest of the world .
BLITZER : Thank you , Mayor .
( APPLAUSE )
Congressman Paul , what is the most pressing moral issue in the United States right now ?
PAUL : I think it is the acceptance just recently that we now promote preemptive war .
I do not believe that 's part of the American tradition .
We , in the past , have always declared war in defense of our liberties or go to aid somebody .
But now we have accepted the principle of preemptive war .
We have rejected the just war theory of Christianity .
And now , tonight , we hear that we 're not even willing to remove from the table a preemptive nuclear strike against a country that has done no harm to us directly and is no threat to our national security .
I mean , we have to come to our senses about this issue of war and preemption and go back to traditions and our Constitution and defend our liberties and defend our rights , but not to think that we can change the world by force of arms and to start wars .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Thank you , Congressman .
Senator Brownback really wants to weigh in , as well .
BROWNBACK : Thank you .
And thank you for the question from a philosopher .
I think it 's the life issue clearly , and I 'm pro-life and I 'm whole life .
And one of the things I 'm the most -- the proudest about our party about is that we 've stood for life .
We 've been a party that has stood for a culture of life .
And it was in our platform in 1980 , and it continues today .
And with that respect -- and I have respect for my other colleagues -- that 's why I do n't think we can nominate somebody that 's not pro-life in this party , because it is at our core .
We believe that every life is beautiful , is sacred , is a child of a loving God from natural -- from conception to natural death .
And that applies not only here and in the womb , it applies to somebody that 's in poverty , it applies to the child in Darfur .
And that philosophy , being pro-life and whole life , is something I think can really help move us forward as a country and as a party .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Senator , if Rudy Giuliani got the Republican presidential nomination , would you be able to support him ?
BROWNBACK : That question came up at the first debate , and I stated that this is something that we as a party have struggled with .
I have great respect for the mayor .
I do n't think we 're going to nominate somebody that 's not pro-life .
BLITZER : Would you be able to support him ?
BROWNBACK : I can support and will support the nominee of our party .
But our party has stood on principles .
It 's a party of principles .
It 's not a party of personalities .
We lose when we walk away from our principles .
That 's when we have trouble .
And that 's the country wants us to do ...
BLITZER : Thank you , Senator .
BROWNBACK : ... is to stand for principles .
( APPLAUSE )
BLITZER : Jennifer , go ahead .
VAUGHN : Next question tonight from Neil Capano .
Neil , you are an airline agent .
QUESTION : Yes , I am .
VAUGHN : You live in Manchester , New Hampshire .
You have a question tonight for Governor Romney .
QUESTION : Yes , I do .
First of all , I would like to thank all of you for joining us tonight in beautiful Manchester , New Hampshire .
However , my question is for Governor Romney exclusively .
You 've been accused of -- you 've been accused of flip - flopping on immigration .
Just earlier tonight you indicated

, privacy , media and politics — sometimes , all at the same time .
But with TV on the web , and web users on TV , the boundaries melted into a swirl of media — ours , mine , and theirs .
Accidental stars discovered they were soaking in it , at the center of a spinning globe that likes to watch .
And everyone else had a lot of fun .
A 23 - year - old masturbates with the public library 's computer — but when he gets outside , there 's someone waiting for him .
It 's Cleveland investigative reporter Carl Monday !
" For some , pursuing the porn sites is a favorite past time at local libraries , " Monday warned somberly in a news segment broadcast in May .
( Monday even follows the " unemployed porn site user " to his parents ' home , where he asks for their opinion on their son's public masturbation . )
Video of Monday 's disturbing ambush interview brought him interent fame , with one entrepreneur selling t- shirts with Monday 's dour face ( along with the words " Carl Monday is watching you masturbate . " )
Ultimately evengot involved , leading to a surreal encounter in which Carl Monday interviewed Jason Jones interviewing Carl Monday .
( Jones turns the tables by asking Monday the same question Monday asked the hapless library masturbator . )
And what happened to the library masturbator ?
He was sentenced to one year 's probation and a promise to avoid all public libraries — and Carl Monday was there in the parking lot to ask for a comment .
Not surprisingly , the comment turned out to be : " Get the hell away from me . " " We track library books better than we track pedophiles , " Congressman Mark Foley told , adding " If I were one of these sick - os I 'd be nervous withon my trail . " " Maybe this was an overt cry for help , " John Walsh later told Larry King Shortly after running his last campaign ad ( which touted " a record we can be proud of ... " ) it was discovered that the Republican Congressman had been sending cybersex messages to underaged male Congressional pages .
When the first hints of scandal surfaced , Foley tried brazening it out .
( " Congressman Mark Foley 's office says the e-mails were entirely appropriate , " reported an ABC News blog , " and that their release is part of a smear campaign by his opponent . " )
But the flood of evidence was overwhelming , eventually revealing that Foley once even held up a vote on Emergency War Time supplemental appropriations for cybersex with a high school student .
( A commenter on the gay South Florida blog
asked : " Where 's Ken Starr , now that he 's really needed ? " )
Foley resigned — although his name remained on the ballot for the November elections .
( He came within 1 % of beating his opponent , though all votes for Foley were transferred to a replacement candidate . )
While bloggers wondered whether Foley would ultimately be prosecuted under sex predator laws that he helped pass , the U.S. Attorney 's office now appears unlikely to press charges .
But the episode still left politicians stunned by the changing rules for privacy in an information - hungry world .
Zinedine Zidane had already announced his retirement from the French soccer team after completing a five - year , $ 66 million contract .
His last game would be the infamous match against Italy in the final round of the 2006 World Cup tournament .
With the score tied after two hours of hard soccer , and the teams headed for a shootout of penalty kicks , Zidane got into an argument with Italian defender Marco Materazzi .
From various news accounts their conversation went something like this .
There followed a fierce headbutt from Zidane — whose position , ironically , was " attacking midfielder " .
He was thrown from the game ( which Italy ultimately won 5 - 3 ) , achieving a second notoriety for his final - game foul .
According to Wikipedia , French President Jacques Chirac congratulated Zidane for being a national hero and a " man of heart and conviction " .
And inevitably , footage of Zidane 's attack found it's way to the internet , where the career culminating moment was re-mixed again and again and again .
Virtually every news story of 2006 drew sardonic commentary from both Jon Stewart and his former correspondent Stephen Colbert .
But in April they made a rare joint appearance to present the Emmy award for best reality TV .
" It 's a pleasure to be here tonight , " Stewart says innocuously .
" Good evening , godless sodomites , " Colbert offers as a counterpoint .
The event gave a rare glimpse into a comedic yin and yang which challenges the way media outlets cover politics .
While both men target the echo chamber of news shows , Stewart simply shares how bewildered he is by foolish politicians and the correspondents who cover them — while Colbert creates a walking caricature of the rabid ideologues he 's targeting .
( On the Emmys Colbert said he was reading from the teleprompter in his heart . )
In a final irony , both men have been given cable TV shows to attack other cable TV shows .
But while their popularity continues to grow , this clip shows that there may be a limit .
Colbert and Stewart 's final jokes note thatlost earlier in the evening after being nominated as " best performance in a variety or music show " .
The ultimate winner ?

Keith Olbermann was entering his fourth year as an MSNBC prime - time commentator — but in August he discovered large audiences would tune in for his " Special Commentary " segments .
Since the first one aired in August , his ratings have nearly doubled , and Olbermann is now reportedly asking MSNBC for a multi-million dollar increase in his contract .
In a memorable segment on September 11 , Olbermann remembered working near Ground Zero and seeing fliers for colleagues who had perished in the towers .
" All the time , I knew that the very air I breathed contained the remains of thousands of people , including four of my friends ... " he said sternly .
" For me this was , and is , and always shall be , personal .
" And anyone who claims that I and others like me are soft , or have forgotten the lessons of what happened here , is at best a grasping , opportunistic , dilettante , and at worst , an idiot — whether he is a commentator , or a Vice President , or a President .
" Meanwhile Devo shocked the world in March by joining Disney to create a new incarnation of their pioneering geek band using cute pre-teen Disney kids .
( " If you 're not upset ... we have n't done our jobs , " Devo's Gerry Casale told The New York Daily News . )
But while the children sang and eventually toured as " Devo 2.0 , " 58 - year - old Casale was plotting fresh subversions .
Soon a mysterious new band appeared called " Jihad Jerry and the Evildoers " ( including all the current members of Devo ) .
The liner notes explain that a young Jerry turned to music when the Ayatollah declared his secular high school " evil " and he was " unwilling to finish his education without girls . " " You have the right to remain naked ... " he sings in " Army Girls Gone Wild , " a subversive political commentary in the guise of a music video .
" What happens in Abu Ghraib stays in Abu Ghraib .
" Casale also surprised the online world in 2006 by paying a visit to two video Movie attendance is still lower than it was in 2004 , partly because geeks would rather spend time playing massively multi-player games .
One glorious moment combined everything into a shiny package — work , games , and music videos .
Musician Jonathan Coulton had been writing a new song every week , and hit the jackpot with his ballad about an under - appreciated computer programmer who is also a monkey .
When the song was released for a re-mix contest Adobe employee Mike " Spiff " Booth then envisioned its evolution into a music video created with in - game footage from World of Warcraft .
With poignant echoes of a real - world workplace , the gorilla stoicly endures his deskbound manager - goblin Rob , and pines for the company receptionist , a green - haired night - elf who is watching her weight .
Besides being one of the best music videos of the year , it 's playful proof that the online world is still curiously exploring new possibilities for collaborative creativity .
And best of all : " No monkeys were harmed in the making of this film .
" When you 're being filmed in the Web 2.0 era , the worst thing you can do is over - react .
Jason
Holt , the student body vice president at the University of South Carolina , was the target of a standard - issue college prank .
In April he returned from an appearance before Congress to discover his office filled with colorful balloons .
His dramatic outburst was surreptitiously videotaped , capturing Holt 's furious eyes burning with undergraduate intensity as he yells " It 's not a joke !
Look at me being serious ...! "
Within two weeks the video had found an audience online at its new home — Look At Me Being Serious.com .
And Holt had become a perfect example of how privacy is changing in a technology - enabled world .
The video was eventually broadcast on VH - 1 , and in a July letter Holt called the aftermath " bitterly painful " .
Saying he 'd received over 100 " negative and demeaning " emails he wrote that he 'd learned " humility " and the abiliity to " admit a mistake . " " [
M ]y actions in the video were rude , arrogant , and inconsiderate , " he continued , wondering if his tantrum would cost him a career in public service , and asking for the student body 's prayers " as I continue to deal with the consequences .
" At the Oscars in March , the most - nominated film was — but overall movie receipts had fallen by six percent , with finicky consumers enjoying new entertainment choices which also included new gaming consoles and personal video recorders .
This means Americans probably were more likely to discover a sympathetic same - sex relationship when they played back the May episode ofwhere Greg and Peter Brady played a gay couple .
Two actors from the 1970s family sitcomwere transported back to the decade one more time as the new neighbors for hard - nosed Red Forman .
This snapshot of the way we were in 2006 was followed two weeks later with another TV - sized message of acceptance .

A television legend flashed his last smile — but not before getting the last laugh .
In 2002 the producers ofousted Louis Rukeyser for someone younger .
But the wily 69 - year - old used his last show to encourage viewers to follow him to a new network .
" I 'll let the market decide , " the Wall Street commentator joked , knowing his audience would stay loyal after 32 years .
His new show premiered with CNBC 's highest ratings ever , while the old PBS show lost 84 % of its audience , and was eventually canceled altogether .
Louis Rukeyser died on May 2 of a rare form of blood cancer at the age of 73 .
But if he could see how the web continues forcing old media to evolve , I 'm sure he'd be smiling .
Just like the rest of us .
Army Recruiters Accused of Misleading Students to Get Them to Enlist
Nov. 3 , 2006  --
An ABC News undercover investigation showed Army recruiters telling students that the war in Iraq was over , in an effort to get them to enlist .
ABC News and New York affiliate WABC equipped students with hidden video cameras before they visited 10 Army recruitment offices in New York , New Jersey and Connecticut .
" Nobody is going over to Iraq anymore ? " one student asks a recruiter .
" No , we 're bringing people back , " he replies .
" We 're not at war .
War ended a long time ago , " another recruiter says .
Last year , the Army suspended recruiting nationwide to retrain recruiters following hundreds of allegations of improprieties .
One Colorado student taped a recruiting session posing as a drug- addicted dropout .
" You mean I 'm not going to get in trouble ? " the student asked .
The recruiters told him no , and helped him cheat to sign up .
During the ABC News sessions , some recruiters told our students if they enlisted , there would be little chance they'd to go Iraq .
But Col. Robert Manning , who is in charge of U.S. Army recruiting for the entire Northeast , said that new recruits were likely to go to Iraq .
" I would not disagree with that , " Manning said .
" We are a nation and Army at war still . "
Manning looked at the ABC News video of his recruiters .
" It 's hard to believe some of things they are telling prospective applicants , " Manning said .
" I still believe that this is the exception more than the norm . …
I 've visited many stations myself , and I know that we have many wonderful Americans serving in uniform as recruiters . "
Yet ABC News found one recruiter who even claimed if you did n't like the Army , you could just quit .
" It 's called a ' Failure to Adapt ' discharge , " the recruiter said .
" It 's an entry - level discharge so it wo n't affect anything on your record .
It 'll just be like it never happened . "
Manning , however , disagrees with the ease the recruiter describes .
" I would believe it 's not as easy as he would lead you to believe it is , " he said .
Sue Niederer , whose son , Seth , joined the Army in 2002 , said she was all too familiar with recruiters ' lies .
" They need to do anything they possibly can to get recruits , " Niederer said .
Seth was sent to Iraq and was killed by a roadside bomb .
Niederer said she was not surprised by what ABC News had found .
She believes it 's still a widespread problem .
She said that recruiters told Seth he would n't be put into combat .
" Ninety percent [ are ] going to be putting their lives on the line for our country , " she said .
" Tell them the truth .
That 's all .
Just tell them the truth . "
MacNN reports that the 3GHz Xeon ( Clovertown ) processor that was introduced in the 8 - core Mac Pro is a currently unannounced model .
According to comments by Intel 's Bill Kircos : " We are indeed shipping a 3.0GHz Xeon version [ and ] expect to see faster gigahertz speeds for our high - end [ Core 2 ] Extreme PCs very soon , too .
For now , the product is in limited production and Apple has chosen to adopt it .
We will introduce another 3.0GHz Xeon SKU later on as well . "
Indeed , it appears Apple had waited for the 3GHz Quad - Core Xeon to become available before launching the 8 - Core Mac Pro .
While rumors of an 8 - core Mac Pro began back in October , the available chips at that time maxed out at 2.66 Ghz .
Only in March was it revealed by Intel that a 3GHz version would be coming " later this year " .
It appears Apple is the first to use the as - yet unannounced 3GHz Xeon ( Clovertown ) chips .
10 steps to a happier mealtime with kids
If you enjoy this post , make sure you subscribe to Be A Good Dad to receive new posts in your email or feed reader
Mealtimes with kids can be rough if you forget how to keep things under control .
Most of the best tricks involve getting everybody focused on eating and talking calmly .
Here are ten keys that we focus on when the kids start to get a little out of control at mealtime .
No toys or TV during the meal .
Kids simply will not eat while playing with a toy or watching TV .
They get way too stimulated to try and focus on green beans .
Turning off the TV can cause its own chaos , so I recommend doing that 15 - 30 minutes before the meal .
Let your kid place the toy he can not part with on the counter so he knows exactly where to find it when he is done eating .
All for one and one for all .
We all sat down at the table , we are all going to get up at the same time .
No matter how quickly somebody “ fills up , ” they can sit at the table and talk or just listen .
We started this when they were still in their booster seats .
We had a couple weeks where they thought this was a dumb idea .
Now that they are older , we very rarely struggle to keep them at the table and eating .
Do n’t cook to order .
Beagoodmom , and sometimes even Beagooddad , spent time cooking this meal .
We are not going to throw away the pork chops and vegies just so you can eat grilled cheese and apple sauce .
If they choose not to eat this meal , I bet they will be a little more interested in the next .
One thing you have to be careful with is you can not give them a huge snack because they skipped their lunch .
Give them a normal snack and let the catch back up at dinner time .
Let them set the table .
Setting the table provides a transition from whatever activity they were working on and sitting down to eat .
Kids also like to do grown up chores and setting the table is a pretty easy skill to learn .
Start with plastic cups , plates , silverware to avoid injuries and broken dishes .
If you have more than one kid , have one get all of the plates and the other get all of the cups , etc .
Then they have to hand them out to their siblings which is good for learning to share and to play with others .
Use utensils and cups as early as possible .
We picked the Avent Trainer cups when they were young .
The handles helped our kids learn to feed themselves at a young age .
We let them use infant silverware as soon as they could hold them and they are now fork and spoon near experts .
The less time you spend shoveling food into their mouth , the more time you can spend enjoying your meal and interacting with the family .
What ’s good for the dad is good for the kids .
Eat the same thing the kids eat .
If you expect them to eat carrots , put some carrots on your plate … and eat them .
If you do n’t want them to eat Cheetos at dinner , do n’t put Cheetos on your plate .
Make sure you use this in a good way .
Do not encourage your kids to only eat junk food and never eat vegies .
Be the bigger man .
Tell them what is going on .
When you have finished putting all of their food on their plate , point to each item and say what it is .
They will start learning the names of the foods quicker and they might actually try some of it .
It seems like pointing and naming the food makes it slightly more appealing .
Our kids still do not like broccoli but at least they look at it on their plate now .
Start with sample sizes .
Kids get overwhelmed when the plate is overloaded and all of the food is touching each other .
Start with small servings of each item .
An added bonus is that you can encourage them to at least take one bite of each thing before giving them more of their favorite thing .
If they have just gobbled down a pound of mac and cheese , they probably are not going to care that you want them to try their peas .
If they start with just a couple tablespoons , then they have some incentive to try those strange green things .
Make them ask for more .
When they finish eating all of the bread , do not put another piece of bread on their plate .
Make them ask for more .
If they can not talk yet , you can settle for pointing , banging their tray , or crying but they should give some sign that they want more .
You can also try learning a couple signs like “ more ” and “ milk . ”
When they can talk , make them ask for more hot dogs .
It is good for building communication skills and social skills like waiting for somebody to have a chance to help them .
Everybody cleans up .
When our kids where just walking , one of their favorite “ chores ” was carrying their cup to the sink , getting lifted by mom or dad , and tossing their cup in the sink .
When we say that the meal is over , our kids grab their dishes and start marching to the sink .
It is such a routine now , that sometimes we forget that they are supposed to do it , and they ’ll remind us .

British low - cost airline easyjet said its proposed ecoJet short - haul airliner - which would use existing technology - would produce 50 percent less carbon dioxide and 75 percent less nitrous oxide than today 's jets .
British low - cost airline easyJet has unveiled a design for a radically different - looking short - haul airliner that it says would be highly environmentally friendly and could be built by 2015 .
EasyJet said its design — which it dubbed the “ easyJet ecoJet ” — would be 25 percent quieter and would emit 50 percent less carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and 75 percent less nitrous oxide ( NOx ) than today ’s newest short - haul airliners .
“ The aircraft example we have unveiled today represents the next major step forward in airframe and engine technology , ” said Andy Harrison , easyJet ’s chief executive .
“ The lightweight structure and open - rotor engines are based on technologies that are being developed right now by the major manufacturers .
The easyJet ecoJet is realistic and it is achievable , ” he added .
“ If the easyJet ecoJet were to be made available today , we would order hundreds [ of ] them for fleet replacement and to achieve the ‘ green growth ’ that our industry has committed to , ” said Harrison .
Why it matters
A 2004 study by NASA documented a 1 percent per decade increase in cirrus cloud cover over the United States , presumably due to increased air travel .
Jets leave condensation trails , or contrails , that sometimes spread out and are indistinguishable from clouds .
The researchers claimed that this extra cloudiness could account for a warming trend of half a degree Fahrenheit per decade in the years between 1975 and 1994 .
EasyJet said its projection that the ecoJet would generate a 50 percent reduction in CO2 emissions was based on the latest research by leading aerospace manufacturers .
The ecoJet ’s engines would produce 25 percent of the improvement and its lightweight airframe 15 percent , while improvements to air traffic control technology and design would provide the remaining 10 percent .
The airline said that given its current passenger - cabin configuration and network , the eco-liner would generate less than 47 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometer in easyJet service .
EasyJet ’s current operations generate 97.5 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometer and the Toyota Prius emits 104 grams , according to the airline .
It noted the European car industry had recently been given a target to achieve 130 grams of CO2 per kilometer .
Today ’s most - produced short - haul airliners are the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 families .
These aircraft are being ordered in such numbers that some customers are n’t due to receive their new jets for another seven years .
The A319 , a member of the Airbus A320 family , is numerically the most important aircraft type in easyJet ’s fleet .
It recently took delivery of its 100th A319 .
Why it 's different
The key features that easyJet said would make the ecoJet radically more environmentally efficient than today ’s airliners are :
Rear - mounted “ open- rotor ” engines ( also known as unducted fans ) , which would offer better environmental performance for short - haul flying due to their higher propulsive efficiency .
EasyJet believes significant difficulties in fixing such large engines under the wings of a narrow - body aircraft would make rear - mounting the best solution .
An aircraft design that would feature a lower cruise speed to reduce drag and a shorter range to reduce weight A gear box between the engine and the open - rotor blades would keep subsonic the speed at which the blade tips would rotate during take - off and landing , reducing engine noise .
Mounting the engines above the ecoJet ’s tailplanes and tailfins would shield the ground from engine noise .
Noise reductions would also come from airframe improvements , which would include omission of slats on the leading edge of the wing .
The airframe would be made of advanced weight - reducing materials similar to those used in current airliner programs such as the Boeing 787 .
Boeing estimates the 787 is 27 percent more fuel efficient than the aircraft it will replace in many fleets .
As global demand for air travel matures over time , several step - changes in technology will be needed to reduce the emissions from aviation in 2050 to below 2005 levels , said easyJet .
The ecoJet could provide the first of these step changes and itself could stabilize emissions from short - haul airline flying at 2005 levels until 2035 .
“ The aviation industry has an excellent record in reducing the environmental footprint of aircraft .
Today ’s aircraft are typically 70 percent cleaner and 75 percent quieter than their 1960s counterparts , ” said Harrison .
“ Now we are planning the next generation that will help towards taking the plane out of the emissions equation . ”
EasyJet ’s A319 - dominated fleet of 131 aircraft has an average age of 2.3 years .
This is the youngest of any major airline in Europe , it says .
“ We have recently called for over 700 of the dirtiest aircraft to be banned from Europe ’s skies and are active supporters of the EU ’s Emissions Trading Scheme and Single European Skies programme , ” said Harrison .
No , seriously .
When I have the time , I ’m “ upgrading ” from Windows Vista to Windows XP .
My keyboard is completely ambiguous .
I stand by my original assertion that the shipping version of this OS is late beta , at best .
I realize that other enthusiasts are leaving Windows altogether ( and leaping instead to Apple ’s OS X ) , but there ’s not yet enough momentum behind my willingness to do that .
I ’ll leave the installs of Vista 32 and 64 on this PC , but I ’ll spend most ( if not all ) of my time back in tried - and - true Windows XP .
I ’ll give Vista a second chance when the first service pack is released later this year , but until then …
My scanner does n’t really work ( Hewlett - Packard Laserjet 3052 ) .
HP has n’t caught up with support yet , and software updates wo n’t be available until SP1 time - frame .
The software works like a charm in XP – amazingly well , as a matter of fact .
Windows Movie Maker crashes on a regular basis .
My IPFax software does n’t work ( the driver will likely never be updated to be Vista - compliant ) .
Never , EVER caused me a problem in XP .
I need this software to work , and dual - booting to use this is not an option .
I still ca n’t get my Lifecam to work , but wound up purchasing the vastly superior Logitech QuickCam Ultra Vision instead ( which puts Microsoft ’s new webcam software AND hardware series to shame ) .
On the same machine ( AMD Quad FX ) , XP trumps Vista in terms of performance .
I do n’t have specific benchmarks on hand , but I can tell you the difference is quite palpable .
This is even with most of Vista ’s eye candy tuned to a dull roar .
We ’ll see if it runs just as quickly when everything ’s reinstalled there .
I only discovered this after rebooting to try my scanner in XP – blazing differences , similar tasks .
NVIDIA chipsets and video cards .
Need I say more ?
I simply ca n’t get to my OS X machine from Vista ( or mount a WebDAV server ) .
Copernic Desktop Search , a far superior desktop search client to Microsoft ’s , either does n’t like Vista or Outlook 2007 – not sure which , yet .
Either way , I ca n’t run it right now – and the Windows Desktop Search tool is still as lame as ever ( sorry , Brandon ) .
I ’ll miss the new Start Menu , but I think there ’s similar third - party software that ’ll keep me happy in the meanwhile .
Explorer keeps losing my view settings .
THIS IS DRIVING ME UP THE FARKING WALL !
Now , I realize that XP suffers from this problem as well , but it ’s never been this bad .
There are so many new options that it ’s difficult to reset each window ’s view every time – including column headers , which are now permanently stuck on “ Tags ” and “ Date Taken ” ( even though I may not be in a folder with objects supportive of these fields ) .
Yes , I realize this problem stretches back centuries – but it seems to have gotten worse , not better .
My workaday software still seems to suffer from weird quirks now and again .
I really do n’t have the time or patience to wait for each developer to catch up just so I can go on living my life .
All these little annoyances are starting to add up to one major headache .
Instead of detailing each one separately ( and extending this list exponentially ) , I ’m just wrapping all of ’em together into one point .
If you think I ’ve missed something somewhere , think again .
Sorry , I… I gave Vista a real chance .
I just ca n’t use it as my primary OS anymore .
It ’s NOT horrible at its core ( by any stretch of the imagination ) .
If all of your hardware and software are fully baked , you ’re good to go – but that ’s not the world I live in .
I will continue to recommend Windows Vista for some users , mind you .
I wish I could take the best parts of Vista and bring them back with me to XP .
I ’m still more than willing to help Microsoft improve Windows and get the message out to users , but I simply ca n’t sacrifice my own time and productivity without benefits in clear sight .
I ’m begging Microsoft and all of my hardware and software vendors to make Windows better for me .
Until then …
The Whoa starts now ( and is continued here ) .
Use of HCFC - 22 has soared in the third world with the economic growth of China , India and other countries , along with the sharp drop in air - conditioner costs that has accompanied China ’s growing skill in making them cheaply .
Mr. Seebaluck said Mauritius ’s use of HCFC - 22 had risen more than 100 - fold in the last six years because of a boom in hotel construction and the rapid expansion of the fishing industry , which uses a lot of refrigeration to preserve freshness .
The use in India and China , far larger markets , has been rising as much as 35 percent a year lately , with specialists predicting that similar growth could last through 2016 .
Industrial nations are required to phase out HCFC - 22 by 2020 , but most are moving faster .
The European Union phased it out in 2004 .
The United States will ban domestic production in 2010 and is considering whether to ban imports then , as well .
China has begun making air - conditioners with more modern refrigerants for the European market .
But by continuing to produce HCFC - 22 for markets elsewhere , the Chinese have been able to claim hundreds of millions of dollars a year in payments from an obscure United Nations agency .
The payments are to compensate Chinese chemical factories for incinerating a waste gas generated as part of the manufacturing process for HCFC - 22 .
If the Chinese industry switches to modern refrigerants , it would no longer produce the waste gas and so would lose the credits .
India has a large and growing HCFC - 22 industry that is also reaping a fortune in credits .
But the Indian government has largely stayed on the sidelines in international talks , while China has called for industrial nations to pay even more for the incineration of waste gases from HCFC - 22 production ; China proposes to spend much of that to develop its renewable - energy industry .
A big problem is that no one has agreed what should replace HCFC - 22 .
The chemicals requiring the fewest changes to air - conditioner designs avoid harm to the ozone layer but are still as potent , gram for gram , in terms of global warming .

The stock market is about to crash .
The only question is whether it will quickly drop down the elevator shaft or follow the jerky flight - path of a man pushed down a stairwell .
Either way , the outcome will be the same ; stocks will nose - dive , the dollar will plummet , and the bruised US economy will be splattered on the canvas like George Foreman in Rumble in the Jungle .
Troubles in the sub - prime market have just begun to materialize and already 38 main sub prime lenders have gone kaput .
Foreclosures have reached a 37 year high , and an estimated 2 million homeowners will be put out on the street in the next few years .
And that ’s just for starters .
The contagion has spread beyond the sub prime sector to other ARMs ( Adjustable Rate Mortgages ) where late payments and defaults are cropping up faster than their sub - prime counterparts .
According to Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius , “ Prime ARM delinquencies are above their worst levels of the 2001 recession … .
By contrast , sub - prime fixed - rate delinquencies are well below their recession levels . ” ( Barrons )
Sub prime loans and other “ Prime ARMs ” ( alta - A loans ) make up roughly 35 % of current mortgages .
That means that millions of homeowners are struggling to meet their “ upwardly - adjusted ” payments .
If Congress does not come up with a bailout strategy , then we will face a “ downturn worse than that resulting from the NASDAQ collapse ” .
( Barrons )
Sub prime loans are loans that are made to people with poor credit .
The lender requires a higher rate of interest to cover his risk .
For the last 5 years , the sub prime market has skyrocketed due to the loosening of lending practices .
The traditional criterion for determining whether a loan applicant is credit - worthy has been abandoned .
Now , it is not uncommon to have mortgage lenders provide 100 % financing to shaky borrowers who are unable to provide documentation of their real earnings ( “ no doc ” loans ) and cannot even scrimp together 4 or $ 5 thousand for a down payment . ( “ piggyback ” loans )
Why on earth would the banks and mortgage lenders take such a risk ?
In a word ; greed .
The mortgage industry is driven by fees .
Lenders ( and agents ) are able to fatten their bottom line through loan origination fees and then they tack on additional fees for shipping the loans off to Wall Street where they are bundled into Mortgage Backed Security ( MBS ) .
Collateralized debt has become a Wall Street favorite and these otherwise shaky loans have become staples in the hedge funds industry .
In fact , last year Wall Street purchased nearly 60 % of all mortgages -- ignoring the risks associated with sub prime “ debt instruments ” .
Also , through the magic of derivatives , many of these Mortgage Backed Securities have been leveraged to the extreme ; sometimes at a ratio of 35 to 1 .
In other words , a home loan of $ 300,000 - - that may have been secured by a young man with bad credit who makes $ 12.50 per hour picking up mill - ends and bits of insulation on a construction job site -- has been leveraged into a $ 10,500,000 securities investment .
This may explain why Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson is trying to sooth jittery investors with words of encouragement while he dispatches the Plunge Protection Team ( PPT ) to shore up the trembling stock market behind the scenes .
Every effort is being made to keep this monstrous equity bubble from pirouetting to earth .
Currently , derivatives and mortgage - backed bonds total more than all US Treasuries , Notes and US Bonds combined !?!
The stock market is one gigantic pyramid of debt and it ’s ready to blow .
Kitco.com ’s Doug Casey puts it like this :
“ The rocket - shot rise of hedge funds and the advances in financial modeling techniques have spawned something of a competition among the so - called best and brightest to find ever - more - complex ways of skimming pennies from very large piles of money .
The collective result is that our financial system has been wired up to $ 370 trillion dollars of privately negotiated investment contracts .
They ’re usually written to shift risk from one bank , pension fund , insurance company or brokerage firm to another .
And many are linked together in long chains , with each contract providing collateral for the next .
It ’s all very clever , but layering the enormous size– $ 370 trillion dollars , far more than the net worth of all the financial institutions in the world – on top of all that complexity is downright scary .
In simpler times , a home loan going bad would affect only the particular lender .
Enough defaults would put the lender out of business .
And that would be the end of it .
But today a wave of defaults can send a shock through the portfolios of financial institutions around the globe , including hedge funds , banks and pension funds far removed from the troubled borrowers .
Imagine an electrical circuit with thousands of connections .
No one designed it .
No one tested it .
No one has a diagram for it .
It just grew .
Now , because of its size and power and pervasiveness , everything depends upon it .
So what happens when one of those thousands of connections burns out ?
No one really knows . ” ( Kitco.com commentaries )
That ’s right ; no one really knows what will happen , but there is growing concern about what MIGHT happen .
And , what might happen is disaster !
( Derivatives numbers are staggering .
The Bank for International Settlements estimates that the notional amount of derivatives traded on regulated exchanges topped a quadrillion dollars last year )
Ann Berg “ War Drags the Dollar Down ” antiwar.com
Casey gives an apt summary of our present predicament .
There is currently $ 370 trillion in derivatives , hedge funds and over - leveraged marginal investments .
There is no coherent relationship between this mass of cyber - wealth and actual deposits or investments .
It is merely a fractional banking scam on steroids ; computer - generated capital with no basis in reality .
As the sub prime market comes under greater strain ; hedge funds will teeter , derivatives will tremble , liquidity will dry up and the whole debt - plagued system will crash in a heap .
The frantic efforts of the PPT with their flimsy bits of scaffolding will amount to nothing .
Wall Street is quick - stepping towards the gallows and there ’s little hope of a reprieve .
As we watch the sub - prime market unwind ; we should keep in mind that this massive expansion of credit took place on Alan Greenspan ’s watch and with his implicit approval .
The former Fed - chief was a big fan of sub - prime mortgages and he was n’t hesitant to extol their merits .
In April 2005 , Greenspan said :
“ Innovation has brought about a multitude of new products , such as sub - prime loans and niche credit programs for immigrants …
With these advances in technology , lenders have taken advantage of credit scoring models and other techniques for efficiently extending credit to a broader spectrum of consumers …
Where once more marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit , lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately .
These improvements have led to rapid growth in sub- prime mortgage lending … fostering constructive innovation that is both responsive to market demand and beneficial to consumers . ” ( Thanks Jim Willie Goldenjackass.com )
“ Innovation ” ?
Is that what Maestro Greenspan calls this fiendish , economy - busting Ponzi - swindle ?
Greenspan is like a jungle - monkey swinging from one massive equity bubble to the next .
The housing bubble turned out to be his “ piece de resistance ” , a bottomless black hole sucking up the nations ’ wealth into its dark vortex .
His “ low interest ” doctrine may have kept the moribund economy on life support after the dot.com bust , but it has ruined the country ’s prospects for the future .
We ’ll be digging out of this mess for decades .
Greenspan nodded approvingly as trillions of dollars were funneled into shaky sub primes , but he chose to cheerlead rather than slow - down the process .
He scorned the idea of government regulation preferring his own type of Darwinian “ natural selection ” or , rather , survival of the shrewdest .
Now the pundits and the talking heads are trying to shift the blame to struggling low - income wage - slaves who thought they could live the American dream by buying a home on credit .
They were seduced by the promise of cheap money and then led by the nose to the slaughter .
The whole charade was orchestrated by Greenspan and his buddies in the banking cabal .
They alone are responsible .
Here ’s another tidbit which sheds light on Greenspan ’s culpability in the sub prime fiasco :
" The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency took little action in public to police the $ 2.8 - trillion boom in the U.S. mortgage market -- whose bust now risks worsening the housing recession .
The Fed , which is responsible for the stability of the banking system , did n't publicly rebuke any firm for failing to follow up warnings on home - lending practices between 2004 and 2006 .
The OCC , which supervises 1,793 national banks , took only three public mortgage - related consumer - protection enforcement actions over the same period .
Consumer advocates and former government officials say the regulators , by acting behind the scenes rather than openly advertising the shortcomings of some firms , failed to discipline an industry that loaned too much money to borrowers who could n't repay it .
Now , more lenders are being forced to shut and foreclosures are rising , threatening to scuttle any chance of an early recovery in housing .
( Chuck Butler ; “ The Daily Pfennig ” )
The Federal Reserve knows where every dime winds up in the economy .
They even provide a detailed account of the relevant data .
Ignorance is not an excuse .
The Fed looked on while trillions of dollars flowed to “ unqualified ” applicants who had no chance of repaying their loans .
The lax standards and easy money kept Wall Street and the mortgage industry happy , but the “ predatory lending ” hurt millions of hard working Americans who are now in danger of losing their homes .
The End of the Liquidity Party ?
All of the major investment firms are heavily invested in the $ 6.5 trillion mortgage securities market .
The sudden decline in the sub prime market is shutting down the funding sources for low income people while increasing home inventories .
It is also boosting unemployment , putting pressure on the banks , and thrusting the country towards recession .
As the housing market continues to languish , home equity loans ( which amounted to $ 600 billion in 2006 ) will shrivel reducing consumer spending and GDP accordingly .
That means that the Federal Reserve will be forced to lower interest rates and remove the last crumbling cinder block propping up the greenback .
When Bernanke lowers interest rates , foreign investment in US Treasuries and dollar - based securities will drop off , the dollar will fall and we will undergo a painful cycle of hyperinflation .
These are the inescapable consequences of Greenspan ’s policies .
Equity bubbles are an expression of class interest .
They are a way of shifting wealth from working class people -- whose hourly wages or fixed - incomes can’t keep pace with a hyperinflationary monetary policy — to the wealthy and powerful , who benefit from overheated markets and rampant speculation .
The investor class and their plutocratic peers are the only ones who profit from interest rate manipulation and increases in the money supply .
For everyone else , inflation is just a hidden tax .
Greenspan used the money supply and interest rates as weapon against working class people .
It became his preferred method of “ social engineering ” ; creating greater division between rich and poor while ensuring the upward redistribution of wealth consistent with his plans for a new world order .
( NWO )
Greenspan is the plutocrat ’s champion ; America ’s all - time serial bubble maker .
The rest of the world is eying America ’s housing slump with growing apprehension .
The downturn in the sub prime market is just the first crack in the façade .
Other disruptions are bound to follow .
Another jolt from the Yen “ carry trade ” or a sudden blip in the Chinese stock market could send Wall Street sprawling and put the economy on a fiscal - respirator .
A substantial dip in securities could trigger a liquidity crisis which would traumatize our credit - dependent society .
If consumer spending slows down , the economy will grind to a halt and living standards will sharply decline .
The sub primes are just the first domino .
These are some of the things that Fed chief Bernanke will have to consider before resetting interest rates :
Does he keep rates where they are and turn away foreign investment or lower rates and try to salvage the faltering housing market ?
Either choice will result in a certain amount of pain .
A cloud of uncertainty has descended on the over - leveraged United States of Foreclosure .
The storm is just ahead .
The stewards of the system -- Paulson , Bush , Bernanke - - could care less about the public welfare .
All their energy is devoted to building a lifeboat for themselves and their fat - cat buddies .
Once , they ’ve robbed the last farthing from the public till they ’ll be gone , and we ’ll still be marching along the path to national calamity .
High - flying US fund manager Jim Rogers summed up the impending crisis like this :
“ You ca n’t believe how bad it ’s going to get .
It ’s going to be a disaster for many people who do n’t have a clue about what happens when a real estate bubble pops .
Real estate prices will go down 40 - 50 % in bubble areas .
There will be massive defaults .
And it ’ll be worse this time because we have n’t had this kind of speculative buying in U.S. history . ”
Then he added ominously , “ When markets turn from bubble to reality , a lot of people get burned . ”
You can ask five different people what a stateful firewall is , and you ’re likely to get at least four answers .
The truth is there are only a few types of firewalls — the rest are simply variations .
The firewall vendors , however , would have you believe otherwise .
Packet filtering , Circuit - Level Gateways , Stateful Inspection , Application - Level Gateways , Deep Inspection — all these terms are thrown around quite liberally by various companies trying to sell their next offering .
As a result , these terms have lost much of their meaning .
Remember that there are only 7 layers of the OSI model ; it ’s not as if truly new concepts are being invented .
All the buzzwords you hear spewed about are the result of overactive marketing departments — not engineering breakthroughs .
My goal here is to give a picture of firewalling that will allow one to map vendor buzzwords to understanding — to be able to take an arbitrary description of a technology and match it up with what ’s really going on .
It ’s my hope that after reading what lies below you ’ll never be confused about firewalls again .
Basic Packet Filters
As a general rule , the more advanced the firewall technology , the higher up in the OSI Model it works .
The first and most basic type of firewall to come about is simply referred to now as a packet filter .
These firewalls worked at the 3rd level of the OSI model , aka the network layer .
Packet filters worked primarily off of two paramaters within packets — the source and destination IP addresses — but they were able to look at ( and filter on ) the protocol field in the IP header as well .
The key here , however , is that very few checks were done on packets , and they were only done at the network layer .
As a result , it has become somwhat trivial to trick these sorts of filters via various techniques .
Spoofing , fragmenting , and various other sorts of tinkering allow an attacker to get traffic through simple packet filters that they were set up to block .
One advantage of packet filters , however , was ( and is ) their speed .
Because they perform so few checks they are able to do so quite efficiently .
Proxy Firewalls
One of the most interesting and powerful types of firewalls is the proxy firewall .
The main thing to remember when considering proxy firewalls is the fact that they initiate a second connection from themselves .
In other words , when a request is made for a resource that ’s handled by a proxy firewall , the original reqest does not make it back to the host in posession of the resource .
The proxy makes the request to the resource and then returns the information back to the client .
This is a highly secure way of doing things because it allows one to filter out a large amount of potentially malicious content within the original request .
For example , imagine that there is 150,000 areas in a request that can be tampered with by an attacker — some of which could create a security issue on the host being targeted .
Well , if only 10 pieces of information are needed to make a legitimate request , the proxy knows this and can take those 10 things and make its own request .
This way , when the proxy asks for the resource , the host is far less likely to be tricked into doing something it ’s not supposed to do .
Stateful Inspection
Without a doubt , “ stateful ” is the most misunderstood term used when it comes to firewall technology .
People seem to attach some sort of quasi- magical meaning to it ; it ’s like they just want to hear that whatever product they ’re using is “ stateful ” .
Well , what does that mean exactly ?
What is a stateful firewall ?
The term was originally coined by Check Point in reference to their Firewall - 1 product , but the term is now used by virtually very firewall vendor in existence .
A stateful firewall differs from a standard packet filter in a very simple way — a stateful firewall deals with connections and their characteristics rather than packets individually .
In short , stateful firewalls keep track of open , legitimate connections and compare traffic moving through the firewall to these known - good entries .
The firewall knows all about the connections in its “ state table ” ( the list of legitimate connections ) — and anything deemed not part of one on the list is discarded .
This was a major advance over basic packet filtering in terms of security .
It suddenly became much more difficult to inject spoofed packets into legitimate connections and have them accepted by the firewall because stateful inspection looks at TCP sequence numbers , TCP Flags , etc. rather than just source and destination IP and port numbers .
Another thing that stateful inspection brought to the table was the ability to touch the application layer to some degree .
The most commonly known example of this is the abilty to handle an FTP session — a complex task involving two seperate connections .
Without being able to watch actual FTP traffic , the firewall would n’t be able to deal with this level of complexity .
This should not , however , be confused with true layer - 7 visibility .
The original forms of stateful inspection dealt predominently with layers 4 and below .
The most important thing to remember when discussing stateful inspecition , however , is arguably what it is n’t .
Firewall vendors have hyped the term to the point that it carries almost magical overtones .
Do n’t fall for it .
Again , stateful firewalls deal with connections rather than individual packets , and they build state tables that hold the connection information .
Then they simply compare traffic moving through them to the contents of their state tables .
No magic .
Some implementations do it better than others , of course , i.e. a SOHO Linksys box ’s stateful inspection is not equal to Firewall - 1’s stateful inspection , but the concept is basically the same .
Deep Packet Inspection
For the last few years it ’s been stateful inspection that ’s received most of the attention .
As mentioned , every firewall vendor on the planet hurried to throw together an implementation just so they could say they had it .
Well , now there ’s a new player in town — deep inspection .
Just as with stateful inspection , vendors are trying their best to make this technology something it is n’t .
To make a long story short , deep inspection is stateful inspection — but with visibility into the application layer .
In other words , deep inspection allows the firewall to see the actual data passing through it rather than just keeping track of connection information .
As mentioned above , many stateful inspection implementations allow for interaction with the application layer in certain circumstances , but that ’s not the main function of stateful inspection .
So what ’s the practical advantage of deep inspection over stateful inspection ?
Content filtering .
Is the client that just made a connection to our webserver trying to propogate a worm ?
Is a website trying to install malware via an HTTP session ?
These are questions that stateful inspection cannot answer and that deep inspection can .
This is made possible by two technologies familiar to anyone in the IDS world — signatures , and anomaly analysis .
Once the firewall can see into the application layer fully , it can start matching what it sees against a list of known bad content .
This is signature - based analysis , and it ’s the backbone of all antivirus technology .
The advantage here is the ability to catch a whole lot of known nastiness , along with the relative ease of updates .
The disadvantage would be the fact that , like in the AV world , the ability to stop unknown attacks is virtually nil , i.e. a new threat usually requires a new update .
Anomaly analysis , on the other hand , works by establishing what ’s normal and then flagging traffic that strays from those boundaries .
Theoretically this is quite powerful , but in practice it ’s often too hard to determine with any confidence what a “ known good ” baseline is .
Without that , it ’s very difficult to to be able to say “ this is bad because it ’s not normal . ”
As a result , it ’s the signature paradigm that ’s dominated this space .
So that ’s basically what “ deep inspection ” turns out to be — a stateful firewall with content analysis that uses signatures and anomaly analysis .
Sexy ?
Maybe . Magic ?
Not hardly .
Summing It All Up
The bottom line for all this is that there are only a few ways that firewalls work .
Every type of firewall you have ever heard of likely falls into just three or four main categories .
Once you realize this it becomes much harder to get confused by the various buzzwords .
So if I were to tell you that there ’s a new firewall out that does “ über filtering ” , you should be able to ask a few questions .
What layer (s ) of the OSI model do the firewall filter on ?
Is this simply another stateful firewall ?
If it has some application layer functionality , then how is it different from existing application filtering technology ?
After asking questions like these you ’ll often find that the creative engineering being sold is nothing more than creative marketing . :
Even though the White House has announced no timeline for a final decision in the midst of its renewed deliberations about whether to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , some of the Republican presidential candidates are taking the opportunity to remind their base where they stand .
Speaking with reporters in Helena , Mont. , Mitt Romney reiterated his support for the facility .
“ I believe that Guantanamo plays an important role in protecting our nation from violent , heinous terrorists , ” the former Massachusetts governor said .
“ Guantanamo is a symbol of our resolve . ”
He added , “ Evil still exists in the world .
It did not go away when the Soviet Union collapsed . ”
Mr. Romney raised eyebrows when he called for doubling Guantanamo during the last G.O.P. debate .
Representative Duncan Hunter , a G.O.P. candidate and member of the House Armed Services Committee , sought to arouse NIMBY sentiments in his San Diego - area district on Friday , warning that Democratic legislation to close the prison would send terrorists to military bases nearby .
“ We should keep them isolated from the criminal population in this country , ” he said .
Among the Republicans , only Senator John McCain and Representative Ron Paul have said they think Gitmo should be closed , and the Democratic candidates agree on closure .
Meanwhile , a top aide to Mr. Romney is on paid leave while accusations that he impersonated a state trooper and illegally ran a reporter ’s license plate are investigated .
Jay Garrity has denied both charges .
That latter charge , by the way , stemmed from this article by The Times ’s Mark Leibovich .
Meanwhile , an advocacy group for victims of child abuse by Catholic clergy members is urging Rudolph W. Giuliani to fire a suspended priest who was then hired by Mr. Giuliani ’s security consulting business .
Alan Placa was accused of covering up sex crimes .
A spokesman for Giuliani Partners said the former New York mayor believes that his childhood friend has been “ unjustly accused . ”
The Times ’s Michael Cooper looks at Mr. Obama ’s grassroots activists around New York City , and looks into whether the campaign represents a bona fide movement or , as one liberal blogger put it , “ a better - than - ordinary campaign for a candidate that ’s personally compelling , and not much more . ”
Alan Fram of The Associated Press writes that Mr. Obama could have problems if he is unable to broaden his support past elites .
Mr. Obama is expected to raise at least $ 25 million this quarter , which ends this month , as is Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , The Washington Post reports .
John Edwards , a Democrat , and Mr. McCain are likely to have disappointing numbers .
Aaron Gould Sheinin of The State of Columbia , S.C. , looks at varying responses by five different campaigns from both parties to the deaths of nine firefighters in the early primary state .
As Mrs. Clinton returns to Little Rock , Ark. , today , Politico.com reports on her past with the Rose Law Firm .
Gov. Bill Richardson , in Iowa Friday , said he would use support for Roe v.

Theory is indispensable in correctly interpreting history .
History -- the sequence of events unfolding in time -- is " blind . "
It reveals nothing about causes and effects .
We may agree , for instance , that feudal Europe was poor , that monarchical Europe was wealthier , and that democratic Europe is wealthier still , or that nineteenth - century America with its low taxes and few regulations was poor , while contemporary America with its high taxes and many regulations is rich .
Yet was Europe poor because of feudalism , and did it grow richer because of monarchy and democracy ?
Or did Europe grow richer in spite of monarchy and democracy ?
Or are these phenomena unrelated ?
Likewise , we might ask whether contemporary America is wealthier because of higher taxes and more regulations or in spite of them .
That is , would America be even more prosperous if taxes and regulations had remained at their nineteenth - century levels ?
Historians qua historians cannot answer such questions , and no amount of statistical data manipulation can change this fact .
Every sequence of empirical events is compatible with any of a number of rival , mutually incompatible interpretations .
To make a decision regarding such incompatible interpretations , we need a theory .
By theory , I mean a proposition whose validity does not depend on further experience but can be established a priori .
This is not to say that one can do without experience altogether in establishing a theoretical proposition .
However , it is to say that even if experience is necessary , theoretical insights extend and transcend logically beyond a particular historical experience .
Theoretical propositions are about necessary facts and relations and , by implication , about impossibilities .
Experience may thus illustrate a theory .
But historical experience can neither establish a theorem nor refute it .
Economic and political theory , especially of the Austrian variety , is a treasure trove of such propositions .
For instance , a larger quantity of a good is preferred to a smaller amount of the same good ; production must precede consumption ; what is consumed now cannot be consumed again in the future ; prices fixed below market - clearing prices will lead to lasting shortages ; without private property in production factors there can be no factor prices , and without factor prices cost - accounting is impossible ; an increase in the supply of paper money cannot increase total social wealth but can only redistribute existing wealth ; monopoly ( the absence of free entry ) leads to higher prices and lower product quality than competition ; no thing or part of a thing can be owned exclusively by more than one party at a time ; democracy ( majority rule ) and private property are incompatible .
Theory is no substitute for history , of course , yet without a firm grasp of theory , serious errors in the interpretation of historical data are unavoidable .
For instance , the outstanding historian Carroll Quigley claims that the invention of fractional - reserve banking has been a major cause of the unprecedented expansion of wealth associated with the Industrial Revolution , while countless historians have associated the economic plight of Soviet - style socialism with the absence of democracy .
From a theoretical viewpoint , such interpretations must be rejected .
An increase in the paper money supply cannot lead to greater prosperity but only to wealth redistribution .
The explosion of wealth during the Industrial Revolution took place despite fractional - reserve banking .
Similarly , the economic plight of socialism cannot be due to the absence of democracy .
Instead , it is caused by the absence of private property in factors of production .
" Received history " is full of such misinterpretations .
Theory allows us to rule out certain historical reports as impossible and incompatible with the nature of things .
By the same token , it allows us to uphold certain other things as historical possibilities , even if they have not yet been tried .
Employing economic and political theory , my new book is a revisionist reconstruction of modern Western history .
It covers the rise of absolute monarchical states out of stateless feudal orders , and the transformation , beginning with the French Revolution and essentially completed with the end of World War I , of the Western world from monarchical to democratic States , and the rise of the US to the rank of " universal empire . "
Neoconservative writers such as Francis Fukuyama have interpreted this development as civilizational progress , and they proclaim the " End of History " to have arrived with the triumph of Western social democracy and its globalization .
Democracy : The God That Failed is my attempt to show otherwise , and to define and give expression to an alternative libertarian view that takes private property seriously .
Three Great Myths
My theoretical interpretation involves the shattering of three historical myths .
The first and most fundamental is the myth that the emergence of states out of a prior , nonstatist order has caused subsequent economic and civilizational progress .
In fact , theory dictates that any progress must have occurred in spite , not because of , the institution of a state .
A state is defined conventionally as an agency that exercises a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decison making ( jurisdiction ) and of taxation .
By definition then , every state , regardless of its particular constitution , is economically and ethically deficient .
Every monopolist is " bad " from the viewpoint of consumers .
Monopoly is hereby understood as the absence of free entry into a particular line of production : only one agency , A , may produce X .
Any monopoly is " bad " for consumers because , shielded from potential new entrants into its line of production , the price for its product will be higher and the quality lower than with free entry .
And a monopolist with ultimate decison - making powers is particularly bad .
While other monopolists produce inferior goods , a monopolist judge , besides producing inferior goods , will produce bads , because he who is the ultimate judge in every case of conflict also has the last word in each conflict involving himself .
Consequently , instead of preventing and resolving conflict , a monopolist of ultimate decision making will cause and provoke conflict in order to settle it to his own advantage .
Not only would no one accept such a monopoly judge provision , but no one would ever agree to a provision that allowed this judge to determine the price to be paid for his " service " unilaterally .
Predictably , such a monopolist would use up ever more resources ( tax revenue ) to produce fewer goods and perpetrate more bads .
This is not a prescription for protection but for oppression and exploitation .
The result of a state , then , is not peaceful cooperation and social order , but conflict , provocation , aggression , oppression , and impoverishment , i.e. , decivilization .
This , above all , is what the history of states illustrates .
It is first and foremost the history of countless millions of innocent state victims .
The second myth concerns the historic transition from absolute monarchies to democratic states .
Not only do neoconservatives interpret this development as progress ; there is near universal agreement that democracy represents an advance over monarchy and is the cause of economic and moral progress .
This interpretation is curious in light of the fact that democracy , in the twentieth century , has been the fountainhead of every form of socialism : of ( European ) democratic socialism and ( American ) " liberalism " and neoconservatism as well as of international ( Soviet ) socialism , ( Italian ) fascism , and national ( Nazi ) socialism
More importantly , however , theory contradicts this interpretation ; whereas both monarchies and democracies are deficient as states , democracy is worse than monarchy at keeping the size and reach of the state in check .
Theoretically speaking , the transition from monarchy to democracy involves no more or less than a hereditary monopoly " owner " ( the prince or king ) being replaced by temporary and interchangeable monopoly " caretakers " ( presidents , prime ministers , and members of parliament ) .
Both kings and presidents will produce bads , yet a king , because he " owns " the monopoly and may sell or bequeath it , will care about the repercussions of his actions on capital values .
As the owner of the capital stock on " his " territory , the king will be comparatively future - oriented .
In order to preserve or enhance the value of his property , he will exploit only moderately and calculatingly .
In contrast , a temporary and interchangeable democratic caretaker does not own the country , but as long as he is in office he is permitted to use it to his advantage .
He owns its current use but not its capital stock .
This does not eliminate exploitation .
Instead , it makes exploitation shortsighted ( present - oriented ) and uncalculated , i.e. , carried out without regard for the value of the capital stock .
Nor is it an advantage of democracy that free entry into every state position exists ( whereas under monarchy entry is restricted by the king 's discretion ) .
To the contrary , only competition in the production of goods is a good thing .
Competition in the production of bads is not good ; in fact , it is sheer evil .
Kings , coming into their position by virtue of birth , might be harmless dilettantes or decent men ( and if they are " madmen , " they will be quickly restrained or if need be , killed , by close relatives concerned with the possessions of the dynasty ) .
In sharp contrast , the selection of government rulers by means of popular elections makes it essentially impossible for a harmless or decent person to ever rise to the top .
Presidents and prime ministers come into their position as a result of their efficiency as morally uninhibited demagogues .
Hence , democracy virtually assures that only dangerous men will rise to the top of government .
In particular , democracy promotes an increase in the social rate of time preference ( present - orientation ) or the " infantilization " of society .
It results in continually increased spending and taxes , paper money and paper money inflation , an unending flood of legislation , and a steadily growing " public " debt .
By the same token , democracy leads to lower savings , increased legal uncertainty , moral confusion , lawlessness , and crime .
Further , democracy is a tool for wealth and income confiscation and redistribution .
It involves the legislative " taking " of the property of some ( the haves ) and the " giving " of it to others ( the have - nots ) .
And since it is presumably something valuable that is being redistributed -- of which the haves have too much and the have - nots too little -- any such redistribution implies that the incentive to be of value or produce something valuable is systematically reduced .
In other words , the proportion of not - so - good people and not - so - good personal traits , habits , and forms of conduct and appearance will increase , and life in society will become increasingly unpleasant .
Democracy has resulted in a radical change in the conduct of war .
Because they can externalize the costs of their own aggression onto others ( via taxes ) , both kings and presidents will be more than " normally " aggressive and warlike .
However , a king 's motive for war is typically an ownership - inheritance dispute .
The objective of his war is tangible and territorial : to gain control over some piece of real estate and its inhabitants .
And to reach this objective , it is in his interest to distinguish between combatants ( his enemies and targets of attack ) and noncombatants and their property ( to be left out of the war and undamaged ) .
Democracy has transformed the limited wars of kings into total wars .
The motive for war has become ideological -- democracy , liberty , civilization , humanity .
The objectives are intangible and elusive : the ideological " conversion " of the losers preceded by their " unconditional " surrender ( which , because one can never be certain about the sincerity of conversion , may require such means as the murder of civilians ) .
And the distinction between combatants and noncombatants becomes fuzzy and ultimately disappears under democracy , and mass war involvement -- the draft and popular war rallies -- as well as " collateral damage " become part of war strategy .
The third myth is the belief that there exists no alternative to Western welfare - democracies .
Again , theory demonstrates otherwise .
The modern welfare state is not a " stable " economic system .
It is bound to collapse under its own parasitic weight , much like Russian - style socialism imploded a decade ago .
More important , however , an economically stable alternative to democracy exists .
The term I propose for this alternative is " natural order . "
The Private Property Alternative
In a natural order , every scarce resource , including all land , is owned privately , every enterprise is funded by voluntarily paying customers or private donors , and entry into every line of production , including that of property protection , conflict arbitration , and peacemaking , is free .
A large part of my book concerns the explanation of the workings -- the logic -- of a natural order and the requirements for the transformation from democracy to a natural order .
Whereas states disarm their citizens so as to be able to rob them more surely ( thereby rendering them more vulnerable also to criminal and terrorist attack ) , a natural order is characterized by an armed citizenry .
This feature is furthered by insurance companies , which play a prominent role as providers of security and protection in a natural order .
Insurers will encourage gun ownership by offering lower premiums to armed ( and weapons - trained ) clients .
By their nature , insurers are defensive agencies .
Only " accidental " ( not self - inflicted , caused or provoked ) damage is " insurable . "
Aggressors and provocateurs will be denied insurance coverage and are thus weak .
And because insurers must indemnify their clients in case of victimization , they must be concerned constantly about the prevention of criminal aggression , the recovery of misappropriated property , and the apprehension of those liable for the damage in question .
Furthermore , the relationship between insurer and client is contractual .
The rules of the game are mutually accepted and fixed .
An insurer cannot " legislate , " or unilaterally change the terms of the contract .
In particular , if an insurer wants to attract a voluntarily paying clientele , it must provide for the foreseeable contingency of conflict in its contracts , not only between its own clients but especially with clients of other insurers .
The only provision satisfactorily covering the latter contingency is for an insurer to bind itself contractually to independent third - party arbitration .
However , not just any arbitration will do .
The conflicting insurers must agree on the arbitrator or arbitration agency , and in order to be agreeable to insurers , an arbitrator must produce a product ( of legal procedure and substantive judgment ) that embodies the widest possible moral consensus among insurers and clients alike .
Thus , contrary to statist conditions , a natural order is characterized by stable and predictable law and increased legal harmony .
Moreover , insurance companies promote the development of another " security feature . "
States have not just disarmed their citizens by taking away their weapons , democratic states in particular have also done so in stripping their citizens of the right to exclusion and by promotinspag instead -- through various non-discrimination , affirmative action , and multiculturalist policies -- forced integration .
In a natural order , the right to exclusion inherent in the very idea of private property is restored to private property owners .
In addition , whereas states have undermined intermediating social institutions ( family households , churches , covenants , communities , and clubs ) and the associated ranks and layers of authority so as to increase their own power vis-a - vis equal and isolated individuals , a natural order is distinctly un-egalitarian .
A Strategy for Liberty
Finally , my book discusses strategic matters and questions .
How can a natural order arise out of democracy ?
I explain the role of ideas , intellectuals , elites , and public opinion in the legitimation and de-legitimation of state power .
In particular , I discuss the role of radical devolution and the proliferation of independent political entities as an important step toward the goal of natural order based on private property , and I explain how to properly privatize " socialized " and " public " property .
People usually strip for love or money .
But Isaac Esquivel and thousands of other Mexican men and women dropped their clothes in neat piles early Sunday and pranced naked around the main plaza of this capital just for the heck of it .
New York photographer Spencer Tunick , famous for rounding up people to pose naked in cities around the world , brought his fetching artistic gimmick here .
His goal was to persuade more than 7,000 residents of this very Roman Catholic country to disrobe in front of God , one another and a media army perched on the roof of the downtown Holiday Inn .
City officials estimated as many as 20,000 people might have taken part .
“ At first I was really nervous , ” said Esquivel , 25 , who also is a photographer .
“ I kept thinking about what they tell you before you make a speech , you know , to imagine your audience naked . ”
He did n’t have to wait long .
At 6:50 a.m. , the disrobing began at Tunick ’s signal , and , after tossing aside their workaday identities , people began running to the center of the capital ’s historic plaza , known as the Zocalo .
‘ Part of human life ’
Within minutes , the square was filled with pink flesh and dark hair , a chanting , shouting , gleeful party in the light of dawn , the gathering framed by the Metropolitan Cathedral , City Hall and the National Palace .
“ Nudity is part of human life , ” said Liliana Velasco , 30 , an anthropologist .
“ Being naked is being in the moment , and being naked in the Zocalo gives everyone a chance to celebrate our culture . ”
Not quite , maybe , what the 16th century Spaniards had in mind when they set aside the plaza for the heart of their new empire .
The giant square is the scene of concerts , political rallies and parades .
Hundreds of thousands of protesters have raised their fists here .
Most years , the Mexican president gives the annual cry for liberty from the balcony of the National Palace to kick off Independence Day celebrations .
Esquivel said he found his own freedom Sunday .
“ After you take off your clothes , you see that everybody is the same , ” he said .
“ That ’s when I stopped being nervous and started to have fun . ”
That did n’t last too long either .
Tunick and his assistants began herding the naked volunteers for the first say - cheese moment .
“ Everybody take a stone , ” barked Tunick , referring to the large stone squares that form the floor of the Zocalo .
The one - person , one - stone command lent order to the crowd .
Tunick asked them to pose in the Mexican salute , which is held not at the forehead but chest - high .
A woman lost her nerve and ran out of the crowd .
She dressed and left in a hurry .
‘ Otra , otra ! ’
After he finished with that pose , the crowd chanted , “ Otra , otra ! ” Another one , another one .
Tunick then asked that they lie down on the cold stones , feet facing north .
Mexico
City is in its warm season , but the early morning temperature was in the 60s .
By 7:30 a.m. , the crowd was kneeling , head down , curled up in the so - called snail pose .
It looked as though they were bowing to the cathedral , Mexico ’s oldest .
A few shouted for Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera to join them .
Tunick had promised while negotiating for city permission that he would not include the cathedral in any of the photographs .
Shortly after 8 a.m. , Tunick dismissed all the men -- about three - quarters of the crowd -- and broke the spell that for a couple of hours had united several thousand strangers in an odd intimacy .
Tunick and his helpers corralled the women into a corner of the Zocalo for one last shot while the men dressed .
Most stuck around to watch .
And some began to cheer , injecting a bit of wolf - whistle attitude that was absent when everybody was naked .
“ Thank you for participating , but would all the men please return to the street , please ! ” shouted one organizer .
“ No photographs please .
No cellphone photographs , please . ”
Everybody was dressed by 9 a.m. as the street sweepers gave the Zocalo a once - over .
“ What a great moment for the Mexican art scene , ” Tunick said later .
“ The heart of Latin America is now in Mexico . ”

Progressive Network of Southeast PA — On May 2 , the Chester County Democratic Committee voted on an impeachment resolution brought to the committee by Stephanie Markstein .
After much discussion , the resolution to introduce articles of impeachment against George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney passed by a 4 - 1 margin .
This resolution , like the one passed by Berks County Democratic Committee , will be sent to the Pennsylvania State Legislature for consideration .
Find your legislator :

And tell them to restore the rule of law , and stop the war by impeaching this executive branch .
SEATTLE , March 5 ( Reuters ) —
The Microsoft Corporation , the software giant , has prepared a blistering attack on rival Google , arguing that the Web search leader takes a cavalier approach to copyright protection .
In remarks prepared for delivery on Tuesday to the Association of American Publishers , the associate general counsel of Microsoft , Thomas Rubin , argues that Google ’s move into new media markets has come at the expense of publishers of books , videos and software .
Mr. Rubin ’s comments echo arguments at the heart of a 16 - month - old copyright lawsuit against Google brought by five book publishers and organized by the Association of American Publishers , an industry trade group .
“ Companies that create no content of their own , and make money solely on the backs of other people ’s content , are raking in billions through advertising revenue and I.P.O.s , ” said Mr. Rubin , who oversees copyright and trade - secret law .
Fizzy Fruit hopes bubbles tickle kids ' appetite for fruit Better - for - you snacking has come down to this : fresh fruit all but guaranteed to make kids belch .
It 's Fizzy Fruit — whole grapes or slices of apples or pineapples carbonated in a secret process with the same carbon dioxide that 's in soft drinks but without added sugar .
At a time of resolutions to eat better and calls for healthier snacks for kids , two powerhouses of food retailing , Wal - Mart and 7 - Eleven , just began selling Fizzy Fruit in some stores in the Southeast and Southwest .
Disney thinks enough of the product that it plans a March promotion for Fizzy Fruit cups tied to its upcoming film Meet the Robinsons .
The fruit is raising eyebrows as one of the more unusual — if not provocative — food items in stores .
Food scientist Steven Witherly predicts kids may like it so much that overall fruit consumption actually could rise .
But Witherly , author of the upcoming book Why Humans Like Junk Food , warns , " The consumption of non-fizzed fruit may decrease . "
One nutritionist is concerned .
" Will this get kids used to eating fruit in an unnatural form and deter them from eating it in a natural form ? " asks Kelly Brownell , director of the Yale Center for Eating and Weight Disorders .
" It 's sad that we 've come to this state of affairs . "
But Fizzy Fruit executives think they 've created a genre that will improve kids ' diets and even change the way they view fruit .
" If we could get kids eating Fizzy Fruit instead of candy , that would make a lot of parents happy , " says Jeff Mason , president of Fizzy Fruit and former managing director of a Coca - Cola unit .
Mason says Fizzy Fruit will be sold coast - to - coast by spring .
It 's already sold in dozens of school cafeterias as part of the lunches .
" Kids love how it fizzes in their mouths , " says Connie Larsen , principal at Sunrise Elementary School in Albany , Ore .
But it is n't cheap .
A 5 - oz. pack at 7 - Eleven is $ 2.49 .
Executives at 7 - Eleven say it helps raise the bar on healthier food .
" While some folks come in for Slurpees , others want healthier things for their kids , " says John Vaughan , the fresh food merchandiser in Texas , where 220 stores carry Fizzy Fruit .
Wal - Mart carries it in 1,200 stores in 15 states — at $ 1.88 a cup .
" You ca n't eat this stuff without smiling , " says spokeswoman Karen Burk .
Wal - Mart is considering carrying it nationally .
Country Fresh is the Fizzy Fruit licensee that supplies both chains .
The toughest thing is getting consumers to comprehend what Fizzy Fruit is , says Alex Espalin , marketing chief at Fizzy Fruit and former innovation director at Coke .
" Fizzy Fruit defines a new product experience for kids , " he says .
It 's this generation 's Pop Rocks , he says , in reference to the 1970s cult candy made with carbon dioxide that crackled when it hit the tongue .
But Fizzy Fruit has one critical difference :
It 's real fruit , not candy .
Enlarge Fizzy Fruit is the real thing , with carbonation added .

The flag - waving chickenhawks can dish out all the propaganda they want , but let 's face it - George Bush is gutting our military , hurting our soldiers and putting our country at risk .
This is some scary stuff , folks .
Our military is stretched so thin they 're forced to send wounded soldiers back into battle , extend their tours of duty and have no choice but to once again cut short their leave time .
Yahoo :
For just the second time since the war began , the Army is sending large units back to Iraq without giving them at least a year at home , defense officials said Monday .
The move signaled how stretched the U.S. fighting force has become .
Read more ...
Our president is holding our soldiers hostage in Iraq which in my eyes is tantamount to torture .
Do we need to invoke the Geneva Conventions in order to protect the troops from their own government ?
It 's time to put to rest the pathetic notion that anyone who does n't support shoving our brave men and women into King George 's meat grinder does n't support the troops .
I want to hear one , just ONE , right wing pundit or politician explain how wanting to save our troops from getting blown up for a lost cause does n't count as support .
You do n't throw an anvil to a drowning man and claim you 're trying to save his life , yet that is exactly what 's happening to our troops .
SilentPatriot : Jack Murtha and the Democrats wants to legislate a required one - year leave .
George Bush wants to send distressed soldiers back into battle as soon as possible .
Now , who really " supports the troops " ?
As Kagro X @ dKos says :
Here is a quick roundup of why I feel the republicans are not going to get my vote in the next election .
I am not saying all republicans are this bad on the issues I care about ( environment , liberty , equality , not starting wars , etc ) but unless they start running someone else I think it ’s safe to say none of these people will be getting my vote .
If you can pay attention through the rambling you will hear that governor James S. Gilmore , III is for “ Nuclear power , and other clean forms of energy , ” He also said a bunch of crap about cutting taxes , and mentioned something about young men and women and national security , also immigration .
A rather horrible answer to a rather straightforward question .
Then Tancredo stands up and unleashes the idea of making the green movement into green dollars .
I wonder if he is for subsides for renewable energy , how about raising taxes on carbon emitters , maybe he is for banning the production of more coal fired power plants , wind farms , anything .
A whole lot of nothing from these two .
Much more after the fold .
Ah what we need in government is another person who has no faith in science .
He even managed to get an applause from the audience for his ignorance ( twice ) .
Brownback does n’t even have the conviction of his own beliefs and tries his best to waffle but at the end of the day they both can not be president because they do n’t think science is real .
McCain , waffles and waffles and waffles , then sort of kind of says he does n’t maybe believe in evolution , or maybe he would maybe allow the teaching of creationism in school , awesome .
There may be some small amount of light at the end of the tunnel that these guys are at least giving lip service to doing something about global warming , but so did Bush and we all know how that turned out .
I love how Willard Mitt Romney wants to drill in ANWR and promote new nuclear plants ( backed up on the nuclear issue by McCain ) .
Seems they are locked into biofuel and nuclear .
Ron Paul seems to have his head out of his ass , but if the big boys have their way he will never even come close to winning .
Nature herself tries and stops these idiots from talking .
Unfortunately she fails .
Pardoning Scooter Libby , sure why not .
I can not believe that he said he would use George W. Bush to teach children about honesty and integrity , seriously am I taking crazy pills or is this just the stupidest thing I have ever heard .
The rest want to keep Bush as far away as possible .
Could this be because Bush has been the worst president in the history of America ?
( although to be fair Tancredo does have the right idea )
Being gay is now an attitude , and that attitude keeps you from defending America .
Shameful .
Giuliani wants to tech our army how to turn us into an empire , and Willard flip flops like a fish out of water .
Not a one of them took a strong stance on the issue .
You do n’t have to be straight to shoot straight people .
Feeling like a masochist , want to watch the whole sordid affair , here is parts Good luck .
If I ruled the world , all driving directions would be formatted like this example :
LEFT on Oak Drive
Go 5 miles
RIGHT on Davis Street
Go 2 miles
It ’s constructed in the order you need the information .
Too often you see directions like “ Go 2 miles on Oak Drive .
It ’s a left . ”
You ’ll sprain your brain reading the information out of order .
Google Maps comes close to getting it right .
They use this format :
“ Turn right at Dublin Blvd 4 miles ”
The word “ turn ” is unnecessary clutter .
And it always takes me a second to figure out whether the “ 4 miles ” means the turn is in 4 miles or if you stay on that road for 4 miles .
And “ right ” would be clearer in caps .
I have the same issue with travel itineraries .
When I book a flight on Orbitz , they e-mail me this little confusing mess of a confirmation that just pisses me off :
“ Tuesday , June 5 , 2007
United Airlines # 1212
Oakland Metropolitan Oak Intl ( OAK ) to Denver International ( DEN )
Departure ( OAK ) : June 5 , 1:57 PM PDT ( afternoon )
Arrival ( DEN ) : June 5 , 5:20 PM MDT ( evening ) ”
It says “ June 5 ” three times .
It says both “ PM ” and “ ( afternoon ) ” whereas “ PDT ” and “ MDT ” go unexplained .
How many people are confused by AM and PM and yet understand PDT and MDT ?
It borders on random .
And would it kill them to use the tab key ?
Here ’s how an itinerary should be formatted .
You put the times on the left , and whatever info you need to the right of those times , in the order you need it .
For example , the first place I put the hotel information is by the estimated time I will check in .
I put people 's contact information next to the time I expect to first see them .
And I put the date only once , as a heading .
See how clear this is .

George Bush yesterday threw international efforts to control climate change into confusion with a proposal to create a " new global framework " to curb greenhouse gas emissions as an alternative to a planned UN process .
The proposal came less than a week before a G8 summit in Germany and appeared to hit European hopes that the world 's industrialised nations would commit to halving their emissions by 2050 .
A UN - brokered meeting in Bali in December , at which it had been hoped to agree to keep climate change to a 2C increase in temperature , is supposed to provide a successor to the Kyoto protocol .
All that was thrown in doubt by the initiative announced yesterday by President Bush .
" By the end of next year , America and other nations will set a long - term global goal for reducing greenhouse gases .
To help develop this goal , the United States would convene a series of meetings of nations that produced most greenhouse gas emissions , including nations with rapidly growing economies like India and China , " Mr Bush said .
Under the Bush proposal , the 15 countries responsible for the overwhelming bulk of greenhouse gas emissions would meet in the autumn with the aim of striking a deal by the end of next year .
But it was unclear how this new grouping would be able to agree on a scheme so rapidly , when there are such pronounced differences within the smaller G8 , largely between the US and its partners .
British and German officials have stressed in recent weeks that a new climate agreement should be based on binding caps on carbon pollution for developed nations , similar to those set up under the UN's Kyoto protocol .
President Bush has consistently opposed such restrictions , which he argues would damage the US economy .
He prefers voluntary targets and his administration is keen to measure the carbon intensity of polluting activities - a measure of their efficiency - rather than tot up their overall emissions .
Yesterday 's announcement contained only a reference to an unspecified long - term goal .
Tony Blair hailed the Bush initiative as an important step forward .
" For the first time America 's saying it wants to be part of a global deal , " the prime minister told Sky News while on a tour of South Africa .
" For the first time it 's setting its own domestic targets .
For the first time it 's saying it wants a global target for the reduction of emissions , and therefore for the first time I think [ there is ] the opportunity for a proper global deal . "
Angela Merkel , the German chancellor and host of next week 's G8 summit , also welcomed the initiative .
" I think it is positive , and the US president 's speech makes it clear that no one can avoid the question of global warming any more , " Ms Merkel said of the proposal .
" This is common ground on which to act . "
However , Bernd Pfaffenbach , the chief German negotiator or " sherpa " on climate change was blunter .
He told the Suddeutschen Zeitung newspaper that excluding the UN or weakening its role was a " red line " that Ms Merkel " will never cross " .
" The leading role of the UN on climate change is non-negotiable , " he added .
Another German official described the proposal as a " poison pill " aimed at undermining G8 and UN efforts to tackle global warming .
" With one stroke you say goodbye to the UN , " the official said .
" This is a fundamentally different approach , and I 'd be very surprised if the other G8 countries abandon the UN course . "
Environmentalists were also furious .
Daniel Mittler , an analyst at Greenpeace International , said : " It 's not even too little too late , but a dangerous diversionary tactic .
He does n't need to start a new process .
There already is one .
This is meant to slow down the UN process . "
The Bush administration moved to dispel the impression that it was an attempt to undermine Europe 's position on climate change , or that it represented a transatlantic breach .
Jim Connaughton , the former energy lobbyist who heads the Council on Environmental Quality at the White House and is lead negotiator on climate change , claimed that the process the president was advocating was not intended to undercut the influence of the Bali climate conference .
" It will run in parallel and reinforce Bali , " Mr Connaughton said .
However , he was critical of using emission caps or setting temperature control , the main instruments of Europe 's approach , and repeated Washington 's opposition to the European goal of limiting climate change to 2C .
" We do n't think that 's a very practical approach , " he said .
" You ca n't manage the temperature . "
Coming days after the Bush administration 's opposition to the 2C goal became public , the new proposal has all but killed off hopes of an agreement on basic principles for combating climate change at the G8 meeting .
German officials had hoped the gaps could be narrowed in a meeting between Ms Merkel and Mr Bush on Wednesday but in yesterday 's speech the US president appeared to commit himself to an alternative course .
European hopes that the US establishment was now convinced that combating climate change was an urgent global task were also knocked yesterday when the chief of the US space agency said global warming was not an issue of pressing concern .
" I have no doubt that a trend of global warming exists , " Michael Griffin of Nasa told a radio station .
" I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with . "
" I have n't heard my name associated with it or anything of that nature , " Mitt Romney told The Salt Lake Tribune during an interview earlier this year .
" That 's not official church doctrine .
There are a lot of things that are speculation and discussion by church members and even church leaders that are n't official church doctrine .
I do n't put that at the heart of my religious belief . "
DHS trying to deport missing soldier 's wife Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday June 20 , 2007 Print This Email This
Her husband volunteered to defend this country , and he has been missing in the deserts of Iraq for more than a month .
Now the US government is trying to kick her out of the country .
Army specialist Alex Jimenez married Yaderlin Hiraldo in 2004 .
Hiraldo entered the US illegally from the Dominican Republic in 2001 , and when Jimenez petitioned for her green card while he was stationed in Iraq it alerted the government to her presence , according to a report on Boston television station WBZ .
Jimenez went missing May 12 in Iraq when he and two other soldiers were captured by al - Qaeda following an ambush .
An immigration judge stopped Hiraldo 's green card processing when her husband went missing , and the government has so far refused to grant a so - called hardship waiver that would allow her to stay in the country , WBZ reported .
Immigration lawyer Matthew Kolken told the television station that Hiraldo would have to wait 10 years to return to the US if she returned to the Dominican Republic to apply for a green card , as the government wants her to do .
Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass. , wrote a letter to the Department of Homeland Security Wednesday , asking that Hiraldo be allowed to stay in the US .
" I do not believe Yaderlin should have her stress and grief compounded by additional worries about her own immigration status , " Kerry wrote to DHS secretary Michael Chertoff .
" I request that no further action be taken Yaderlins case while her husband is missing in action . "
A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to RAW STORY 's request for comment .
Jimenez 's identification card was found in an al - Qaeda safe house recently , along with a video claiming that al - Qaeda members had killed Jimenez and other member 's of his unit .
But there has been no other sign of him since his disappearance .

Just when you thought it could n't get any more despicable , along comes BusRadio .
Their business will be to pipe ads , corporate - sponsored contests and promotions for their commercial website -- along with music -- into school buses , and into our children 's ears , on their way to and from school .
This " content " will be segmented by the students ' age group , so the busloads of elementary school kids will get ads and other propaganda most alluring to them , while the middle - school and high school students will each get ads and other propaganda most alluring to them .
BusRadio will start with school buses serving over 100,000 students in Massachusetts this September , then roll out their business nationwide in 2007 .
Now , the extremely subtle marketing tricks targeting adults that I am dedicated to exposing in my columns are sinister enough , but at least adults -- equipped with the type of insights I provide -- have a fighting chance .
Children and teens , meanwhile , do n't typically comprehend the impact marketing has on them .
Research has shown , in fact , that kids seven and younger cannot even distinguish between a fact and an advertisement … to their innocent minds , whatever an ad claims must actually be true ( because why would anyone lie ? )
BusRadio knows that full well , and they actually brag that they will " take targeted student marketing to the next level . "
The targets are , of course , our children who are sitting there captive to the forced messaging on the buses .
Even worse , the school districts ( the specialists in children 's brains ) also know full well that children and teens do n't comprehend the full impact of marketing -- but those school districts embracing BusRadio are flat - out ignoring this fact because of the short - term financial gain … Perhaps Cigarette Manufacturers
Should
Donate 10 % in Exchange for School Distribution !
Please note with awe and reverence that the oh - so - kind - hearted BusRadio has agreed to provide 5 % of their revenue to participating school districts .
As if that end justifies the means .
So what 's next , allowing junk food in the vending machines , fast - food in the cafeteria , and advertising in the classrooms just because the school districts get a cut of that revenue , too ?
Oh wait … many U.S school districts HAVE already stooped to those levels .
Okay , so then what 's next , offering cigarettes and condoms in the vending machines if those companies pledge to contribute 10 % to the schools ?
Allowing the school gymnasium 's to become strip clubs in the off - hours if they agree to contribute 15 % of their revenue to the schools ?
I wish comparing cigarettes to advertising was an exaggeration , but -- as a marketer who once worked on that irresponsible side of marketing -- I have repeatedly demonstrated how today 's rampant propaganda tricks adults into going into debt , ill health and depression .
Because they are even more impressionable , the situation is even worse for kids -- marketing gone wild is THE key cause behind many of the serious problems facing kids today including obesity , depression , violence and more .
So let me put this as kindly as possible -- BusRadio is a company based on a disgusting business model .
The more successful they are at manipulating kids ' minds , the more financially successful they will be as more companies will pay higher prices for advertising with them .
But the school districts that allow them to " target " our children with propaganda are truly the reprehensible ones , as their job -- the reason we trust our kids to them and pay tax dollars -- is to protect and expand children 's minds .
NOT allow them to be " targeted . "
What You Should Know About the Founders of BusRadio What Makes a School Bus ?
2006 - 2007 Version
There 's something you should know about the two founders of BusRadio , Michael Yanoff and Steven Shulman : they are the same executives who founded Cover Concepts , a business that provides schools with millions of free book covers decked out in ads promoting McDonald's , Nike , Calvin Klein and other major national brands .
So they know a thing or two about targeting your children for subtle mind - manipulation .
They also know a thing or two about defending themselves from public criticism .
There has already been some outcry against BusRadio in Massachussetts , where their pilot program is slated to begin this autumn .
If the outcry is n't loud enough to stop them , that simply means they are getting some practice for their national rollout in 2007 .
And predictably their main rebuttals to the criticism have been :
Hey , they 're contributing 5 % of their revenues for BusRadio to the school districts that will allow them !
( See my comments on this dangerous line of reasoning above )
Well , in a typical hour it will only be eight minutes of advertising and two minutes devoted to contests .
( And ?
The point is that advertising is already way too rampant and destructive , especially to children .
So MORE on their way to and from SCHOOL ?
But in case that sounds " okay " to some , note this : BusRadio's programs are digital and so are NOT monitored at all by the Federal Communications Commission .
So in those other 44 minutes per hour , BusRadio will be able to pay whatever music they are paid to play , and to announce whatever news they choose to announce to your kids .
Propaganda comes in many pretty packages .
Furthermore , the contests they are announcing will direct children to their website -- where there will be plenty more marketing for them to consume ! )
Um …
At least it 's better content than what your kids are listening to on their own !
( Really ?
Ads ?
Subtle propaganda ?
Run by two executives and other corporate strangers I do n't know , but whose backgrounds indicate they DON'T have my two children 's best interests in mind as their # 1 goal ?
I think I 'd rather trust my children 's choices over that option , and take responsibility for the values I instilled in them , thanks . )
The ultimate point here -- and the source of my ultimate disgust - is that our children wo n't even have a choice to shut off BusRadio when they 're on the bus .
Unlike even television which CAN be shut off , it will be FORCED into their bus , much the same way radio propaganda has been forced upon citizens in totalitarian countries in the past .
If it were all Mozart and Beethoven music being piped into the background , so be it .
But this is advertising .
This is contests that lead to a website providing more advertising .
This is corporate - sponsored music and news .
All served by complete strangers whose motivation and key goal is selling more and more and more , NOT the betterment of our children .
And unless the kids are instructed to plug their ears with their fingers or an I - Pod for every school bus ride , they will be forced to hear the propaganda .
If that is not an alarm I do n't know what is .
Time to Ride the
School Bus , Kids !
So what can YOU do about it ?
Simple : One , contact your local school board and tell them NOT to let BusRadio into your school district .
If they do n't know what BusRadio is , they soon will -- so send them a copy of this column so they wo n't hear from BusRadio first .
Two , if you do n't have children of your own , please pass this column on to every parent with kids in or going into grades k- 12 so they are aware of -- and can oppose -- BusRadio .
Meanwhile , for those who support the idea of totalitarianism in general and this business that forces kids to listen to propaganda while they are captive on their school buses in particular , some additional ways to make it even more profitable include binding the children 's hands to they can't plug their ears , and gagging their mouths so they can't talk over BusRadio .

Now that Hugo Chavez has closed yet another independent source of news in Venezuela , the true nature of his regime is being revealed :
CARACAS ( AFP ) – President Hugo Chavez ’s clampdown on opposition television stations widened Monday as police used rubber bullets and tear gas on demonstrators protesting what they called an attack on free speech .
(…)
After 54 years on the air , RCTV went dark at midnight Sunday after the government refused to renew its license .
It was promptly replaced by TVes , a state - backed station which began broadcasting cultural shows .
On Monday several people were injured as police in Caracas fired rubber bullets and tear gas to put down a demonstration against the RCTV shutdown , following the fifth straight day of protests .
A policeman ’s leg was broken in the fracas , a police official said .
(…)
One of the country ’s leading dailies , El Nacional , denounced it as “ end of pluralism in Venezuela , ” and slammed the government ’s growing “ information monopoly . ”
The archbishop of the city of Merida , Baltasar Porras Cardoso , compared Chavez to Hitler , Mussolini and Cuban leader
Fidel Castro — who is a close friend of the left - wing Venezuelan president .
“ This is the first time in eight years ( of Chavez as president ) that the university students hold a massive protest , ” said Leopoldo Lopez , an opposition leader and neighborhood mayor .
Here 's a case where there was no premeditation , only a tempting opportunity yet what the person did with the opportunity is still considered a felony .
Those who excuse non-violent rapists of legal responsibility because they did n't set up a situation with the intention of committing rape and met with an opportunity because of the victim 's mistake , must , if they are consistent , excuse this woman .
A local school social worker is in jail after a mistake put more than $ 2.5 million in her bank account , according to a criminal complaint filed in Hennepin County District Court .
Notice that this woman did nothing to bring the money within her grasp , but she 's still being charged with a crime for exploiting what did not belong to her .
So where are all those who say that the fault for this woman 's actions belong entirely with the issuer of the check ?
Where are those who say the issuer of the $ 2.5 million robbed itself ?
Where are those who claim that this transaction was consensual and therefore this woman could n't have committed a crime ?
She was given the money , she did n't take it .
Those who do n't defend this woman with the fervency with which they defend alleged opportunistic rapists reveal themselves .

Humans are going back to the Moon
Mr Hope exploited a loophole in the 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty and he has been claiming ownership of the Earth 's Moon - and seven planets and their moons - for more than 20 years .
These are " truly unowned lands " , he says .
" We 're doing exactly what our forefathers did when they came to the New World from the European continent . "
Hope says he has so far sold more than 400 million acres ( 1.6 million sq km ) , leaving a further eight billion acres still up for grabs .
Buyers include Hollywood stars , large corporations - including the Hilton and Marriot hotel chains - and even former US presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter .
George W Bush is also said to be a stake holder .
Mr Hope claims to be selling 1,500 lunar properties a day .
He allocates land by simply closing his eyes and pointing to a map of the Moon .
No government has yet recognised the lunar sales as legally binding
The next race to exploit the Moon was started by President George Bush in January 2004 , when he committed the US to returning to the Moon by as early as 2017 .
He said the US aimed to establish a long - term lunar base by about 2020 .
" We 're talking about not just going there to stay three days , " says Nasa rocket engineer Dr John Connolly .
This time , he says , " we 're talking about the idea of learning to live there . "
Commercial frontier
Other countries are also making plans .
China - which has already successfully launched two manned space missions - has announced a similar timetable .
Russia , for nearly 50 years one of the world 's leading space powers , may not be far behind .
Europe , Japan and India have also expressed an interest .
A metric ton of helium 3 would supply about one - sixth of the energy needs today of the British Isles
Harrison Schmitt
Large private companies and rich entrepreneurs have also seen a new business opportunity .
One of the biggest is US space contractor Lockheed Martin , which is currently developing technologies that will enable future lunar residents to exploit the lunar surface .
In particular , it is working on a process which will convert Moon dust into oxygen and water .
It may even be able to turn it into rocket fuel .
" Just like we use resources here on Earth in order to live off the land - you can do the same thing on the Moon , " says Lockheed Martin 's Dr Larry Clark .
But this is peanuts compared with what scientists believe is the real prize lying in the moon rocks .
Mining the Moon
Data collected from the Apollo Moon landings have indicated that large deposits of an extremely rare gas called helium 3 are trapped in the lunar soil .
Scientists believe that this helium 3 could be used to create a new source of almost inexhaustible , clean , pollution - free energy on Earth .
Mr Schmitt was in a " geologist 's paradise " walking on the Moon
" A metric ton of helium 3 would supply about one - sixth of the energy needs today of the British Isles , " he claims .
Plans are already afoot in the US and Russia to strip - mine lunar helium 3 and transport it the 240,000 miles ( 385,000 km ) back to Earth .
The Moon , claims Professor Jerry Kulcinski of the University of Wisconsin - Madison , could become the Persian Gulf of the 21st Century .
" If we had gold bricks stacked up on the surface of the Moon , we could n't afford to bring them back .
This material - at several billion dollars a tonne - is what makes it all worthwhile . "
Lone voice
Not everybody is happy with the idea of exploiting the Moon .
Edgar Mitchell was a member of the 1971 Apollo 14 lunar mission .
He is worried that , in our rush to exploit it , we could also destroy valuable scientific information .
" As far as how the Universe works , we 're just barely out of the trees .
Until we know what the Moon is really all about , the idea of trying to commercialise it is , in my opinion , a misplaced idea , " he argues .
Yet , he is almost a lone voice .
" The Moon is such a rich scientific destination , I think we need to look at it just the way we do the South Pole , " explains Dr Connolly .
" We should go there , find everything there is to find out scientifically .
There are a number of resources that we know can be of great benefit . "
Horizon : Moon for Sale will be broadcast on BBC Two on Tuesday 10 April at 2100 BST .
DePauw University severed its ties today with a national sorority that evicted two - thirds of the university ’s members last year in what the sorority called an effort to improve its image for recruitment , but which the evicted women described as a purge of the unattractive or the uncool .
“ We at DePauw do not like the way our students were treated , ” DePauw ’s president , Robert G. Bottoms , said in a letter to Delta Zeta .
“ We at DePauw believe that the values of our university and those of the national Delta Zeta sorority are incompatible . ”
The sorority evicted 23 members of its DePauw chapter in December , and half a dozen other women later quit in protest .
The action greatly diminished the chapter ’s diversity .
The women the sorority allowed to stay were all slender and conventionally pretty .
Those evicted included some overweight women , and several minority members were evicted or left the sorority on their own .
In an interview , Dr. Bottoms said that beginning this fall Delta Zeta would no longer be permitted to house students in its Greek - columned residence on the DePauw campus in Greencastle , Ind .
Only a handful of undergraduates are currently living in the Delta Zeta house , and four of them are seniors , Dr. Bottoms said , adding that the university would help any women who had been planning to live in the residence next year to find alternative housing .
All my life I have been bothered by the notion that things are going faster and faster .
And that there was something wrong about this .
Since I have become an adult it is my distinct impression that things are , indeed speeding up .
Planes , automobiles , electronic communication all help humans interact faster , better , more efficiently .
But the cost is great and obscured by a variety of mechanisms : this article is just about a sliver of them .
Some History
In the late 1800 's the concept of " slavery " , openly practiced in America up to that point , was officially rejected and processes were set in motion to end it and , ostensibly , wipe it out .
UPDATE : Please see the excellent Juneteenth and the seeds of freedom by tface1000 currently on the diary list at Daily Kos
Today is June 19 ... otherwise known as Juneteenth .
Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration of of the emancipation of the slaves in the United States .
The significance of June 19 is that day in 1865 , Major General Gordon Granger landed at Galveston , Texas and announced the order that the slaves had been freed .
This was two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation , and the reasons for this could be one of many , including the desire to not let them know so owners could reap another harvest , to the fact that there were n't enough Union soldiers to enforce it until Granger arrived .
Nevertheless , they were finally freed from their enslavement , and Juneteenth is the celebration of that day .
To paint in broad strokes , slavery was replaced by the what I call a debt - based Peonage System .
Since the late 1800 there has been a large concerted effort to wrest " freedom " from Americans .
The demise of the family farm , the addiction to petroleum as the means of producing our society 's goods and electrical and other power , hitherto unknown by any other peoples , are 2 giant interlocking themes in what has happened to this country .
The introduction of mass - production and the Industrial revolution have been another profound influence on this development .
More and more , people were working in regulated shifts : infamously barbaric at first , but , with activism , we got weekends , a 40 hour week , vacation time , sick time .
A regular money - making scheme .
Then came the TV and it ;s as - yet unmeasured impact on humankind , it 's power stolen from the people by and funneled into the hands of a few massively - powerful corporate entities and their elected representatives .
The vast power of the TV is used to sedate , to deceive , to influence thoughts , values , beliefs , attitudes and behavior .
The single main purpose is to make Americans want to buy things .
The Consumer Society
Modern America , the offensive , shrill , shallow , mindless consumptive beast , the Ugly America whose government is wholly co-opted by corporate interests , exploiting the entire world for what it can steal and sell back to you for a fat profit - this is the America I want to destroy .
The America that wants gas - guzzling Hummers and houses the size of the Castle Dracula , with their patchy frankenlawns and their $ 50,000 cars and IMAX - sized plasma TVs and their fine , fine suits , and $ 400 shoes .
And that $ 35,000 watch chrongraph that so accurately tracks the $ 50,000 car 's navigation system .
See : The Overspent American : Why We Want What We Don't Need .
[ I could not get the video to link from You Tube .
It 's a very good overview of what I gloss over here . ]
Dropping Out The Permanent Protest
I have two general ideas to air about damaging this monstrosity .
1 is what I call " dropping out " , the general overview , the other is the concept of the cheap car - a case in point .
Basically the Consumer Society envelops you like a fish is water : you 're soaking in it now !
The first thing a person has to do is become comfortable with the idea that the whole of the commercial media is employed to deceive you at least a little tiny bit .
Usually a whole hell of a lot .
3 great examples - WMD's , cannabis prohibition , and the current firestorm over global warming .
Add Iraq war coverage to this .
In the end I think , perhaps idealistically ( sue me ) , if enough Americans adopt SOME of this stuff - which is essential for the coming future realities anyway - the " system " will lose steam .
I know it sounds crazy .
The main thing to get started is TURN OFF THE TV .
I turned mine off many years ago .
I have noticed in the past few years I am not necessarily consumed with thought of buying this or that material item .
There are things I need to buy but these are more or less based on identified and actual need , not on TV commercials and product - placement in made for TV programming and commercial films .
The information , ie " news " on TV is n't as fresh or accurate as what you can find online .
It just is n't .
And print media sees the writing on the wall - their days are numbered if they do n't get creative .
Printing the Truth would be pretty creative .
I digress .
The next thing is to reduce your consumption
This actually means ' change ' or ' alter ' it because you gotta live , right ?
In My 30 Days of Consumer Celibacy the author , who references a group called the Compactors a consumer group , goes on a special sort of " diet " : no new purchases .
No purchasing anything new for 30 days .
Call me an impatient American consumer , but the truth is , I both care passionately about the environment and live in a world where I often have zero extra time .
And shopping for used stuff takes lots of time .
I made a commitment some time ago to use my purchasing power to help the environment , and spending a month Compacting forced me to reexamine my priorities .
It also helped me reconsider my needs versus my wants .
*****
I wondered : Am I really making a difference ?
Do I need to eliminate everything I would ordinarily buy new ?
The answer surprised me .
In The Consumer 's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices , Michael Brower and Warren Leon of the Union of Concerned Scientists calculated the impact of various consumer purchases on four environmental problem areas : air pollution , water pollution , global warming , and habitat alteration .
They analyzed the environmental footprints of everything from cheese to carpet to feminine products and then aggregated them into 50 categories of goods and services .
In the end , they found that just 7 of the 50 categories were responsible for the lion 's share of environmental degradation : cars and trucks ; meat and poultry farming ; crop production ; home heating , hot water , and air conditioning ; household appliances ; home construction ; and household water use and sewage treatment .
Dropping out , for me , has been a process .
Following seeing Supersize Me , I stopped eating at " fast - food restaurants " .
McD's , Burger King , Wendy's , Chick - fil - A , none of these places get my money anymore .
It 's been nearly 3 years .
I also cut out corporate grocery stores as much as possible .
I hate like hell to shop in a Publix or Krogers .
I do when I have to but 90 % + of our money goes to about 4 different locally - owned individual businesses , Asian and other farmer 's markets .
The food is better , cheaper and its much easier tog et organic stuff .
This is a more work - intensive lifestyle .
My wife just happens to be an awesome " cook " - I hate to use that word as it does n't convey her masterful understanding the selection , purchase , and storing and cooking of raw foods but it cuts several hundred dollars off our monthly food bill and we eat unbelievably well .
( Last night and , umm , right now , we are having fresh squid stir - fried with ginger , shrimp / broccoli soup and rice .
Very fresh squid @ $ 1.49 / lb . )
There is very little packaging that we buy .
Our trash container is seldom half full while I drive past homes that have twice - weekly trash pickup and their trashcan - just like mine - is always heaped full of crap .
The boxes and packaging trash by - product of the un-examined consumer lifestyle .
So if you start just looking at your trash and wonder how to stop paying for all that stuff you are throwing away , you will be inconvenienced but you 'll have saved money and taken a good step towards unhooking that yolk around your neck .
Next Step : Credit is Debt & Debt means slavery
During the days of slavery , some of the educated / specialist slaves were allowed , by necessity , to travel away from the plantation to conduct business .
They would wear special tags or badges that identified where they " belong " .
I essentially view the credit card as the evolved version of this concept .
Peonage is a system whereby people are legally kept in slave - like bondage by a creditor until such time that the debt is satisfied .
Many slaves elected to stay on at plantations as hired free people but gut sucked into the peonage system buying goods on credit .
Basically , as long as you pay the man every thirty day , so says a good friend , you are a " free person " .
Nothing wrong with that , is there ?
Well , yeah , I think there is .
The TV blasts nonstop messages of consumption across America and across the world .
Credit is pushed by predatory lending firms harder than heroin on a virtually sonambulent mass which buys all that crap on credit and finds itself working 2 and three jobs to keep up .
And it 's killing them .
Repos and foreclosures have recently hit new highs , have n't they ?
The Mortgage Bankers Association reported Thursday that the percentage of payments that were 30 or more days past due for subprime adjustable - rate mortgages jumped to 15.75 percent in the January - to - March quarter .
That was a sizable increase from the late 2006 delinquency rate of 14.44 percent and the highest on record , said Doug Duncan , the association 's chief economist .
Foreclosure filings , meanwhile , were up 90 percent in May compared with last year , according to industry data firm RealtyTrac Inc .
Many people who took out subprime mortgages , especially adjustable - rate loans , have recently been clobbered by a combination of rising interest rates and weak home prices , making it increasingly difficult for them to keep up with their monthly payments .
Lenders in the subprime market have also been hard hit , and some have been forced out of business .
Many reading this may be aware of the concept of Affluenza as well as what to do about it .
These are good sites for information and some mild motivation to help one make the jump .
My plan for destroying Consumer America and the Capitalist System
It 's all very simple , really .
I discovered this recently as I tried to find a decent used car for my wife .
She is from a foreign country where she never drove a car .
She has learned to drive on my 4 wheel drive Toyota truck with a manual 5 speed .
She hates it .
She can drive it but she hates it .
So we have been looking for a car with an automatic .
Atlanta traffic is so dangerous she does n't want to be figuring out gears .
We looked and looked .
We have seen a lot of trash paraded as a decent deal .
She has been in front of some of the best examples of slimy used car salesmen .
We have taken several cars that I thought we " ok " to my mechanic who quickly diagnosed obscure but serious problems which were more or less purposefully - hidden .
I got CARFAX and have run 50 VIN numbers on different cars many OK but horribly over - priced , others affordable buy having very sketchy pasts or multiple accidents or were in New Orleans in September 2005 .
So on and so forth .
And a lot of car dealers posing as private sellers with the primo vehicle .
Crooks and Liars one and all .
Finally , a person she met networking within the Vietnamese community has very kindly offered to sell us a car they do n't use much for $ 1200 .
It appears to be worth , on the corrupt but legal market , about $ 3600 .
It 's CARFAX is the best one I have seen , locally - owned and operated , 2 owners , no accidents , and still under 100000 .
It took me a little while to overcome my skeptical ways .
How can a car that really runs cost only $ 1200 ?
It hit me :
It 's just not American .
Not the New 21st - Century Consumer Society American values .
If MOST people could easily get a car like this for $ 1200 or even $ 1500 a large part of the Consumer Society scheme collapses .
( Yes , the same principle applies to mass transportation but we will get a wave of used cars before we will get effective mass transit in THIS country . )
So MUCH of the Consumer Society is about the automobile .
They define who we are to ourselves and others .
They reflect our status in life and all that .
Cars mean so many things but I want to focus on the following : Cars mean
Profits from Credit
profits from petroleum consumption
profits from selling cars , new and used .
There is just so much money to be made if you have the ability to buy a running car for $ 1200 and resell it for $ 4000 , which I believe happens constantly .
Large amounts of money are funneled into an ever - smaller group of hands .
It 's called business and allegedly is good for you and me .
But just imagine for a moment being able to go buy a decent , mechanically - sound car for under $ 2000 .
One that would run 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 years .
You did n't use any credit .
Nobody made money from you borrowing money .
A new car dealer did n't make some obscene profit from you buying a new vehicle .
The one that loses $ 10000 in value the day after you drive it off the lot .
A large part of the profit stream gets by - passed while you have got what you need to get you job and buy your food and get around .
Buying very cheap use cars , a nightmarish and distasteful task , undercuts 2 of the big three profit streams related to the use of cars .
Can you imagine depriving that system of that much sheer , needless profit ?
I sure can .
Well , there you have it .
We can do some serious damage to what America has become by working on dropping out of of the Consumer Society .
Turn off your TV

Gravel becoming online hero Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday May 10 , 2007 Print This Email This Mike Gravel is n't going to let miniscule fundraising and poll numbers below 1 percent dissuade him in his quixotic bid for the White House .
Building on a compelling performance at last months Democratic debate , in which his impassioned anti-war rhetoric stood out in the crowded field , Gravel and his supporters are organizing online with a grassroots fervor he hopes will put him on par with the top tier campaigns .
The swell of support has been enough to secure the former Alaska Senator a spot on another debate stage next month .
When the Democrats gather next month in New Hampshire for a debate cosponsored by CNN and the Manchester Union Leader , Gravel will be on stage along with the other contenders , Gravel spokesman Shawn Alexander Colvin tells RAW STORY .
Although a representative of the Manchester Union Leader initially told the campaign that Gravel did not meet the criteria necessary to be included , his performance in the South Carolina debate convinced CNN to invite Gravel to participate in New Hampshire , Colvin said .
The 2008 elections page on news aggregator Digg.com has been consistently featuring stories on Gravel and his Republican doppelganger Rep. Ron Paul , the Texas libertarian shaking up the GOP field .
Several Gravel stories also have been referenced on reddit.com , a similar aggregator , included a link to a petition titled , " Let Gravel speak !
Ask CNN to include Mike Gravel in their debate . "
Gravel 's campaign used reddit and Digg to promote its official home page , and traffic to the site exploded after his appeareance at the debate , and in the days immediately following the debate , Gravel - related links occupied the top spots on those sites , according to blog Neomeme .
Since clips from Gravels April 26 debate performance became a hit on YouTube , his campaign has used its online supporters to create a virtual staff ,  Colvin said , adding that around a half - dozen supporters have begun working with the campaign in the last couple of weeks , helping to maintain the candidates
Web site and working with his media team .
While Gravels antics may be inspiring online activists , his appearance on the debate stage appears to have rankled some in the mainstream media .
A Washington
Post editorial this week called for long - shots to be swept from the debate stage .
 When Mr. Gravel says he's not running to win , that ought to be grounds enough to toss him out ,  the editorial argued .
Colvin said Gravels statement that it doesnt matter  whether he is elected was taken out of context and should not be used to imply he is running a vanity campaign .
Rather , it reflected Gravels support for the national ballot initiative , which he says would empower voters to make more decisions in their government .
Campaign fundraising also has grown since the debate , but Colvin would not say by how much .
Gravels homepage lists a goal of raising $ 35,000 this month .
Gravel raised just $ 15,534 in the first three months of this year , and his campaign account is carrying more than $ 88,000 in debt .
Colvin insists fundraising will not decide this election , and he insists that Gravel will be increasing fundraising goals every month to raise at least enough to still be competitive by the time the Iowa Caucuses and New Hampshire Primaries arrive in January .
( The top two Democrats , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have each raised more than $ 25 million , and election experts have predicted candidates will need to have raised at least $ 100 million by the end of this year to be taken seriously . )
Although he may not be able to afford expansive teams or polished advertisements , Gravel will continue to take advantage of free forums to spread his message , as he did in the first South Carolina debate .
But it is unclear whether Gravel will be able to translate his current mini - boomlet into the kind of movement that will be necessary to climb into even double - digit support in the polls .
ECONOMICS is “ not a ‘ gay science ' , ” wrote Thomas Carlyle in 1849 .
No , it is “ a dreary , desolate , and indeed quite abject and distressing one ; what we might call , by way of eminence , the dismal science . ”
Carlyle was a fine one to talk .
He was a brooding curmudgeon who thundered against industry , progress and the young science that sought to explain them .
He found economists dismal not for the obvious reasons , such as their dry arithmetic or their gloomy preoccupation with scarcity and subsistence .
Instead , he took against them because they were so wedded to the idea of happiness .
The economists of his day took their cue from Jeremy Bentham and his “ utilitarian ” philosophy .
They calculated happiness , or utility , as the sum of good feelings minus bad , and argued that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain were the sole springs of human action .
One even looked forward to the invention of a hedonimeter , a “ psychophysical machine ” that would record the ups and downs of a man 's feelings just as a thermometer might plot his temperature .
Such people , Carlyle complained , fancied that man was a “ dead Iron - Balance for weighing Pains and Pleasures on ” .
The hedonimeter was never invented , and for a century or so economists fell silent about both weights on man 's scales .
They studied outward behaviour , not inward feelings ; choices made , not pleasures taken .
But in recent years , economists have become newly confident that they can measure utility as Bentham conceived it : as a quantum of pleasure or pain .
How do they do it ?
Mostly they just ask people .
Daniel Kahneman , a psychologist at Princeton University who won the Nobel prize for economics in 2002 , reckons people are not as mysterious as less nosy economists supposed .
“ The view that hedonic states cannot be measured because they are private events is widely held but incorrect , ” he and his colleagues argue .
Generally , people can say how they feel at a given moment , on a scale of zero to ten .
And if this smacks of hearsay not science , the new “ hedonimetrists ” can appeal to other kinds of evidence , better calculated to impress .
They can look into people 's eyes ; or better still , their brains .
People who confess to feeling happy also grin more than others .
And they mean it : they smile with their eyes ( a contraction of the orbicularis oculi facial muscles ) , not just their mouths .
People 's self - reports also tally roughly with what electrodes planted on their scalp reveal about the frequency and voltage of electrical waves in their left forebrain , which sparks up when they are feeling good .
Mr Kahneman 's most notorious experiment took place in a Toronto hospital over a decade ago .
He and a colleague asked patients undergoing a colonoscopy ( in which a probe is passed up the rectum ) to report their level of discomfort minute by minute .
Later , they were asked how they felt about the procedure in retrospect .
Their answers were surprising .
The test left a worse impression on patient A , for whom it lasted less than ten minutes , than on patient B , who suffered for 24 minutes .
Patients ' recollections were heavily coloured by the procedure 's worst moment and its last moment .
The duration of the pain did not seem to make much difference .
Patients were happier about a colonoscopy that lasted longer but ended better .
Fallible memories
Mr Kahneman , who is not shy of extrapolation , thinks people often choose to repeat experiences that seem better in retrospect than they did at the time .
Contrary to Bentham , the “ sovereign masters that determine what people will do are not pleasure and pain , but fallible memories of pleasure and pain . ”
If people are bad at recalling their feelings , they are worse at predicting them .
They fail to anticipate how a person feels after moving to a new city , losing a limb or winning a jackpot .
Prisoners imagine that solitary confinement will be worse than it really is ; mothers - to - be think the pain of childbirth will be more bearable than it typically proves to be .
And it is not just unusual events that trip people up .
According to Mr Kahneman , people struggle to predict how their appetite for ice - cream , low - fat yogurt or music might change in the course of a week of enjoying them .
If man is an iron - balance that weigh pains and pleasures , the scales are sadly askew .
As a result , many economists now ignore one of the discipline 's dreariest maxims : de gustibus non est disputandum , one does not quarrel over tastes .
Robert Frank begins his 1999 book “ Luxury Fever ” with a long , incredulous description of the Viking - Frontgate Professional Grill , a barbecuer 's folly , sporting infra-red rotisserie , rangetop burners and brass trimmings .
Such purchases would once have gone unquestioned by economists .
The consumer was king : if he spent $ 5,000 on a grill , a $ 5,000 grill must be what he wanted .
Likewise , if he picked X over Y , a colonoscopy over an enema , pushpin over poetry , his choice should be respected .
But now economists like Mr Frank and Mr Kahneman delight in second - guessing such choices , citing the evidence of their hedonimeters .
Have fun
What sumptuary advice do they offer ?
In general , the economic arbiters of taste recommend “ experiences ” over commodities , pastimes over knick - knacks , doing over having .
Mr Frank thinks people should work shorter hours and commute shorter distances , even if that means living in smaller houses with cheaper grills .
The appeal of such fripperies palls faster than people expect , they say .
David Hume suggested that “ the amusements , which are the most durable , have all a mixture of application and attention in them ; such as gaming and hunting . ”
But as with any argument involving economists , there is more than one side to it .
For one thing , many experiences demand a substantial outlay on commodities : horses , hounds and jodhpurs , for example .
And as Bryan Caplan , of George Mason University , points out , many trinkets and fripperies themselves provide a stream of experiences .
Adam Smith thought there was pleasure to be had simply in admiring the craftsmanship of a well - made watch , even if its extra accuracy was of little practical benefit .
Bentham appreciated his creature comforts : according to Negley Harte , the University of London 's historian , his embalmed body wears a pair of knitted underpants , unlike most of his contemporaries , who simply tucked their shirt - tails between their legs .
And before Mr Frank scoffs at Gillette 's latest five - blade shaving system , he should recall Benjamin Franklin 's belief that teaching a young man to shave , and keeping his blade sharp , would contribute more to his happiness than giving him 1,000 guineas to squander .
The money would leave behind only regret .
But self - grooming spares a man “ the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers , and of their sometimes dirty fingers , offensive breaths , and dull razors . ”
Richard Layard , an economist at the London School of Economics , provides one prominent example of the transformation that some dismal scientists have undergone .
He made his mark with his 1991 treatise , “ Unemployment ” , co-authored with Stephen Nickell and Richard Jackman .
On its cover , the book featured the painting “ L'Absinthe ” by Edgar Degas : a dejected woman and a dishevelled man , two “ rather sodden ” characters , as one reviewer put it at the time , pass the time and ease their sorrows with a tipple in a Paris café .
The book was dedicated to the “ millions who suffer through want of work ” .
Today , Lord Layard argues , unemployment is no longer Britain 's biggest social problem .
The number of jobless Britons claiming the dole is now about 960,000 .
But there are over 1 m people receiving incapacity benefits because depression and stress have left them unfit to work .
Lord Layard 's latest book has a much jauntier image on its cover : a “ happy eccentric ” with a fez on his head , a monocle in his eye and a bunch of flowers in his hand .
A perky character , one might say .
Ambitious , policy - minded economists such as Lord Layard are no longer satisfied with raising the rate of employment .
They want to lift the rate of enjoyment too .
That , it turns out , is not easy .
Happiness , as measured by national surveys , has hardly changed over 50 years .
The rich are generally happier than the poor , but rich countries do not get happier as they get richer .
The Japanese are much better off now than in 1950 , but the proportion who say they are “ very happy ” has not budged .
Americans too have remained much as Alexis de Tocqueville found them in the 19th century : “ So many lucky men , restless in the midst of abundance . ”
Lord Layard and Mr Frank both blame habit and rivalry for this stagnation of morale .
People grow accustomed to what they have — however much of it there is .
Moreover , having a lot of things is not enough if other people have more .
A rising tide lifts all boats , but not all spirits .
For economists , this is radical stuff .
They traditionally argue that people best serve themselves and the public by minding their own business .
Indeed , this laissez - faire attitude is one reason Carlyle attacked them .
Economics , he wrote , “ reduces the duty of human governors to that of letting men alone ” .
He was afraid this radical idea would “ dissever and destroy most existing institutions of society ” .
But Lord Layard argues that we cannot help minding other people 's business , as well as our own .
Doing well is not enough : we also want to do better than our peers .
This status anxiety runs deep in our nature , he says .
Vervet monkeys at the top of their social tree enjoy more mates and bananas as a result , but they also exult in their position for its own sake .
As with monkeys , so with mandarins .
Top British civil servants tend to live longer than their underlings , regardless of other differences in lifestyle , according to the “ Whitehall II ” studies which have been monitoring thousands of Humphreys and Bernards since the 1980s .
Doing well is not enough : we also want to do better than our peers .
This status anxiety runs deep
To clamber up the pecking order , some people slave away nights and weekends at the office .
They gain in rank at the expense of their free time .
But in making that sacrifice they also hurt anyone else who shares their aspirations : they too must give up their weekends to keep up .
Mr Frank reckons that many people would like to work less , if only others slackened off also .
But such bargains cannot be struck unilaterally .
On the contrary , people compete in costly “ arms races ” , knowing that if they do not work harder , they will lose their standing to someone who does .
These races are motivated by more than just prestige .
As Fred Hirsch argued in his 1977 book , “ The Social Limits to Growth ” , many good things in life are “ positional ” .
You can enjoy them only if others do n't .
Sometimes , a quick car , fine suit or attractive house is not enough .
One must have the fastest car , finest suit or priciest house .
Think of the scramble for schools , Mr Frank says .
Only 10 % of kids can go to the top 10 % of schools .
In many countries , wherever the schools are good , the houses will be expensive .
Thus parents who want the best education for their child must overwork to afford a house in a good school district .
In doing so , however , they raise the bar for everyone else .
Is mutual disarmament possible ?
Not without government help , Mr Frank and Lord Layard argue .
The exchequer should tax earned income heavily enough to deter one - upmanship , they say .
Despite appearances , this is not a naked example of punitive redistribution — the fiscal politics of envy .
Mr Frank and Lord Layard do not want to level the social order .
Their aim is much more conservative than that .
Their taxes would leave the pecking order intact and envy undiminished .
But people would be deterred from acting on the green - eyed monster .
The problem these economists want to tackle is not inequality per se .
It is that people do n't know their place and scramble vainly to improve it .
Carlyle , who thought man should content himself with being the worthy follower of worthy superiors , would no doubt have approved .
Go with the flow
Not that Carlyle was workshy .
On the contrary , he thought that work was the only lasting measure of a man .
As he put it , whatever insight , ingenuity and energy a man had in him “ will lie written in the work he does ” .
And the “ only happiness a brave man ever troubled himself with asking much about was , happiness enough to get his work done . ”
Economics , on the whole , disagrees .
It thinks of labour as a chore .
People sell it , at the expense of their leisure time , purely as a means to the end of consumption .
Indeed , Carlyle first anointed economics the “ dismal science ” because liberal economists insisted that American slaves be free to sell their labour in the marketplace like everyone else .
For many people , work is — as traditional economics assumes — just a way to pay the rent .
But Carlyle is not the only one to see it as much more than that .
In a string of experiments , Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi , of Claremont Graduate University , has handed out pagers to thousands of people who agreed to log their mood whenever prompted to do so .
People were , unsurprisingly , at their happiest when eating , carousing or pottering around the garden .
But some fortunate people also found deep satisfaction from losing themselves in their work : “ forgetting themselves in a function ” , as W.H. Auden put it .
It is easier to forget yourself in some functions than in others , of course .
In Auden 's poem , surgeons manage it “ making a primary incision ” , as do cooks , mixing their sauce , and clerks “ completing a bill of lading ” .
This happy state , which Mr Csikszentmihalyi calls “ flow ” , arises most often in work that stretches a person without defeating him ; work that provides “ clear goals ” , “ unambiguous feedback ” and a “ sense of control ” .
Where these things are lacking , people can sometimes sculpt their jobs to compensate .
For example , Amy Wrzesniewski , of New York University , and her colleagues found hospital cleaners who would hold patients ' hands and keep them company , brightening their day as well as scrubbing their rooms .
Other researchers noted that hairdressers see themselves as more than just scissors for hire .
They serve as emotional confidants for clients they like , and “ fire ” clients they do n't .
Mr Csikszentmihalyi is now one of three scholars behind the “ Good Work ” project , which aims to make “ flow ” a more common experience in professional life .
The project frets about how to square the “ competing demands of excellence , ethics , and earnings ” .
In some fields of endeavour , such as genetic research , it found that good work was rewarded with professional success ; but in others , professional pride and corporate profit seemed to tug in opposite directions .
Journalism , apparently , is a “ prototypically misaligned profession ” , staffed by reporters who want to investigate great affairs of state but read by a public more interested in stories that are “ scandalous , sensational , superficial ” .
Some fortunate people also found deep satisfaction from losing themselves in their work
What to do ?
The Good Work project tends to blame the “ market ” for corrupting craftsmanship .
But consumers cannot be made to want what producers care to make .
Besides , “ it is a thrill unique to a market society to find that people are willing to pay for one 's product , ” writes Deirdre McCloskey in her latest book , “ The Bourgeois Virtues ” .
Payment is a form of applause ; all the more convincing because it is costly .
Furthermore , when you spend what you have earned in the market , you can enjoy knowing that you have “ pulled your own weight ” , taking from the national product no more than you have added to it .
If people are determined to pursue their calling rather than simply taking a job , some professions ( surgery , cookery , genetics ) may become overcrowded , others undersubscribed .
But when a job cannot find enough takers , the market finds ways to ennoble it : first pay , and then status , begin to rise .
It becomes economical to automate some aspects of the work , employing machines to do the deadening humdrum toil that men and women are no longer willing to put up with .
What remains of the job will be the bits only people can do : tasks that require insight , ingenuity and the human touch .
Ms McCloskey recalls the Cincinnati sewerman , interviewed a few years ago on National Public Radio , who earned $ 60,000 a year and liked to tell girls he was an “ environmental ” worker .
The dismal sage
Did Thomas
Carlyle ever make his peace with the dismal science ?
Even his admirers admit that his “ bigoted dislike of Political Economists withheld him from studying their works ” or appreciating their advances .
Nor did he soften much in his disdain for the fruits of commercial society : cheaper cotton and swifter railways meant nothing to him ; and in his opinion , advertising , or “ puffing ” as he called it , deserved to be taxed out of existence .
But as any economist could have pointed out , he had a lot to thank commercial society for .
Having discovered his vocation as a cultural muckraker , he eventually secured an audience , a market and even the offer ( which was refused ) of Westminster Abbey as a final resting place .
In periods of speedy progress , it seems , stubborn reactionaries at least enjoy a certain scarcity value .
Green Mountain Daily — Peter Shumlin is waiting to hear from you .
Last week , with great flair and impressive gravitas , Senate President pro-temp Shumlin said that if he recieved an impeachment resolution , he would see that it moved through the Senate .
But it turns out that he was only talking about the impeachment resolution that he knows will never get out of Gaye Symington ’s House .
Senator Jeanette
White has gotten an impeachment resolution drafted by the legislative counsel and would like to introduce it into the Senate .
But Shumlin says that he wo n’t let it happen .
Did he talk the good talk about the Constitution and the rule of law because he believes in them , or because he saw an opportunity to curry favor without having to actually do anything ?
Let ’s let him know that we ’re sure that he ’s a man of principle who can be taken at his word .
Let ’s all give him a call this weekend and remind him of his promise .
Mr. Shumlin , we are drowning in cynicism , make us proud .

If you ’ve been reading my blog you know that a couple of weeks back I got involved with the Technorati Favorites Exchange meme .
I thought it would be an interesting experiment in networking and traffic building .
And getting into the Technorati Favorites Top 100 seemed possible .
So I did it .
I spent a good part of a couple of days adding blogs to my Technorati Faves and then visiting their blogs and commenting so that they would know I added them and then would add me .
Soon , I was faved by almost 200 bloggers and climbed to number 87 on the Top 100 list .
A little more effort and I could have climbed another 20 - 30 slots ( I ’m about to drop off the list ) .
Overall , I ’ve made the statement that I thought the meme was a waste of time – my time and the time of the people who read my blog .
To you who read my blog regularly , once more , I ’m sorry to have wasted your time .
Please keep reading because I hope to turn this into a positive .
Did I gain from the meme ?
Sure I did – a bit of traffic and some readers .
I ’m happy about gaining the readers .
Am I disgruntled at the results , as Richard Cunningham suggests ?
No .
Not at all , actually .
Do I think bloggers should meme - link ?
Yes , I do actually .
First , however , I feel it ’s important to be clear what we ’re aiming for .
This is the point I feel is being missed … participating in memes should be something you do to serve your core blogging goal .
Let ’s face it , memes are going to increase your reach , land you more traffic and potentially grow your readership .
No question about it .
And if constantly increasing reach , traffic and readership is the core goal of your blog , great – do every meme that comes your way .
Personally , I have no problem with it , if that ’s your goal .
But what if your goal is great content , engaging conversation and building relationships with your readers ?
Then does meme - linking serve your existing readers ?
Maybe , but maybe not .
That ’s what ’s being missed by some of the comments I ’ve seen around the Technorati Faves Exchange .
For instance , Gary Lee suggested , “ I think it would be fair to mention how many backlinks you have also received from this meme just to show that their have been some benefits . ”
Likewise , Maki ’s take was , “ The fact that you 've received 69 comments in the previous post is also not a waste of time . ”
Both great points .
But , they ’re missing my point – the meme does n’t serve my blogging goal – which is to create great content , engaging conversation and build relationships .
Sure , it increases my traffic which may allow me some new readers .
But it does so at the expense of my current readers .
And since no where in my blogging goals do I mention getting new readers and increasing my traffic , I simply do n’t feel that these types of meme - links are valuable for my blog .
It seems , instead that I ’m sacrificing my current readers to reach new ones .
And I do n’t think that ’s necessary .
Of course , Maki ’s point is a bit off in that only 1 of those 69 comments was to engage me in a conversation .
The rest were just link hunters .
That ’s fine , I participated in the meme and expected that .
But it is n’t the type of commenting I ’m looking for .
I ’m looking for commenting that lead to rich conversation – such as in these three posts .
Mark Goodyear gets it with his comments , “ Memes are fun , but typically they distract a blog from its thematic purpose ” and “ the best inbound links come from a carefully targeted market . ”
As does thepaperbull with his comment , “ I wanted to know how many people favorited me because they valued my site / content . ”
And Ruhuel added in his comments , “ I too prefer consistent traffic over superficial traffic . ”
All of them speak closer to what I feel is being missed in all this –
The most useful memes are those that benefit everyone involved and your readers first .
Memes aimed at just increasing links and traffic simply do n’t add value to my readers .
So I ’m not going to participate in them any longer .
Memes , however , that do add value by being content focused – such as Ben Yoskovitz 's Ultimate Guide to Productivity and Mohit Singhania 's Be Original Project – I will continue to participate in – and have ( respectively ) .
So Doris , gilda*su , and Ari , when you asked me about gaining new readers – of course I ’m grateful .
Not for the traffic nor the favorite links .
What I ’m grateful for is you – you as a reader and a commenter .
As you can see from this post , I care deeply for the people who take the time to read my blog .
And for those who comment and engage in the conversation .
That ’s why I put so much of time and all of myself into it .
And that ’s why I do n’t want to waste your time with writing about memes that are just about building my traffic .
You deserve quality content from me , instead .
And I trust in you that if you find value in my blog , you ’ll not only continue to read , but you ’ll get my feed , you ’ll link to me from your blog and you ’ll share my blog with others .
That ’s how I ’ve built my traffic so far .
No tricks .
And I love the results .
Are there faster ways ?
Sure .
I could do a lot to grow my traffic in ways that are n’t about my readers and my content .
But I wo n’t do that – at least not any more .
My blog goal is about creating conversation and building relationship and that ’s what I ’ll focus on .
Your thoughts ?
We 've shown you some kind - of - mean anti-squirrel apparatuses in the past , but this one takes it to the next level .
Animal rights people , do n't bitch at us , we did n't do it , we just laughed at it .
A lot .

As you can see , there 's a rope that attaches to the colander and is slipped under the door .
The mouthbreathers that perpetrated this stunt let it go when the squirrel got on board , sending him flying .
Obviously you should n't try this at home , although we 've seen enough squirrels fall out of trees and such that we 're confident this guy probably got away alright .
Reaction from the family , after the jump .

SAN JOSE --
Those standing in line around the Bay Area to be among the first to spring for a new iPhone should n't feel bad :
Even the cofounder of Apple was queued up .
Steve Wozniak arrived at the Apple store at Valley Fair Mall in San Jose at 4 a .m. to begin the wait wearing a button that read , " The line starts here .
Woz # 1 . "
In fact , he had n't been the first to show up but in deference , Apple fans stepped aside to give him the first space .
" This has been the main mall my whole life , " Wozniak said , explaining his choice of venue .
" This is where I and Steve Jobs came when we were kids . "
When the Apple store closed at 2 p.m. to prepare for the 6 p.m. onslaught of business , 200 people stood behind Wozniak .
Why did they bother , when Apple is offering to ship its new product at no extra cost ?
" Yeah , you can order a CD online , too -- or you can go to the concert and hear it live , " Wozniak said .
Over in Emeryville , more than 150 iPhone devotees had lined up outside the Apple store , many chatting , tapping away on Apple laptops or grooving to music on iPods .
The Apple store provided free WiFi , and Bay Street shopping mall let people power up electronic devices from nearby poles while they waited .
First in the line of loungers was Jiggs Davis Jr. , a 73 - year - old biotech entrepreneur from Piedmont , who was accompanied by one of his employees , project manager Chi Pak , 24 .
Davis , wearing a red American flag ball cap to shield the sun , said he 's been an Apple fan since the company 's inception .
His own Alameda company is outfitted with all Apple products .
He appreciates their simplicity , he said .
He nabbed the first spot in line by arriving at 4:45 a.m. and was passing the time working on his Powerbook G4 .
He will be happy , he said , to replace the Cingular Treo hooked to his belt with the new iPhone .
Sitting next to them was Saul Sutcher , an 18 - year - old Occidental college student , a self - proclaimed Apple fan since birth who owns several iPods , a few laptops and could n't wait to add the iPhone to his collection .
He was keeping busy organizing his music and photos so they'd be ready to load onto his new accessory .
His family dropped by from time to time to drop off blankets , food and electronics .
Next to Sutcher was Rick Shibata , a 36 - year - old information technology manager for a Richmond freight company , who was wearing a MacWorld T - shirt .
He gave up a good - paying consulting gig , he said , to wait in line for an iPhone .
The Apple fan , who has attended every MacWorld convention for the past eight years and catches all the Steve Jobs keynotes on the Web , said he could n't wait to replace his Motorola Razr cell phone .
" I just love their user interface , and their design is top - notch , " he said .
All four got to the Emeryville store so early , they helped set up the barricades through which the line snaked this afternoon .
At the end of the line was the most recent arrival : Kyle Killion , 29 , of Oakland , who co-founded JamLab , a Web site for musicians .
He had to work , he said , so he got there about 1 p.m .
He got hooked on the new product when he got a chance to play with it for a few minutes at the Apple developer conference .
Killion , who calls himself an " Apple whore " and planned to purchase two iPhones , said that he did n't like the company when Jobs was n't at the helm .
" It 's possible to love a product and hate a company , " he said , adding that he does n't like how Apple treats its developers .
Across the street and down a block , a much smaller line of about 20 people -- including a baby in a stroller -- formed outside the Cingular store .
Limit for customers there is one phone per person .
That 's OK with Angelica Contreras , 20 , a college student from San Pablo , and her boyfriend of six years , Owen Perez , 22 , who arrived at 9 a.m. and jumped to the head of the Cingular line rather than wait in the already long line in front of the Apple store .
They had heard rumors that the Apple store would be giving away T - shirts , but they did n't care .
They just want one phone for Contreras , who has been pining for the product for six months and can't wait to play with its touch screen .
She has had it with her Razr phone .
" Everybody has it , " she said .
" I want something else , something better . "
So what does Perez , a Merritt College psychology major , think ?
He laughed .
" I 'm not getting one .
But she wanted one bad . "
In San Francisco , about 200 hopeful consumers had queued up by 3 p.m .
Some had been on - hand the previous evening , when an unknown benefactor delivered pizza , and a local company handed out chocolate .
Those in line had plenty of time to spread rumors .
A bearded man at the end of the San Francisco line this morning , who would only identify himself as Ray , insisted that the store " only had 600 phones . "
Where did he hear that ?
" From the media , man , " Ray said .
Actually there have been no reports of how many will be available .
However , postings on the Apple Web site remind potential buyers that they can order online , have a phone shipped to them and not even pay a delivery charge .
That may be keeping the lines in check .
Or , like San Francisco Art Institute student Chris Silva , they may just think " the whole thing is totally over - hyped . "
Silva , number five in line at Walnut Creek , has no interest in buying an iPhone himself -- he 's earning $ 100 for every 24 hours he stands in line .
But his guess is the buyer who 's paying him did n't have to bother .
" Just wait , " Silva says .
" At 8 o'clock tonight you 'll be able to walk right in and buy a phone . "

According to Illinois Rising Action , last week , Democrat Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons mailed hundreds of voters a voting notice letter that listed the wrong address for their Election Day polling location .
According to news reports , the incorrect polling address listed on the letter directed voters to an individual ’s home instead of the correct location , the East Bend Township Building .
Clerk Ammons dismissed this critical error and offered no explanation other than he is “ taking the necessary steps to clarify the issue . ”
With only five weeks to go until election day , his response to the latest mistake in the run-up to the November election is unacceptable and demonstrates his complete disregard for the seriousness of his responsibility to oversee an election with integrity .
Ammons must be transparent with the people of Champaign County on the specific actions he is taking to remedy this situation and properly notify voters of their correct voting locations .
Ammons must calm the public ’s concerns by answering questions surrounding his latest mistake in the run-up to the November election :
How many voters received a voting notice letter with the wrong address listed ?
What specific actions is your office taking to correct this mistake and ensure these voters are notified of their correct voting location address ?
“ Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons must be open and transparent and address the questions surrounding this mistake immediately ” , said Kayleen Carlson , executive director of Illinois Rising Action .
“ With just five weeks to go until the election , failing to correct this critical error will put the validity of the November elections at risk . ”
This is not the first time Champaign County Clerk Ammons has been at the center of controversy surrounding an election .
Following the March 17 , 2020 primary election , it was discovered Clerk Ammons was illegally counting ballots before the primary Election Day .
It was also discovered that Ammons ’s office sent duplicative ballots to voters prior to the March primary .
In addition to the controversies surrounding the primary election , just last month Ammons ’s office mailed Vote By Mail applications that included an error in the return address zip code on the application that could result in delivery delays of an application for a voter .

1 ) A bedroom by any other name ..... Just tell me how many goddamn bedrooms there are in the apartment .
Perhaps the very definition of bedroom is in question so let 's get down to brass tacks .
A bedroom , I think we can all agree , is a space large enough to fit a bed .
To be called a bedroom in an ad , it must be a room with a door that separates it from all the other rooms .
It must not contain the front door to the apartment .
Any room that does not meet these three criteria is not a bedroom .
When it comes to bedrooms , please do not round up to the nearest number .
A two bedroom with a strange space between the kitchen and the living room is not a three bedroom .
2 ) I know how many bedrooms I needIf I am in the market for a three - bedroom , do n't show me two - bedrooms .
One of my roommates is not going to evaporate into thin air just because the apartment has really great light or high ceilings .
If we are in the market for a $ 3000 three - bedroom , a $ 3000 two - bedroom is not just as good .
It is 1.5 times too expensive for two of us , and pretty much useless for the third .
3 ) Albany , NY is not on the Upper East Side .
Let 's talk about neighborhoods .
Perhaps you are hoping to prey on the uninitiated , but your number is up .
You can't play that " Upper East Side / Upper West Side " game with us !
We all know that 119th St. and 2nd Ave. is different than 79th St. and 2nd Ave .
Same goes for the West Side .
181st and Broadway -- not the same as 81st and Broadway .
Some of us want to live at each of these four addresses , so why not save us all time and call a spade a spade ?
Even if you happen to lure an unsuspecting newcomer with promises of " The Upper East Side , " what happens when they get off the 6 at 110th St. to come see the place ?
Will you blindfold them and lead them to the " Fabulous Upper East Side Steal -- Must See " ?
4 ) Pictures of New York landmarks will not interest me in an apartment .
I know that New York City contains BOTH Central Park and the Empire State Building .
I know it is an exciting city that looks great at night .
I mean , for Chrissakes , I live here !
When I see the little orange " pic " next to a listing , what I want to see is a picture of .... the apartment .
Today I opened up just such an ad to find .... a picture of the castle in Central Park .
Is there an apartment in there for rent ?
Please , for the love of all that is good , tell me :
What were you thinking ?!
And while we 're at it :5 ) Hallways are not enticing .
Neither are bathrooms .
A single picture of a really long hallway is NOT going to make me drop everything and ride the train to its farthest stop .
Dark hallways -- even worse .
Long hallways say : the rooms in this apartment are small and poorly laid - out .
Then there are the ads with a single picture of the bathroom .
Bathroom pictures say : this apartment is so ugly , the bathroom is the only room I felt I could publicly post .
Do you know anyone who moved into a shithole because the bathroom fixtures were newly installed ?
Ok .
No hallways .
No bathrooms .
Finally : 6 ) &&&&&&& &
<<<<<<< ******* >>>>>>>> %%%%%%%%
Get it ?
Wait , you do n't understand ?
That 's because these characters do not transmit information .
Why do you waste your title field with them ?
Actually , they do transmit information .
They say :
This broker is not smart or classy .
All I 'm asking for , really , is : Price .
Number of bedrooms .
Accurate neighborhood listing and / or subway stop that is nearest by foot or ( shudder ) bus .
What it comes down to is :
We know what we want .
We know what we need .
We 're not idiots .
Just show us apartments and take our 10 % , 15 % , even 17 % brokers fees with a graceful smile .
Please .
Thanks !
You own your life .
You own the fruits of your labor .
You decide .
Several years ago in a far off land I was a computer science student .
One of my classes was comprised of little more than counting adding subtracting , living , binary numbers .
This machine would have been great to have , not just because it is sweet ( it is ) but because it would have given me something to do while I let my brain recover from all those ones and zeros .
Also if the world were to end , and the few humans to survive could n’t get windows to boot , they could start the great task of building a grand wooden computer .
I do n’t know why , just because they could ( is n’t that why we do anything ? ) .

Unless we change direction , we are likely to end up where we are headed .
- Chinese proverb
President Bush first announced the so - called Surge Plan back in January .
Five months later , it appears that , once again , military planning by American forces in Iraq has come up wanting :
BAGHDAD , June 3 â € ”
Three months after the start of the Baghdad security plan that has added thousands of American and Iraqi troops to the capital , they control fewer than one - third of the cityâ€™s neighborhoods , far short of the initial goal for the operation , according to some commanders and an internal military assessment .
The American assessment , completed in late May , found that American and Iraqi forces were able to â€œprotect the populationâ€  and â€œmaintain physical influence overâ€ only 146 of the 457 Baghdad neighborhoods .
In the remaining 311 neighborhoods , troops have either not begun operations aimed at rooting out insurgents or still face â€œresistance , â€ according to the one - page assessment , which was provided to The New York Times and summarized reports from brigade and battalion commanders in Baghdad .
(…)
The operation â€œis at a difficult point right now , to be sure , â€ said Brig .
Gen. Vincent K. Brooks , the deputy commander of the First Cavalry Division , which has responsibility for Baghdad .
In an interview , he said that while military planners had expected to make greater gains by now , that has not been possible in large part because Iraqi police and army units , which were expected to handle basic security tasks , like manning checkpoints and conducting patrols , have not provided all the forces promised , and in some cases have performed poorly .

Breast cancer cases have hit " frightening " levels and our modern lifestyle and prosperity may be to blame .
Figures today show an 80 per cent increase since 1971 with one in nine women now developing the disease .
Factors leading to the rise include obesity , smaller family size , less breastfeeding as more women go out to work , earlier periods and later menopause .
Increasing use of HRT and growing alcohol consumption are also cited .
The Pill has been linked to some cases but its use cannot account for the startling increase .
Professor Sir Richard Peto said : " Breast cancer is roughly a disease of prosperity . "
The charity Breast Cancer UK is demanding action to halt the rise .
" We believe women have a right to know these frightening statistics and should be asking the Government what it is doing to tackle the causes and prevention of the disease , " said a spokeswoman .
A total of 36,939 women were diagnosed in England in 2004 , an 81 per cent increase in incidence of the cancer since 1971 , after statistical adjustment for the ageing of the population .
Over the year , 41,000 cases were diagnosed in the UK .
Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in the UK , even though it principally affects only women .
There are a few hundred cases each year in men .
The age - standardised incidence in 2004 was 120.8 per 100,000 population , the highest figure on record , up from 66.9 in 1971 .
The figures are in Cancer Registrations , the annual statistical report issued by the Office for National Statistics .
Cancer is usually a disease of the elderly and older age groups .
But breast cancer is increasing in every age group .
Among those aged 20 to 34 , the disease , though rare , increased by 50 per cent in the three decades from 1971 to 2001 .
In the 45 to 49 age group it rose by 41 per cent over the same period .
The biggest increases have been in the 50 to 64 age group , in which the incidence has more than doubled after introduction of breast - screening which detects tumours too small to be picked up by a doctor in a clinical examination .
Professor Peto , Britain 's foremost cancer epidemiologist , of Oxford University , said : " There has been a slow drift upwards since the 1950s , basically due to society becoming more prosperous .
Breast cancer is roughly a disease of prosperity .
" The rise was much more rapid in Spain because their rate of [ social ] progress was quicker . "
He added : " Having fewer children before the age of 30 , early first periods , late menopause and being obese or overweight after menopause are all factors behind the increase . "
Ruth Yates , at Cancer Research UK , said it was difficult to offer advice to women on how to avoid the disease because there are so many factors .
She said there was not just one thing women can do although not smoking , better diet and drinking less will have an impact .
Volkswagen Touareg successfully tows a Boeing 747
News , Volkswagen

A Volkswagen Touareg V10 TDI has succeeded in towing a Boeing 747-200 weighing approximately 155 tonnes .
Watched by engineers , Volkswagen personnel and bemused passers - by , the Touareg V10 TDI completed seven complete runs on the auxiliary runway at Dunsfold Aerodrome , 40 miles south west of London .
The vehicle was a standard production Touareg fitted with a special towing adaptor to connect it with the aircraft towing link and loaded with 4.3 tonnes of metal ballast to bring its total weight to just over seven tonnes ( 7,030 kg ) including the driver , an engineer from the technical department at the company ’s headquarters in Germany .
The car ’s engine , self - levelling air suspension , wheels , tyres and structure were all standard .
One precaution that turned out to be unnecessary was the fitment of the 4.56 axle ratio from the Touareg V8 model in place of the 3.27 gearing of the V10 .
This was established as the demonstration was conducted in the second of the Touareg ’s 12 forward gears rather than first .
The final modification was to change the outer body panels for photographic purposes so that this example was visually the same as the next generation Touareg which is due to be launched next year .
The attempt was designed to demonstrate the reserves of strength and durability of the Touareg V10 TDI .
This model won
The Caravan Club Towcar of the Year Awards full - size 4x4 category in 2004 and 2005 and has established itself as the benchmark diesel SUV , offering an extraordinary combination of performance and fuel efficiency since it was launched in 2003 .
A theoretical towing capability in excess of 200 tonnes was calculated by multiplying the 553 lbs ft of torque generated by the V10 TDI engine through the standard transmission ’s lowest ratio and without taking into account the torque multiplication benefits of the torque converter .
This however assumed a dry surface and loading the Touareg ’s body and suspension well in excess of its rated limits .

An initial trial was carried out successfully in Germany with an operational Boeing 747-400 weighing 190 tonnes but it subsequently became difficult to obtain an aircraft for the length of time and in an appropriate location to conduct a press demonstration .
Colleagues therefore requested Volkswagen UK to obtain a suitable aircraft and location .
The result was an ex-British Airways Boeing 747-200 weighing 155 tonnes .
The aircraft , first flown in 1980 and retired last year retains its full complement of 500 seats , 11 toilets and complete landing gear , albeit without an operating braking system .
The original engines were removed last year to make way for dummy items used in the filming of a recent motion picture .
Despite this , the aircraft still weighs 155 tonnes , due in part to the 28 tonnes of water held on board in the fuel and nose tanks .
The changes to the Touareg are more modest .
Modifications extend to the addition of 4,345 kg of ballast in the form of steel plates set behind the front bumper and beneath the engine .
The balance of the ballast was made up by bags of steel balls weighing 25 kg each .
The result is a split of 2,755 kg over the front axle and 4,275 kg over the rear to bring the total to 7,030 kg which includes Uwe Krieghoff , the nervous driver .
He was not prepared to say how much his body contributed to the 7,030 kg total .
Conditions for the attempt were far from perfect .
A strong headwind combined with torrential rain and resulting standing water prompted concerns over traction on the wet surface .
Despite the scale of the attempt the vehicle needed little preparation .
The engine was warmed up before a brief visual inspection of the tyres prior to the attempt being given the green light .
The Touareg ’s standard towbar ( fitted with an adapted towing bracket ) was hooked up to the nose wheel collar of a Boeing 747 and the chocks were removed .
At the wheel Uwe selected ‘ drive ’ and the low ratio , second gear setting on the Touareg ’s six - speed gearbox .
The required tractive effort is at its highest during the initial pull to overcome the static friction of the aircraft tyres on the runway .
Flatspots form on the aircraft ’s 18 tyres under the 155 tonnes of weight and additional resistance must be overcome to get the aircraft rolling .
Uwe pressed the accelerator around halfway down in second gear before easing off as the aircraft gained momentum .
With no visible loss of traction the Touareg began dragging the 231 ft airframe of the 747 along the runway , maintaining an even five mph in the process .
Having covered an estimated 150 metres the driver eased back on the throttle before slowly engaging the Touareg ’s brakes to slow both the vehicle and the aircraft to a stop .
After the attempt Uwe commented : ‘ I was a bit disappointed we could n’t find something heavier to tow as it was a bit too easy !
If anyone could lend us a heavier aircraft then please let us know . ’
The vehicle was checked after the repeated runs and no side effects of the demands made on the engine and transmission could be found .
The engine temperature remained normal , as did the transmission and the tyres survived without a hint of the forces passed through them .

At certain latitudes , midwinter becomes all about perspective .
Snow can be a hazard to driving , a ticket to slide , or one of nature 's nicer decorative touches .
But the white stuff can also be seen as building material .
And you do n't have to be 10 years old and thinking " snow fort . "
Quinzees - hollowed - out mounds of snow , igloos without the blocks - were once widely used by Chipewyan hunters who had strayed far from their winter lodges in subarctic Canada .
Today they 're favored by intrepid wilderness campers who like working with natural resources - and who understand the insulating properties of snow .
Scout troops and high schools from Maine to Michigan turn the building of these short - term shelters into learning experiences .
Dogs have been known to inhabit the snow huts with glee .
Quinzees also have backyard - recreation potential .
The experience is something like sand - castle building .
Key difference :
You get to go inside and hang out .
Gordon Baker once slept in a quinzee in temperatures of 25 degrees F. below zero .
He and two friends lounged inside with a candle for light and felt comfortable wearing T - shirts .
" If you have a shovel , a couple of friends with shovels , and a few sticks , you can make a big pile of snow and have a house in two hours , " says Mr. Baker , a guide with Algonquin Outfitters in Oxtongue Lake , Ontario .
Algonquin will host its annual Winter Activities Day - including quinzee - building - next month .
There is science at play in the creation of these dark and dead - quiet domes .
Many quinzee - builders " mulch " snow by trampling it before they begin their mounds , packing as they pile .
Heat from the pressure changes the snow crystals ' structure , Baker says , and has a binding effect .
Snow should set - an hour at least - before digging begins .
Sticks should be slid in from the outside to help a digger know when a consistent wall thickness of six inches or so is achieved .
Size is a function of a digger 's ambition .
A team of about 10 students built a " super quinzee " a couple of years ago , says Jason Carter , a biology teacher at Houghton High School in Michigan , which holds an annual Quinzee Day in February to give 10th - graders a taste of winter - survival tactics .
" They were able to fit the whole class of 100 in it , " says Mr. Carter , still incredulous .
" They worked furiously all day , and they all squeezed in . "
Carter says the school learned a valuable lesson when the tradition began a decade ago .
It held the event one year on the same day as a volleyball game .
" The girls that participated were just wiped out , " he recalls .
" They lost their game .
So [ since then ] we 've always moved it to a day when there are no athletics going on . "
Veterans recommend tricks to reduce the rigorous work .
Piling snow on top of waterproof duffel bags or even garbage cans can speed hollowing - pull them out through a hole in the side of the quinzee and they leave a cavity .
That tactic has drawbacks .
A Boy Scout troop from Honeoye Falls , N.Y. , describes in a 2003 weblog entry having buried backpacks and a big garbage can too deep in a mound , a move that " sounded good in the planning stage " but that led to a long and difficult extraction - made more urgent because several campers had left their lunches in their backpacks .
Left to harden , a good quinzee can last .
Baker has seen them hold up for a month or longer before falling to the elements .
" You probably would n't want to have to depend on one for your shelter , because you 're never sure you 're going to have enough snow , " he says .
" [ People ] build them because it 's fun .
It warms you up , and it 's something to do . "
How to build your own snow hut
Go ahead , make a dome of your own .
The following advice is distilled from builders and first - hand experience .
The Monitor accepts no responsibility for snow down your back - or any other mishaps .
It 's wet work .
Mulch the snow by stomping out your site .
Circle your growing pile , adding shovels - full , lightly packing .
Leave a five - or six - foot pile ( 10 feet across ) to set for a couple of hours .
Poke several small sticks in the top and sides of the mound , about six - to eight - inches deep .
Dig from the side near the bottom - in and then up , to minimize cold - air flow .
Hollow until you hit the stick ends , and have a friend near the entrance keeping it clear .
Smooth the interior walls .
Create one or more three - inch ventilation holes in the dome .
( In an oversized quinzee , a larger side chimney for a very small and inefficient twig fire is possible but discouraged because of the possibility of smoke buildup . )
Place a tarp on the quinzee floor ( optional ) and whistle for the dog - or the kids , who are by now inside watching Nickelodeon .

Introduction
I have taken a lot of pictures over the years , and like many photographers , I am proud of my work and want to display my favorites on the walls of my home .
Framing costs and available wall space limit the number of photos that I can display at any given time , however , and inertia limits the number of times I change my display prints .
Recently , I started investigating digital frames as a possible solution to my problem .
Most of the commercially available digital frames do n’t really meet my needs .
They have small ( 5 ” to 7 ” ) screens , and are designed to sit on desk tops .
Most of them are not matted , and the frames are plastic , metal or simulated wood .
They range in price from about $ 100 to $ 300 ( US ) .
I also found a couple of large screen digital frames available online , but they are quite expensive ( $ 800 to $ 1200 ) for basic frame and matte combinations .
A quick search of the web turned up several do - it - yourself articles by photographers that had built their own digital frames – typically from discarded laptops .
The laptop based digital frames have larger screens ( 10 ” to 15 ” ) , and tend to be reasonably inexpensive to build ( provided you own a discarded laptop ) .
The laptop projects that I saw had a couple of common issues , however .
All of them involved taking the laptop apart completely and generally rendering it useless for any other activity .
The screens were also smaller than I wanted – equivalent to an 8 ” x12 ” photo , and varied considerably in contrast , brightness , and general image quality .
For my project , I wanted a desktop quality LCD screen of a size equivalent to an 11” x14 ” photograph .
I also wanted professional quality matting and framing .
My wife was skeptical about the project , and I knew that if the frame did not look great , it would be banished to the family room , instead of being mounted in a place of honor in the living room .
I had recently upgraded my 17 ” LCD desktop monitor , and I also had a discarded laptop .
I decided to use these as the base components for my digital frame .
My plan to use a full size desktop LCD monitor had several design issues that I needed to resolve :
A desktop monitor is heavy – 10 + lbs and a laptop also weighs several pounds .
The monitor would need to be mounted in the center of the frame , far enough from the sides to allow for a decent width of matte ( 3 ” at least on all sides ) .
Obviously the frame was going to require internal bracing of some kind .
A LCD monitor is thick – at least 2 ½ ” – and that does not include the laptop .
I knew that a 5 ” thick digital frame was never going to pass my wife ’s living room test , so I decided to separate the monitor from the laptop , and to connect them with an extended VGA cable .
Power and cabling : A laptop and an LCD monitor require 2 electrical outlets , and a VGA cable to connect them , but exposed cabling was out of the question .
Running cables through the inside of a wall vertically is relatively straight forward ( gravity does most of the work ) , but running them laterally through wall studs is complicated and messy .
I decided to place the frame directly above our piano , so that I could conceal the laptop behind the piano .
This would allow me to do only vertical cable fishing .
Controlling and configuring the device :
Most of the laptop designs that I saw did not have great control systems .
Typically , the laptops were disassembled , and had peripherals removed to reduce weight .
Many had the keyboard mounted backwards behind the screen – not the most user friendly configuration .
With my design , the laptop remains intact , and so easily supports installing new software , patching the operating system , adding photos to the unit , and changing the slideshow .
Because the laptop is concealed , however , it is still awkward to work with .
I decided that controlling the laptop wirelessly from my desktop PC would be the final configuration .
There are many ways to build a digital frame , and my design is only one of them .
If you plan to build your own frame using these instructions , you will probably need to improvise from time to time .
If my instructions look wrong for your situation , they probably are .
Please measure carefully and use your own discretion when following these , or any other do - it - yourself instructions .
Step 1 : Removing the LCD Panel from the Monitor Case .
a) Lie the LCD monitor face down on a soft towel .
LCD screens scratch easily , so be careful not to touch the front of the LCD panel with your fingers or tools .
b) Remove the stand from the monitor case .
Usually this is attached to the back of the case with 4 screws .
c ) Remove the screws that hold the 2 halves of the case together .
These are usually 2 or 4 of these screws , typically located in the corners of the case .
d ) Try to lift the rear half of the case away , but do not force it .
Most LCD cases have internal catches that hold them together .
Insert a small flat tool into the crack between the 2 halves of the case .
A small screwdriver or any flat plastic item such as a guitar pick will do the job .
You should not need to insert the tool into the cap more than half an inch .
Gently slide the tool in the crack the length of the monitor ’s side .
You will hear the catches releasing as you slide .
Repeat for all four sides of the monitor using the same technique .
Be careful when you are splitting the case near the external monitor control buttons , as there is wiring close to the monitor edge at this point .
When you have released all of the catches , the back of the case should lift away easily .
e ) Behind the external monitor control buttons , you will see a small circuit board that the buttons are attached to .
Remove the screws that connect this circuit board to the case , but do not remove the wires connecting the board to the LCD .
f ) Locate the four corner brackets that attach the LCD panel to the front of the plastic case and remove the screws .
g ) Do not remove any screws connecting the LCD panel to the internal circuit boards or control systems .
h ) Lift the LCD panel away from the front of the case .
If it does not separate easily , stop and look for any other connecting screws or wires .
Place the panel face up on your work surface .
Step 2 : Matting the LCD
a ) Locate the corner brackets shown in Figures 4 and 5 .
These are the same brackets that used to attach the LCD to the front of the case .
Notice that the fronts of the brackets are set back from the front of the LCD screen .
Carefully measure this setback distance and write it down .
For my monitor , it was ¾ ” from the front of the LCD panel to the front of the brackets .
This will be the thickness of the internal bracing required for the frame ( as shown in Figure 9 ) .
b ) Measure the visible dimensions of the LCD screen ( not counting the metal edges ) .
For my 17 ” LCD , the dimensions were 10.75 ” x 13.5 ” .
These are the dimensions of the matte cutout .
c ) Decide on the width of matte that you want .
I wanted approximately 3 ” of matte on each side , because this width gives the frame a nice “ gallery ” style look .
d) A 3 ” matte on my LCD required outside matte dimensions of 16.75 ” x 19.5 ” ( 3 ” + 10.75 ” + 3 ” = 16.5 ” and 3 ” + 13.5 ” + 3 ” = 19.5 ” ) .
The closest standard frame size to this is 16 ” x 20 ” .
A 16 ” x 20 ” frame and a 17 ” LCD monitor allows for a 3 ¼ ” matte on the left and right sides and a respectable 2 5/8 ” matte on the top and bottom .
e ) Select a neutral color for the matte , as there will be many different photos on display .
I chose white , because it matches other framed art in my living room .
f ) A properly cut matte board will make a huge difference in the appearance of the finished frame , and if you do not have the equipment and training to cut your own matte , I suggest having it done by a framing shop .
The outside dimension of the matte is the size of your frame , and the inner dimension ( cutout ) is the visible area of your LCD panel .
g ) The matte has to be exactly positioned on the LCD panel .
Place a couple of drops of crazy glue on the metal edge surrounding the LCD panel ( not on the screen itself ) and center the matte on the screen .
A couple of drops is plenty because the glue is only needed to keep the matte correctly positioned on the LCD – it does not support any weight .
Hold or clamp the matte in place until the glue dries .
Step 3 : Framing the LCD Panel
a ) I selected a frame with a profile that is both deep ( 1 ¼ ” ) and wide ( 1 ¼ ” ) .
Note that the frame is not deep enough to completely conceal the thickness of the LCD panel ( 2 ½ ” )
More about this later .
b) Remove and discard the glass ( if any ) from the frame .
Place the matted LCD face down in the frame .
Be sure that the monitor control circuit board and wiring remains accessible .
c ) We need to secure the matted LCD in the frame with additional bracing .
Remember the measurement of the setback from Step 2a ?
In my case , that measurement was ¾ ” which allowed me to use standard 1 ” x 1 ” wood trim ( Note : the actual size of 1 ” x 1 ” trim is ¾ ” x ¾ ” ) .
Your measurement may require different size trim .
Cut 2 lengths of the 1 ” x1 ” trim to fit the inner width of the frame – in my case 20 ” long .
d ) Mount 2 small angle brackets on each of the blocks as shown below .
e ) Slide the bracing between the matte and the LCD corner brackets .
Attach the bracing to the corner brackets with screws .
f ) Attach the bracing to the picture frame using the angle brackets .
Be sure to leave the monitor control button wires free from constraint by the bracing .
g ) At this point , you should be able to lift the frame and move it around .
The LCD panel and the matte board should remain firmly in place .
h ) You will notice that the depth of the frame does not conceal the entire depth of the LCD panel .
This is deliberate , as I felt that a 2 ½ ” deep frame was still too thick to look “ right ” on the wall .
To counter this , I bought a second very cheap black frame .
The second frame is considerably smaller than the primary frame , but deep enough to conceal the rest of the LCD .
This creates the optical illusion that the entire unit is only the depth of the primary frame .
i ) Mounting the monitor controls .
In this design , the monitor controls ( Off / On , brightness , contrast etc. ) are attached to the secondary frame behind the bottom lip of the front frame .
Place the secondary frame on the back of the first frame , and position the control button circuit board where you would like it to be in the final configuration .
Carefully mark the spot on the secondary frame where the control wiring needs to pass through the frame in order to allow the circuit board to be mounted .
j ) Use a jigsaw to notch the secondary frame in the marked position .
Pass the wires through the notch , and attach the circuit board to the secondary frame using the original screw holes in the circuit board .
Use only very small crews that are smaller than the original holes , and do not over tighten the screws .
They are only to hold the board in place , and you do not want to risk cracking the circuit board .
k ) Using small angle brackets , attach the secondary frame to the back of the primary frame .
l ) The frame is now quite heavy .
I suggest using bolts through the sides of the secondary frame to attach the frame hanging hardware .
Step 4 : Wiring the frame
I suggest testing the system before going any further .
If something has gone wrong , you want to know it before punching holes in the walls .
Hook up the VGA cable to the laptop and plug it in .
This is also a very good time to install your control software ( see Step 5 ) .
It is much easier to work with the laptop before it is placed in its final concealed position .
a) Select the exact spot that the digital frame will hang on the wall , and mark the corners of the secondary frame with small pencil marks .
The hole that you cut in the wall for the cables must fall completely inside these marks in order to be concealed by the frame .
b ) Measure your LCD ’s power cord and VGA cable .
Measure the distance between the marks on the wall and where you will conceal the laptop .
Allow extra VGA cable length to allow you to work comfortably with the laptop once the frame has been mounted .
Are the cables long enough ?
The 6 foot VGA cable that I owned was not long enough – so I purchased a 15 foot VGA cable from the local computer store .
The LCD power cord only needs to be long enough to get through the wall cavity ( 5 to 6 feet ) , because it will not move once mounted , and an extension cord can be used to add extra length to reach the outlet if required .
c ) Lay the digital frame on its face , and connect the power and VGA cable to the back of the frame .
Hold the connected cables flat against the back of the frame and determine the exact position where the cabling will need to bend to enter the wall cavity .
This position must be completely behind the digital frame .
Mark the equivalent position on the wall , being sure that it falls within the pencil marks from step 4a .
d ) I wanted to make the smallest possible holes in the wall for the cabling , so I decided to use standard 2 ” cable grommets ( like you use to pass cabling through the top of a desk ) .
These are easily available from most hardware stores .
Make sure that the grommet is large enough to pass your VGA cable through .
I used 2 ” grommets .
e ) The packaging for the grommets will list the exact size of hole that needs to be cut .
Use a drywall saw to cut the hole in the position that you marked on the wall , in Step 4c , and insert the edge ring of the grommet .
This ring should neatly patch the ragged edge of the hole that you cut .
Remove the inner cap of the grommet until after you have completed fishing the cables .
f ) Cut a piece of string 8 to 10 feet in length and attach a metal washer to one end .
Hold the string in the center of the hole that you cut in the wall , and let the string with the washer attached hang on the outside of the wall so that the washer is suspended about 6 ” from the floor .
Mark the spot where the washer touches the wall , and cut a second grommet hole at that location .
Insert the grommet edge ring in the lower hole .
g ) Lower the metal washer into the inside of the wall through the upper hole .
Be very careful not to let go of the loose end of the string .
The washer and string should appear in the lower hole once it descends that far .
Fish the washer and the string out of the lower hole .
You should now have a piece of string extending the length of the inside of the wall , with one end peeking out of each grommet hole .
h ) Tape one end of your VGA cable to the end of the LCD power cable that attaches to the LCD panel .
Tie the taped ends of the cables to the string coming out of the lower grommet hole .
i ) Gradually pull the cables through the lower hole and out the upper hole by pulling on the string coming out of the upper hole .
Voila – your cables are now running through the wall .
j ) Insert the inner caps on the grommets for a nice finished look ( see Figure 16 ) .
k ) Connect the power and VGA cables to the back of the digital frame .
I suggest using a plastic zip tie to securely attach the cables to the back of the LCD panel .
The last thing that you want is the power cord disconnecting accidentally and disappearing into the wall cavity .
l ) Hang the frame on a picture hook attached directly to a wall stud .
I do not suggest using drywall anchors for something this heavy .
Feed any excess cabling into the wall .
Connect the lower end of the VGA cable to your laptop , and plug everything in behind the concealing furniture .
Slide the laptop into its hiding place .
Step 5 : Control Software
Slideshow Software :
There are many software packages available that can run a slideshow .
Your requirements may not be the same as mine – so be sure to check the internet to see what is available .
I used the free IrfanView photo viewing software for my slideshow .
It allows me to easily assemble slideshows and configure them to my tastes .
I loaded approximately 70 photos and configured the slideshow to change images at 5 minute intervals – giving me about a 6 hour slideshow .
I have configured Irfanview to suppress error messages , hide the cursor , randomize the order of the slides ( without repeats ) and hide photo file pathnames .
There are many other available options .
IrfanView can be configured to automatically resize photos to fit the screen resolution .
I really do n’t like to have my photos resized like that , so I always crop photos to the native 1280 x 1024 pixel resolution of the LCD monitor before including them in a slideshow .
Irfanview is available at : http://www.irfanview.com/.
Be sure to slip them a few bucks as a donation for using this excellent product .
Wireless Control :
One of my goals was to be able to control the laptop wirelessly from my desktop PC .
Fortunately , my laptop has a wireless card , so I simply added it to the Windows workgroup that my desktop PC belongs to .
This allows me to push photos to a shared folder on the laptop wirelessly from my desktop ( I can even save directly to the shared folder from PhotoShop ) .
I also wanted the ability to start and reconfigure the slideshow wirelessly .
My goal was to be able to take control of the laptop remotely from my desktop like I can with Windows Remote Assistance or PC Anywhere .
Logmein.com offers several packages that do this sort of thing , including a free version that suits my limited needs for controlling the digital frame perfectly .
The free version allows me to control my digital frame from any authorized PC that has a connection to the internet .
It is password protected .
Logmein Free is available at : https://secure.logmein.com/go.asp?page=products_free
Alternatively , there are also many VNC ( Virtual Network Computing ) products available , some of which are open - source and free .
The project sounds quite complicated , but once I had the plan worked out , it went very quickly .
I only spent about 4 hours building the digital frame , once I was satisfied with the design .
My Dad always told me to measure twice and cut once , and that is the philosophy that I used in this project .
There were no significant screw - ups .
I am not very handy with tools , so if I can do this project , so can you .
Good luck !
Man of peace : David Hasselhoff
Barely a month after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 , the city that had been divided by politics for more than 40 years was united in song .
And leading the chorus of several hundred thousand voices was a man hitherto known to the rest of the world for driving a talking car .
David Hasselhoff , star of the hit 80s TV series Knight Rider , is renowned in celebrity - obsessed circles for being Big In Germany ; not only as an actor , but as a purveyor of soft rock anthems .
For that seminal concert , on New Year 's Eve 1989 , Hasselhoff stood atop of the partly - demolished wall and belted out a tune called Looking for Freedom .
It was during Hasselhoff 's current promotional tour of Germany that the Hollywood star made headlines for a remark about this event .
HASSELHOFF THE HIT MACHINE
He 's released 10 albums in Germany He 's now promoting his latest , David Hasselhoff Sings America
In 1993 he made no. 35 in the UK with If I Could Only Say Goodbye
Acting like a singer
" I find it a bit sad that there is no photo of me hanging on the walls in the Berlin Museum at Checkpoint Charlie , " he told the magazine .
So what , if anything , was David Hasselhoff 's influence in helping settle the Cold War ?
For those in the UK and US who know him mainly for his TV roles , most notably as leading lifeguard Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon in Baywatch , it 's hard to appreciate Hasselhoff 's influence on the German cultural scene .
Capture the mood
Hasselhoff was already a singing star in Austria and Switzerland when , in 1989 , he had the wisdom to cover a 1970s German hit , Auf Der Strasse Nach Suden .
Renaming it Looking for Freedom , with Hasselhoff singing in English , the song raced up the charts in the late summer , just as a wave of revolt began sweeping through Eastern Europe .
By the time Berliners started hacking away at the concrete wall that had divided their city for a generation , the torch - bearing anthem had been number one for several weeks in West Germany .
The actor / singer played to hundreds of thousands in Berlin
The album of the same name topped the charts for three months and , that December , Hasselhoff was invited to headline a New Year 's Eve concert in the recently reunited city .
The gig was apparently rubber - stamped by the then German chancellor , Helmut Kohl .
The singer himself has powerful memories of the performance .
" It was the first time Germany had been unified , and close to a million East and West German fans stood together in the freezing cold at midnight watching me perform .
I was overcome with emotion , " he recalls .
Hasselhoff , who by now was appearing in Baywatch , scooped a clutch of top German music awards and went on to become one of the country 's biggest selling artists of the 90s .
His popularity even prompted a headline in one German newspaper , " Hasselhoff : not since the Beatles " .
Forgotten role ?
So , do German fans think their idol has been overlooked as a history man ?
Crazy guys : Hasselhoff and arch fan Sascha Tauber
" It 's a big museum from what I hear , so I can't see why they would n't have room for a photo . "
But according to Sascha Tauber , who runs The Hasselhoff Foundation - David 's Munich - based official fanclub - this could be an example of the notoriously humourless Germans getting one over on the rest of us .
" Did David Hasselhoff help bring an end to the Cold War ?
No , I think this is just a joke . "
DIGG THIS
In the days immediately following the blizzard which swept through the Denver area last week , Denver 's politicians and bureaucrats were out in full - force assuring residents that the city and the state had done everything in their power to mitigate the effects of the blizzard on city and state roads .
Recognizing that residents could blame the city and the state for their lack of preparation and their gross incompetence at plowing the streets and highways , Denver 's politicians and bureaucrats spouted the same self - immunizing platitude we 've all heard bureaucrats and politicians recite from time to time : " What more could we have done ?
We just need more tax money for maintenance equipment . "
Most people in Denver seem to accept this infuriatingly tired defense for governmental failure and incompetence , despite the fact that the very same defense is used every single time a blizzard hits .
No matter how many blizzards we have in Denver , and no matter how many times the city and state governments fail to adequately maintain the roads , Coloradoans refuse to believe that anything could have been done differently to keep the roads safe and passable — except to have the city and the state commandeer ever more money in the form of taxes to buy still more equipment for road maintenance .
This series of events which follows every blizzard in Denver ( i.e. , government failure to maintain roads , leading to bureaucratic calls for more taxes , leading to bigger maintenance budgets , which inevitably fail to result in better services in the next blizzard , which starts the cycle over again ) offers a superb illustration of the absolute logical impossibility of socialism .
This is true , as Ludwig von Mises long ago pointed , because there is absolutely no way for the city and state governments in Colorado to know whether they are spending the right amount on road maintenance .
In the hope of putting to end this Sisyphusian cycle , I would like to suggest to Coloradoans that the solution to this cycle of governmental failure lies in the total privatization of Colorado 's roads , rather than allocating even more tax money to socialized - road maintenance .
In order to see why this is the case , first consider the amount of tax money allocated by the City of Denver to plowing streets in this blizzard alone : $ 700,000 .
How could we tell whether or not the sum of $ 700,000 is too high , too low , or just right , as judged by the consumers of this service ?
The first crucial thing to notice is that it 's impossible to tell whether the residents of Denver ( i.e. , the supposed consumers ) even consider road - plowing during a blizzard a service at all !
Because the residents of Denver are forced to pay for the service whether they want to or not ( in the form of involuntary taxation ) , we are in no position to say whether they really want this service or whether it is being forcefully supplied to them .
Unless consumers voluntarily pay for a good or service , we simply cannot simply assume that they want it .
In order to see why this is true , consider the following hypothetical example .
Suppose you go on vacation , and while you are away I break into your house and steal your gold watch .
Suppose further , however , that I feel guilty about taking your watch , and I decide to compensate you for the watch by washing all the windows in your house before you get back .
In this hypothetical example I can't simply assume that you were willing to exchange your watch for my window washing services , because the exchange was not made voluntarily .
The same is true of any so - called " service " provided by tax dollars : because the " exchange " is not made voluntarily , we cannot say whether the taxpayer really wants it or whether he is being completely ripped off like the watch - owner above .
If you think my example is outlandish with respect to the plowing of the roads in Denver , think about the numerous owners of Hummers in the city of Denver who do n't need to have the roads plowed in order to drive on them .
Can we simply assume that they would have voluntarily paid for this so - called " service " ?
Of course not .
Even if we assume ( contrary to fact ) that services funded with tax dollars are truly voluntarily demanded , there still remains the problem of determining how much to spend on them .
This is where the problem of socialism becomes logically insoluble .
This is true , ( again , as Ludwig von Mises brilliantly pointed out ) , because there are no prices with which to determine whether the city and state governments are spending too much on road maintenance , too little on maintenance , or the right amount .
Take the sum of $ 700,000 given above .
Is this the right amount of money to spend on road maintenance in Denver during a blizzard ?
How do we know that $ 750,000 or $ 500,000 would not be preferable from the point of view of the consumers ?
How do we know that residents and business owners in Denver would n't be willing to spend $ 3,000,000 + on road - plowing — especially considering that this blizzard hit less than a week before Christmas , at the peak of the holiday shopping season ?
The simple fact is that it is totally impossible to tell whether the amount is sufficient , insufficient or adequate .
The city and state governments simply allocate a totally arbitrary budget for road maintenance out of tax dollars , which has absolutely no relationship to consumer preferences .
To see how serious this problem is , recall that the production of goods and services is always for the satisfaction of consumer desires .
This is the goal of all economic production .
In order to calculate whether consumers are in fact being satisfied by a certain amount of production of a certain good or service , we need to have some mechanism for the transmission of consumer preferences to producers .
In other words , in order to calculate whether resources are being used efficiently from the point of view of consumers , consumers need to pay market prices for those services .
In the case of road maintenance in Denver , however , the self - appointed producers of the " service " have no way of determining how much consumers would be willing to shell out for those services .
Because the provision of road maintenance is socialized , the pricing mechanism has been completely abolished , and the rational economic calculation for which pricing is necessary has also been thrown out the window .
In other words , the provision of road maintenance " services " in Denver is completely unrelated to the desires of the consumers , for whom the production of this service was intended in the first place .
The $ 700,000 figure given above is absolutely and unmistakable arbitrary — and so would any other figure the city and the state would pull out of thin air .
The solution to this unnecessary quandary is simple : privatize the roads in Denver so that the market pricing mechanism can be allowed to indicate to producers whether they are spending the proper amount on road maintenance from the point of view of their own consumers .
If the roads were privatized , producers would be able to tell simply by looking at their profit and losses whether they were spending the proper amount on road maintenance .
Profits and expanding business would indicate ( as it does in any free market industry ) that the producer was doing a good job satisfying his customers , and that he was using his resources efficiently from the point of view of his consumers .
Economic losses and loss of customer base would indicate to the producer that he was doing a poor job satisfying his consumers , or that he was allocating his resources wrongly from the point of view of his consumers .
The fact is , moreover , that the people in Denver do not demand road plowing services ( or any other good or service , for that matter ) in the same amount .
Some people do n't care a whit whether their roads are plowed , and they would not be willing to pay anything to plow them ( my brother is one of these people ) .
Other people actually own plows on their own private trucks .
These people certainly would be unlikely to pay huge amounts for this service , since they can almost effortlessly do it for themselves .
Businesses , on the other hand , are very likely to have an extremely high demand for road plowing services , because having clear roads is essential for their patrons to be able to get to their shops .
Given this unequal demand for road services , it is surely unfair for people who have very little demand for road plowing to be forced to subsidize those who have a high demand for road plowing .
As I write , another large snowstorm is making its way toward Denver .
Many of Denver 's roads are likely to be shut down once again .
Many businesses are likely to suffer even more economic losses as a result of the city and state governments ' ineptitude at plowing .
More people will likely be killed or injured while driving on roads which are dangerously under - plowed .
Coloradoans should prepare themselves for another onslaught of pleas from Denver 's bureaucrats and politicians for more tax money for road maintenance , and the whole cycle will begin anew .

The Best of Mark R. Crovelli
ON WEDNESDAY , the World Economic Forum will begin in Davos , Switzerland .
If the meeting sounds like a collection of economists lulling each other to sleep talking about interest rates , think again .
What the in - crowd simply calls “ Davos ” is an assemblage of business leaders , politicians , visionaries and -- more recently -- celebrities at an isolated ski resort for an intense three - day discussion of global issues .
Since Swiss business professor Klaus Schwab launched the forum in 1971 , it has become the ne plus ultra of elite meetings , eclipsing such challengers as Renaissance Weekend , the British - American Project and the Trilateral Commission .
At least , that ’s what the rhetoric surrounding Davos suggests .
According to the World Economic Forum ’s website , Davos is “ an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging leaders in partnerships to shape global , regional and industry agendas . ”
Political scientist Samuel P. Huntington asserted that “ Davos people control virtually all international institutions , many of the world ’s governments and the bulk of the world ’s economic and military capabilities . ”
Its critics hold a similar view .
Anti-globalization protests have targeted the conference , causing its security budget to grow at an alarming rate .
To many of them , Davos is the epitome of how globalization is managed by the elite to impoverish the many .
One of the few scholarly studies of the Davos experience characterizes the meeting as “ a polymorph platform of intermediations on the new frontiers of capitalism . ”
I ’m not entirely sure what that means , but it does not sound good .
Some of this criticism is misplaced .
Claiming that Davos is the secret cabal that runs the world would be like claiming that playing for the NBA makes people taller -- it confuses correlation with causation .
Given that the forum ’s organizers listed giving “ sports leaders a voice ” as one of the major achievements of last year ’s meeting , critics might be exaggerating the power of Davos just a wee bit .

The official rhetoric about solving global problems is overblown as well .
The few Davos attendees who have kissed and told suggest that the conference is more about networking opportunities and ego gratification than shaping global agendas .
In an online Davos diary from last year , author David Rothkopf observed , “ Delegates were all collectors , collecting big names , anecdotes to share with friends , validation . ”
At this point , Davos appears to serve three purposes .
First , it is a useful place for politicians to launch new , grandiose initiatives that never quite live up to their billing .
Former Secretary - General Kofi Annan launched the U.N. 's Global Compact there in 1999 .
The U.S. proposed a Middle East Free Trade Zone in 2003 .
And British Prime Minister Tony Blair used Davos in 2005 as the platform to launch the G8 ’s climate - change initiative .
Second , Davos serves as a convenient meeting place for negotiators .
Because everyone who is anyone is in attendance , political and business leaders can paradoxically reduce their travel by knowing that they will see each other at Davos .
It is now standard practice for trade negotiators to meet at the conference .
For many world leaders , Davos is merely another stop on the summit train , like the G8 meetings or the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation summit .

Third , Davos has become the place where political and business celebrities can meet the only kind of celebrities the rest of the world really cares about .
In recent years , Bono , Brangelina and Sharon Stone have shown up .
Although this has only intensified media interest , it has also elicited complaints from longtime participants that Davos has become the international equivalent of the Sundance Film Festival .
What used to be a small , intimate gathering has metastasized into something bigger -- and slightly more crass .
There are signs that Davos may have jumped the shark .
Activists used to demand a voice at the forum .
In recent years , however , they have abandoned it altogether .
Instead , they attend the rival World Social Forum , which is held at about the same time as Davos .
Even more disconcertingly , Davos sponsored a Gallup poll that found , across the globe , growing distrust of political and business leaders -- the very people who attend Davos .
The World Economic Forum will not go down without a fight .
According to Schwab , “ our annual meeting will help [ leaders ] to address the global agenda and hopefully restore much needed confidence in the ability of global leadership to improve the state of the world for all . ”

Perhaps -- but the polling data could be a harbinger of Davos ’ irrelevance .
This leads to an interesting existential question :
What if they threw an elite meeting and no one cared ?
According to Heather MacDonald , the feminist takeover of Harvard is imminent .
The university is about to name as its new president radical feminist Drew Gilpin Faust , following Lawrence Summers ’s all - too - brief reign .
Summers ’s recklessly honest speculations about women in science strengthened the feminist hold on faculty hiring and promotions .
The Task Force won a $ 50 million commitment to increase faculty “ diversity efforts ” at Harvard .
As University President , Lawrence Summers in 2005 gave a speech where he dared to suggest that innate differences between men and women could explain why men hold more seats as top scientists than women .
This is a plausible thesis .
According to Dr Paul Irwing at Manchester University , there are twice as many men with an IQ of 120 - plus as there are women , and 30 times as many with an IQ of 170 - plus .
There are other studies that indicate similar , disproportionate numbers of men among those with extremely high intelligence .
Besides , even though Summers may have been wrong , it is dangerous to embark on a road where important issues are not debated at all .
One of the hallmarks of Western civilization has been our thirst for asking questions about everything .
Political Correctness is thus anti-Western both in its form and in its intent .
It should be noted that in this case , feminists formed the vanguard of PC , the same ideology that has blinded our universities to the Islamic threat .
It makes it even worse when we know that other feminists in academia assert that the veil , or even the burka , represents “ an alternative feminism . ”
Dr. Wairimu Njambi is an Assistant Professor of “ Women ’s Studies ” at the Florida Atlantic University .
Much of her scholarship is dedicated to advancing the notion that the cruel practice of female genital mutilation ( FGM ) is actually a triumph for Feminism and that it is hateful to suggest otherwise .
According to Njambi “ anti-FGM discourse perpetuates a colonialist assumption by universalizing a particular western image of a ‘ normal ’ body and sexuality . ”
Harvard university recently received a $ 20 million donation from Prince Al - Waleed bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz Al - Saud , a member of the Saudi Royal Family , to finance Islamic studies .
This will no doubt be used to influence the curriculum to make it friendlier and less “ Islamophobic . ”
Senior Western institutions for higher education such as Harvard are thus simultaneously serving as outlets for Saudi Islamic propaganda and for left - wing radical feminists .
This may on the surface look like quite a paradox , but in different ways both groups discredit traditional Western culture by highlighting its “ history of oppression and injustice , ” and they both stifle ideological dissent and suppress criticism of their holy doctrines .
Perhaps feminists failed to listen to fellow Harvard Professor Charles Fried , who has warned that “ The greatest enemy of liberty has always been some vision of the good . ”
Feminism has hurt us by encouraging public accept for intellectual hypocrisy , which later paved the way for Islamic infiltration .
The official mantra is that men and women are not just equal but identical , but at the same time that women are also somehow superior .
Both of these claims cannot , logically speaking , be true at the same time , yet both are being made simultaneously .
This gross double standard closely mirrors that of Multiculturalism , where all cultures are equal but Western culture is inferior and evil .
This is a technique labelled Repressive Tolerance by the cultural Marxist Herbert Marcuse in 1965 .
Briefly speaking , those who are deemed to belong to “ dominant ” groups of society should have their freedom of speech suppressed by progressives and radicals , and simply be denied access to discussion forums , in order to rectify the “ institutional oppression ” in society .
Marcuse ’s ideas had a huge impact in the 1960s and 70s .
He also advocated free sex without any constraints as a method of freeing people from religious morality .
Prof. Bernard Lewis warned in The Jerusalem Post that Islam could soon be the dominant force in a Europe “ Europeans are losing their own self - confidence , ” he said .
“ They have no respect for their own culture ” and have “ surrendered ” on every issue with regard to Islam in a mood of “ self - abasement and political correctness . ”
Although Mr. Lewis did not say so , this is to a significant extent the result of decades of demonization by left - wing academics , including radical feminists .
The goal of radical feminism was never about equality between the sexes , it was about the destruction of the nuclear family and of the power structures of society in general .
As Ellen Willis , self - proclaimed democratic socialist and founder of Redstockings , a radical feminist group from 1969 , stated to left - wing The Nation in 1981 : “ Feminism is not just an issue or a group of issues , it is the cutting edge of a revolution in cultural and moral values . [...]
The objective of every feminist reform , from legal abortion [...] to child - care programs , is to undermine traditional family values . ”
Feminist icon Simone de Beauvoir stated that “ no woman should be authorized to stay at home to raise her children [ … ] because if there is such a choice , too many women will make that one . ”
Well , after two generations of Second Wave Feminism , Ms. Willis and Ms. Beauvoir have had their way :
The West has skyrocketing divorce rates and plummeting birth rates , leading to a cultural and demographic vacuum that makes us vulnerable to a take - over by … Islam .
And feminists still are n't satisfied .
Toy researcher Anders Nelson at Sweden ’s Royal Institute of Technology has warned that toys have become increasingly gender - segregated over the past fifteen years : “ People often explain [ their toy purchases ] by saying that boys and girls want different things .
But in order for children to be able to reflect on [ the toys ] they receive , adults have to open their eyes to [ inherent gender ] structures .
To children , these [ gender ] roles are more unquestioned and instinctual . ”
Mr. Nelson encouraged parents to give more gender neutral Christmas presents .
In other words , no Barbie dolls for girls and no cars for boys .
This is the result of a culture destroyed by Political Correctness .
Swedish Marxist politician Gudrun Schyman has suggested a bill that would collectively tax Swedish men for violence against women .
In a 2002 speech , the same Schyman famously posited that Swedish men were just like the Islamic Taliban regime in Afghanistan .
A male columnist in national newspaper Aftonbladet responded by saying that Schyman was right :
All men are like the Taliban .
Misandry , the hatred of men , is n’t necessarily less prevalent than misogyny , the hatred of women .
The difference is that the former is much more socially acceptable .
When young politician Kjetil Vevle showed up for a meeting planning the demonstrations at that year ’s protests at the International Women ’s Day on 8 March in the city of Bergen , Norway , he was told that men did n’t have voting rights at the meeting even though they were passionate feminists .
The leaders did n’t think there was any cause for complaints , as the men had generously been awarded the right to voice their opinion , just not the right to make decisions .
Although countries such as Norway and Sweden like to portray themselves as havens of gender equality , I have heard visitors comment that the sexes are probably further apart here than anywhere else in the world .
Radical feminism has bred suspicion and hostility , not cooperation .
And it has no in any way eradicated the basic sexual attraction between feminine women and masculine men .
If people do not find this in their own country , they travel to another country to find it , which is now easier than ever .
A striking number of Scandinavian men find their wives in East Asia , Latin America or other nations with a more traditional view of femininity , and a number of women find partners from more conservative countries , too .
Not everyone , of course , but the trend is unmistakable .
Scandinavians celebrate “ gender equality ” and travel to the other side of the world to find somebody actually worth marrying .
Norway and Sweden are countries with extremely high divorce rates .
Boys grow up in an atmosphere where masculinity is demonized , attend a school system where they are viewed as deficient girls and are told by the media that men are obsolete and will soon be rendered extinct anyway .
A feminist culture will eventually end up being squashed , because the men have either become too demoralized and weakened to protect their women , or because they have become so fed - up with incessant ridicule that they just do n't care anymore .
If Western men are pigs and “ just like the Taliban ” no matter what we do , why bother ?
Western women will then be squashed by more aggressive men from other cultures , which is exactly what is happening in Western Europe now .
The irony is that when women launched the Second Wave of Feminism in the 1960s and 70s , they were reasonably safe and , in my view , not very oppressed .
When the long - term effects of feminism finally set in , Western women may very well end up being genuinely oppressed under the boot of Islam .
Radical feminism thus leads to oppression of women .
I wonder whether Virginia Wolf saw this coming .
Maybe if she were alive today , she would hail the Islamic veil as an “ alternative road to feminism ” and write a book called A Burka of One ’s Own .
With some luck , it might even have earned her a Diversity Scholarship at Harvard .

How the Feminists ’ “ War against Boys ” Paved the Way for Islam , 4 September 2006
Seeds of domesticated squash found by scientists on the western slopes of the Andes in northern Peru are almost 10,000 years old , about twice the age of previously discovered cultivated crops in the region , new , more precise dating techniques have revealed .
The findings about Peru and recent research in Mexico , anthropologists say , are evidence that some farming developed in parts of the Americas nearly as early as in the Middle East , which is considered the birthplace of the earliest agriculture .
Digging under house floors and grinding stones and in stone - lined storage bins , the archaeologist Tom D. Dillehay of Vanderbilt University , in Nashville , uncovered the squash seeds at several places in the Ñanchoc Valley , near the Pacific coast about 400 miles north of Lima .
The excavations also yielded peanut hulls and cotton fibers  about 8,500 and 6,000 years old , respectively .
The new , more precise dating of the plant remains , some of which were collected two decades ago , is being reported by Dr. Dillehay and colleagues in today ’s issue of the journal Science .
An analysis of the 100 largest technology companies finds that those with the highest - paid CEOs in 2005 had the worst returns .
Why the disconnect ?
An analysis of the 100 largest technology companies finds that those with the highest - paid CEOs in 2005 had the worst returns .
In the recent study , DolmatConnell & Partners , an executive compensation consulting firm based in Waltham , Mass. , found there was an inverse correlation between tech CEO pay and shareholder returns over a one - year period .
Companies analyzed in the study included Cisco Systems , Dell , EMC , Google , Hewlett - Packard , IBM , Microsoft and Oracle , as well as telecommunications providers , technology services companies and products distributors .
The one - third highest performing companies paid their chief executives an average of $ 7.12 million -- while the bottom third paid their CEOs $ 9.29 million .
The study compared direct compensation , which includes base salary , bonus , long - term incentive payouts and value of stock grants .
Why the disconnect ?
Jack Dolmat - Connell , founder and president of the firm , cites the phenomenon of " chasing the median " : Companies benchmark their executive compensation figures on peers instead of looking at factors related to performance .
He also suggests that lower - performing companies may be investing in leadership talent to get things on the right track : " They may be paying significantly over - market to get those good CEOs . "
Dolmat - Connell declines to cite specific examples of highly paid CEOs whose companies underperformed .
" We do n't know exactly the reason why a company does things , " says Dolmat - Connell .
" A company may be in the midst of a major business transition -- we do n't know the intricacies of the situation to know whether [ a compensation package ] was right or wrong . "
But IBM , as an example , corroborates the study 's findings .
According to Baseline 's analysis of the 100 tech companies in the DolmatConnell study , IBM is in the bottom third , as its stock price declined 15 % in 2005 .
Meanwhile , CEO Sam Palmisano is one of the highest - paid executives in the industry , with direct compensation last year totaling $ 12.4 million -- including a $ 5.2 million bonus -- according to regulatory filings .
In IBM 's 2005 proxy statement , the company 's compensation committee says it " believes that the total value of Mr. Palmisano 's compensation is appropriate compared to chairmen / CEOs of the company 's large , complex global competitors . "
It also notes that his 2005 compensation included a $ 4.2 million payout from IBM 's 2003 - 2005 long - term incentive program , " based on the company 's cumulative financial results over that three - year period . "
Then , on the other hand , there 's Bruce Chizen , CEO of Adobe Systems .
Adobe was included as part of the DolmatConnell study and ranks in the top third ( its stock was up 20 % last year ) .
Chizen received $ 1.9 million in direct compensation in 2005 , below the industry average .
Despite the overall inverse correlation of pay to performance in the tech sector , Dolmat - Connell notes that year - over - year , in CEO compensation of the highest - performing group of tech companies increased in 2005 - - up 15.7 % versus the year prior -- while that of the chief execs of the bottom - performing companies declined 12.0 % .
" The starting points are wrong , " he says , " but things are moving in the right direction . "

Here ’s a scenario that will face many of us in the far future .
You ’re hurtling through the cosmos at nearly the speed of light in your spaceship when you take a wrong turn and pass into the event horizon of a black hole .
Uh oh , you ’re dead – not yet , but it ’s inevitable .
Since nothing , not even light can escape the pull from a black hole once it passes into the event horizon , what can you do to maximize your existence before you join the singularity as a smear of particles ?
Physicists used to think that blackholes were sort of like quicksand in this situation .
Once you cross the event horizon , or Schwarzschild radius , your date with the singularity is certain .
It will occur at some point in the future , in a finite amount of proper time .
The more you try to struggle , the faster your demise will come .
It was thought that your best strategy was to do nothing at all and just freefall to your doom .
Fortunately , Geraint F. Lewis and Juliana Kwan from the School of Physics at the University of Sydney , have got some suggestions that fly in the face of this stuggle = quick death hypothesis .
Their paper is called No Way Back : Maximizing survival time below the Schwarzschild event horizon , and it was recently accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia .
When an unlucky victim falls into the event horizon of a black hole , they will survive for a finite amount of time .
If you fall straight down into a stellar black hole , you ’ll last a fraction of a second .
For a supermassive black hole , you might last a few hours .
Due to the tremendous tidal forces , an unlucky victim will suffer spaghettification , where differences in gravity from your head to your feet stretch you out .
But let ’s not worry about that for now .
You ’re trying to maximize survival time .
Since you ’ve got a spaceship capable of zipping around from star to star , you ’ve got a powerful engine , capable of affecting your rate of descent .
Point down towards the singularity and you ’ll fall faster , point away and you ’ll fall more slowly .
Keep in mind that you ’re inside a black hole , flying a spaceship capable of traveling near the speed of light , so Einstein ’s theories of relativity come into play .
And it ’s how you use your acceleration that defines how much personal time you ’ll have left .
In a moment of panic , you may point your rocket outwards and fire it at full thrust , keeping the engine running until you arrive at the central singularity .
However , Lewis and Kwan have demonstrated that in the convoluted space - time within the event horizon , such a strategy actually hastens your demise , and you ’ll actually end up experiencing less time overall .
So , what are you to do ?
Lewis and Kwan have the solution , identifying an acceleration “ sweet - spot ” that gives you the maximal survival time .
All you have to do , once across the event horizon , is fire your rocket for a fixed amount of time , and then turn it off and enjoy the rest of the fall .
But how long should you fire your rocket for ?
Lewis and Kwan show this is a simple calculation involving the mass of the black hole , how powerful your rocket is , and how fast you crossed the event horizon , easily doable on a desktop computer .
Here ’s another analogy from Lewis :
“ Consider a race to the centre between a free faller and a rocketeer .
Suppose they cross the event horizon together holding hands .
As they cross , they start identical stop watches .
One falls inwards , while the other accelerates towards the centre for a little , then swings their rocket round and decelerates such that the free faller and the rocketeer meet and clasp hands again just before hitting the singularity .
A check on their stop watches would reveal that the free faller would experience the most personal time in the trip .
This is related to one of the basic results of relativity – people in freefall experience the maximum proper time . ”
So now you know .
Even after you ’ve fallen into the black hole ’s event horizon , there are things you can do to lengthen your harrowing journey so that you get to experience more time .
Time to you can use to deal with your spaghettification problem .

Ever since President Bush rammed the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 through Congress to lend a pretense of legality to his detention camp at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , we have urged Congress to amend the law to restore basic human rights and judicial process .
Rulings by military judges this week suggest that the special detention system is so fundamentally corrupt that the only solution is to tear it down and start again .
The target of the judges ’ rulings were Combatant Status Review Tribunals , panels that determine whether a prisoner is an “ unlawful enemy combatant ” who can be tried by one of the commissions created by the 2006 law .
The tribunals are , in fact , kangaroo courts that give the inmates no chance to defend themselves , allow evidence that was obtained through torture and can be repeated until one produces the answer the Pentagon wants .
On Monday , two military judges dismissed separate war crimes charges against two Guantánamo inmates because of the status review system .
They said the Pentagon managed to get them declared “ enemy combatants , ” but not “ unlawful enemy combatants , ” and moved to try them anyway under the 2006 law .
That law says only unlawful combatants may be tried by military commissions .
Lawful combatants ( those who wear uniforms and carry weapons openly ) fall under the Geneva Conventions .
If the administration loses an appeal , which it certainly should , it will no doubt try to tinker with the review tribunals so they produce the desired verdict .
Congress cannot allow that .
When you ca n’t win a bet with loaded dice , something is wrong with the game .
We are forever being bombarded with apparently incredible correlations of various solar indices and climate .
A number of them came up in the excoriable TGGWS mockumentary last month where they were mysteriously ‘ improved ’ in a number of underhand ways .
But even without those improvements ( which variously involved changing the axes , drawing in non-existent data , taking out data that would contradict the point etc. ) , the as - published correlations were superficially quite impressive .
Why then are we not impressed ?
To give you an idea , I ’m going to go through the motions of constructing a new theory of political change using techniques that have been pioneered by a small subset of solar - climate researchers ( references will of course be given ) .
And to make it even more relevant , I ’m going to take as my starting point research that Richard Lindzen has highlighted on his office door for many years :
That ’s right .
Forget the economy or the war(s ) , the fortunes of the Republican party in the US Senate are instead tied closely to the sunspot cycle .
“ Oh yes ” , the sceptics might say “ but that ’s just a couple of cycles and does n’t use up - to - date numbers .
What happens after 1986 ? ”
Well , that is a little problematic , however , the good early correlation is obviously still important ( r=0.52 ! 1960 -1986 ) and so we should be able to refer to it over and over again without noting that it breaks down subsequently ( cf. Svensmark , 2007 referring to Marsh and Svensmark ( 2000 ) ) .
But more importantly , it just demonstrates that the theory needs a little adjustment .
Let ’s look at the second half of the record .
Well , there ’s another strong correlation for that period as well ( r=-0.63 , 1988-2006 ) .
Only this time the correlation is inverted , but that should n’t be surprising to anyone – solar - senator effects are complicated !
If we now put it all together , we can see that there is a reasonable match over the whole period ….
well , except that break in the period 1984 and 1988 and , unfortunately , last year ’s elections did n’t fit the pattern either .
But 1984 - 1988 was Ronald Reagan ’s second term and clearly no theory of Republican senators can ignore that .
We therefore propose that the ‘ Ronald Reagan second term phase shift ’ combined with the change of sign of the Hale solar magnetic cycle in 1986 , obviously changed the dynamics .
This kind of phase shift is frequently seen in solar studies ( cf. Landscheidt and many others ) , where it is rarely taken as a sign that two time series with decadal spectral power are in fact completely independent .
Finally , it is permissible to leave off the more recent data points ( cf. TGGWS ) for “ graphical convenience ” .
So after just a little work , we have managed to rescue the original theory to match a much longer amount of data :
Some readers may scoff and suggest that in the absence of any mechanism , these powerful correlations are numerological artifacts arrived at using post hoc fallacious reasoning that have no predictive capability .
That might appear to be a valid argument .
However the ultimate test will of course be experimental .
On the basis of these intriguing results , we propose exposing Republican senators to varying levels of cosmic rays in a basement and monitoring their electability .
Any refusal by the funding agencies or ethical review panels to support this would simply be confirmation that the political science establishment are scared of what this research would imply for their so - called “ consensus ” .
Convincing , eh ?
WASHINGTON --
The race for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination has become wide open , a new Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll shows .
But the value of winning it has fallen sharply .
The survey shows that without formally entering the race , former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson has risen to second place in the Republican field .
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani continues to leak support , but leads the pack with 29 % to Mr. Thompson 's 20 % , while former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has pulled even with Sen. John McCain ...
Border Patrol commanders say they see no explanation for the drop - off across the entire 2,000 - mile border other than stiffer enforcement deterring migrants .
The slackening flow , they argue , belies the conventional wisdom that it is impossible to stem illegal migration .
Many veteran officers in the force are now beginning to believe it can be controlled with enough resources .
The new measures range from simply putting more officers out on patrol to erecting stadium lights , secondary fences and barriers of thick steel poles to stop smugglers from racing across the desert in all - wheel - drive trucks .
The Border Patrol has deployed hundreds of new guards to watch rivers , monitor surveillance cameras and guard fences .
In the Yuma headquarters of the Border Patrol , for instance , Chief Ronald Colburn said that with the help of the National Guard the patrol had doubled the agents in his sector to about 900 , extended the primary steel wall eight miles past the end of the Mexican town of San Luis Río Colorado , and constructed a vehicle barrier six miles beyond that .
“ It ’s the right mix , the right recipe , ” he said .
The federal government has also begun punishing migrants with prison time from the first time they enter illegally in some areas .
For instance , along the 210 miles of border covered by the Del Rio office of the Border Patrol , everyone caught crossing illegally is charged in federal court and , if convicted , sentenced to at least two weeks in prison .
That is an enormous break with past practice , when most Mexican migrants were simply taken back to the border and let go .
People from Central American countries were given a court date and released on their own recognizance .
Few ever showed up .
In San Luis Río Colorado , the effects of the stepped - up patrols are apparent .
A year ago , migrants thronged the town park and cheap motels , where guides , known as “ coyotes ” or “ polleros ” offered their services .
Now the park is nearly empty .
The smugglers are telling their charges to take a bus to a spot called El Sahuaro about 50 miles east of town .
From there the migrants make a dangerous two - day walk through rocky canyons and barren desert to reach Interstate 8 .
In her three years as an obstetrician and gynecologist in Brooklyn , Dr. Ngozi Nwankpa - Keshinro delivered several hundred babies , conducted several thousand pelvic exams and diagnosed everything from infections to infertility .
But this year , with a little additional training , she has entered a new field : cosmetic medicine .
As one of the owners of a medical spa in Brooklyn that opened in January , she has given dozens of clients Botox injections to relax their wrinkles and Restylane injections to fill out their smile lines and plump their lips .
“ The two fields are as alike as an apple and an orange , ” Dr. Nwankpa - Keshinro said .
“ One can be lifesaving , while the other is not .
But when you clear up someone ’s acne or facial hair , they are as grateful as if you delivered their baby . ”
Cosmetic medicine also provides a more relaxing lifestyle , she said .
“ And it ’s very satisfying . ”
Five years ago , cosmetic medicine was primarily the domain of plastic surgeons , facial surgeons and dermatologists — medical school graduates who undergo several years of training in facial skin and its underlying anatomy .
But now obstetricians , family practitioners and emergency room physicians are gravitating to the beauty business , lured by lucrative cosmetic treatments that require same - day payments because they are not covered by insurance and by a medical practice without bothersome midnight emergency calls .
I ’m going to use an incident from my past to illustrate why bad business decisions drive IT people crazy .
And if you work in IT and you do n’t get involved in business decisions then you should – this example will show you why .
This is possibly the single worst business decision I have personally been involved with in my entire IT career .
I ’ve never been involved in some massive multinational company where the decisions involved billions of dollars and affected thousands of people .
This story also is n’t about the collapse of a company .
It might not be as sexy as some stories but it does highlight a typical , fundamental disconnect that occurs all too often between business and IT .
Or between business and any sort of rationality and common sense .
Some of the identifying elements have been changed to protect the guilty but the core aspects of the decision as I ’m going to relate it are true .
I was working in a large logistics company that leased a large range of assets to companies all over the country .
Everything from furniture to computers to vehicles were managed via the corporate leasing system .
When leases expired on the assets ( after 6 months to 3 years ) my company took them back and usually sold them via auction ( through 3rd party auction houses ) to recoup the residual value .
Each year , tens of millions of dollars worth of stock was sold this way .
Here ’s a tip : find out how end - of - lease merchandise is sold in your town – you can save a fortune buying this way .
I was the analyst on the development of an IT system to handle these auction transactions .
The existing process was paper based – a list of inventory was distributed , auction houses nominated what items they wanted to sell , the items in question were delivered to the auction houses , they were sold at auction , the auction house took a commission and paid my company the remainder of the sale price .
I was given some high - level business requirements ( essentially revolving around tracking and reporting on progress of the transactions ) and had to develop some detailed specifications that the programmers could use to develop the system .
A key part of the development cycle was that a pilot was going to be run with the single biggest auction house .
This one outlet handled about 40 % of all our inventory and the remainder was split among about 10 other auction houses .
If the software worked with the big outlet , it would then be rolled out to the others .
Upon analysing the rather sketchy Business Requirements document ( filled mostly with ill - defined jargon and waffling ) , one half - sentence stood out as essentially being the whole requirement for the project .
After transactions were processed “ an exception report is required . ”
This made sense – tens of millions of dollars in inventory was going out to external parties every year .
It would be nice if you knew the sales they were reporting matched what you had sent them to sell .
I spent some time with the primary business user ( who was much more switched on than the bodgy BR document suggested – it turns out he had very little to do with its creation . )
He agreed that identifying any discrepancies between the items we sent out and the items reported as sold was the single most important requirement .
After some discussion we identified a way to track discrepancies far more accurately than simply “ we sent you something to sell and you did n’t give us any money for it . ”
Because my company bought and sold such huge volumes we had a very detailed cost history in a database .
We could say quite accurately what something should be worth new , after one year , after two years and so on .
The system could be programmed to check sale prices against historical averages and if the deviation was too big ( say , more than 20 % ) you could follow up with the auction house to find out why they ’d sold it for such a low price .
The whole thing could be managed much more efficiently because instead of having to check every transaction , the business user would only have to check out of the ordinary sales that triggered the exception rule .
So we had an elegant solution that was n’t particularly difficult to implement .
I was feeling pretty good .
I submitted the specification to my manager for approval .
And received a rather unexpected response :
Manager : “ We do n’t need to check the dollar amounts they report . ”
Me : “ Why not ? ”
Manager : “ We trust them to get the numbers right . ”
Remember , this was for transactions worth tens of millions if not hundreds of millions every year .
My manager was suggesting the amount of oversight required for external parties handling these transactions was zero .
I was stunned .
I thought maybe I had n’t explained the solution clearly .
Me : “ We ’re not talking about manual checking of figures .
We already have all the information required to automate this sales audit .
We can make the threshold as generous as you like – maybe a 25 % deviation .
Maybe only apply the check to transactions worth more than $ 10,000 .
If they never get the number wrong then nothing will ever happen – we ’ll only be notified if a transaction looks wrong . ”
Manager : “ We trust them so there ’s no need to check the figures . ”
Me : “ What exactly do we trust them to do ?
Do we trust them to never , ever make a mistake when they enter a value ?
Do we trust them to never dishonestly manipulate the auction and sell our stuff to a friend of theirs for far less than its fair value ?
Do we trust them to never falsely report a low sales price and pocket the difference ? ”
Manager : “ Of course , that ’s exactly what we trust them to do . ”
Me : “ That ’s crazy ! ” ( note to self : stop telling business people their ideas are crazy )
“ You trust every single person that works for that company ?
You trust people who might work there in the future , people we ’ve never met ?
And even if you trust our major partner , this will be rolled out to a dozen other companies .
Do you trust everyone who works for them and everyone who will ever work for them ? ”
Manager : “ I ’ve answered your question , stop trying to make things more complicated than they need to be . ”
Me : “ I ’ve already talked to the programmers and this check is relatively trivial to put in place .
Maybe two days of programming and testing .
It wo n’t affect our overall delivery schedule and it will result in a much better system . ”
Manager : “ We do n’t need to use even those two days because we trust them . ”
Me : “ So you ’re going to consciously put into place a system that would allow massive errors to pass through undetected .
A system that would allow large scale fraud to go undetected .
When there ’s a really simple solution already defined ? ”
Manager : “ Yes .
It is n’t required because we trust our partners . ”
I think it would have hurt my head less to bash it against an actual brick wall rather than to continue to butt up against this figurative one .
Here ’s why business decisions like this make IT people so angry : it ’s illogical , it allows bad data to enter the systems and it ’s easily solvable .
And here ’s why IT people should care about decisions like this : you just know when the inevitable happens and some huge amount of money goes astray , IT are going to be blamed for building a system that “ allowed ” it to happen .
So what did I do ?
I circulated an email to everyone who could possibly be affected that this decision had been made .
I made it clear that it was possible to have this check in place but it had been declared unnecessary .
I included the same information in the specification .
And at the first opportunity I found a job somewhere else because I was n’t going to be subjected to that lunacy if I could avoid it .
Any suggestion that I took a job processing payments at one of the auction houses is unfounded conjecture .
The fact that I have an early retirement planned at an offshore tax haven where I have a secret bank account is purely coincidental .
Without a doubt , JavaScript has been making something of a comeback in the last year .
If you ’re involved in client - side development in any way at all , chances are that you ’re finding yourself writing more JavaScript now than you have in a long time .
If you learned most of your JavaScript back when DHTML was all the rage and before DOM Scripting was in vogue , there have been some big shifts in the way scripts are written .
Most of these are in the way event handlers are assigned and functions declared .
Both of these changes are driven by the desire to write scripts that are responsible page citizens , both in not tying behaviour to content and in taking care not to conflict with other scripts .
I thought it may be useful to look at some of these more responsible approaches to learn how to best write scripts that are independent of the page content and are safely portable between different applications .
Event Handling
Back in the heady days of Web 1.0 , if you wanted to have an object on the page react to something like a click , you would simply go ahead and attach an onclick attribute .
This was easy and understandable , but much like the font tag or the style attribute , it has the downside of mixing behaviour or presentation in with our content .
As we ’re learned with CSS , there are big benefits in keeping those layers separate .
Hey , if it works for CSS , it should work for JavaScript too .
Just like with CSS , instead of adding an attribute to our element within the document , the more responsible way to do that is to look for the item from your script ( like CSS does with a selector ) and then assign the behaviour to it .
To give an example , take this oldskool onclick use case :
< a id =" anim - link " href= " # " onclick = " playAnimation ( ) " >
Play the animation </a>
This could be rewritten by removing the onclick attribute , and instead doing the following from within your JavaScript .
document.getElementById(' anim - link ') .onclick = playAnimation ;
It ’s all in the timing
Of course , it ’s never quite that easy .
To be able to attach that onclick , the element you ’re targeting has to exist in the page , and the page has to have finished loading for the DOM to be available .
This is where the onload event is handy , as it fires once everything has finished loading .
Common practise is to have a function called something like init ( ) ( short for initialise ) that sets up all these event handlers as soon as the page is ready .
Back in the day we would have used the onload attibute on the < body > element to do this , but of course what we really want is :
window.onload = init ;
As an interesting side note , we ’re using init here rather than init ( ) so that the function is assigned to the event .
If we used the parentheses , the init function would have been run at that moment , and the result of running the function ( rather than the function itself ) would be assigned to the event .
Subtle , but important .
As is becoming apparent , nothing is ever simple , and we ca n’t just go around assigning our initialisation function to window.onload .
What if we ’re using other scripts in the page that might also want to listen out for that event ?
Whichever script got there last would overwrite everything that came before it .
To manage this , we need a script that checks for any existing event handlers , and adds the new handler to it .
Most of the JavaScript libraries have their own systems for doing this .
If you ’re not using a library , Simon Willison has a good stand - alone example
function addLoadEvent ( func ) { var oldonload = window.onload ; if ( typeof window.onload != ' function ' ) { window.onload = func ; } else { window.onload = function ( ) { if ( oldonload ) { oldonload ( ) ; } func ( ) ; } } }
Obviously this is just a toe in the events model ’s complex waters .
Some good further reading is PPK ’s Introduction to Events .
Carving out your own space
Another problem that rears its ugly head when combining multiple scripts on a single page is that of making sure that the scripts do n’t conflict .
One big part of that is ensuring that no two scripts are trying to create functions or variables with the same names .
Reusing a name in JavaScript just over - writes whatever was there before it .
When you create a function in JavaScript , you ’ll be familiar with doing something like this .
function foo ( ) { ... goodness ... }
This is actually just creating a variable called foo and assigning a function to it .
It ’s essentially the same as the following .
var foo = function ( ) { ... goodness ... }
This name foo is by default created in what ’s known as the ‘ global namespace ’ – the general pool of variables within the page .
You can quickly see that if two scripts use foo as a name , they will conflict because they ’re both creating those variables in the global namespace .
A good solution to this problem is to add just one name into the global namespace , make that one item either a function or an object , and then add everything else you need inside that .
This takes advantage of JavaScript ’s variable scoping to contain you mess and stop it interfering with anyone else .
Creating An Object
Say I was wanting to write a bunch of functions specifically for using on a site called ‘ Foo Online ’ .
I ’d want to create my own object with a name I think is likely to be unique to me .
var FOOONLINE = {} ;
We can then start assigning functions are variables to it like so :
FOOONLINE.message = ' Merry Christmas !' ; FOOONLINE.showMessage = function ( ) { alert ( this .
message ) ; } ;
Calling FOOONLINE.showMessage( ) in this example would alert out our seasonal greeting .
The exact same thing could also be expressed in the following way , using the object literal syntax .
var FOOONLINE = { message : ' Merry Christmas ! ' , showMessage : function ( ) { alert ( this .
message ) ; } } ;
Creating A Function to Create An Object
We can extend this idea bit further by using a function that we run in place to return an object .
The end result is the same , but this time we can use closures to give us something like private methods and properties of our object .
var FOOONLINE = function ( ) { var message = ' Merry Christmas !' ; return { showMessage : function ( ) { alert ( message ) ; } } }( ) ;
There are two important things to note here .
The first is the parentheses at the end of line 10 .
Just as we saw earlier , this runs the function in place and causes its result to be assigned .
In this case the result of our function is the object that is returned at line 4 .
The second important thing to note is the use of the var keyword on line 2 .
This ensures that the message variable is created inside the scope of the function and not in the global namespace .
Because of the way closure works ( which if you ’re not familiar with , just suspend your disbelief for a moment ) that message variable is visible to everything inside the function but not outside .
Trying to read FOOONLINE .
message from the page would return undefined .
This is useful for simulating the concept of private class methods and properties that exist in other programming languages .
I like to take the approach of making everything private unless I know it ’s going to be needed from outside , as it makes the interface into your code a lot clearer for someone else to read .
All Change , Please
So that was just a whistle - stop tour of a couple of the bigger changes that can help to make your scripts better page citizens .
I hope it makes useful Sunday reading , but obviously this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to designing modular , reusable code .
For some , this is all familiar ground already .
If that ’s the case , I encourage you to perhaps submit a comment with any useful resources you ’ve found that might help others get up to speed .
Ultimately it ’s in all of our interests to make sure that all our JavaScript interoperates well – share your tips .
It 's not only the spruikers for the nuclear power industry who are saying so .
In his book The Revenge of Gaia , noted environmentalist James Lovelock reiterates his support for nuclear power .
Certainly , set against the backdrop of global climate disaster , the risks associated with nuclear technology seem to be the lesser of two evils .
But nuclear power only looks greenhouse - friendly from a distance .
If you take a closer look , it 's far from a solution to the climate crisis .
The first problem is the widespread idea that most greenhouse gases come from electrical power .
Unfortunately for all of us , that 's not the case .
In 1999 the International Energy Agency estimated the world emissions from electrical networks at less than 39 per cent of total emissions .
Of course , there are regional differences to this .
The coal - fired stations in Victoria , for example , reportedly account for 55 per cent of the state 's total emissions .
In contrast , a 2004 European Union report found that , of the yearly 4 million tonnes of greenhouse gases put out by its ( then ) 15 countries , only 21 per cent came from electricity generation .
So even if all the non-nuclear stations in the EU countries were replaced by nuclear ones , and these new stations were constructed , fuelled and operated without any greenhouse gases ever being generated ( an impossibility ) , EU countries would still be pouring just on 80 per cent of their present load ( more than 3.2 million tonnes of greenhouse gases ) into the atmosphere each year .
Whichever figures we go by , it 's evident that even total removal of the fossil fuel stations from the equation would still see a vast quantity of greenhouse gases pouring into the atmosphere every year .
Substitution by nuclear power could achieve no more than set back its damage by a few years .
Even if we decided that this is better than nothing , we 're still faced with the problem of fuelling all these new reactors .
This brings us to the second problem with nuclear power : a lack of fuel .
Going on the figures on the World Nuclear Association website , if the present global output of electricity were obtained entirely from nuclear reactors , and as efficiently as best practice allowed , the uranium in all the known rich - ore bodies in the world that they list would keep them going for just under nine years .
Thereafter , the world would have no nuclear power stations operating and therefore no power stations at all .
Given that the construction and initial fuelling of a reactor requires significant energy input and associated greenhouse emissions , this hardly makes good environmental sense .
One solution to this shortage might be to mine uranium from poorer sources such as the earth 's crust , granite , sedimentary rock and even seawater .
The problem here , though , is that even if it became economically feasible to mine such sources , the amount of energy expended in extracting the uranium , preparing it for use and building new reactors would far exceed the energy it eventually generated .
In other words , nuclear power is n't neutral when it comes to greenhouse gases .
On the contrary , greenhouse gases are emitted at every step along the way to generating nuclear power .
In dismissing solar power , Homer has to overlook the recent United Nations report saying that an 800 - square - kilometre area of the Sahara could generate enough electricity for the whole world .
He is , of course , still entitled to his opinion that solar is a pipedream .
But so too is the popular notion that nuclear power is greenhouse - gas friendly .

Parrot へようこ そ
これ は「 Parrot : Some Assembly Required 」という記事 をParrot の 0.0.2 のリリースのために改稿したものです。これは
Parrot 初心者にとって Parrot とは何か、どう使うのかを学ぶための最良の方法にするつもり。
This is an update to the article ' Parrot : Some Assembly Required ' which appeared on http://www.perl.com for the 0.0.2 release of Parrot .
It 's intended as being the best way for the newcomer to Parrot to learn what Parrot is and how to use it .
Parrot とは？
第一に、とにもかくにも 、Parrot って何？ なんでみんなこれについて大騒ぎしてんの？ えーと。もしあなたが箱の中で暮らしてでもいなければ
、Perl コミュニティが新し い
Perl のデザインと、その実装をしているのを知ってるよね。新バージョンのPerl、言語と実行処理系の両方。
First , though , what is Parrot , and why are we making such a fuss about it ?
Well , if you have n't been living in a box for the past year , you 'll know that the Perl community has embarked on the design and implementation of a new version of Perl , both the language and the interpreter .
Parrot ってのは 、Perl 6 ととっても強く結びついてるけど、
Perl 6 ってわけじゃない。それが何であるかを知るためには
、Perl がどうやって動いているのか、ちょっと知っておかないといけない。Perl に君のプログラムを食べさせると、まず中間言語( IR : Intermediate Representation ) かバイトコー ド( bytecode ) にコンパイルされる。そいつらをPerl内部の（コンパイラとは）ほとんど別のサブシステムであるインタプリタに食わせ、解釈実行する。つまり、Perl を動かすには 2 つの別個な段 階( phase ) があるってわけだ。 「バイトコードへコンパイル」すること、「バイトコードを解釈実行」すること。これは別に
Perl に限ったことではなくて、他の言語でも同じで、例えば
Python とか Ruby とか Tcl とか、信じるか信じないかは別にして 、Java とか。
Parrot is strongly related to Perl 6 , but it is not Perl 6 .
To find out what it actually is , we need to know a little about how Perl works .
When you feed your program into perl , it is first compiled into an internal representation , or bytecode ; then this bytecode is fed to almost separate subsystem inside perl to be interpreted .
So there are two distinct phases of perl 's operation - compilation to bytecode , and interpretation of bytecode .
This is not unique to Perl ; other languages following this design include Python , Ruby , Tcl and , believe it or not , even Java .
これまでのバージョン の Perl では、これらの配置（コンパイラとインタプリタの位置付け、かな？）がとってもその場しのぎのものだった。コンパイラとインタプリタを包むようなデザインじゃなくて、インタプリタは結局コンパイラに依存しまくりだった。そうはいっても、インタプリタ（他の言語では仮想マシン( VM:Virtual Machine ) って言うけど）はソフトウェアによるCPUと考えられてる。コンパイラはそのVMのためのマシンコード命令列を生成するものってね。Cコンパイラが実際のCPU上で動作するマシンコードを生成するようにね。
In previous versions of Perl , this arrangement has been pretty ad hoc : there has n't been any overarching design to the interpreter or the compiler , and the interpreter has ended up being pretty reliant on certain features of the compiler .
Nevertheless , the interpreter ( some languages call it a Virtual Machine ) can be thought of as a software CPU - the compiler produces " machine code " instructions for the virtual machine , which it then executes , much like a C compiler produces machine code to be run on a real CPU .
Perl 6 もコンパイラとインタプリタのデザインを別個にしようと計画している。これが、このサブプロジェクトを立ち上げた理由だ。これは
Parrot と呼ばれ、ある程度限られてはいる が
Perl 6 と独立している 。Parrot は Perl 6 の VM になるはずで 、Perl 6 上でバイトコードを実行するソフトウェアCPU なんだ。我々は Perl 6 コンパイラを作る前に Parrot に取り掛かっている。一度（出力コードの）ターゲットが決まっちゃったほうが、コンパイラ作るの楽だしね！
Perl 6 plans to separate out the design of the compiler and the interpreter .
This is why we 've come up with a subproject , which we 've called Parrot , which has a certain , limited amount of independence from Perl 6 .
Parrot is destined to be the Perl 6 Virtual Machine , the software CPU on which we will run Perl 6 bytecode .
We 're working on Parrot before we work on the Perl 6 compiler because it 's much easier to write a compiler once you 've got a target to compile to !
Parrot という名前は 、2001 年のエイプリルフールのジョークから選ばれた。それは、Perl と Python が共同で次のバージョンのインタプリタを作るってものだった。これは、あるアイデアを反映するものだった。ゆくゆくは同様のほかの言語がそのVMとして
Parrot を使うようになって、ある意味、動的言語のための共通ランタイム に Parrot をしたい、って意味だ 。
The name " Parrot " was chosen after the 2001 April Fool 's Joke which had Perl and Python collaborating on the next version of their interpreters .
This is meant to reflect the idea that we 'd eventually like other languages to use Parrot as their VM ; in a sense , we 'd like Parrot to become a " common language runtime " for dynamic languages .
今どこにいる の
これは、強調しなきゃいけないんだけど、我々はまだ開発の初期段階なんだ。
It should be stressed we 're still in the early stages of development .
だけど、もう少し様子を見ようかな、なんて思わないでね！
Parrot は既に使えるんだ。も う2つの小さな言語が
Parrot バイトコードにコンパイルできるようになっているし（後述）、Leon Brocard は Java バイトコードから 、Parrot用のそれに自動的に変換するためにがんばってる。
But do n't let that put you off !
Parrot is still very much usable ; we 've already seen two mini-languages emerge which compile down to Parrot bytecode ( more on that later ) , and Leon Brocard has been working on automatically converting Java bytecode to Parrot .
現在のところ 、Parrot アセンブラ言語で簡単なプログラムを書くことができる。Parrotマシン語に変換するためのアセンブラと、それを動かすテスト用インタプリタを使ってね。たくさんの基本的なのとか超越数学関数とか、いくつかの基本的な文字列のサポートと、それからいくつかの条件演算なんかのサポートをしてるよ。
At the moment , it 's possible to write simple programs in Parrot assembly language , use an assembler to convert them to machine code and then execute them on a test interpreter .
We have support for a wide variety of ordinary and transcendental mathematical operations , some rudimentary string support , and some conditional operators .
どうやって手に入れるの
だから、 Parrot のコピーを手に入れて、詳しく調べてみよう。
So let 's get ourselves a copy of Parrot , so that we can start investigating how to program in the Parrot assembler .
定期的に発行される、バージョン番号つきのリリースは
CPANで手に入る（現在、それは ver.0.0.3 だけど）。でも、現段階では恐ろしいほどリリースごとに違いが出る。リリースに追従するのなら、CVSからコピーをとってくるべきだ。これは、それをどうやるかって例。
Periodic , numbered releases will appear on CPAN ( we 're currently on version 0.0.3 ) , but at this stage of the project an awful lot is changing between releases .
To really keep up to date with Parrot , we should get our copy from the CVS repository .
Here 's how we do that :
% cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.perl.org :/cvs/public login ( Logging in to anonymous@cvs.perl.org ) CVS password : [ and here we just press return ] % cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.perl.org :/cvs/public co parrot cvs server : Updating parrot U parrot/.cvsignore U parrot/ Config_pm.in ....
また、ウェブで のCVSレポジトリへのインターフェースは
http://cvs.perl.org/cvsweb/parrot/ にある。
There 's also a web interface to the CVS repository , available at http://cvs.perl.org/cvsweb/parrot/.
CVS の使えない人のために 、CVS のスナップショットが6時間ごとに作られてて、それはここ
http://cvs.perl.org/snapshots/parrot/。
For those of you who can't use CVS , there are CVS snapshots built every six hours which you can find at http://cvs.perl.org/snapshots/parrot/.
さあ 、Parrot をダウンロードした。次はビルドしなきゃいけない。こんなふうに。
Now we have downloaded Parrot , we need to build it ; so :
% cd parrot % perl Configure.pl Parrot Configure Copyright ( C ) 2001 Yet Another Society Since you 're running this script , you obviously have Perl 5 - - I 'll be pulling some defaults from its configuration .
...
あなたのローカル設定について、いくつかの質問を聞かれるはずで、リターンキーさえ押しておけばいい。そして最後に、 make コマンドをタイプして。運がよければ
Parrot のテスト用インタプリタが無事にビルドされるかもね。（もしできなかったら、苦情をいうためのアドレスはこの紹介の最後にあるよ・・・）
You 'll then be asked a series of questions about your local configuration ; you can almost always hit return for each one .
Finally , you 'll be told to type make ; with any luck , Parrot will successfully build the test interpreter .
( If it does n't , the address to complain to is at the end of this introduction ... )
テストスー ト
さあ、テストを動かそう。 make test ってタイプして、次のような実行結果をみてくれ 。
Now we should run some tests ; so type make test and you should see a readout like the following :
perl t/harness t/op / basic ..... ok , 1/2 skipped : label constants unimplemented in assembler t/ op / string .... ok , 1/4 skipped : I 'm unable to write it !
All tests successful , 2 subtests skipped .
Files=2 , Tests=6 , 2 wallclock secs ( 1.19 cusr + 0.22 csys = 1.41 CPU )
（もちろん、これよりもいっぱいテストはあるけど、大体の雰囲気はつかめると思う。いろいろな理由から、テストは省略されることもある。ただし失敗するテストが出てきたりするのはまずいので注意しよう）
( Of course , there are many more tests than this , but you get the idea ; tests may be skipped - for one reason or another - but none of them should fail ! )
問題の報 告
もし 、Parrot について問題があったら、bugs-parrot@bugs6.perl.org へ、その問題を書いて送ってくれ。そのときには、ビルド時に作った myconfig を含めてね。
If you have problems with parrot , please send a message to bugs-parrot@bugs6.perl.org with a description of your problem .
Please include the myconfig file that was generated as part of the build process .
パロットのコンセプト - Parrot Concepts
Parrot アセンブリに入る前に、簡単にいくつかのコンセプトをみておきましょう。
Before we dive into programming Parrot assembly , let 's take a brief look at some of the concepts involved .
型 - Types
Parrot CPU には、4つの基本的なデータ型がある。
The Parrot CPU has four basic data types :
INTVAL 整数型 ; ポインタを抱えるのに十分な大きさであることを保証.
FLOATVAL アーキテクチャ依存の不動小数点型 .
STRING 抽象化されたエンコーディング独立な文字列型 .
PMC その他の型。たとえば ( perl の ) スカラー型や配列型 .
INTVAL
An integer type ; guaranteed to be wide enough to hold a pointer .
FLOATVAL
An architecture - independent floating point type .
STRING
An abstracted , encoding - independent string type .
PMC
Other types lile a ( perl ) scalar or an array .
最初の3つの型はほとんど自明だね。最後の型、Parrot Magic Cookies は若干理解するのが難しいかも。でも、それでもいいや。PMC
についてはこの記事の最後まで、いろいろ説明するからね。
The first three types are pretty much self - explanatory ; the final type , Parrot Magic Cookies , are slightly more difficult to understand .
But that 's OK !
We 'll talk more about PMCs at the end of the article .
レジスタ - Registers
現在の Perl 5 の VM はスタックマシンだ（訳注：そうだったんだー）。値を伝えるために、そえをスタックへ積むってやつ。演算は、まず最初にスタックの上から値をロードして、実際に演算して、それからその結果をスタックの上にのっける。これはとっても楽だけど、とっても遅いんだ。例えば、二つの数を足すとき、3回のスタックへのプッシュ（訳注：a,b,resultのpush）と2回のスタックからのポップ（訳注：a, b のポップ）が必要になる。悪いことに、スタックは実行時におっきくなるから、メモリ割り当てはあなたがやって欲しくない時に起こる。
The current Perl 5 virtual machine is a stack machine - it communicates values between operations by keeping them on a stack .
Operations load values onto the stack , do whatever they need to do , and put the result back onto the stack .
This is very easy to work with , but it 's very slow : to add two numbers together , you need to perform three stack pushes and two stack pops .
Worse , the stack has to grow at runtime , and that means allocating memory just when you do n't want to be allocating it .
だから 、Parrot は伝統的に確立されたVMとは縁を切って、レジスタアーキテクチャ、実際のハードウェアCPUと類似したアーキテクチャを使おうと思う。これは別の利点がある。レジスタベースのCPUのための全ての文献がそのまんま利用できるってこと。コンパイラの書き方とか、最適化の仕方とかね。
So Parrot 's going to break with the established tradition for virtual machines , and use a register architecture , more akin to the architecture of a real hardware CPU .
This has another advantage : we can use all the existing literature on how to write compilers and optimizers for register - based CPUs for our software CPU !
Parrot は各型にそれぞれ専門のレジスタがある。32個の
INTVAL 用レジスタ、32個の FLOATVAL
レジスタ、32個の文字列型のレジスタ、そして 32個の PMC 型のレジスタだ 。Parrot アセンブラでは、それら は I0 ... I31 , N0 ... N31 , S0 ... S31 , P0 ... P31 って表現する。
Parrot has specialist registers for each type : 32 INTVAL registers , 32 FLOATVAL registers , 32 string registers and 32 PMC registers .
In Parrot assembler , these are named I0 ... I31 , N0 ... N31 , S0 ... S31 , P0 ... P31 .
さて、いくつかアセンブラを見ていこうか。set 演算でレジスタの値を設定することができる。
Now let 's look at some assembler .
We can set these registers with the set operator :
set I1 , 10 set N1 , 3.1415 set S1 , " Hello , Parrot "
全てのパロット演算は同じ書式になっている。演算の名前、目的レジスタ、そしてオペランド（訳注：これだけカタカナってかっこわるい）だ。
All Parrot ops have the same format : the name of the operator , the destination register , and then the operands .
演算 - Operations
たくさんの種類の演算を使うことができるよ。docs/core_ops.pod ファイルにそれらについて書いてある。少しアセンブラの式を加えてね。たとえば、レジスタに格納されている値や、定数なんかを印字できたりする。（訳注：そんな演算いれんなー）
There are a variety of operations you can perform : the file docs / core_ops .
pod documents them , along with a little more about the assembler syntax .
For instance , we can print out the contents of a register , or a constant :
print " The contents of register I1 is : " print I1 print "
"
また、レジスタでの数学的な演算とかやれる。
Or we can perform mathematical functions on registers :
add I1 , I1 , I2 # Add the contents of I2 to the contents of I1 mul I3 , I2 , I4 # Multiply I2 by I4 and store in I3 inc I1 # Increment I1 by one dec N3 , 1.5 # Decrement N3 by 1.5
また、単純な文字列操作なんかもできる。
We can even perform some simple string manipulation :
set S1 , " fish " set S2 , " bone " concat S1 , S2 # S1 is now " fishbone " set S3 , " w " substr S4 , S1 , 1 , 7 concat S3 , S4 # S3 is now " wishbone " length I1 , S3 # I1 is now 8
分岐 - Branches
フロー制御なしじゃ、ちょっとつまんないね。まず最初に、Parrot には分岐とラベルってのがある。分岐演算は
Perl の goto と同じね 。
Code gets a little boring without flow control ; for starters , Parrot knows about branching and labels .
The branch op is equivalent to Perl 's goto :
branch TERRY JOHN : print " fjords
" branch END MICHAEL : print " pining " branch GRAHAM TERRY : print " It 's " branch MICHAEL GRAHAM : print " for the " branch JOHN END : end
また、レジスタが true であるかの単純なテストもできる 。
It can also do simple tests for whether or not a register contains a true value :
set I1 , 12 set I2 , 5 mod I3 , I1 , I2 if I3 , REMAIND print " 5 is an integer divisor of 12 " branch DONE REMAIND : print " 5 divides 12 with remainder " print I3 DONE : print "
" end
もし I3 が true だったら（つまり、ゼロでなければ）、 REMAIND へ分岐する。もし I3 がゼロなら、演算は失敗し、次の文を実行する。これを
Perl でかくとこんな感じだ 。
Note that if branches to REMAIND if I3 contains a true ( i.e. non-zero ) value ; if I3 is zero , execution falls through to the next statement .
Here 's what that would look like in Perl , for comparison :
$ i1 = 12 ; $ i2 = 5 ; $ i3 = $ i1 % $ i2 ; if ( $ i3 ) { print " 5 divides 12 with remainder " ; print $ i3 ; } else { print " 5 is an integer divisor of 12 " ; } print "
" ; exit ;
比較について言うと、十分な数値の比較器をもってる。eq , ne , lt , gt , le , ge とか。注意してほしいのは、別な型との比較が出来ないってこと。比較するときは、サフィックスに _i や _n を、どの型を用いているかを示すためにつけなきゃいけない。これを読んでるときにはアセンブラがそれを予測するべきなんだけど。
And speaking of comparison , we have the full range of numeric comparators : eq , ne , lt , gt , le and ge .
Note that you can't use these operators on arguments of disparate types ; you may even need to add the suffix _i or _n to the op to tell it what type of argument you are using - although the assembler ought to divine this for you , by the time you read this .
いくつかの Parrot プログラム - Some Parrot Programs
んじゃ、少し簡単なプログラムを見ていこうか。言語の感じをつかむためにね。
Now let 's have a look at a few simple Parrot programs to give you a feel for the language .
時間の表示 - Displaying the Time
この小さなプログラムは UNIX 時間を毎秒（かそこら）で表示する。
This little program displays the Unix epoch time every second : ( or so )
set I3 , 3000000 REDO : time I1 print I1 print "
" set I2 0 SPIN : inc I2 le I2 , I3 , SPIN branch REDO end
最初に、整数レジスタ3に3百万をセットする。これは完全にいい加減な番号で、3百万というのは、私のマシンでParrotの命令が一秒間あたり平均6百万回実行できることを基準に、とりあえず選んだ値だ。それで、このプログラムには2つのループがある。外側のループは現在( UNIX)時間を整数レジスタ1に格納し、表示して（ついでに改行も）整数レジスタ2をゼロにセットする。内部ループは整数レジスタ2を3百万になるまでインクリメントしていく。到達したら、
REDO へ戻る。要は、ただビジーループでいくらか時間を過ごしているだけである。これは、単純に現状のParrotが sleep 演算を持っていないから。後でどうやってこれを実装するかをみてみようね。
First , we set integer register 3 to contain 3 million - that 's a completely arbitrary number , due to the fact that Parrot averages a massive six million ops per second on my machine .
Then the program consists of two loops : the outer loop stores the current Unix time in integer register 1 , prints it out , prints a new line , and resets register 2 to zero .
The inner loop increments register 2 until it reaches the 3 million we stored in register 3 .
When it is no longer less than ( or equal to ) 3 million , we go back to the REDO of the outer loop .
In essence , we 're just spinning around a busy loop to waste some time .
This is only because Parrot does n't currently have a " sleep " op ; we 'll see how to implement one later on .
どうやってこれを動かそうかね？ まず、これを Parrot バイトコードへアセンブルしなきゃいけない。 assemble .pl でね。だから、アセンブラを showtime .
pasm としてコピーして、それから Parrot ディレクトリで次を動かしてね 。
How do we run this ?
First , we need to assemble this into Parrot bytecode , with the assemble .pl provided .
So , copy the assembler to a file showtime .
pasm , and inside your Parrot directory , run :
perl assemble.pl showtime.pasm > showtime.pbc
（.pbc ってのは 、Parrotバイトコードの意味ね）
(.pbc is the file extension for Parrot bytecode . )
フィボナッチ数の発見 - Finding a Fibonacci number
フィボナッチ数列というのは、次のようなものだね。まず、1,1 という二つの数列を用意する。そして、最後の二つの数字を足し合わせて、数列の後ろに加える、って手段を続ける。1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 って感じ。フィボナッチ数 fib( n ) は n番目のフィボナッチ数という意味。次に示すのは最初から20個のフィボナッチ数を見つける簡単なParrotアセンブラプログラムだ。
The Fibonacci series is defined like this : take two numbers , 1 and 1 .
Then repeatedly add together the last two numbers in the series to make the next one : 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , and so on .
The Fibonacci number fib(n ) is the n'th number in the series .
Here 's a simple Parrot assembler program which finds the first 20 Fibonacci numbers :
# Some simple code to print some Fibonacci numbers # Leon Brocard < acme@astray.com > print " The first 20 fibonacci numbers are :
" set I1 , 0 set I2 , 20 set I3 , 0 set I4 , 1 REDO : set I5 , I4 add I4 , I3 , I4 set I3 , I5 print I3 print "
" inc I1 lt I1 , I2 , REDO DONE : end
Perl にするとこうなる 。
This is the equivalent code in Perl :
print " The first 20 fibonacci numbers are :
" ; my $ i = 0 ; my $ target = 20 ; my $ a = 0 ; my $ b = 1 ; until ( $i == $ target ) { my $ num = $ b ; $ b += $ a ; $ a = $ num ; print $ a , "
" ; $ i++ ; }

Jako
アセンブラでプログラミングするのはこれくらいにして、
Jako っていう中間レベルの言語をみてみよう 。Jako は Gregor Purdy によって書かれた。彼は明らかにアセンブラでのプログラミングでひどく参っていたんだ。もう濡れ烏って感じ（訳注：やりすぎ？）。Jako はちょっと C に似てて、ちょっ と
Perl に似てて 、Parrot で出来ることはなんでもできるけど、もうちょっと整理されてる。さて、もう一度フィボナッチなプログラムを試してみよう。
So much for programming in assembler ; let 's move on and look at a medium - level language - Jako .
Jako was written by Gregor Purdy who obviously got sick ( as a parrot ) of programming in assembler .
Jako looks a little bit like C and a little bit like Perl , and it can do anything you can do in Parrot assembler , but a little tidier .
Let 's try that Fibonacci program again :
print ( " The first 20 fibonacci numbers are :
" ) ; var int i = 0 ; var int target = 20 ; var int a = 0 ; var int b = 1 ; var int num ; while ( i != target ) { num = b ; b += a ; a = num ; print ( " $
a
" ) ; i++ ; }
どれくらい Perl バージョンに似てるかに注目してみて。 " $ " 記号を取っ払っ て 、Perlish な untile をもっと普通の while と取り替えて、my を var int に取り替えて、とかなんとか 。
Notice how similar this is to the Perl version ?
I stripped away the $ sigils , replaced the Perlish until with a more common while , replaced my with var int and I was nearly done .
Jako コンパイラ、jakoc は 、Parrot のlanguages / jakoに入ってる 。
The Jako compiler , jakoc , ships with Parrot in the languages / jako subdirectory :
% languages / jako / jakoc fib.jako > fib.pasm % perl assemble.pl fib.pasm > fib.pbc % ./ parrot fib.pbc
The first 20 fibonacci numbers are : 1 1 2 3 ...
次はなに？ - Where Next ?
Parrot は実際非常に急速に開発が進んでいて、コンパイラのための準備には程遠い。この節では 我々の Parrot開発を手伝ってみてもいいかな、と興味を持ってもってくれた人のために書いてる。
Parrot is obviously developing very rapidly , and we 've still got a long way to go before we are ready to a compiler to this platform .
This section is for those who are interested in helping us take Parrot further .
演算の追加 - Adding operations
最初に、我々はもっと多くの演算を加えなきゃいけない。でも、それは注意深く考えないといけないし、全ての新しい演算の提案は
Dan Sugalski 、 Parrot デザイナにチェックしてもらわなければならない。
The first thing we need is a lot more operations ; but this needs to be carefully thought out , and all new proposals for operations should be checked by Dan Sugalski , the Parrot designer .
とは言っても 、Parrot に新しい演算を加えるのはとても単純だ。さっき不平を言ってた sleep 演算を足してみよう 。
That said , adding operations to Parrot is actually very simple .
Let 's add the sleep operator we were complaining about earlier .
print " String " とか、レジスタの値を表示するために print I3 とか、書けるけど 、Parrot の演算は多 態( polymorphic ) ではない。アセンブラがちょっとトリッキーなことやって対応してる。その2つの演算は2つの別々の演算として実装されてて、
print_sc っていう文字列定数を表示するためのものと、
print_i っていって整数レジスタの値を表示するものだ。このへんはプリプロセッサによっていいようにしてるから、オペコードを追加するために必要なのは core.ops ファイルに実装を足すことだけってわけだ。
Although we 've been able to say print " String " and print I3 to print a register , Parrots ops are not polymorphic - this is some trickery carried out by the assembler .
Those two operations would be implemented by two different ops , print_sc to print a string constant , and print_i to print an integer register .
All this is handled by the preprocessor , so all we need to do to add an opcode is to add its implementation to the core.ops file .
この書しきってのがちょっと変わってて、Perlプログラムによって前処理される
C なんだ 。Cの関数は op foo( ) か、 inline op foo ( ) って宣言しなきゃいけない 。
The format of this file is a little funny ; it 's C which is pre-processed by a Perl program .
The C functions should be declared either op foo ( ) or inline op foo ( ) .
この inline 接頭語はこの関数がすげー簡単であるってことのヒントになって、JIT（訳注：JITコンパイラ 。Just
In Compile ではない）とかの最適化でインライン化する対象になったりする。 inline じゃない演算の関数はもっと頑張らなきゃいけない 。
The inline prefix is a hint for code generation that this is a very simple op function , which for JIT or other optimizations might be able to be converted inline .
Non-inline op functions might require more work .
んで、特別なパターンがあって、一番大切なのは goto NEXT ( )
だ。この式は次の演算へ移動ってことを示してる。次の演算の場所ってのは、この演算のサイズから計算された実際のCのコードで自動的に決まる。（訳注：すげー自信なし）
There are special patterns , the most important of which is goto NEXT ( ) .
The statement goto NEXT ( ) means that the address of the next op should be worked out automatically during real C code generation based on the size of the current op .
引数は $ 1 とか $ 2 とか、そんな感じで書く。これは実際のCの引数じゃないけど、バイトコード列から取り出すことができる引数なんだ。
Arguments are denoted by $ 1 , $ 2 and so on - they are n't actual arguments to the C function , but are pulled out of the bytecode stream .
というわけで、定数sleep演算をやってみよう。引数 $ 1 を渡して、これをsleep（訳注：( 3 ) ）に渡してみよう。
So let 's do the constant sleep op first .
We want to take the first parameter , $ 1 , and pass it to sleep :
inline op sleep ( i|ic ) { sleep ( $ 1 ) ; goto NEXT ( ) ; }
これは、整数定数と整数レジスタで動く。
That works for both integer constant and integer register argument versions of the op function .
あとはテスト（t/op/basic.t参照）とドキュメント（core.opsにPODを足せば自動的に docs に入る）を加えれ ばParrot CPUへの演算の追加は完了。んで、アセンブラは自動的にsleepで寝る時間を定数か変数か、判断する。んで、sleep
っていってる演算をディスパッチするわけだ。これで、showtime
の例をもっとうまく欠けるね。それはちょっとした練習問題になるってわけだ。
All that 's missing is a test suite ( see t/ op / basic.t for an example ) and some documentation ( add your POD to core.ops and it'll be automatically added into the appropriate file in docs ) and we 've added our instructions to the Parrot CPU .
The assembler will automatically determine whether we 're sleeping for a constant time or a variable time , and will despatch the right op when we just say sleep .
Now we can rewrite the showtime code a little more neatly - or rather , you can , as a nice little exercise !
Vtable データ型 - Vtable datatypes
PMC は Perl 5 の SV や Python のオブジェクトとかに似てる 。PMC はいくつかの型のオブジェクトで、いくつかの演算をすることができる。例えば、
PMCs are almost like Perl 5's SVs and Python 's Objects , only more so .
A PMC is an object of some type , which can be instructed to perform various operations .
So when we say
inc P1
これは PMCレジスタ 1 の値を増加させるんだけど、その増加するための方法ってのは
PMC が知ってる。
to increment the value in PMC register 1 , the increment method is called on the PMC - and it's up to the PMC how it handles that method .
PMC は、どうやって Parrot を言語独立にしていこうかって奴 で 、Perl の PMC は Python や
Tcl のそれとは違う挙動だったりする。特定のメソッドはvtable っていう構造にある関数ポインタで、それぞれの PMC が vtable へのポインタをもってる。クラスのメソッドを実装してるやつね。（訳注：C++のvtable のイメージで、いいんだよなぁ？ 多分）だから、 Perl インタプリタ はPerlっぽいクラスなライブラリとリンクしなきゃいけないし、PMC は Perl っぽい挙動しなきゃいけないね。
PMCs are how we plan to make Parrot language - independent - a Perl PMC would have different behavior from a Python PMC or a Tcl PMC .
The individual methods are function pointers held in a structure called a vtable , and each PMC has a pointer to the vtable which implements the methods of its " class " .
Hence a Perl interpreter would link in a library full of Perl - like classes and its PMCs would have Perl - like behaviour .
PMC 型というのは doc/vtables.pod に書いてあって、新しい PMC を次のように作ることができる。
The PMC types available are described in doc/vtables .pod ; you can create a new PMC with
new P0 , < typename >
そして、 core.ops の PMCをサポートする命令を使うことができる。 doc/vtables.pod には、どうやって PMC の vtable クラスを実装すればいいか書いてあるよ 。
and then use any of the instructions in core.ops which support PMCs .
doc/vtables.pod also tells you how to implement your own PMC vtable classes .
もっとやること - More Todos
たくさん Parrot でやりたいことが残ってて、例えばいくつかの
I / O（もうちょっとプログラムを面白くするための）とか、一連の文字列関数（いろんなエンコーディングとか、それらの変換とか）とか、もっともっとドキュメント用意するとか、ほんとに、ほんとにもっともっとテストしなきゃいけないとか、いろんなプラットホームでParrot の移植性を確認したりとか、あと、もっと演算を用意したり、とか。
There are a huge number of things we want to do with Parrot : we need , for instance , to create some I/O operators to make programs actually interesting ; we want to create a range of string functions to deal with various encodings and convert between them ; we want more documentation ; we really , really need more tests ; we want to check Parrot 's portability to various platforms ; and finally , there are a load more ops that we need to implement .

I ’ve always been intrigued by alternative building methods and materials .
I know , for example , that domes ( of the geodesic or monolithic concrete varieties ) are strong , inexpensive , and easily built , and that straw bale houses provide excellent insulation .
Were I planning to build my own house , I might consider any of these options , as well as adobe , brick , stone , glass block , and good old - fashioned wood .
But when I heard recently that Disneyland had once featured an all - plastic house , I just boggled .
It did not amaze me in the slightest that such a structure was possible , but I could n’t get over one huge question :
Why ?
Why in the world would anyone build a house out of such a gauche material ?
And who would want to live in such a house ?
The Plastic House
When Disneyland opened in Anaheim , California in 1955 , one of its most popular themed areas was Tomorrowland , where visitors could get a taste of what life would be like in the near future .
At that time , commercial plastics were still new enough , and exotic enough , that they excited the public ’s imagination — any vision of the future must contain a great deal of these futuristic materials .
One of the largest manufacturers of plastic products at that time was Monsanto , a sponsor of numerous Disneyland exhibits .
The company was looking for ways to expand its markets , and at the same time gather data on the practicality and desirability of various plastics as construction materials .
At Monsanto ’s behest , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had spent years designing an entirely plastic house ; actual construction began in 1956 .
When Walt Disney heard about the house , he offered to let Monsanto display it at Disneyland .
After the House of the Future was finished in 1957 , it began attracting crowds at the rate of about 10,000 people per day .
The single - level house , whose exterior was fashioned from prefabricated fiberglass modules , looked like a giant white + sign .
The center rested on a pedestal , while the four cantilevered wings “ floated ” above the ground .
Each of the wings was a single room ( master bedroom , children ’s bedroom , living room , and dining / family room ) ; the center of the house contained the kitchen and a bathroom .
The house ’s main attraction was that the building itself and virtually everything inside was synthetic — the furniture , the upholstery , the carpets , the dishes , and even the clothes in the closets .
( The windows were made of glass , and there were of course some metal fixtures . )
Monsanto described the house as its prediction of what life would be like in 1987 — an impossibly distant 30 years into the future .
As such , the house naturally contained such marvels as a “ revolutionary ” microwave oven ( which was functional ) .
It also contained a number of non-functional mockups of devices that would surely be commonplace in 1987 , such as an ultrasonic dishwasher , video intercoms , and a large , wall - mounted , flat - screen TV ( missed it by that much ) .
Because visitors could walk through the house just as a real family would , it seemed entirely believable — if one example could exist , there was no reason to believe others could n’t be made as well .
And apparently , guests frequently claimed that they wanted , and would pay for , such a house .
But it was merely a proof of concept ; Monsanto had never intended to get into the prefab house business .
What ’s Not to Like ?
According to the marketing materials Monsanto provided , the appeal of plastic was self - evident : it was durable , long - lasting , easy to clean , waterproof , impervious to rot , and so on .
These claims are true enough .
But Monsanto also described the house and its fixtures using words like “ warmth , ” “ charm , ” and “ beauty ” — as though they could will those characteristics into existence simply by stating them .
Perhaps visitors really did think an all - synthetic living room could be warm and cozy 50 years ago , but I find it quite amusing that a comment like “ Hardly a natural material appears in anything like its original state ” was considered an enticing selling point .
Far from being warm and charming , the pictures I ’ve seen of the house strike me as sterile and soulless .
But , well … that ’s me .
By 1967 , public expectation about the future had changed significantly .
Some elements of the House of the Future had already become commonplace , while others seemed less and less likely .
The overall shape of the house , too , had gone out of style and looked increasingly dated .
So after showing the house to some 20 million visitors , Disney decided to tear it down .
An oft - told story , which may be apocryphal , is that the house was so indestructible that a wrecking ball bounced right off it ; it took weeks to dismantle the structure by hand .
If nothing else , the House of the Future epitomized the vaporware future of the 1960s — the shiny , labor - free , robot - assisted , flying - car lifestyle that , the media assured , was just around the corner .
Ten years .
OK , maybe 20 or even 30 , but basically imminent — definitely in your lifetime .
Modern visions of the future tend to be a lot more conservative , a lot grungier — in other words , a lot more like today , with maybe a bit more gadgetry .
And as much as I mourn the loss of that once - imagined future , I fully expect the actual future to be full of lovely natural materials .
Note :
This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on May 3 , 2005 .
MOSCOW , May 9 — President Vladimir V. Putin seemed to obliquely compare the foreign policy of the United States to the Third Reich in a speech on Wednesday commemorating the 62nd anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany .
The comments were the latest in a series of sharply worded Russian criticisms of the foreign policy of the United States — on Iraq , missile defense , NATO expansion and , more broadly , United States unilateralism in foreign affairs .
Many Russians say the sharper edge reflects a frustration that Russia ’s views , in particular opposition to NATO expansion , have been ignored in the West .
Outside of Russia , however , many detected in the new tone a return to cold - war - style antagonism , emboldened by petroleum wealth .
Mr. Putin ’s analogy was a small part of a larger speech , otherwise unambiguously congratulating Russian veterans of World War II , known here as the Great Patriotic War.
Mr. Putin spoke from a podium in front of Lenin ’s mausoleum on Red Square before troops mustered for a military parade .
Mr Callaghan lost his legs three years ago
Double amputee Brian Callaghan , 60 , was asked for his disabled pass entitling him to free travel , while boarding the number 17 First bus to Middleton .
" I 've got no legs , it 's pretty obvious , " he replied .
Bob Mason , of First Bus services , apologised to Mr Callaghan for any embarrassment and said an investigation into the incident had been started .
Mr Callaghan , from the Blackley area of the city , is a former bus driver himself and said other passengers were outraged when the driver refused to move .
His wife , Maria , 58 , had helped him onto the bus before purchasing her own £ 1.40 ticket .
We would be more than happy to send a representative from the company to meet with Mr Callaghan to discuss his concerns
Bob Mason , First Bus
" After my wife helped push me on to the bus , he shouted after us down the bus ' Oi , have you got a pass , mate ? '. "
" Everyone was shouting and saying : ' What 's wrong with this driver , is he for real ? '
" I felt all eyes on me - it was incredibly embarrassing and belittling .
" I 'm an easy - going guy - nothing fazes me normally - but I was gobsmacked at the driver 's attitude . "
Fortunately , Mr Callaghan was able to show the driver his pass - but he was left embarrassed by the incident .
Mr Callaghan , who worked as a bus driver in Greater Manchester for 17 years until 1980 , is planning to make a written complaint to First buses about his treatment on Sunday 25 March .
Investigation triggered
" In all my time working , I never once asked people for passes if they were obviously blind or disabled , " he added .
" That 's just unnecessary and unkind . "
Mr Callaghan lost his legs three years ago through diabetes , one six months after the other .
Although he and his wife have a car , they occasionally use public transport to visit friends for lunch .
Mr Mason , First 's service delivery director , said he was " saddened " to hear about Mr Callaghan 's experiences .
" I 'd like to apologise to him for any embarrassment and discomfort he experienced , " said Mr Mason .
" We need to establish all the facts so that we can learn what transpired and introduce steps , if necessary , to ensure there is no repeat at any time in the future .
" We would be more than happy to send a representative from the company to meet with Mr Callaghan to discuss his concerns . "
The nightmare scenario of a shutdown in the meridional ocean current that drives the Gulf Stream was dramatically portrayed in disaster film The Day After Tomorrow .
That scenario had Europe and North America plunged into a new ice age virtually overnight .
Although no scientist thinks the switch - off could happen that fast , they do agree that even a weakening over a few decades would have profound consequences .
The Gulf Stream originates in the Gulf of Mexico , flows up the US east coast , then crosses the Atlantic , where it splits in two , with one branch crossing to West Africa .
The other branch , the North Atlantic Drift , extends towards Europe .
The warm water it brings to Western Europe 's shores raises the temperature by as much as 10 degrees in some places and without it the continent would be much colder and drier .
Researchers are unsure what to make of the 10 - day hiatus in the current in 2004 .
" We 'd never seen anything like that before and we do n't understand it .
We did n't know it could happen , " said Harry Bryden , of Britain 's National Oceanography Centre , who presented the findings to a conference in Birmingham on rapid climate change .
Is it the first sign that the current is stuttering to a halt ?
" I want to know more before I say that , " Professor Bryden said .
Lloyd Keigwin , of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US , said the 2004 shutdown was " the most abrupt change in the whole [ climate ] record " .
" Suppose it lasted 30 or 60 days , when do you ring up the prime minister and say let 's start stockpiling fuel ? …
How can we rule out a longer one next year ? " he said .
Professor Bryden 's group stunned climate researchers last year with data suggesting that the flow rate of the Atlantic circulation had dropped by about 6 million tonnes of water a second from 1957 to 1998 .
If the current remained that weak , he predicted , it would lead to a one - degree drop in temperature in Britain in the next decade .
A complete shutdown would lead to a four - to six - degree cooling over 20 years .

Neurotechnology Growing a Brain in Switzerland
A network of artificial nerves is growing in a Swiss supercomputer -- meant to simulate a natural brain , cell - for - cell .
The researchers at work on " Blue Brain " promise new insights into the sources of human consciousness .
Captured on a home video camera , some electrons follow a straight path through superfluid helium ( far left ) .
Those entrained in a superfluid vortex follow a snakelike path .

To observe the motion of an electron – an elementary particle with a mass that is one billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a gram – has been considered to be impossible .
So when two Brown University physicists showed movies of electrons moving through liquid helium at the 2006 International Symposium on Quantum Fluids and Solids in Kyoto , they raised some eyebrows .
The images , which were published online on April 28 , 2007 , in the Journal of Low Temperature Physics , show scattered points of light moving down the screen – some in straight lines , some following a snakelike path .
The Matrix it ’s not .
Still , the fact that they can be seen at all is astounding .
“ We were astonished when we first saw an electron moving across the screen , ” said Humphrey Maris , a professor of physics at Brown University .
“ Once we had the idea , setting it up was surprisingly easy . ”
Maris and Wei Guo , a doctoral student , took advantage of the bubbles that form around electrons in supercold liquid helium .
Using sound waves to expand the bubbles and a coordinated strobe light to illuminate them , Guo was able to catch their movements on a home video camera .
A free electron repels the atoms that surround it , creating a small space , or bubble , around itself .
In conventional liquids , the bubble shrinks to nothing because the surface tension of the liquid works against the repulsive force .
Superfluid helium has very little surface tension , so the bubble can become much larger .
The two opposing forces balance when the diameter of the bubble is about 40 angstroms – still far to tiny to see .
The researchers used a planar transducer – basically , a loudspeaker that produces flat , not focused , sound waves – to pummel the whole volume of liquid helium with sound .
As each wave overtook an electron bubble , it alternately increased and decreased the surrounding pressure .
Under negative pressure , the bubbles expanded to about eight microns , the size of a small speck of dust , then shrank again as the next wave of high pressure washed over them .
A strobe light , synchronized to the sound pulse , illuminated the bubbles without overheating the chamber .
Running a camcorder in “ super night mode , ” Guo and Maris were able to record the approximately 2,000 photons they estimate were scattered by the expanded bubbles , producing a series of electron - bubble images on each frame of videotape .
“ The results are very original and really spectacular , ” said Sébastien Balibar , research director for physics at l’Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris , “ imaging single vortices of atomic size with a sound wave is an astonishing achievement . ”
To be sure they were seeing electron bubbles and not just trapped dust , the researchers gradually increased the power to the transducer .
They detected no points of light at low power and then a rapid increase in the appearance of bubbles at a particular voltage , just as their calculations predicted .
Dust particles would exhibit no such threshold .
The researchers had planned to introduce streams of electrons into the chamber from a radioactive source , but found that even without a source , a number of electrons could be seen moving through the chamber .
Most traveled in a fairly straight line leading away from the transducer , which produces a flow of heat down through the liquid .
A few of the electrons , however , followed a distinctly different snakelike path .
Maris and Guo hypothesize that those electrons are following the lines of superfluid vortices – a phenomenon akin to a tornado in which the liquid spins at high velocity around a line .
“ The vortex is like a piece of string running through the liquid , ” said Maris .
“ The electron bubble is attracted to the core of the vortex and gets attached to it .
It ’s as though it ’s sliding down this rope that winds through the fluid . ”
By following the path that the electron takes as it slides along the vortex , the researchers were able to observe vortex lines for the first time .
“ People never thought it would be possible to visualize the vortex lines , ” said Guo , “ but then , almost by accident , we saw them . ”

Story Highlights • Air Force rescue teams have more than 750 " saves " in Iraq , Afghanistan
• These teams work under constant threat of enemy fire as they rescue troops
• Their motto : ' That Others May Live '
Adjust font size :
AVON PARK AIR FORCE RANGE , Florida ( CNN ) --
As a member of the U.S. Air Force 's elite Combat Search and Rescue team , " Dan , " a pararescueman , or PJ , is used to saving the lives of fellow U.S. and coalition troops in battlefield situations .
But last month , he was the one in need of rescue .
During a mission in southeastern Afghanistan , he was critically injured in a Chinook helicopter crash that killed eight service members , including U.S. Army Rangers and a fellow pararescueman .
Before losing consciousness , Dan managed to give a medical assessment to a rescue team in another location .
As he lay in a hospital bed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , recovering from the injuries he suffered in Afghanistan , Dan said he could n't wait to get back to his unit .
We originally met " Dan , " a PJ , which is short for parajumper , right before he volunteered for that mission in Afghanistan .
" We 'll live up to our motto , ' That Others May Live , ' " he said to us during covert night - operations training in Florida swamplands .
" If you 're out there , we 'll go get you . "
( Watch PJs train for missions abroad )
The PJs are special operators within the Air Force , a kind of cross between a Green Beret and an emergency trauma paramedic .
These elite troops need to remain anonymous to work behind enemy lines , so actual names are avoided in this story .
Their job is considered one of the military 's toughest , and they are in constant demand .
Lately , headline after headline about aircraft that have gone down in Iraq and Afghanistan have reinforced that fact .
The team
For every helicopter that goes down , an Air Force Combat Search and Rescue team , which includes the PJs , must go into that same hostile territory to rescue and medically treat the downed crew .
The PJs are part of what 's called the Guardian Angel Weapon System , which includes combat rescue officers and survival , evasion , resistance and escape specialists .
Pilots and aircrews of high - tech rescue helicopters , A - 10 Warthog attack jets , fighter jets , reconnaissance aircraft and special refuelers round out the team .
" We 're spring - loaded , " said an A - 10 pilot whose call sign is " Batt . "
" You 're looking at a whole wing of people to put a couple of us guys on the ground to get one guy home , " PJ " John " added .
The PJs are the only unit designated by the Department of Defense primarily to rescue and recover U.S. personnel trapped behind enemy lines .
These units take on other special duties that they do not talk about , but their main mission is to save and bring people home from hostile territory .
( Gallery : View photos these troops took on their missions )
" The most comforting thing that was said to us was , ' Because of you guys , a warrior was brought back , ' " rescue helicopter pilot " TC " said .
Air Force officials credit their Combat Search and Rescue teams with more than 750 saves in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11 .
They also credit these units with saving more than 4,000 lives during and after Hurricane Katrina .
Hollywood has dramatized some of their exploits in movies such as " The Perfect Storm , " which showed rescues off the New England coast , and " Black Hawk Down , " which showed them helping bring back Army Rangers and others wounded or killed in helicopter crashes during the Battle of Mogadishu , Somalia , in 1993 .
The work has always been dangerous , but it is getting more so , according to one PJ : Insurgents have laid ambushes , or placed bombs or other " secondary devices , " that specifically target the rescue teams .
They call these " SAR traps , " short for Search and Rescue traps .
Six PJs have been killed since the beginning of both operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom .
Dan , the PJ injured in Afghanistan , said before he left for that special mission that his teammates know they can face hostilities every time they respond to a call .
" For the families of those soldiers and civilians , they should know we 'll go out there and do what we can ; we 'll put our lives on the line to bring that person home , " he said .
The tools
PJs head into war zones with an array of equipment : rafts , snowmobiles , scuba gear , 4 - wheelers , mountain - rappelling equipment , souped - up jet skis , medical equipment , off - road motorcycles , parachutes and oxygen masks for high - altitude jumps from aircraft .
They also carry a variety of weapons , from combat machine guns to sniper rifles .
This is what the PJs call " traveling light . "
" I remember laughing because PJs , before we deployed , they said , ' Sir , we need to bring our water gear , ' and I said , ' You 've got to be kidding me .
We 're going to the desert . '
And they said , ' You never know , we 've got be ready . '
I 'll be damned if I did n't have to eat crow , " helicopter pilot TC said .
After doing water rescues and helping recover downed aircraft , humvees and other U.S. military vehicles in lakes and canals in Iraq , TC changed his tune .
" I was like , ' OK , you guys won , if you want to bring snowmobiles to the desert , I 'm gonna let you , because who knows , it might be snowing that day . ' "
PJ training is among the toughest in the U.S. military 's special units , which include SEALs , Green Berets , DELTA Force and Marine Force Recon .
Nine out of 10 people who try to be PJs do not make it through the selection process .
PJs have to train in a variety of disciplines : parachuting , underwater combat , wilderness survival , trauma paramedic training and more .
If candidates do n't do well in one thing , they are out .
" It has to be , " PJ " Mark " tells me , " We 're talking about what could be the difference between life and death on every single mission we go out on . "
In the early days of the Iraq war , during the coalition 's " shock and awe " campaign , that training made a difference for " Chocks , " an A - 10 pilot whose plane was shot down by a surface - to - air missile over Baghdad .
He was on the ground , alone in hostile territory , afraid of becoming a prisoner of war .
" It 's a very primal , survival fear , not just of dying , but the pain associated with the way they [ the enemy ] make you die if they chose to actually do that .
It was a real fear , a very primal ' Come to Jesus , ' " Chocks said .
A rescue mission was launched immediately after Chocks ejected from his plane .
Two " Jolly " rescue helicopters and their crews , along with the PJs on board , came under fire while rescuing him .
But they got him back to safe territory .
" That vulnerability , that ' Oh God , I 'm going to get tortured , exploited , ' it evaporates , it 's gone , " he said about being rescued .
Today , as President Bush seeks to increase troop levels in Iraq , the need for rescues could grow .
The Air Force says its Combat Search and Rescue teams are ready to support that increased need .
The teams are also looking at potential future conflicts , in places such as Iran or North Korea .
" We 're ready to go anywhere , anytime , " said Brigadier Gen. Doug Raaberg of Air Combat Command .
" It 's kind of like a life insurance policy .

Muslims burned the flag of St George and called for the Queen to ' Go to Hell ' in a furious rally held in London over Salman Rushdie 's knighthood .
Angry Muslim extremists rallying at Regents Park Mosque said that anger over the award could match the fierce reaction to publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in Denmark in 2006 .
Organisers of a protest outside the mosque claimed several hundred demonstrators were denouncing the decision to reward Rushdie , whose novel " The Satanic Verses " led to a death threat from Iran in 1989 .
" This knighthood is just another example of Tony Blair and his government 's attempts to secularize Muslims and reward apostates , " said Anjem Choudray , protest organizer and an ex-head of the British wing of the banned radical group al - Muhajiroun .

" Rushdie is a hate figure across the Muslim world because of his insults to Islam , " Choudray said .
" This honour will have ramifications here and across the world " .
One of Britain 's leading Muslims has branded the flag burning protestors " strange lunatics . "
Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui , leader of the Muslim Parliament , condemned the protestors , saying : " This is unacceptable behaviour which the majority of Muslims in this country would not support .
" There 's no denying a large section of the Muslim community feel very hurt about this issue .
But having expressed your anger and frustration you 've got to move forward .
" Unfortunately there will always be some strange lunatics , like in any community , who give others a bad name . "
A prominent Iranian cleric has said the fatwa death warrant against author Salman Rushdie issued by the late Iranian Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini in 1989 was " still alive " in the Islamic Republic .

The comments by Ahmad Khatami at Friday prayers broadcast on state radio were the latest sign of the anger in Iran sparked by Britain 's decision to award a knighthood to Rushdie .
Muslims say his novel " The Satanic Verses " blasphemed against the Prophet Mohammad and ridiculed the Koran .
" In the Islamic Iran that revolutionary fatwa of Imam ( Khomeini ) is still alive and cannot be changed , " Khatami , who often rails against the West , told worshippers in Tehran .

In 1998 , Iran 's government formally distanced itself from the death warrant , but hardline groups in Iran regularly renew the call for his murder , saying Khomeini 's fatwa is irrevocable .
Pakistan 's parliament renewed a call on Friday for Britain to withdraw a knighthood for author Salman Rushie and apologise for hurting Muslim feelings .

Rushdie , whose 1988 novel " The Satanic Verses " outraged many Muslims around the world , was awarded a knighthood for services to literature in Queen Elizabeth 's birthday honours list last week .
Pakistan and Iran have protested against the honour and the Pakistani parliament condemned it in a resolution on Monday .
The National Assembly lower house of parliament passed another resolution on Friday expressing dismay Britain had not reversed its decision .

" The British government has not withdrawn the title which has not only disappointed the entire Pakistani nation but has also hurt it , " Parliamentary Affairs Minister Sher Afgan Niazi told the assembly .
" This august house again calls on the British government and its Prime Minister Tony Blair to immediately withdraw the title ... and tender an apology to the Muslim world . "
Muslims say Rushdie 's novel blasphemed against the Prophet Mohammad and ridiculed the Koran .
Britain has defended the knighthood , stressing the importance of free speech and saying it was part of a trend of honouring Muslims in the British community .
At least five people were killed and scores wounded in protests against the book in the Pakistani capital in 1989 .
Two days after that , the late Ayatollah Rohallah Khomeini , Iran 's supreme religious leader , issued a fatwa , or religious decree , calling on Muslims to kill the Indian - born British writer , who spent the next nine years living in hiding .
Religious Affairs Minister Mohammad Ejaz - ul - Haq , son of Pakistan 's late military president Mohammad Zia-ul - Haq , told the assembly this week that if someone committed a suicide bombing to protect the Prophet Mohammad 's honour , his act was justified .
He later said he did not mean such attacks were justified but was merely saying militants could use the knighthood as a justification for violence .
A hardline cleric called on Wednesday for Rushdie to be killed and the next day the speaker of the Punjab provincial assembly said blasphemers should be killed .
A group of traders in Islamabad on Thursday offered a reward of 10 million rupees ( $ 165,000 ) to anyone who killed Rushdie .

A protein acting as a long - distance signal from leaf to shoot - tip tells plants when to flower , says new research published in Science Express on Thursday 19 April 2007 .
The study reveals the likely mechanism by which the Arabidopsis plant flowers in response to changes in day length .
Earlier research had shown that plants ' leaves perceived seasonal changes in day length , which triggers a long - distance signal to travel through the plant 's vascular system from the leaf to the shoot apex , where flowering is induced .
However , the identity of the long - distance signal remained unclear .
This new research , carried out by scientists at Imperial College London and the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne , has led to the proposal that this signal is a protein known as Flowering Locus T Protein ( FT protein ) , which is produced in leaves by the Flowering Locus T gene ( FT gene ) .
It travels through the plant 's vascular system to the shoot apex , where it activates other genes , causing the plant to flower .
The research team were able to track the progress of the protein through the plant by tagging it with a green fluorescent protein originally isolated from jellyfish , allowing it to be detected in living tissues using highly sensitive microscope systems .
The team then grafted two plants together , only one of which contained the gene for the fluorescent version of FT .
This allowed them to show conclusively that FT protein moved from where it was produced in the leaves of one plant , across into the other plant .
The FT protein is produced when the FT gene is switched on by another gene known as CONSTANS .
This is a key gene expressed in leaves which reacts to changes in day length .
Dr Colin Turnbull from Imperial College London 's Division of Biology , who carried out the research , said : " This could be a really important breakthrough in plant science .
Since the 1930s when it first became clear that something was communicating the perception of changes in day length in leaves to the shoot apex , and causing flowering , scientists have been trying to work out exactly how this mechanism works .
" Over the past couple of years several labs made exciting discoveries all pointing to the FT gene being central to controlling flowering time .
Now that we have been able to track FT protein moving from its source in leaves to its destination in the shoot tip , we have a plausible explanation for how plants respond to day length .
Parallel work in Japan shows very similar mechanisms operating in rice , so there is immediate potential to translate research into practical benefits for food crops .
The ability to control flowering is of enormous commercial significance across food and non-food species , for example extending production seasons or designing plants better adapted to changing climate . "

Rape victim seeks President 's nod to end life
Anand Mohan Sahay in Muzaffarpur | February 22 , 2007 13:12 IST
A rape victim from Muzaffarpur district in Bihar has sought justice or permission to die from President A P J Abdul Kalam .
In a letter written in Hindi , the 16 - year - old girl , hailing from Patahi village in the district , requested the President to either intervene and get her justice or allow her to die because some powerful people , who she claims are relatives of her rapist , were threatening to torture and humiliate her .
She informed that fear , threat and social abuse had forced her father to flee the village and that she had stop going to school .
According to the police complaint filed by her , she was allegedly raped by Jimmy , her neighbour Anil Thakur 's son , on September 27 .
" I was raped at the dagger point , " she said .
During the course of investigation , the police found her allegations to be true and arrested Jimmy .
But trouble started when police tried to speed up the case trial .
" Thakur 's family and their caste men threatened us to withdraw the case and leave the village , " she said , claiming that in the last five months , not only was she being tortured , but her family members too were being humiliated time and again .
" They even threatened to repeat the incident with my younger sister , " she claimed in the letter .
Even as the girl awaits a reply from the President , Tirhut range DIG Gupteshwar Pandey told rediff.com on Thursday that the police will do everything to provide security to the rape victim and go for speedy trial of the case .
Is science harmed by the reckless use of ... metaphors ?
Carl Philips , Brian Guenzel and Paul Bergen are hopping mad about bad metaphors .
Writing in the Journal of Harm Reduction , they pull on their imaginary boxing gloves .
Stepping into the ring , so to speak , they declare : " Anti-harm - reduction advocates sometimes resort to pseudo - analogies to ridicule harm reduction .
Those opposed to the use of smokeless tobacco as an alternative to smoking sometimes suggest that the substitution would be like jumping from a three - storey building rather than a 10 - storey , or like shooting yourself in the foot rather than the head . "
Following their summary of these two disagreeable analogies , Philips , Guenzel and Bergen proceed to administer a good thrashing .
They have collected several versions of the " jump from a building " metaphor .
While some metaphor makers " likened smoking to falls from at least the 10th floor and smokeless tobacco to falls from at least the third , we found numbers as high as 50 and 30 " .
These are beneath contempt , they explain , because " anyone with a passing familiarity with the human body and earth 's gravity should be aware that falls from the 10th storey are almost always fatal " .
Perhaps unsure of their own familiarity with the human body and Earth 's gravity , they conduct a review of the available literature on mortality rates as a function of free - fall distance .
" It is surprising , " they write , " how little information is published on the topic .
The literature suggests that falls from up to the third storey are almost always survived , with the death rate increasing sharply and approaching 100 % over the next three or four storeys .
" More accurate analogies might actually be fairly useful in painting the picture for consumers .
A non-trivial portion of young men have probably jumped from a second - storey window , but few would dare jump from the fourth . "
This is their main line of attack , and they go at it from other directions , too .
In the second bout , they pummel the " gunshot to the head " metaphor , applying a devastating one - two punch combination :
· " It is immediately obvious that the gunshot metaphor is absurd : if someone was faced with the choice of shooting himself in the head and shooting himself in the foot or leg , the latter option is quite obviously better from a health - outcomes perspective . "
· " Mortality risk from self - inflicted gunshot wounds to the head dwarfs that from smoking , while foot wounds , though they have a low mortality rate , have a high probability of permanent debilitating orthopedic damage , a risk absent in tobacco use . "
In the end , they let slip what has most got up their nose .
" The metaphors , " they write , " exhibit a flippant tone that seems inappropriate for a serious discussion of health science . "
Philips and Bergen are at the University of Alberta in Edmonton .
Guenzel is at the centre for philosophy , health and policy sciences in Houston , Texas .

But there is neither East nor West , Border , nor Breed , nor Birth
When two strong men stand face to face , tho ’ they come from the ends of the earth !
Rudyard Kipling , “ The Ballad of East and West ”
--
THE TWO POLITICAL celebrities liked those lines so much that they put them on their campaign poster .
The words framed a portrait of the two - man team : a popular , charismatic governor of California and a wealthy , well - known politician from New York .
It was 1912 .
The New Yorker , former President Teddy Roosevelt , had left the Republican Party to take the presidential nomination of the dissident Progressive Party .
( “ We stand at Armageddon , and we battle for the Lord , ” he declared with characteristic bombast . )
The Californian , Gov. Hiram Johnson , had helped talk Roosevelt into the move and abandoned the GOP himself to take the second spot on the Progressive ticket .
The two big personalities were motivated by a mutual need for attention and a shared disgust with interest groups and partisan politics .
Last week , two more outsized politicians from both coasts , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , stood together at a conference in Los Angeles to denounce Washington and partisans of both parties .
Schwarzenegger publicly encouraged Bloomberg to make an independent run for president , and Bloomberg took a step in that direction , announcing that he was dropping his registration as a Republican .
The two men even arranged themselves in a familiar pose for Time magazine .
The inside shot is similar to the 1912 campaign poster .
Like Roosevelt and Johnson , Schwarzenegger and Bloomberg , wearing suits and serious expressions , were photographed from below , in a way that made them look taller than they really are .
“ Who Needs Washington ? ” asked the Time cover headline .
Inside , the magazine labeled its article “ The New Action Heroes ” and raised the possibility of a Bloomberg presidential candidacy in 2008 .
It was n’t Kipling , but the message was familiar .
The dream Schwarzenegger and Bloomberg embody — of a unity politics practiced by larger - than - life men who are bigger than geography , bigger than ethnic or religious origins and bigger than party politics — remains as alluring as it was 95 years ago .
The Time article went so far as to quote Warren Buffett suggesting Schwarzenegger run as Bloomberg ’s vice president .
The idea of a Bloomberg - Schwarzenegger ticket soon made its way through the media universe , trumpeted by the Associated Press , the New York tabloids , the San Francisco Chronicle , the San Jose Mercury News and even the website of this newspaper .
That such a notion got such play , even though a Schwarzenegger vice presidency is blatantly unconstitutional ( a foreign - born person is n’t eligible to be president and hence ca n’t be vice president either ) testifies to the enduring appeal of political celebrity and independence .
Still , the governor could be a force for Bloomberg even if he ca n’t run with him .
And if the mayor takes the governor ’s advice and does run , and if Schwarzenegger throws his celebrity into backing Bloomberg , the history of the 1912 campaign will be relevant .
Alas , its lessons do not bode well for either man .
Bloomberg , like Roosevelt , is a reluctant candidate who seems in no hurry to get in the race .
Given the procedural demands of such a campaign , that reticence could prove costly .
Roosevelt suffered by starting late .
( Johnson ’s papers , on file at UC Berkeley , are full of letters to Roosevelt , begging him to commit to making a race . )
The campaign was disorganized and plagued by calamities .
Less than a month before the election , Roosevelt was shot in Milwaukee .
He survived , but he could n’t do much on the stump .
Johnson , a far better speaker than Roosevelt , took over and performed ably , but it was n’t enough .
The ticket finished second , beating the incumbent Republican president but losing the presidency to Democrat Woodrow Wilson .
Venturing so much and losing , both men forfeited power and influence .
Roosevelt did not run for office again .
He died in 1919 .
Johnson , returning to Sacramento as a Progressive , was abandoned by important allies and proved so ineffective that he jumped to the U.S. Senate midway through his second term .
He returned to the Republican fold , but lingering suspicion about his partisan loyalty helped deny Johnson the Republican presidential nomination in 1920 .
Schwarzenegger and Bloomberg , popular lame ducks , have uncertain political futures .
Both have been talked about for state offices —
Bloomberg for governor , Schwarzenegger for Senate — but neither post would seem a natural fit .
An independent presidential campaign would raise their national profiles .
But what chance would there be of success ?
Given the 1912 campaign , not to mention the third - party attempts since then , the answer might have been expressed by Kipling , in two verses immediately preceding the ones that Roosevelt and Johnson used in their poster :
Oh , East is East , and West is West , and never the twain shall meet
Tushnet provides an illustrative example :
A crude example , far more crude than a full analysis would be : Prior to the New Deal , Congress initiated legislation subject to modest review by the President , whereas after the New Deal the President initiated legislation subject to modest review by Congress .
And , during the transformative period when Franklin D. Roosevelt was attempting to construct a new constitutional order , his efforts to seize the legislative initiative were understood to be challenges to settled pre-constitutional understandings about the relation between President and Congress -- and , as such , revolutionary .
Tushnet 's article dates from 2003 .
How might we illustrate the concept of constitutional hardball today ?
Would we conclude that the Bush " administration 's " assertion of broad , unconstrained executive power -- including the power to abrogate federal law ( like FISA ) -- constitutes an example ?
How about this " administration 's " understanding and use of signing statements , no longer used merely as markers denoting the President 's position on matters of constitutional law , but rather as policy directives to the entirety of the executive branch as to how to interpret and execute the law ?
The novel concept , driven by Tom DeLay ( with Jack Abramoff 's money ) , that Republican - controlled states could and should redraw their Congressional districts in between the accepted ten year intervals , purely for partisan advantage ?
The application of political litmus testing to the appointment of U.S. Attorneys ?
The White House 's assertion that its senior officials are not subject to the subpoena power of the Congress ?
Or perhaps the Military Commissions ( read : Torture ) Act ?
Political actors can play constitutional hardball with substantive principles .
Proponents of a constitutional transformation will propose legislation that pushes the envelope of existing constitutional doctrine .
The proposed statutes will not be obviously unconstitutional , because constitutional hardball consists of actions that are plausibly defensible under existing constitutional doctrine .
But , they will signal that their proponents have a substantially different understanding of government 's role than had seemed settled .
And , importantly , the proposals , if enacted , might have the effect of enhancing the political strength of the coalition seeking to change the constitutional order .
So what does it look like to lose a " game " of constitutional hardball ?
The high - stakes characteristic of constitutional hardball shows that hardball is an element of the more general phenomenon Jack Balkin and Sanford Levinson identified as partisan entrenchment .
According to Balkin and Levinson , large - scale changes in deep institutional arrangements occur through a process of partisan entrenchment .
Balkin and Levinson focus on partisan entrenchment in the courts .
" When a party wins the White House , it can stock the federal judiciary with members of its own party , assuming a relatively acquiescent Senate . "
In doing so , the president extends his party 's policy positions , and its positions on the meaning of the Constitution , over a much longer period than his own presidency .
And , once the judges are in place , " they start to change the understandings of the Constitution that appear in positive law . "
For Balkin and Levinson , partisan entrenchment means that " [ p] arties who control the presidency install jurists of their liking -- given whatever counterweight the Senate provides . "
The process of partisan entrenchment should , I believe , be understood more broadly than Balkin and Levinson 's initial presentation .
The full process of partisan entrenchment has several stages , in which control of the courts in only one phase .
First , proponents of a particular set of arrangements gain control over one component of the government .
They then use that control to devise mechanisms that ensure their continued control of that component .
For example , they might develop ways of implementing civil service regulations , intended to eliminate eliminating partisan influence on the lower levels of the bureaucracy , so that lower - level bureaucrats are in fact committed to a particular partisan program .
U.S. Attorneys replaced -- without Senate advice and consent -- according to partisan litmus tests ?
Or , perhaps more important , they set their substantive legislative or executive agenda to attract strong support from some , and to demobilize their opponents .
Huge and lopsided tax cuts for the " base ? "
The enormous shift of federal grant resources from community - based to " faith - based " organizations ?
Further , those who control one component of the government try to leverage that control into taking control of other components .
Mid-census , partisan redistricting plans approved by Justice Department political operatives despite unanimous opposition from career civil servants in the Voting Rights section ?
Federal and local law enforcement using " enhanced powers " of surveillance to infiltrate and undermine opposition activists ?
The use of highly politicized U.S. Attorneys '
Offices to strategically prosecute local Democrats ?
And what are the stakes involved in losing such a " game ? "
The stakes are high when politicians play political hardball , that is , because the politicians believe that the winners might end up with permanent control ( meaning , control for the full time - horizon of today 's politicians ) of the entire government .
The winner of constitutional hardball takes everything , and the loser loses everything .
Pretty serious , would n't you say ?
And yet , it is precisely the Serious People -- that is , the political punditry and the forgers of the Conventional Wisdom -- who counsel us to ignore the dynamics of constitutional hardball , to seek the " middle ground , " and prize the art of " bipartisan compromise . "
What might be the result of such an asymmetrical response ?
Tushnet answers :
I suspect that most readers are likely to think that there is something distasteful about constitutional hardball as a process .
After all , playing for keeps in politics is , it might be thought , a recipe for social disaster , leading at the extreme to genocide and annihilation of the enemy .
Even short of that , constitutional hardball might lead to unpleasant personal relations among politically active people .
And , as L. Michael Seidman has emphasized , playing for keeps might be wrong just because it fails to acknowledge the possibility that one 's political - constitutional opponents might actually be right about the Constitution -- a possibility that , according to Seidman , is ever - present .
Note , though , that some of these normative questions are not about constitutional hardball itself , but are about what happens when someone wins the game .
Consider , for example , the sheer distastefulness of constitutional hardball .
That problem could be eliminated after constitutional transformation occurs -- after , that is , we emerge from the tunnel into the new constitutional order .
Then , the politicians having control of the government can revert to ordinary constitutional politics , and their opponents can , like Eisenhower and Nixon in 1960 , play the game on the winners ' terms , hoping to pick up a victory or two themselves .
If our normative misgivings are founded in simple distaste for constitutional hardball , exacerbated by the fact that politicians have been playing it for more than twenty years now , we can take solace in the possibility that someday the Republicans might win .
So , what do you say , folks ?
Shall we bide our time and rely on the courts to fix it all for us ?
Will oversight and exposure of the Nixon / Bush doctrine be enough ?
Will Americans finally and miraculously simply awaken to the realities of constitutional transformation ?
Did the Clinton impeachment really make us so afraid of the process itself that it should be considered unavailable to us in combating the constitutional - level game undertaken by Republicans ?
Is this really something we can actually debate our way out of ?
Can we really afford to head into 2008 under the banner of " bipartisan cooperation ? "

Sharp Silhouette

Explanation :
Though it 's 93 million miles away , the Sun still hurts your eyes when you look at it .
But bright sunlight ( along with accurate planning and proper equipment ! ) resulted in this sharp silhouette of spaceship and space station .
The amazing telescopic view , recorded on September 17 , captures shuttle orbiter Atlantis and the International Space Station in orbit over planet Earth .
At a range of 550 kilometers from the observing site near Mamers , Normandy , France , Atlantis ( left ) has just undocked and moved about 200 meters away from the space station .
Tomorrow , yet another satellite of planet Earth can be seen in silhouette - the Moon will eclipse the Sun .
This last eclipse of 2006 will be seen as an annular solar eclipse along a track that crosses northern South America and the south Atlantic .
TECH firms constantly moan about software piracy and no wonder .
Last year it accounted for 35 % of the worldwide market and cost the industry $ 39.6 billion according to the Business Software Alliance , a trade body .
America and China lead the world in terms of total losses from piracy at $ 7.2 billion and $ 5.4 billion respectively .
But when calculated according to the number of computers in each country a different picture emerges .
Cash - strapped countries dominate the leader board .
In Azerbaijan , which comes out on top , computers are loaded with $ 262 - worth of pirated software on average .
But Iceland is the surprise second - placed nation : although software to the tune of $ 32 m is pirated it is spread over only a few computers .

Hagel hints at Hagel / Bloomberg presidential ticket David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Sunday May 13 , 2007 Print This Email This
When asked about the possibility of a 2008 presidential run as an independent , Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - NE ) this morning told CBS Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer that he is " not happy with the Republican party today . "
" It 's been hijacked by a group of single - minded , almost isolationists , power projectors , " he said , indicating that he would make a decision about whether to run for president by late summer .
Independent candidates are " good for the system , " continued Hagel .
" I think we 're living today at the most unpredictable political time in modern history . "
America , he went on , is looking for " honest , competent , accountable leadership . "
" I think a credible third ticket , third party , would be good for the system , " said Hagel .
" It would force both parties , that have been hijacked by the extremes of their two parties , and I think we would want something like .
I would hope this country has some options like that .
I think it shakes the system up , the system needs to be shaken up .
This country 's in trouble . "
The senator went on to heap praise on New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg , who is also said to be considering a possible presidential run .
When asked directly about a potential Hagel / Bloomberg ticket for 2008 , Hagel responded , " It 's a great country to think about a New York boy , and a Nebraska boy to be teamed up leading this nation . "
The following video is from CBS 's Face the Nation .

Noare people going to know this is photoshopped .
"
The first new - look issue , on newsstands tomorrow , features what appears to be a photo of Ronald Reagan with a fat tear sliding down his cheek , illustrating the cover story , " How the Right Went Wrong . "
A somewhat cryptic credit in small type on the ( revamped ! ) table of contents describes the image this way : " Photograph by David Hume Kennerly .
Tear by Tim O'Brien . "
Nowhere does it specifically state that the cover is a photo illustration — in other words , that it 's Photoshopped . "
The exchange came as the administration is seeking new legislation to update the surveillance act to expand the government ’s surveillance powers , in part to deal with vast changes in communications technology since 1978 , when the measure was enacted .
The White House says that the outmoded rules embedded in the law mean that the government cannot eavesdrop on some telephone calls , e-mail and other communications that do not involve Americans or impinge on the privacy rights of people inside the United States .
While administration officials , citing national security concerns , have declined to discuss publicly what communications gaps they wish to plug , their proposed legislation seems designed to single out so - called “ transit traffic , ” purely international telephone calls and e-mail that go from one foreign country to another , but happen to be digitally routed through the United States telecommunications system .
The administration ’s proposal would also provide legal immunity for telecommunications companies that cooperated with the National Security Agency ’s surveillance program without warrants before it was brought under the surveillance act in January .
It would also provide legal protections for government workers who took part in the N.S.A. program .
Several Democratic lawmakers expressed frustration on Tuesday that the administration had not provided documents related to the National Security Agency program , which the White House called the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
They suggested that they would be reluctant to agree to a change in the surveillance law without more information from the White House .
“ To this day , we have never been provided the presidential authorization that cleared that program to go or the attorney general - Department of Justice opinions that declared it to be lawful , ” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , Democrat of Rhode Island .
“ Where ’s the transparency as to the presidential authorizations for this closed program ?
That ’s a pretty big ‘ we ’re not going to tell you ’ in this new atmosphere of trust we ’re trying to build . ”
Congress ’s last effort to craft a decent energy strategy , in 2005 , was largely disappointing .
But at the risk of getting our hopes up once again , we call attention to two promising bills making their way to the Senate floor .
Stapled together , they could make a constructive start toward reducing this country ’s dependence on oil imports and its emissions of greenhouse gases .
The first , championed by Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici of New Mexico , has three main objectives .
It seeks to reduce oil consumption by quintupling the production of biofuels — principally ethanol from sources other than corn — by 2022 .
It would mandate stronger efficiency standards for energy - intensive household appliances , including lighting fixtures and refrigerators .
And , perhaps most important , it would try to bring to commercial scale the government ’s nascent efforts to build coal - fired power plants capable of capturing and storing emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas .
Coal will remain the world ’s most plentiful fuel , and unless some way is found to neutralize its emissions , the battle to stabilize emissions is almost certainly lost .
The other important bill , known as the Ten - in - Ten Fuel Economy Act , was approved last week and is mainly the handiwork of Senator Dianne Feinstein of California .
It would raise the fuel economy standard for passenger cars from 25 to 35 miles per gallon over the next 10 years , and — for the first time — would require steady improvements in fuel efficiency for medium and heavy - duty trucks .
The debate over fuel economy has been deadlocked for three decades , and approval of this bill would represent a major breakthrough .

At my local recycling center , the first bin is labeled “ commingled containers . ”
Whoever dreamed up this term could have taken the easy way out and just written “ cans and bottles . ”
But no , the author opted for words out of the bureaucrat ’s style book , and chose the raised - pinky elegance of a phrase distant from normal English .
He also added poor spelling ( “ comingled , ” also a correct spelling , would have been clearer ) and pointless redundancy ( the concept of “ co ” is already embedded in the word “ mingled ” ) .
How did they pack so many errors into two words of modern environmental prose ?
At the beginning of his 1946 essay “ Politics and the English Language , ” George Orwell made clear that he thought the language had become disheveled and decadent .
Intending shock , Orwell offered five examples of subliterate prose by known writers .
But these selections do n’t look as ghastly to us as they did to Orwell , because language is so much worse today .
Consider some recent usages .
In plain English , what does it mean when students “ achieve a deficiency ” or reach a “ suboptimal outcome ? ”
It means they failed .
A “ suboptimal outcome ” is even worse in a hospital .
It means the patient died .
The airline industry sometimes speaks of a “ hull loss . ”
What it means is that a plane just crashed .
Here ’s more twisted language : your doorman is now known as an “ access controller , ” and a receptionist is a “ director of first impressions . ”
Hospital bills can be filled with such language .
How about a “ thermal therapy unit ” — an ice bag — or a “ disposable mucus recovery unit , ” also known as a box of Kleenex ?
But the institution that wins the coveted convoluted - language award is the government — any government , in any country .
A U.S. document speaks of “ ground - mounted confirmatory route markers . ”
Translation : road signs .
In Oxford , England , city officials decided to “ examine the feasibility of creating a structure in Hinksey Park from indigenous vegetation . ”
They were talking about planting a tree to get some shade .
Joyce Kilmer ’s famously awful non-poem reads : “ Poems are made by fools like me / But only God can make a tree . ”
Today , Kilmer might have to write : “ Versified and rhythmic non-prose verbal arrangements are fashioned by people of alternative intelligence such as myself , but only the divine entity , should he or she actually exist , can create a solar - shielding park structure from low - rise indigenous vegetative material . ”
The words of bureaucrats may twist tongues , but language on today ’s college campus can truly twist minds .
Many prominent people , particularly academics , have invented new ways to torture the English language .
My friend Denis Dutton , a philosophy professor who runs the Arts & Letters Daily website , launched a bad writing contest to honor these masters of gobbledygook .
The grand prize winner was Judith Butler , a well - known professor at the University of California–Berkeley who wrote this impenetrable sentence : “ The move from a structuralist account . . . marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony . . . ”
The sentence rattled on that way for 94 words .
Another well - known professor , Martha Nussbaum , has said that Butler ’s prose “ bullies the reader into granting that , since one cannot figure out what is going on , there must be something significant going on . ”
Other professors have defended Butler on the grounds that English specialists , like technical analysts , are entitled to use private language that ’s foreign to nonspecialists .
Think about that : these professors are taking pride in prose that readers can’t comprehend .
Remember when NYU professor Alan Sokal submitted a nearly impenetrable article to the postmodern magazine Social Text , arguing that gravity was a social construct ?
The magazine printed it as a serious piece , so Sokal had to explain his hoax to the editors .
If you think gravity is n’t real , he said , I invite you to walk out my window and test the theory .
I live on the 21st floor .
Several kinds of writing heresy are thriving in the universities .
One is that the ability to write is so unimportant that it should be expected only in humanities departments , maybe just in English courses .
Another is the romantic notion that rules , coherence , grammar , and punctuation are unimportant : what counts is the gushing of the writing self .
One adherent of this school of thought told me that we should no longer talk about misspellings , but personal spellings .
The self decides what is right and wrong .
Writing in The Public Interest , City Journal contributing editor Heather Mac Donald has reported that “ students who have been told in their writing class to let their deepest selves loose on the page and not worry about syntax , logic , or form have trouble adjusting to their other classes — the ones in which evidence and analysis are more important than personal revelation or feelings . ”
Grammar and clear expression are under another kind of attack as well .
Rules , good writing , and simple coherence are sometimes depicted as habits of the powerful and privileged .
James Sledd , professor emeritus of English at the University of Texas , writes in the textbook College English that standard English is “ essentially an instrument of domination . ”
If proper English is oppressive , what could be more logical than setting out to undermine it ?
English Leadership Quarterly ran an article urging teachers to encourage intentional writing errors as “ the only way to end its oppression of linguistic minorities and learning writers . ”
The pro-error article , written by two professors at Indiana University of Pennsylvania , actually won an award from the quarterly , a publication of the National Council of Teachers of English .
So you can now win awards for telling the young to write badly .
Some campuses have evolved a separate tongue , marked in large part by stretching the meaning of words to make speech sound like punishable action .
Simple criticism , for example , emerges as “ intellectual harassment , ” or perhaps “ semantic violence . ”
And if funding for mostly black schools is too low , that ’s “ intellectual genocide . ”
When Lani Guinier ’s controversial plan for proportional voting drew protests , she accused her critics of “ non-traditional violence . ” “ Non-traditional ” is a common weasel word these days .
“ Non-traditional students ” refers to older students .
One feminist referred to a friend who was having an affair with a “ non-traditional man . ”
She meant that he was not a member of the chattering classes : he was a plumber .
Political speech is a mess as well , larded with euphemism and evasion .
In 1990 , I was startled to learn that GOPAC , the Republican political action committee controlled by Newt Gingrich , was shipping words to Republicans around the country so that the speeches of local politicians would sound like Newt .
GOPAC supplied positive words to use when referring to the GOP : courage , moral , children , choice , and personal , for instance , and ugly words to pin on Democrats , including bizarre , collapse , red tape , sensationalists , and anti-flag .
These words presumably could be combined in any order — “ collapsing anti-flag sensationalists , ” for instance , or “ morally courageous pro-flag children . ”
Out of curiosity I looked up Newt ’s last major speech , delivered to the Heritage Foundation , and found that it really was n’t a speech at all .
It was a collection of 238 GOPAC buzzwords , lightly connected by a few ordinary nontoxic words .
One cause of bad language is the influx of intentional ambiguity from the world of advertising .
What was the meaning of Nike ’s famous slogan , “ Just Do It ” ?
Did it mean , do n’t procrastinate , do n’t debate your options endlessly , just seize the moment and act ?
Or did it mean , forget about scruples and conscience , go get what you want ?
This kind of ambiguity shows up in the prose of the right - to - die movement .
Take the phrase “ aid in dying . ”
Does it mean moral support for a dying person , help in committing suicide , or putting a sick patient to death without consent ?
It means whatever you take it to mean .
All around us is prose intended not to convey meaning , but to mask and distort .
Many awful expressions of the day emerge out of misguided compassion .
An example is a long New York Times discussion of a famous writer ’s plagiarism .
The Times could not bring itself to use the P - word , but talked delicately of “ unacknowledged repetitions ” and “ inappropriate borrowings , ” since it did not want to hurt the plagiarist ’s feelings .
The idea of offending or hurting feelings can lead to the greatest corruption of language .
It can undermine the straight , simple prose that communicates ideas , images , or yes , even feelings , to a great number of people .
So how should we write and restore the integrity of good English ?
Candor , clarity and sincerity are important keys .
All of us are weary of writers who dance around their subjects , protecting friends , bending facts to push a cause .
“ The great enemy of clear language is insincerity , ” Orwell wrote .
“ When there is a gap between one ’s real and declared aims , one turns instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms . ”
Further , our minds are clogged with the clichés , idioms , and rhythms of other people , and we have to work to avoid them .
Paul Johnson says , “ Most people when they write , including most professional writers , tend to slip into seeing events through the eyes of others because they inherit stale expressions and combinations of words , threadbare metaphors , clichés and literary conceits .
This is particularly true of journalists . ”
Kurt Vonnegut has said that a writer ’s natural style will almost always be drawn from the speech he heard as a child .
Vonnegut grew up in Indiana , where , he said , “ common speech sounds like a band saw cutting galvanized tin . ”
He wrote : “ I myself find I trust my own writing most and other people seem to trust it most , when I sound most like a person from Indianapolis , which is what I am . ”
When I started my column in U.S. News & World Report 18 years ago , I decided to write in a conversational style .
This meant I would never use words such as “ nonetheless , ” “ moreover , ” “ albeit , ” and “ to be sure , ” because they are in nobody ’s speaking vocabulary .
It also meant that I wrote as though I were addressing each reader personally , talking about something that interested us both .
My model here , believe it or not , was John Madden , the football announcer .
Madden is the most famous TV football analyst not because he knows the most , though he may , but because he sounds like a friend on the next bar stool watching the game and sharing his thoughts with you .
After a month or so , I realized that readers of columns do n’t just follow the words .
They listen to the background music too .
Readers want to know who you are .
Is the writer consistent and fair ?
Does his take on the world relate to me ?
Is he humorless or playful ?
Do I want to spend time with him ?
Is he in the pocket of some cause or political party ?
A few years ago , I taught a summer class in nonfiction writing at Southampton College on Long Island .
I was very impressed by the students ’ abilities , but they had a group flaw : they wanted to write primarily about their own feelings .
One day I said : Write me 2000 words on any subject , but do n’t use the word “ I . ” Many in the class balked at this and wrote their essays with great difficulty .
Confusing an opinion with an argument has one big advantage .
The text is uncriticizable , since the writer can always say , “ It ’s my prose and I ’m entitled to my opinion . ”
But writing is n’t a personal or private enterprise .
It ’s an attempt to change consciousness and change the world .
In his book The Ethics of Rhetoric , Richard Weaver says that the right to utter a sentence is one of the world ’s greatest freedoms .
It is the “ liberty to handle the world , to remake it , if only a little , and to hand it to others in a shape which may influence their actions . ”
Speech and writing constitute what Weaver calls “ the office of assertion , ” a force adding itself to the other forces of the world .
Writing is power .
If you write well , you can have an impact .

Australia ’s current drought , the worst in a century , is driving its feral camels mad with thirst .
The country ’s 1 million wild camels , the largest population in the world , are stampeding through Western Australian towns looking for water .
“ They did a lot of damage searching for water , ” a townswoman told Reuters , “ trampling air conditioning hoses , taps , and pipes . ”
Despite these attempts , thousands of the animals are being found dead along the dried - up banks of the Docker River .
The camels , which usually travel in groups of about 100 animals , were first introduced to Australia around 1840 to provide transportation through the dangerously hot and expansive deserts of Western and Central Australia .
The several different breeds –slender riding camels from the Middle East , two - humped camels from China , and draft camels from India–were essential cargo vehicles for the country ’s many infrastructure projects .
But by 1930 , autos had replaced camels and the animals were left to fend for themselves .
Left alone , the animals flourished in the desert and today camels are an epic problem Down Under , particularly for the Aboriginees who live in more remote areas of the contintent .
In an attempt to control populations , Australia captures and sends live camels to Southeast Asia and hope to send 25,000 a year to Muslim markets .
Even such measures will be insufficient to deal with animals that live for 50 years , breed for 30 , and whose population doubles every eight years .
As global warming increases the droughts , gangs of hundreds of thirsty camels will most likely continue to be a force to reckon with .
Researchers are meeting in Perth tomorrow to decide their fate .

When I started out in this game , the police went round in pairs and rarely appeared in the papers .
There 'd be stories appealing for witnesses to a crime , an Identikit photo of a suspect would be issued and an inspector would occasionally read out a short statement outside court following a successful conviction .
And that was about it .
These days , there are just a handful of bobbies left on the beat , while the rest are sitting behind locked doors in police stations closed to the public - filling in forms , attending diversity seminars and suing each other for racial and sexual harassment .
The politicisation of the police is all but complete .
Come back at 3 pm on Wednesday , May 2 for a live webchat with Richard Littlejohn
Scroll down for more ...
No one wants to go back to the rough - and - tumble days of 1970s Regan and Carter policing that 's recently been getting an airing on BBC1's Life On Mars .
( Oh , I dunno . )
But at least back then , the Old Bill solved more real crimes and nicked more villains .
So what happened to all the " tough - on - crime " rhetoric that Tony Blair fed us ?
Well , there 's still plenty of crime out there - just not the kind of " crime " most of us recognise .
Here 's a handful of cases to give you a true flavour of modern policing .
• West Yorkshire Police scrambled a £ 3.3 million , 180 mph helicopter to chase two boys suspected of taking a pedalo in a boating lake without paying .
The desperados were duly rounded up and charged - but whether with nicking the pedalo or pedaloing above the speed limit was n't clear .
• Keighley Police in Yorkshire announced a crackdown on crime .
Detective Chief Superintendent Roger Gasson said : " The festive season is a busy time for us .
We are determined to stop offenders causing Christmas misery . "
So when Susan Drummond , a cleaner , found herself being pelted with bricks by a gang of 25 youths outside the nursery where she worked , she retreated inside and dialled Keighley Police .
When she got through , she was told there was no one available to respond because the officers were " mealing " .
That 's cop -speak for having their tea .
• Merseyside Police hired an American to teach coppers how to ride a bike .
A spokesman said : " They 'll learn how to get on and off and generally cycle along . "
I do n't know about you , but I could do all that when I was about seven .
One minute , my dad was holding the saddle , the next he was gone .
Er , that was all there was to it .
What about the cops who can't manage a two - wheeler ?
Will they get a trike , or one with stabilisers ?
• In Aberdeen , the ever- vigilant McPlod launched a campaign against a growing menace to society .
Bus drivers will be charged with careless driving if they splash pedestrians by driving through puddles .
• In Staffordshire , the war on motorists has taken an exciting new twist .
WPC Gibbs , Staffordshire 's answer to Juliet Bravo , was driving her panda car through the village of Codsall when she spotted three boys riding a homemade go - kart .
It sounds like a scene out of Just William and recalls an age when youngsters made their own amusements in the fresh air , instead of sitting in their bedrooms glued to computer screens , downloading pornography from the internet .
That 's not how Juliet Bravo saw it .
She pulled the boys up and said they were breaking the law because they had n't got a tax disc or insurance .
After lecturing them , she took their names and addresses .
A few days later , their parents received a letter informing them that their sons were guilty of antisocial behaviour .
Needless to say , the parents were livid - not with the boys but with the petty - minded police .
One of the boys ' mothers , Karen Cross , said :
" When I was young , my sister and I built our own go - kart .
It is part of growing up . "
Precisely .
When I was a boy , building your own kart out of planks half - inched from the nearby building site and pram wheels recovered from the local scrapyard was a rite of passage .
With no brakes and rudimentary steering made from string likely to snap at any time , we were a downright menace .
It was like the chariot race from Ben Hur .
The only way of stopping was to hit a wall headon or slam your shoes down on to the pavement .
Frankly , you were better off hitting the wall , especially as most of us had only one pair of shoes .
There was always someone limping to school with the soles and heels hanging off their Startrites , sporting a clip round the ear from their mum or dad .
Mrs Cross was prepared to concede the possibility that Juliet Bravo was concerned for the safety of the boys and other pedestrians and road - users .
She admitted : " Young lads can cause problems sometimes .
If the police officer was concerned , she could have told them : ' Come on , lads , you are causing a problem .
You could hurt yourselves or cause an accident .
Let 's have you home and off the streets . ' "
That is , of course , what any sensible copper would have done .
Moreover , not so long ago , if a silly slip of a WPC did tell her inspector she had taken the names of three young boys riding a go - kart , she'd have spent the rest of the week cleaning out the cells after the winos .
But that 's not how it works any more .
You'd have thought the police would be pleased three teenage boys were getting rid of their energy in such an innocent fashion and not shoplifting , robbing people of mobile phones , spraying graffiti all over the place or kicking in bus shelters .
It 's not as if the Old Bill have n't got anything else to do .
In Staffordshire that same year , burglaries went up seven per cent and violent crime increased 16 per cent .
• The Staffordshire Plod seem to specialise in this kind of nonsense .
Sergeant Peter Davies threatened to prosecute villagers in Eccleshall for giving away bottles of sherry on tombola stalls at the village fete without a licence , contrary to Section 160 of the Licensing Act 1964 .
While Eccleshall , like most of rural Britain , is plagued by burglary , car crime , drugs and vandalism , Davies decided to go after the tombola barons of the WI , the Young Farmers and the Ladies ' Bell - ringing Circle .
The stallholders were forced to pack up and local charities were considerably poorer as a result .
• The Old Bill are fighting a constant battle against a lack of resources .
That 's the excuse they always give for not turning out .
So you can imagine the amazement of shopkeeper Gary Haggas , from Middlesbrough , when he saw four police cars racing past his shop and a helicopter overhead .
What could warrant such a turnout - an armed robbery , an Al Qaeda attack , a murder ?
Er , no .
A policeman had just had his bike pinched while he was carrying out a spotcheck on a man outside the shop .
• The Metropolitan Police decided to spend £ 70,000 sending officers on " Shakespeare awareness " courses .
The programme was designed to instill
" inspirational leadership " by drawing on Henry and Julius Caesar .
Wherefore art thou , Romeo Bravo Echo ?
• Cambridgeshire is plagued with illegal gipsy campsites .
But rather than do anything about that , Old Bill decided the real victims here are not the tax - paying , law - abiding locals , but the non-taxpaying , lawbreaking invaders .
The police spent £ 10,000 on a CD advising
" travellers " of their , er , " rights " .
Chief Superintendent Simon Edens believes " travellers " are victims of racism , who suffer " disgusting and offensive " abuse .
On which planet did he complete his diversity training ?
It obviously was n't anywhere near Cambridgeshire , which is home to a massive illegal settlement at Smithy Fen , where locals have been subjected to constant antisocial behaviour and the murder of their postman since the 800 " travellers " moved in .
Otherwise , he would n't have had the 2,000 CDs produced in Romany .
Only a handful of " travellers " speak proper Gipsy .
Most of them are Irish .
He 'd have been better off getting Terry Wogan to voice it .
• In Plymouth , police threatened to tip off insurance companies if burglary victims had left a window open or a door unlocked .
Insurers could then punish householders by refusing to pay out on claims .
This was the Plymouth Plods ' response to a record 34 per cent yearon - year increase in burglaries in the city .
It was bad enough when they could n't be bothered to do anything more than give you a note for the insurance .
Now they seem determined you should n't even be entitled to compensation for your stolen property .
The city 's police commander , Chief Superintendent Morris Watts , said : " It is part of a number of measures to raise awareness and to hammer the message home that you must take better care of your property . "
Brilliant .
Only in Blair 's Britain could a senior police officer have come up with a plan to persecute victims in order to combat a crime wave .
If Chief Supergrass Watts and his force had been doing their job properly , the people of Plymouth would be able to leave their doors and windows unlocked without fear of being burgled , as they could within living memory .
But he seems to think burglary is a force of nature , against which society can do nothing except batten down the hatches and hope for the best .
Anyone who does n't turn his house into Fort Knox is clearly gagging for it .
Someone should have told him that the job of the police is to patrol the streets , arrest criminals and protect property - not to act as a nark for the Man from the Pru .
They might also suggest that presiding over a 34 per cent annual rise in burglaries should be a resignation matter , not the occasion for a sanctimonious , patronising and threatening lecture to the law - abiding people who pay his wages .
• Superintendant Supergrass 's attitude is sadly typical of so much of our modern police force - sorry " service " .
They 're all far too busy to actually do anything about crime .
Take Welwyn Garden City 's finest .
We are not talking NYPD Blue here .
A thief robbed the local Wine Rack , making off with a customer 's purse containing £ 100 .
Two days later , manager Andy Smith spotted chummy going into a nearby fish and chip shop .
He called the police , but the thief made good his escape .
The Old Bill said they could n't find the chip shop .
Two weeks later , the thief actually walked back into Wine Rack .
As luck would have it , there were five police officers in the street only yards away .
Andy ran out to ask them to arrest the man .
But the cops could n't help .
They were engaged on a mission vital to national security - putting out traffic cones .
Nicking villains could wait .
Hertfordshire Constabulary defended the officers ' dereliction of duty .
A spokesman said they were properly engaged tackling " serious traffic disruption " .
The people of Welwyn Garden City can sleep easy in their beds knowing that although they 've got a police force that could n't organise a fish supper in a chip shop , it is a worldbeater when it comes to cones and contraflow systems .
• In an Essex shopping precinct , a disabled pensioner was breathalysed after a zealous young policeman spotted her drinking a can of lemonade shandy .
She was sitting on her invalid electric shopping trolley at the time .
• When they 're not ignoring crimes or persecuting innocent victims , there 's nothing the Old Bill like more than suing each other .
Which is why Police Federation rep PC Des Keanoy found himself under investigation for slapping the bottom , or putting his hand round the waist - depending whom you believe - of a female inspector at a conference in Blackpool .
Quite apart from the fact that that is precisely what conferences in Blackpool are for , how did this woman rise to the rank of inspector without being able to handle this kind of nonsense ?
Could n't she just have slapped his face or kicked him in the lunchbox ?
If she can't cope with an overfamiliar subordinate , how would she react to an armed robber with a sawn - off Purdey ?
• A motorist in Stirling was banged up for two days for revving his car in a " racist " manner next to a pair of Libyan immigrants .
• We 're always being told the purpose of speed cameras is not to nick motorists or raise money , it is to save lives .
Perhaps someone can explain this to 71 - year - old Stuart Harding , from Aldershot , Hampshire .
He 's just been banned from driving and ordered to pay £ 364 costs .
His crime ?
To put up a notice on the A325 warning
drivers : " Speed Trap - 300 yards " .
There had been 18 accidents on that stretch of road in a year and Mr Harding was trying to get motorists to slow down before a spot where people were crossing to a car boot sale .
You might have expected the police to be grateful .
Far from it .
They nicked him .
Magistrates used powers intended for antisocial behaviour to take away his driving licence .
Mr Harding does n't understand how he 's done anything wrong by encouraging people to obey the law .
Me neither .
Perhaps the clue is that police regularly catch drivers exceeding the limit on that stretch .
On one morning alone , they issued 200 tickets .
At £ 60 a time , that 's £ 12,000 .
Not a bad morning 's work .
Easier than catching burglars .
So when will they stop lying to us ?
They do n't want people to slow down .
The purpose of speed cameras is not road safety .
It 's about nicking people and raising money .
• In Herefordshire , police hauled a shopkeeper away from his Sunday lunch and threatened him with prosecution for selling golliwogs .
This was n't an isolated piece of lunacy , either .
The Golliwog Squad was also making itself busy in Worthing , Sussex .
Police said they were treating as a matter of
" priority " a complaint about gollies being displayed in a local store .
Owner John Scadgell faced charges under Section 2 of the Public Order Act , which makes it an offence to exhibit anything which could be considered threatening , abusive or insulting .
The Old Bill said Mr Scadgell was committing a racially aggravated offence .
The complaint was made by 36 - year - old graphic designer Gerald Glover , who is quoted as saying :
" I just thought it was disgusting .
When I saw them , I thought ' Oh my God , ' and I was stunned .
I do n't know what message it sends out to children today . "
For heaven 's sake .
Children do n't look at gollies and go out and join the BNP .
I 've never met any black person who looks even remotely like a golliwog .
I thought we 'd grown out of all this 1980s nonsense .
The Home Office even says that displaying golliwogs is not an offence .
That did n't stop the zealots at Worthing nick .
As far as they were concerned , this was a " hate crime " and must be given top priority .
We have now reached the stage where crime is an intangible thing .
It may not technically be against the law , but it becomes a crime if someone says it is .
Mr Glover should have been told politely to go away and get a life .
If he persisted , he should have been sectioned .
You 've got to be pretty sick to see evil in a harmless cuddly toy .
And whichever police officer sanctioned the investigation should be demoted .
The reality is he 'll probably be put on the fast track to promotion to chief constable .
• Patrick Hamilton is a former paratrooper , a Falklands veteran who served seven tours of duty in Northern Ireland .
He spent 25 years in the Army ready and willing to lay down his life for freedom and justice .
He must wonder why he bothered .
When Mr Hamilton , 52 , saw his 16 - year - old daughter , Catherine , being menaced by a gang of hooligans , he rushed to her defence .
She was being threatened by a group of teenage boys and girls who followed her back from her part - time job at McDonald 's , in North Shields , Tyneside .
Mr Hamilton gave chase , grabbed hold of one of the gang and tried to make a citizen 's arrest .
As the police arrived , he called out : " I 've got one , I 've got one . "
But the police were n't interested in nicking the troublemaker or going after the gang .
Instead , they arrested Mr Hamilton , handcuffed him and drove him away in a police car .
He was held at the local police station for an hour before being released without charge .
Mr Hamilton , who now works as a college lecturer , teaching youngsters who want to join the police or Armed Forces , was livid .
And rightly so .
He said : " I can't believe the police treated me and my family like this .
It 's disgusting .
I can't believe the police protected these scum . "
I can .
The police have gone from being on the side of the lawabiding , through being neutral , to actively siding with vermin .
Mr Hamilton 's arrest is par for the course .
The Old Bill can't be bothered to go after thugs , either because they 're frightened of getting a kicking , or because they 're scared of the Left - wing , legally - aided lawyers who infest our so - called justice system .
So they take the easy option and nick the good guys .
While brave men like Patrick Hamilton fight for freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan , this is the kind of " justice " they can expect back home .
Well done , North Shields Police .

What is a traitor ?
A traitor betrays and harms his own nation , his own religion , or his own people .
Note that I use the masculine form because of probable historical preponderance not because I doubt the abilities of females to match males in this capacity .
In this reflection I want to consider the hierarchy of lying , betrayal of trust , and treason .
A traitor will almost certainly lie , but he far transcends lying .
Lying , itself , is far from trivial , and the foolish expression " mere lies " conveniently conceals that lies cause tragedy , ruin , suffering , and death .
A traitor does betray the trust of others .
However , betrayal of trust , although heartbreaking and disillusioning to those betrayed , generally does not cause the damage to multitudes of people that the act of treason does .
Acts of treason weaken , harm the nation , and cause the gravest setbacks to the spirit of those betrayed - feelings of shame and uncleanliness .
In the above sentences , I have briefly outlined my perceptions of the distinctions and gradations between the acts of lying , betrayal of trust , and treason .
I think we all would accept some sort of hierarchy of these actions , albeit , possibly expressed somewhat differently .
It is a truism to say Bush and Cheney lied on numerous vital issues .
It is clear that they betrayed the trust of our troops , of their families , the American people , and our friends and allies worldwide .
Similarly , the betrayed the trust of the unfortunate poor citizens of New Orleans .
However , beyond their lies , their betrayal involves their certitude of the untenable , their smearing of their unconvinced critics , and their deceitful duality of us or them , good or evil , black or white in a world of smudgy gray .
But beyond even the enormity and gravity of this betrayal of trust lies the deliberate and calculated harm they have inflicted on the American people .
The selling and exploitation of federal lands owned by the people to benefit big corporations , their disregard of the growing inaccessibility to decent health care and higher education , the non-maintenance of industrial safety standards , their tax cuts mainly to those with incomes in excess of $ 200,000 , their kowtowing before the big energy companies , the installation of a corporation - owned Supreme Court , the outsourcing of government , the squalor of Guantanamo , the degradation of Abu Ghraib , the bungling of the Katrina aftermath are merely a few of the uncountable ways this pair of scoundrels have willfully harmed and damaged our beloved country .

Abhijit Menon - Sen wrote to me to ask for advice in finding the smallest triangular number that has at least 500 divisors .
( That is , he wants the smallest n such that both n = ( k2 + k ) / 2 for some integer k and also ν (n ) ≥ 500 , where ν(n ) is the number of integers that divide n. )
He said in his note that he believed that brute - force search would take too long , and asked how I might trim down the search .
The first thing that occurred to me was that ν is a multiplicative function , which means that ν( ab ) = ν ( a ) ν ( b ) whenever a and b are relatively prime .
Since n and n - 1 are relatively prime , we have that ν( n ( n - 1 ) ) = ν ( n ) ·ν( n - 1 ) , and so if T is triangular , it should be easy to calculate ν( T ) .
In particular , either n is even , and ν ( T ) = ν ( n /2 ) ·ν( n - 1 ) , or n is odd , and ν ( T ) = ν (n ) ·ν ( ( n - 1 ) /2 ) .
So I wrote a program to run through all possible values of n , calculating a table of ν (n ) , and then the corresponding ν ( n ( n - 1 ) / 2 ) , and then stopping when it found one with sufficiently large ν. my $ N = 1 ; my $ max = 0 ; while ( 1 ) { my $n = $ N % 2 ? divisors ( $ N ) : divisors ( $ N/2 ) ; my $ np1 = $ N % 2 ? divisors ( ( $ N+1 ) / 2 ) : divisors ( $ N+1 ) ; if ( $n * $ np1 > $ max ) { $ max = $n * $ np1 ; print " N=$N ; T= " , $ N * ( $ N+1 ) / 2 , " ; nd( ) =$max
" ; } last if $ max >= 500 ; $ N++ ; } There may be some clever way to quickly calculate ν (n ) in general , but I do n't know it .
But if you have the prime factorization of n , it 's easy : if n = p 1 a 1 p 2 a 2 ... then ν(n ) = ( a 1 + 1 ) ( a 2 + 1 ) ... .
This is a consequence of the multiplicativity of ν and the fact that ν( pn ) is clearly n+1 .
Since I expected that n would n't get too big , I opted to factor n and to calculate ν from the prime factorization : my @nd ; sub divisors { my $n = shift ; return $ nd [ $n ] if $ nd [ $n ] ; my @f = factor ( $n ) ; my $ ND = 1 ; my $ cur = 0 ; my $ curct = 0 ; while ( @f ) { my $ next = shift @f ; if ( $ next != $ cur ) { $ cur = $ next ; $ ND *= $ curct + 1 ; $ curct = 1 ; } else { $ curct ++ ; } } $ ND *= $ curct + 1 ; return $ ND ; } Unix comes with a factor program that factors numbers pretty quickly , so I used that : sub factor { my $r = qx{factor $ _ [ 0 ] } ; my @f = split /\s + / , $r ; shift @f ; return @f ; } This found the answer , 76,576,500 , in about a minute and a half .
( 76,576,500 = 1 + 2 + ... + 12,375 , and has 576 factors . )
I sent this off to Abhijit .
I was rather pleased with myself , so I went onto IRC to boast about my cleverness .
I posed the problem , and rather than torment everyone there with a detailed description of the mathematics , I just said that I had come up with some advice about how to approach the problem that turned out to be good advice .
A few minutes later one of the gentlemen on IRC , who goes by " jeek " , ( real name T.J. Eckman ) asked me if 76,576,500 was the right answer .
I said that I thought it was and asked how he'd found it .
I was really interested , because I was sure that jeek had no idea that ν was multiplicative or any of that other stuff .
Indeed , his answer was that he used the simplest possible brute force search .
Here 's jeek 's program : $ x=1 ; $ y=0 ; while ( 1 ) { $y += $ x++ ; $ r=0 ; for ( $ z=1 ; $ z < = ( $y ** .5 ) ; $ z++ ) { if ( ( $y / $z ) == int ( $y / $z ) ) { $ r++ ; if ( ( $y / $z ) != ( $ z ) ) { $ r++ ; } } } if ( $ r>499 ) { print " $y
" ; die} } ( I added whitespace , but changed nothing else . )
In this program , the variable $y holds the current triangular number .
To calculate ν(y ) , this program just counts $ z from 1 up to √y , incrementing a counter every time it discovers that z is a divisor of y .
If the counter exceeds 499 , the program prints y and stops .
This takes about four and a half minutes .
It takes three times as long , but uses only one - third the code .
Beginners may not see this as a win , but it is a huge win .
It is a lot easier to reduce run time than it is to reduce code size .
A program one - third the size of another is almost always better — a lot better .
In this case , we can trim up some obvious inefficiencies and make the program even smaller .
For example , the tests here can be omitted : if ( ( $y / $z ) != ( $ z ) ) { $ r++ ; }
It can yield false only if y is the square of z .
But y is triangular , and triangular numbers are never square .
And we can optimize away the repeated square root in the loop test , and use a cheaper and simpler $y % $ z == 0 divisibility test in place of the complicated one .
while ( 1 ) { $y += $ x++ ; $ r=0 ; for $ z ( 1 .. sqrt ( $y ) ) { $y % $ z == 0 and $ r+=2 ; } if ( $ r>499 ) { print " $x $y
" ; die} } The program is now one - fifth the size of mine and runs in 75 seconds .
That is , it is now smaller and faster than mine .
This shows that jeek 's approach was the right one and mine was wrong , wrong , wrong .
Simple programs are a lot easier to speed up than complicated ones .
And I have n't even consider the cost of the time I wasted writing my complicated program when I could have written Jeek 's six - liner that does the same thing .
So !
I had to write back to my friend to tell him that my good advice was actually bad advice .
The sawed - off shotgun wins again ! [ Addendum 20070405 : Robert Munro pointed out an error in the final version of the program , which I have since corrected . ] [ Addendum 20070405 : I said that triangular numbers are never square , which is manifestly false , since 1 is both , as is 36 .
I should have remembered this , since some time in the past three years I investigated this exact question and found the answer .
But it hardly affects the program .
The only way it could cause a failure is if there were a perfect square triangular number with exactly 499 factors ; such a number would be erroneously reported as having 500 factors instead .
But the program reports a number with 576 factors instead .
Conceivably this could actually be a misreported perfect square with only 575 factors , but regardless , the reported number is correct . ] [ Addendum 20060617 : I have written an article about triangular numbers that are also square . ]

The Invisible Man
Humans have long been fascinated by the concept of invisibility .
From H.G. Wells ’ Invisible Man to Harry Potter ’s cloak of invisibility , purveyors of fiction have pondered what one would do if one could move about unseen .
Invisibility is often portrayed as a perfect transparency ⁠— ala the Invisible Man⁠ — however this method is in conflict with the laws of nature as we understand them .
Moreover , a transparent person would be plagued with a host of difficulties that seem quite insurmountable .
Any consumed food or drink would be embarrassingly visible as it meanders through the digestive system , and these visible nutrients would immediately begin to integrate into the body .
That ’s to say nothing of wardrobe problems and social difficulties .
The competing approach to invisibility involves some sort of cloaking device to route photons around an object .
This method is somewhat more feasible , but of course it comes with its own unique set of complications .
For instance , if all the outside light is diverted around something , no light is able to reach an observer inside , leaving them unable to see out .
These difficulties and others have long left all serious speculation about invisibility lodged safely in the distant future .
But this is no longer so .
In October of 2006 , Professor Sir John Pendry of the Imperial College London announced the successful creation of a rudimentary cloaking device which nudges the idea a bit closer to reality .
Perhaps most surprising of all , the whole concept rests on a fairly simple physical principle of light⁠ — one that requires no electricity to operate , and that every high - schooler learns in basic physics .
In essence , Sir John ’s invisibility cloak relies on refraction , the same property of light seen when a prism casts a rainbow .
Refraction can also be seen by poking a pencil into a glass of water .
The underwater portion will appear to be offset from the rest because of the bending of light as it moves from one medium to another⁠ — from water to air .
A few years ago Sir John and his physicist friends reflected upon the idea of using refraction to bend light completely around an object .
If this were possible , the light would emerge on the other side , unchanged , as if the object were not there at all .
Of course this simple idea is n’t quite so simple in application .
The researchers ’ first obstacle was the precision light - bending this method requires .
There simply were n’t any materials with quite the right properties to bend light in the necessary semi-circle , nor were any naturally occurring materials good candidates for the position .
So the scientists looked to metamaterials ⁠ — substances whose electromagnetic properties are dependent upon tightly designed internal structures rather than on their chemical composition .
Guided by a theoretical design published in an earlier paper , and working in concert with researchers at Duke University , Sir John and his team created a five - inch round cloak using a metamaterial structured in two - dimensional concentric rings , specifically designed for this purpose .
This unique configuration is thought to be one of the most complex metamaterial structures ever made .
Their first goal was to make a material that was “ invisible ” to microwave radiation since microwaves are a longer wavelength than visible light⁠— millimeters rather than nanometers ⁠ — and therefore easier to manipulate .
In the laboratory the researchers placed their cloak inside a test chamber , turned on the microwave emitter , and monitored the detector on the other side .
Their spiffy new metamaterials worked flawlessly .
The inside of the small cloak was completely unaffected by the microwaves aimed at it , while the outside registered readings as if the cloak were n’t there at all .
Of course , the need for the right materials is n’t the only difficulty in making a true invisibility cloak .
If they wish to develop their prototype into something less limited , Sir John ’s team must address a number of issues .
First is the wavelength problem .
The cloak as it currently exists can only work for a very narrow range of wavelengths .
In the context of visible light , it ’s as if the cloak was only invisible to red light , while still perfectly visible in blue .
Broadening the range means making the cloak significantly thicker , which could severely limit applications .
Additionally , creating metamaterials which can do the same for visible wavelengths is considerably more tricky , since the metamaterial ’s precision structures must be as small as the wavelength they are meant to affect , and visible light waves are on the scale of millionths of a millimeter .
The other weakness in the current design is that the invisibility only works in one plane .
The object enclosed by it cannot be seen from the side , but it can be seen clearly from above or below .
To remedy this , Sir John and some of his co-authors at Duke are working to push the cloak into the third dimension .
Should they succeed with both of these challenges a new difficulty emerges⁠ — if the object within the cloak is invisible to the outside world , then no light is able penetrate the cloak , and therefore any occupants would be blind .
This is not necessarily a problem if one wishes to hide a stationary object , but it creates difficulty when one wants to conceal people or cameras .
Allowing a cloak to work effectively while on the move presents yet another challenge .
Naturally the military has expressed interest in the budding technology , as well as providing funding for its development .
Of particular interest is the fact that radar wavelengths are very close to that of microwaves , meaning that a radar - invisible cloak will be possible much sooner than one which is invisible to the eye .
This would provide the armed forces with a radar - defeating technology far beyond even that of current stealth aircraft .
Even though all of the wrinkles have yet to be ironed out , the basic breakthrough proves that the concept has merit .
An invisibility cloak exists .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) hopes that Sir John ’s cloaking device can help make some of their problems disappear within the next few years , and civilian applications could soon follow .
In any case , it is now certain that an invisibility cloak will someday be possible .
Whether or not it is practical remains to be seen .

The Aurora programme envisages Europeans on Mars
They will live and work in a series of interlocked modules at a research institute in Moscow .
Once the hatches are closed , the crew 's only contact with the outside world is a radio link to " Earth " with a realistic delay of many minutes .
It sounds like Big Brother , but there are no plans to televise the test .
The modular " spacecraft " measures some 550 cubic metres ( 19,250 cubic feet ) , the equivalent of nine truck containers .
It is based at the Russian Institute for Biomedical Problems in the Russian capital .
The goal is to gain insight into human behaviour and group dynamics under the kinds of conditions astronauts would experience on a journey to Mars .
Big commitment
With the exception of weightlessness and radiation , the crew will experience most other aspects of long - haul space travel , such as cramped conditions , a high workload , lack of privacy , and limited supplies .
The volunteers will be put through a number of scenarios , such as a simulated launch , outward journey of up to 250 days , an excursion on the Martian surface , followed by the return home .
The 500 - day duration is close to the minimum estimated timescale needed for a human trip to the Red Planet .
The Earthbound astronauts will have to deal with simulated emergencies and perhaps even real ones .
But , while Esa says it will do nothing that puts the lives of the simulation crew at unnecessary risk , officials running the experiment have made it clear they would need a convincing reason to let someone out of the modules once the experiment had begun .
" The idea behind this experiment is simply to put six people in a very close environment and see how they behave , " Bruno Gardini , project manager for Esa 's Aurora space exploration programme , told BBC News .
Team ethic
In all , 12 European volunteers will be needed .
They must be aged 25 - 50 , be in good health , have " high motivation " and stand up to 185 cm tall .
Smokers , or those with other addictions , to alcohol or illicit drugs , for example , will be rejected .
Esa is also looking for a working knowledge of both English and Russian .
" We will do pre-selection , medical tests , psychological tests , etc .
But at the end , you really have to see how they react in as close to a real situation as possible on Earth , " explained Mr Gardini .
He added that the results would help define the selection criteria for a future Mars mission .
" This is the beginning ; it will be a long time before we go to Mars , " the Esa official said .
" But this is a field which is difficult to quantify .
It 's human behaviour , so there 's no method .
The Russians have done lots of study in the past and we will be sharing some data .
" We have to look at the mix of people ; at the end of the day , we want a team . "
Robots first
Marc Heppener , of Esa 's Science and Application Division , said the crewmembers would get paid 120 euros ( 158 dollars ) a day .
Viktor Baranov , of Russia 's Institute of Biomedical Problems , said his organisation had received about 150 applications , only 19 of which had come from women .
A precursor 105 - day study is scheduled to start by mid-2008 , possibly followed by another 105 - day study , before the full 520 - day project begins in late 2008 or early 2009 .
European scientists have been asked to submit proposals for experiments in the areas of psychology , medicine , physiology and mission operations .
Mounting a mission to Mars would face many other hurdles , not least of which would be shielding the crew against the potentially deadly dose of radiation they would receive on the journey .
Esa 's Aurora programme has already begun preparations to land a rover - called ExoMars - on the Red Planet .
It has the stated aim , however , of trying to get European astronauts to Mars at some time in the future .
Majority approves of gays in the military
I think it ’s safe to say that opponents of gays serving in the military are officially out of arguments .
A new poll from Harris Interactive found that 55 % of Americans think gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the military .
By comparison , 19 % of the 2,337 Americans polled said gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve “ only if they keep their sexual orientation a secret , ” and 18 % said they should “ not be allowed to serve in the military at all . ”
This dovetails nicely with a Zogby poll of U.S. troops released about a month ago .
A new poll reveals that 73 % of military members say they are comfortable around lesbians and gays .
And 23 % say they know an active duty soldier in their unit who is lesbian or gay … .
More than half — 55 % — of the troops who know a gay peer said the presence of gays or lesbians in their unit is well known by others . [… ]
“ Those who defend the law have argued that openly gay personnel harm military readiness .
This research highlights the absurdity of such a hypothesis , ” said C. Dixon Osburn , executive director of Servicemembers Legal Defense Network .
A majority of American civilians are ready to scrap “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” ; a majority of American troops are fine with serving alongside gay servicemembers .
Remind me , what arguments are left on the other side ?

Many of us have stood in a noisy , crowded bar and asked , " What 's a guy got to do to get a drink around here ? "
Well , you 're about to find out .
Here are some Do's and Don'ts that will keep the relationship between the bartender and bar patron running smoothly .
DON'TSFail to have your money readyWe 're waiting on you .
Everyone else is waiting on us .
Therefore , by the Transitive Property of Equality , everyone is waiting on you .
Rule # 1 : Have your shit together .
Not only will following Rule # 1 get you served quicker in a bar , it 's a good general rule to adopt in life and is especially helpful in Central American border crossing scenarios .
WhistleThis is an absolute No - No .
You whistle at dogs and pretty ladies , not people .
Wave moneyOh , you 've got a dollar !!
I 'll be right over !!
Hopefully I wo n't break an ankle in my fevered rush to get you your " curz lite . "
Well , at least you 're not breaking the next rule .
Yell out the bartender 's first nameThere 's something deeply psychologically disturbing about hearing your name called out , turning around and seeing a complete stranger .
That 's one of the reasons strippers use stage names .
Bartender 's do too .
Mine is Pixie .
Say " make it strong ! " or " put a lot of liquor in it " Oh , you 're one of the rare drinkers that like their drink strong !
When you say this , you 're assuming I make weak drinks ( which is insulting ) and you 're assuming that I 'll stiffen this one up for my new best buddy , you .
This is the best way to get a weak drink .
Give the ever - expanding drink order
You want a Bud .
I go get it .
I come back and now you want a Margarita .
Okay , no prob .
I come back , and ( oh yeah ! ) now you want a shot of Tequila , too .
You really could have told us this all at once .
See Rule # 1. Pull the redirect ( or the bait ' n ' switch ) Usually used after the money wave or the whistle , this is when the gentlemen passes his turn to the lady behind him .
Yeah , um , do n't do that , okay ?
Chances are she 's not ready , and your weak attempt at chivalry just cost you your turn .
See you in 30 minutes .
Try the confused , lost look This is usually accompanied by the question " What kind of beer y'all got ? " while looking at all the beers we have .
You did know you were in a bar , right ?
You did n't just appear here , did you ?
Refer to Rule # 1. Order High Maintenance shootersExample : " Lemme get an Alabama Slammer , a Red Snapper , two Kamikazes , a Buttery Nipple and a Lemon Drop . "
Usually followed by a small tip .
People , these shooters are fine by themselves , but there are multiple steps involved with each one .
Translation : Time Sink .
You may get them this time , but you 'll probably be waited on last the next time we see your face .
Here 's a clue as to whether or not you 're high maintenance ; if two bartenders are working and they see you , and they flip a coin and the loser comes over to take your order , pretty good chance you 're high maintenance .
Assume we know you 're in the bandWe know , we know , you 're gonna be really famous , but you 're not there yet , tiger .
Tell us you 're in the band and which band you 're in .
By the way , if you are in a band and get free / reduced drink prices , feel free to tip , as most bartenders are also in bands !
It 's not like we do n't know how it is .
Oh , and our bands will smoke your band .
Assume we know you periodUnless you 've followed the first " Do " rule below , we do n't remember you .
You are one of a thousand faces for us , and when you point at an empty glass or a beer bottle that 's invariably facing away from us , your attempt at a shortcut backfires .
Tell us what you want .
Apologize for sucking
Do n't apologize for not tipping .
Acknowledging that you suck is not the same as not sucking .
Oh , and do n't say " I 'll get ya next time . "
We know all about you .
Assume soft drinks are freeAre they free at McDonald's ?
Are they free at Wal - Mart ?
Are they free anywhere ?
I blame M.A.D.D. for this myth .
Put pennies and nickels in the tip jarWe do n't want that crap in our pockets any more than you do .
We do n't have anything smaller than quarters .
Have you ever ordered a drink that cost $ 3.17 ?

BAGHDAD , Dec. 30 — Saddam Hussein never bowed his head , until his neck snapped .
His last words were equally defiant .
“ Down with the traitors , the Americans , the spies and the Persians . ”
The final hour of Iraq ’s former ruler began about 5 a.m. , when American troops escorted him from Camp Cropper , near the Baghdad airport , to Camp Justice , another American base at the heart of the city .
There , he was handed over to a newly trained unit of the Iraqi National Police , with whom he would later exchange curses .
Iraq took full custody of Mr. Hussein at 5:30 a.m .
Two American helicopters flew 14 witnesses from the Green Zone to the execution site — a former headquarters of the Istikhbarat , the deposed government ’s much feared military intelligence outfit , now inside the American base .
Unlike Earth hurricanes , the storm 's position appears fixed
Enlarge Image
Measuring 5,000 miles ( 8,000 km ) across , the storm is the first hurricane ever detected on a planet other than Earth .
Scientists say the storm has the eye and eye - wall clouds characteristic of a hurricane and its winds are swirling clockwise at 350 mph ( 550 km / h ) .
However , unlike Earth hurricanes it seems stuck at the pole , not drifting .
" It looks like a hurricane , but it does n't behave like a hurricane , " Dr Andrew Ingersoll , a member of Cassini 's imaging team at the California Institute of Technology said .
" Whatever it is , we 're going to focus on the eye of this storm and find out why it 's there . "
Though Jupiter 's Great Red Spot storm moves anti-clockwise , and is far bigger than the storm on Saturn , it does not have the eye and eye - wall that mark out a hurricane .
We 've never seen anything like this before .
It 's a spectacular - looking storm
Michael Flasar , Nasa astrophysicist
But Saturn is a gaseous planet therefore this storm does not have an ocean at its base .
The Saturn storm is bigger not only in diameter than an Earth hurricane , but in height too , with a ring of huge clouds towering 20 - 45 miles ( 30 - 70 km ) above the well - developed eye - two to five times higher than in storms on Earth .
Unknown phenomenon
One Nasa scientist , Michael Flasar , told Reuters news agency that the storm looked just like water swirling down a bath plug hole , only on a colossal scale .
" We 've never seen anything like this before , " Mr Flasar said .
" It 's a spectacular - looking storm . "
Fourteen frames of the storm were captured by the Cassini spacecraft over the course of three hours on 11 October 2006 .
Cassini was passing about 210,000 miles ( 340,000 km ) from the ringed planet as it continues its exploration of Saturn and its moons .
Cassini entered into orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004 .
Later that year , it released the piggybacked Huygens probe towards the planet 's largest moon , Titan .
Huygens touched down on Titan on 14 January 2005 , sending back data on the moon 's atmosphere , weather and its surface .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a co-operative project of the US space agency ( Nasa ) , the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and the Italian Space Agency ( Asi ) .

Where pooches outnumber kids , impassioned , doting owners and hounds dressed to the canines treat all days like dog days 1 / 10 Back to Gallery
Carter , in a royal blue rugby shirt and tie , was ready for his first birthday party .
A 6 - foot poster bearing his likeness marked the gathering spot at Allyne Park in San Francisco , where 60 of his closest friends dipped their toes in an inflatable pool and noshed on beach - themed cupcakes designed by a food stylist .
Yes , it was a bit over the top for a Yorkshire terrier , but his parents were so proud .
Nobody beats San Francisco when it comes to doting on dogs .
It 's a city with luxury dog hotels , rooftop dog cocktail parties , a pet cemetery and City Hall plans to turn dog droppings into alternative energy .
And the urban legend is actually true : Dogs outnumber children in the City by the Bay .
There are an estimated 120,000 dogs in San Francisco , according to the city 's Animal Care and Control department .
There are anywhere from 108,000 to 113,000 children , according to U.S. census figures from 2000 and 2005 .
Dogs dominate in part because it 's becoming increasingly impossible for parents to afford to live in San Francisco -- 1,000 students disappear from the public schools each year .
Also , a large percentage of the city 's gay couples are choosing canines over kids , said Laura Cavaluzzo , San Francisco editor of urbanhound .com .
Add to that empty - nest Baby Boomers who are filling the void with man 's best friends and San Francisco is starting to look more and more like Paris or Carmel , with cafe dogs lounging and specialty shops offering everything from dog massage to hot - pink pup sweaters that say " Biatch . "
And nowhere in the city is it more of a dog's life than in District 8 -- encompassing the Noe Valley and Castro neighborhoods .
A computer analysis of ZIP codes shows the highest number of dog licenses there -- though just 15 percent of San Franciscans license their dogs .
Bernal Heights is also in the top three dog ZIP codes .
" There are very few businesses that do n't allow you to just stroll in with your dog , " said Cavaluzzo , who lives in District 8 .
Here you can have your dog pose with a Mrs. Claws drag queen at Christmas , or have your dog washed by a go - go boy in a Speedo to raise money for AIDS charities .
On weekday evenings , parks become the social centers for neighbors and their dogs .
At Duboce Park , several dozen dogs play in the two - block stretch of grass -- the French bulldog people sit together in one section , the Chihuahuaphiles in another , and the bigger Labs and retrievers run in circles in the lower flat portion of the park .
On a recent afternoon , one woman pushed her toy dog in a stroller .
Another sat on a bench knitting her dog a sweater .
" It 's such a routine that everyone knows everyone -- a newcomer stands out , " said Paul Holtz , who shows up almost daily with his Rhodesian ridgeback , Scout .
At the Best in Show dog boutique on Castro Street , sales of high - end designer dog toys go up every year , said co-owner Richard Shiu , who can sometimes be found sporting a T - shirt that reads , " Dogs Are the New Kids . "
" People want function , but they also want design , " said Shiu , whose top - selling toy is a rubber squeaky bust of President Bush .
( There 's also Arnold Schwarzenegger , North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Hillary Rodham Clinton ) .
Six or seven years ago , Chiu said , pet " guardians " ( the officially sanctioned term in San Francisco ) had boring choices between rawhides and rope bones .
Now , people with disposable income want water bowls in Eames - style bent cherrywood holders and Cubist pet car seats .
Or a furry black " Jimmy Chew " pump .
Nationally , pet lovers spent $ 38.5 billion on their animals in 2006 , up from $ 21 billion a decade earlier .
Miki Manji plunked down a couple of Benjamins at Best in Show for a gray zippered sweatshirt with a red leather Maltese cross on the back for her dapple dachshund , Louie .
" He goes everywhere with me , " said Manji .
" I 'm going through a breakup , so he 's really comforting to me right now . "
Capitalizing on the dog worship is Ritu Raj , who just opened one of his posh pet resorts , Wag Hotel , in San Francisco .
Vacationing owners can leave their beloved dogs and cats in suites with faux leather beds , flat - screen TVs and Webcams , knowing their animals will get daily play dates , organic meals and , for an extra fee , swim time in the pool , pedicures and blueberry facials .
Since it opened in May , Wag has had 1,000 overnight stays , and there are 5,000 upcoming reservation nights , Raj said .
On Saturday , DJ Kid Loose spun on Wag 's rooftop garden to entertain guests and their dogs at a cocktail party .
" The key thing about San Francisco is people are looking for opportunities to go out and celebrate with their dogs , " Raj said .
" People are like proud papas -- they want to show off their dogs . "
Dogs are also big politics in the city , and battles over whether to leash or not to leash in parks have been some of City Hall 's most passionate .
Local lawmakers vie to win endorsements from the San Francisco DOGPAC political action committee , and posing with dogs has become the equivalent of kissing babies .
San Francisco 's dog culture is one of the main reasons city Animal Care and Control Director Carl Friedman moved here in the 1960s .
Back then , he took his Weimaraner with him to classes at San Francisco State University .
" Things have changed since then .
People were more laid - back about their dogs , now they treat them like family members .
We certainly did n't have gourmet dog shops , " he said .
Now there are dog restaurants .
Every Monday at Zazie in Cole Valley , dog owners can bring Fido to the trumpet vine - enclosed patio in back .
On a recent Zazie dog night , six dogs sat in their owners ' laps or curled up under the tables .
A pug from Carmel named Ruby insisted on roaming for scraps .
The wait staff deftly stepped around her as they carried plates of salmon and poured glasses of Mutt Lynch Unleashed Chardonnay .
" When you come home after work and your dog has been alone all day , you really feel guilty if you go out to dinner , so that 's why Zazie is perfect for us , " said Janet Moomaw , who shared a table with her German shepherd mix Findlay , her girlfriend and her neighborhood dog walker .
Dog night has boosted what is a traditionally slow dinner night , said Zazie owner Jennifer Piallat , and aside from the occasional bark , there have n't been any problems .
The only change was a ban on the long , stretchy leashes -- a request from the employees who kept tripping over them .
" We started dog night because we are a French restaurant , to be whimsical and to cater to the neighborhood , " Piallat said .
" I 'd like to do it every night . "

Discussions to the tune of ‘ zomg teh jubblies on teh Dead or Alive birds are da hax0r , w00t ! ’ are as commonplace on the ‘ tinternet as rumours about the iPhone release date , so I ’m not surprised to discover the latest top ten list of ‘ the hottest game babes to date ’ doing the rounds of the gaming blogs this week .
Is anyone else tired of these inane lists , where every mammary - bulging heroine looks like a carbon copy of the one before her , with taut thighs glistening in sweat at every available opportunity ?
Whatever happened to having some nice wholesome girl - next - door type characters to idolise , that you can happily play a game featuring the vixen infront of your Dad , and not fear an embarassing pants - tent episode ?
Together with several other hot - blooded controller - wielding men from the Shiny game blogs , I ’ve put together a list of who I think deserves to be on the Top Ten List Of Gaming Vixens who are n’t just featured for their 34 - 24 - 34 ratio and ability to knock out a vertically - challenged man with a simple quiver of the lady - lumps .
10 . ) Claire Redfield from Resident Evil – this sassy lass rides a motorbike , has Queen lyrics on the back of her jackets , and even had a brief stint in jail – what ’s not to love about her when she oozes so much street cred ?
She also cares deeply for her brother , going on endless quests to find him in Resident Evil 2 .
9. ) Yorda from Ico – Ico ’s love interest , Yorda is imprisoned by her nasty old mother in a castle , the modern day Rapunzel .
She manages to help Ico escape from the castle by opening doors he cannot , and thus wins the protagonist ’s heart and ours .
As Al from PSPSPS explained , “ she takes pity on the freaky horned boy – so perhaps , subconsciously , we nerds like the idea of some tall hot chick hanging out with us despite the fact that we ’re hideously deformed and ostracised by society ” .
8. ) Princess Zelda from The Legend of Zelda series – How can we not admire the Princess when Link is willing to drop everything for her and rescue her in every incarnation of the Zelda franchise ?
With magical powers and ethereal looks , she ’s elegance and modesty in every sense of the word .
Plus she has a hot pair of ears !
7. ) Kreia from Knights Of The Old Republic II : The Sith Lords – Unfamiliar to me , this character was mentioned my 90 % of the men I questioned in regards to this list .
Chris from Xboxer summed it up best with ” she actually made the dark side interesting , better than that whole good vs. evil thing that they ’ve got going in most of the Star Wars universe .
Also nice to have a slightly nihilistic baddie .
Who could control lightsabers with mind powers “ .
Ahh , so it ’s not her atrophied eyes which makes every man fancy her then ?
6. ) Mia Fey from Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney – Fey in name , fey in nature , as whilst this smoking hot lawyer died in the second game , she still aided Phoenix with his cases from the grave .
Reliable and trusting , she was the best mentor Phoenix could ’ve hoped for – Ally McBeal who !?
5. ) Yuna from Final Fantasy – Another gal who most men recommended , she may resemble a librarian in her first game debut ( FFV ) , but with pins that look good ( but not unrealistic , as in Dead or Alive ’s case ) even with a hotpants - and - side - skirt combo , added to her kind - hearted , humble spirit , it ’s no wonder she ’s a favourite when deciding on a cosplay outfit !
4. ) Samus Aran from Metroid – Seen only in bulky cyborg garb through most of the games , it was natural to assume the bounty hunter was male , so plenty of jaws dropped when she removes her helmet and suit at the end to reveal a killer body and great hair to boot .
We like her for her modesty and quietness , plus her willingness to appear in every possible Nintendo collaboration title .
3. ) Jade from Beyond Good and Evil – I was tempted to place Jade an number one in the list purely because I enjoyed the game so much , but that ’s not the point to this list !
This street - smart reporter / journalist earns our respect for being decked head to toe in green , even sporting a peculiar shade of green lipstick that ’s ever so difficult to pull off with the aplomb she manages .
Her patience with that irritating uncle of hers , Pey’j , and perserverance through the challenges she faces puts her at a healthy number three .
2. ) Carla Valenti from Fahrenheit – the NYPD officer is incredibly committed to her job , to the point of experiencing panic attacks .
Wielding a weapon , she is a tough - talking woman who yearns for a private life , instead pouring all her waking hours into her job – the modern careerwoman .
1. ) Jill Valentine from Resident Evil – Looking like a revolutionary , or perhaps the fifth member of the Manic Street Preachers in her army - garb , girls want to be her ( me included ) , and guys want to do her .
Specialising in bomb disposal , you cannot fault her in any of the games she appears in .
Smart , sassy , and not afraid to kick some ass , this is the pin-up girl we should all have on our bedroom walls and lust after .
Now , are you still day - dreaming about Lara Croft ’s boobies after reading through that list , eh ?

Former Rove aide pleads the Fifth on White House contacts with convicted lobbyist Abramoff Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday May 22 , 2007 Print This Email This Susan Ralston , the former executive assistant to top White House adviser Karl Rove , invoked her rights against self - incrimination while she was being asked to answer questions by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , the Committee 's Chairman , Rep. Henry Waxman , announced in a memo Tuesday .
The deposition for which she sat concerned contacts between convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff and Rove , as well as the White House more broadly .
" The subjects this morning that she will be unable to testify to ... are the subjects of the relationship between Jack Abramoff and his associates and White House officials , including Ms. Ralston , and the subject of the use by White House officials of political e-mail accounts at the RNC , " Ralston 's lawyer , Bradford Berenson said , during the May 10 deposition .
" She has material , useful information about both of those subjects . "
According to Waxman 's memo , which was sent to Oversight Committee members , Ralston is seeking immunity from prosecution .
" She is more than willing to provide it to the committee .
However , she will , as we have previously discussed , require a grant of immunity before she is comfortable going forward , " Berenson also said in the deposition .
A spokeswoman for the Committee would not say whether or not immunity would be granted to the former Rove aide .
" I think we 're letting the memo speak for itself , " she told RAW STORY when asked if the Committee would grant immunity , or had discussed it with the White House .
Ralston served as executive assistant in the White House to Karl Rove until September 2006 .
From 1998 to 2001 , she had also worked for Abramoff , who was convicted of a variety of crimes in federal court in January 2006 .
The Committee noted that Ralston " appeared voluntarily and testified on a number of subjects unrelated to the Abramoff matter , " in the May 10 deposition .
The full memo can be accessed at this link .
Only a few days left to Double your gift
Today , the fast - growing cadre of corporate leaders pressing for climate action welcomes a new member : Rupert Murdoch , CEO of News Corporation , the media empire that encompasses Fox News , 20th Century Fox , HarperCollins , MySpace.com , and dozens of newspapers in Australia , the U.K. , the U.S. , and beyond .
Photo : Kelly Kline/WireImage.com
At an event held this morning in midtown Manhattan and webcast to all News Corp. employees , Murdoch launched a company - wide plan to address climate change that includes not only a pledge to reduce the company ’s emissions ( which has come to be expected at such biz - greening events ) but also a vow to weave climate messaging into the content and programming of News Corp . ’s many holdings .
“ The challenge is to revolutionize the [ climate change ] message , ” Murdoch told the crowd .
He emphasized the need to “ make it dramatic , make it vivid , even sometimes make it fun .
We want to inspire people to change their behavior . ”
Grist obtained an exclusive advance copy of Murdoch ’s speech and the company ’s energy plan .
While not groundbreaking , Murdoch ’s strategy to cut News Corp .’s own emissions is nothing to sneeze at :
The company will reduce its carbon footprint 10 percent by 2012 via energy - efficiency efforts and use of renewable energy , and it will become carbon - neutral even sooner , in 2010 , by buying emission offsets from projects such as wind farms in India .
But Murdoch said that News Corp.’s hundreds of millions of viewers and readers represent the most fertile ground for change : “ Our audience ’s carbon footprint is 10,000 times bigger than ours …
Imagine if we succeed in inspiring our audiences to reduce their own impacts on climate change by just 1 percent .
That would be like turning the state of California off for almost two months . ”
These might be surprising observations coming from any media titan , but all the more so from a man who has long worn his conservative politics on his sleeve and whose company owns outlets like Fox News and The New York Post , which are widely considered right - leaning .
Murdoch is an outspoken supporter of President Bush , and just last month criticized the press for being too hard on Dubyah .
“ [ T ] here ’s a sort of monolithic attack on him every day of the year , ” Murdoch told a meeting of business leaders .
While Fox News ran a surprisingly fair and balanced news special on climate change a year and a half ago , and has journalists like Shepard Smith who seem to take the problem seriously , the channel is better typified by conservative commentator Sean Hannity , who recently bashed Al Gore and others who are concerned about climate change as “ liberal global - warming hysterical people . ”
So what ’s motivating Murdoch ?
While he voiced concerns that “ climate change poses clear , catastrophic threats , ” his emphasis was on opportunities to fatten the bottom line .
“ Our advertisers are asking us for ways to reach audiences on this issue , ” Murdoch said .
He also argued that the new climate strategy would reduce energy costs , help the company recruit top talent , and provide “ a chance to deepen our relationships with our viewers , readers , and web users . ”
And yet the strategy for boosting climate - related content throughout News Corp. divisions is still vague .
Murdoch mentioned new green programming on the car and motorcycle cable network SPEED , a “ Preserve Our Planet ” program on the National Geographic Channel , and a channel dedicated to climate change on MySpace , but the larger vision is not yet defined by a quantifiable target .
News Corp. Vice President of Business Development Roy Bahat told Grist that the company will not try to awkwardly wedge the issue into programs , but said , “ It will naturally become more prevalent throughout our programming , be it sitcoms or news .
We are asking all of our creative leaders to incorporate climate change in ways that would make drama more dramatic , or comedy funnier , or news more relevant — ways that inspire viewers to bond with the program . ”
Coverage of global warming in News Corp. outlets has already gone up considerably in the last year , Bahat said : “ For example , The Times of London had roughly 50 percent more climate - related stories last year than the previous year .
It was n’t because of a mandate , it ’s because the audience wants to hear about it .
The audience drives us as much as we drive the audience . ”
But Murdoch himself seems very comfortable with the notion of driving his audiences , describing his goals in terms that smack more of a Greenpeace activist than a corporate boss :
“ The climate problem will not be solved without mass participation by the general public in countries around the globe .
And that ’s where we come in . ”
How long , then , before American Idol participants are tasked with creating a snappier climate anthem than Melissa Etheridge ’s “ I Need to Wake Up ” ?
Full disclosure : Amanda Griscom Little has a book contract with HarperCollins , a News Corp. company .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former Vice President Al Gore on Thursday urged people worldwide to pressure their governments to cut global warming pollution by 90 percent in developed countries and by more than half worldwide by 2050 .
Al Gore smiles at a news conference to introduce a " 7 Point Pledge " in conjunction with the Live Earth Concerts in New York , June 28 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jeff Zelevansky
Gore said the July 7 Live Earth concerts -- to be held in Johannesburg , London , New Jersey , Rio de Janeiro , Shanghai , Sydney and Tokyo -- will ask people around the globe to sign the climate change pledge .
Organizers have said the concert , which is being broadcast in more than 100 countries , could be watched and heard by 2 billion people worldwide .
“ This is a global challenge , ” Gore told a news conference in New York .
“ We will need a tougher global treaty , we will need every nation to be a part of the solution and we will need individuals all around the world to be part of the solution . ”
“ The Live Earth concerts represent an unprecedented opportunity to ask for the world ’s attention long enough to deliver an SOS and then to begin delivering information about the solutions to every single person , ” he said .
The seven - point Live Earth pledge demands governments agree and sign within two years an international treaty to fight climate change .
It also asks people to cut their own pollution , to make their homes , business , schools and transport more energy efficient , and to plant new trees and preserve forests .
The pledge also asks people to fight for a halt on any new coal burning generators without the capacity to trap and store carbon dioxide gases , for laws and policies that expand the use of renewable energy sources , and to buy from businesses and support leaders committed to solving the climate crisis .
“ We have to get all nations involved , but in order to accomplish that we have to bring about a sea change in public opinion , ” said Gore , whose documentary “ An Inconvenient Truth ” about global warming won two Academy Awards this year .
Scientists say smokestack and tailpipe emissions of heat - trapping gases cause global warming , which could lead to more deadly floods , droughts and heat waves .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found that global carbon dioxide emissions must fall 50 to 85 percent by 2050 to stop the planet from heating up more than 2 degrees Celsius .
Gore said Madonna and the Black Eyed Peas had each written original songs for Live Earth , while a third original song would be unveiled on the day .
Concert organizer Kevin Wall also promised a surprise event in Antarctica .
Man , 73 , fails high school exams after 39th try since 1969
JAIPUR , India — A 73 - year - old man who failed his 10th grade high school exams for the 39th time vowed today to try again next year in the hopes that an education will improve his job and marriage prospects .
Shivcharan Jatav , a farmer from the desert state of Rajasthan in western India , had no formal education as a child .
He has been trying to pass the exams since 1969 , when an army recruiter told him it would improve his chances of being accepted into the military .
" Since then I have been trying to pass this examination , but without any success , " Jatav said , days after receiving the bitter news that he had failed again .
Jatav passed only one subject — the ancient language of Sanskrit — and he said he scored just 103 out of a total of 600 in the examinations .
Even though he is too old to join the army he has kept at it , hoping to become a more eligible bachelor .
" I could not get married as the girls told my family members that I was not properly educated .
It 's my fate that deprived me of education and a married life , " he said .
Still , he has no regrets .
" I am a happy and contented person , " said Jatav .
Even a complete idiot like me can write a simple parser in 20 minutes in Haskell .
While basically killing off time , it struck me that I wanted an english - to - nadsat translator .
Wikipedia pointed me to this page , where there is a translator for Windows .
The very same page has the dictionary it uses , in the following form :
A appy polly loggies : apologies ::
School boy speak appy polly loggy : apology :: School boy speak B baboochka : old woman :: Russian ( babooshka / grandmother ) baboochkas : old women :: Russian ( babooshka / grandmother ) baddiwad : bad :: School boy speak baddiwadest : baddest :: School boy speak banda : band :: Russian ( banda / band , gang ) bandas : bands :: Russian ( banda / band , gang ) bezoomny : mad :: Russian ( byezoomiyi / mad , insane )
Yes , this probably can be handled with regexes as it ’s regular enough , but that ’s too complicated for me .
I ’m not smart enough for that finite automata stuff .
So I copied all that text as - is and saved as nadsat . dict .
Then I began writing the parser .
module Nadsat where
import Text .
ParserCombinators .
Parsec
import qualified Data .
Map as Map
import Data .
Char
First thing I wanted was to weed out the “ A ” , “ B ” , etc. headers
header = oneOf [ ' A '..' Z ' ]
Then I wrote a parser for one line of dictionary
word = do {
nadsat <- any Char `manyTill` ( char ' :' ) ;
english <- anyChar `manyTill` ( string " : : " ) ;
etimology <- any Char `manyTill` newline ;
return $ Map.singleton ( filter isAlpha english ) ( filter isAlpha nadsat ) ;
}
Given that , writing the parser for a whole dictionary is easy :
dict = do {
discard <- skipMany header ;
words <- many word ;
return $ Map.unions words ;
}
The trickiest part ( and it ’s not really tricky ) is this :
nadsatDict = parseFromFile dict " nadsat.dict "
The type of that function is nadsatDict :: IO ( Either ParseError ( Map. Map [ Char ] [ Char ] ) ) , because trying to parse a file might throw an error .
Luckily , Either ParseError b is an instance of Functor , so fmap solves the problem of using that Map dictionary easily .
This function does the bulk of translating , given a Map containing the dictionary .
subst s m = unwords $ map ( \x -> Map.findWithDefault x x m ) ( words s )
Finally , we write main , trivially ( modulo the fmap thing I mentioned before ) :
main = do { text <- getContents ; dict <- nadsatDict ; print $ fmap ( subst text ) dict ; }
Bingo !
Nadsat translator in 20 minutes .
Even a complete idiot like me , never having had programming lessons or a CS education at all , can write a simple parser in Haskell in a few minutes .
Can your language do that ?
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs touted the company ’s forthcoming products as “ the best I ’ve ever seen in my life , ” and told Apple shareholders that the Mac ’s transition to Intel processors will pay off in the long run .
Jobs , Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer , and Senior Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing Phil Schiller answered investors ’ questions Thursday during Apple ’s annual shareholder meeting at its Cupertino campus .
During the session , the three executives remained typically tight - lipped about Apple ’s future product plans .
When pressed by one shareholder about what product releases to expect in the future , Jobs simply said , “ I ca n’t tell you . ”
However , Apple ’s CEO did n’t let secrecy stop his enthusiasm for those secret products .
“ The new products in the pipeline are the best I ’ve ever seen in my life , ” Jobs said .
Another shareholder requested that the company make “ the ultimate media center , ” a personal video recorder that could record television programs and share media on his computer .
“ We hear you loud and clear , ” Jobs responded .
During the meeting , Jobs admitted that the Mac ’s transition to Intel - based processors is probably costing the company some hardware sales as customers wait for new models to hit the market .
But he expressed confidence that the strategy will pay off for the company in the long run .
“ Intel has a great roadmap , ” Jobs said .
“ This new [ Intel Core Duo ] chip is phenomenal — it blows away anything other suppliers have , including our former suppliers . ”
Jobs was particularly effusive about the MacBook Pro , a laptop powered by an Intel Core Duo chip that just this week added a 17 - inch configuration .
“ Everyone wants a MacBook Pro because they are so bitchin’ , ” he said .
Environmental matters
Unlike last year ’s shareholder meeting , which included occasionally heated exchanges between Jobs and an environmental group protesting the company ’s recycling policies , Thursday ’s meeting remained largely civil , even when environmental questions arose .
Larry Fahn , a former president of the Sierra Club , said a recycling program recently announced by Apple did n’t go far enough .
He also said that Apple has only recycled 2.4 percent of the computer equipment sold seven years ago , compared to 10 percent recycled by Dell and 7 percent by HP .
“ We are concerned that besides being a hip , cool company , Apple is falling short of the industry environmentally , ” Fahn said .
“ I would like to thank you for the program introduced last week , but there is still a long way to go . ”
In response , Jobs noted that the Sierra Club recently voted Apple one of its top 10 environmentally friendly companies .
“ So there is some kind of disconnect with your numbers , ” he said .
Jobs also noted that Apple ’s new recycling program takes any computer , not just Macs , “ because we like switchers , too . ”
“ I think there are a lot of PCs that should be recycled , ” Schiller added .
Jobs said environmental groups focusing on Apple can be frustrating because the company does a lot of work in the background that isn’s always recognized .
He also suggested groups wanting to make an impact should target CRTs since those types of monitors pose a great environmental risk .
“ We only have one CRT product left and that ’s the eMac , ” Jobs noted .
“ We could be sitting here next year with none . ”
Jobs ’ role at Disney
Talk at the Apple shareholder meeting turned to the other company once headed by Jobs — Pixar , which was bought by Disney in January for $ 7.4 billion .
The purchase made Jobs the largest individual shareholder of the entertainment giant .
Asked about his role at Disney following the Pixar deal , Jobs dismissed any fears that he might scale back his role at Apple to become more involved with Disney .
“ I think Bob Iger is the best person to be running Disney , ” Jobs said .
“ I ’ll be on the Board , which will require less of my time than when I was running Pixar . ”
Jobs also looked to calm any concerns about Apple ’s market share and how a slowdown in the industry might affect the company .
“ You can talk about the negatives of 4 to 5 percent market share , but it ’s kind of like being in the ocean , ” Jobs said .
“ We ’re on the bottom , so it does n’t matter what the weather is like up top . ”

We have only had the phone for a few hours but we needed to get inside its casing , what follows is our dissection of the Apple iPhone .
Please note that we 're doing this so you are not tempted to on your recent $ 500 / $ 600 expenditure , while it is quite possible to take apart using easy to find tools we 'd recommend against it as it will undoubtedly void your warranty and will most likely mar up the beautiful gadget 's exterior .
Do whatever you wish to your iPhone , but do so at your own risk :)
This is the iPhone that most of Apple 's customers will be seeing :
Special thanks to Olivia Marsh and Manveer Wasson for help with the disassembly and photographs for this article
And this is one of ours , on the operating table :

Slim
The first step to disassemble the device is to remove the lower black plastic piece ; heating it up and squeezing a razorblade in there made it not only possible , but easy :
Then came the process of removing the brushed aluminum cover , which was n't nearly as easy .
After a lot of bending , pulling and other unfathomable things one would do to a brand new iPhone we were left with this :
Ignore the slightly bent iPhone casing , we swear it came this way
Notes on the Amendments
Each Amendment to the Constitution came about for a reason — to overrule a Supreme Court decision , to force a societal change , or to revise the details of the Constitution .
This page will give an overview of how each Amendment came to be .
The process for adopting an amendment is outlined elsewhere , as is the ratification history of each Amendment .
A list of failed amendments is also available .
Quick links : Bill of Rights ( 1-10 ) , 11th , 12th , 13th , 14th , 15th , 16th , 17th , 18th , 19th , 20th , 21st , 22nd , 23rd , 24th , 25th , 26th , 27th .
The Bill of Rights ( Amendments 1 through 10 )
As noted on the Constitutional Convention Topic Page , several delegates to the convention refused to sign the newly drafted constitution because it did not include a bill of rights .
Bills of rights were typically parts of the constitutions of the several states of the day ( and today ) , placed there to ensure that certain rights were recognized by the government .
Most of the delegates did not feel such a bill was necessary , and other may have been on the fence but were weary from the months of negotiations .
The lack of a bill of rights was one of the main arguments that Anti-Federalists used to try to convince the public to reject the Constitution .
But the need for change was all too evident , and it was not rejected .
However , some of the states sent suggestions for amendments to the Constitution to add an enumeration of certain rights .
The ratification messages of the states included many varying suggestions , which the very first Congress took under consideration in its very first session .
Representative James Madison , who was so instrumental in the creation of the Constitution in the first place , drafted a bill of rights .
Though he originally opposed the idea , by the time he ran for a seat in the House , he used the creation of a bill as part of his campaign .
He introduced the bill into the House , which debated it at length and approved 17 articles of amendment .
The Senate took up the bill and reduced the number to 12 , by combining some and rejecting others .
The House accepted the Senate 's changes , voting on September 24th and 25th , 1789 ; twelve articles of amendment were sent to the states for ratification .
The first two articles were not accepted by enough states , but the last ten were .
We know them today as Amendments 1 through 10 .
The second article was eventually ratified as the 27th Amendment .
The first ten amendments , collectively known as the Bill of Rights , were ratified on December 15 , 1791 ( 811 days ) .
A photographic image of the badly - faded original Bill is available on this site .
11th Amendment
The 11th Amendment came about as a direct result of the Supreme Court decision in Chisholm v Georgia ( 2 U.S. 419 ) in 1793 ( see the Events Page for details ) .
Congress felt that the Supreme Court had over stepped its bounds , and feared it would do so again unless prohibited by the Constitution .
The Chisholm case was decided in 1793 , just five years after the adoption of the Constitution .
The Amendment was approved by Congress on March 4 , 1794 , and ratified on February 7 , 1795 ( 340 days ) .
The Amendment limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to automatically hear cases brought against a state by the citizens of another state .
Later interpretations have expanded this to include citizens of the state being sued , as well .
In Hollingsworth v Virginia ( 3 USC 378 [ 1798 ] ) , the passage and ratification of the 11th was challenged for two reasons .
First because the President did not sign the amendment bill , and second because the amendment presented a situation where people had some legal relief before ratification that dried up after , creating an ex post facto situation .
The Supreme Court rejected both challenges , setting some important precedent for future amendments .
12th Amendment
The Constitution was written before parties were a player in American politics .
When John Adams was chosen for President in the 1796 election , the second - place candidate , Thomas Jefferson , became Vice President — but Adams was a Federalist and Jefferson was a Democratic - Republican .
The two clashed several times during Adams 's presidency , though Adams 's conflicts with Hamilton , a Federalist , too , probably caused Adams more concern .
In the election of 1800 , the flaws of the original system became more than apparent .
Jefferson and Aaron Burr both got 73 votes in the Electoral College , forcing the House of Representatives to choose .
The problem ?
Both Jefferson and Burr were candidates of the same party , with Burr chosen to be the Vice President ; some states preferred Burr , and neither was able to get the required majority until the stalemate was ultimately broken .
The result was the 12th Amendment , approved in Congress on December 9 , 1803 , and ratified on June 15 , 1804 ( 189 days ) , in time for the new process to be in place for the 1804 election .
With the 12th , Electors are directed to vote for a President and for a Vice President rather than for two choices for President .
13th Amendment
Slavery was an institution in America in the 18th and 19th centuries .
The Southern states , with their agricultural economies , relied on the slavery system to ensure the cash crops ( cotton , hemp , rice , indigo , and tobacco , primarily ) were tended and cultivated .
Slaves were not unknown in the North , but abolition in the North was completed by the 1830's .
In 1808 , the Congress prohibited the slave trade , not a year later than allowed in the Constitution .
A series of compromises , laws , acts , and bills tried to keep the balance between the slave states and the non-slave states .
For a more thorough history of slavery , see the Slavery Topic Page .
South Carolina voted to secede from the United States as a result of Abraham Lincoln 's election to the Presidency .
Lincoln had , over time , voiced strong objections to slavery , and his incoming administration was viewed as a threat to the right of the states to keep their institutions , particularly that of slavery , the business of the states .
More states seceded , eleven in all , forming the Confederate States of America .
The secession movement led to the Civil War .
In the waning days of the war , which ran from 1861 to 1865 , the Congress approved an amendment to abolish slavery in all of the United States .
Once the CSA was defeated , approval of the 13th Amendment was quick in the Northern states .
By the end of 1865 , eight of the eleven Confederate states had also ratified it .
Proposed on January 31 , 1865 , it was ratified on December 6 , 1865 ( 309 days ) .
Eventually , all of the CSA states except Mississippi ratified the 13th after the war ; Mississippi ratified the amendment in 1995 .
14th Amendment
The ratification of the 13th Amendment was a major victory for the North , and it was hoped that with the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment , the effects of slavery in the United States would quickly diminish .
The original plan to readmit states after acceptance of the 13th was supported by President Andrew Johnson , but the Radical Republicans , as they became known , wanted more than just a return to normalcy .
They wanted to keep the power they had attained during the war years .
The South did not make it easy for Johnson , however , and the so - called Black Codes started to be passed in Southern states .
Congressional inquiries into the Black Codes found them to be a new way of controlling ex-slaves , fraught with violence and cruelty .
The ensuing Reconstruction Acts placed the former CSA states under military rule , and prohibited their congressmen 's readmittance to Congress until after several steps had been taken , including the approval of the 14th Amendment .
The 14th was designed to ensure that all former slaves were granted automatic United States citizenship , and that they would have all the rights and privileges as any other citizen .
The amendment passed Congress on June 13 , 1866 , and was ratified on July 9 , 1868 ( 757 days ) .
15th Amendment
The last of the Reconstruction Amendments , the 15th Amendment was designed to close the last loophole in the establishment of civil rights for newly - freed black slaves .
It ensured that a person 's race , color , or prior history as a slave could not be used to bar that person from voting .
Though a noble idea , it had little practical effect for quite some time , as the Southern states found myriad ways to intimidate blacks to keep them from voting .
The Congress passed the amendment on February 26 , 1869 , and it was ratified on February 3 , 1870 ( 342 days ) .
Though ratification of the 15th Amendment was not a requirement for readmittance of the Confederate states to the Congress , one of the provisions of the Reconstruction Acts required that the states include a provision in their new constitutions that included a near - copy of the text of the 15th .
All of the CSA states except Tennessee , which was immune from the Reconstruction Acts , eventually ratified the 15th Amendment .
16th Amendment
In 1895 , in the Supreme Court case of Pollock v Farmer 's Loan and Trust ( 157 U.S. 429 ) , the Court disallowed a federal tax on income from real property .
The tax was designed to be an indirect tax , which would mean that states need not contribute portions of a whole relative to its census figures .
The Court , however , ruled that the tax was a direct tax and subject to apportionment .
This was the last in a series of conflicting court decisions dating back to the Civil War .
Between 1895 and 1909 , when the amendment was passed by Congress , the Court began to back down on its position , as it became clear not only to accountants but to everyone that the solvency of the nation was in jeopardy .
In a series of cases , the definition of " direct tax " was modified , bent , twisted , and coaxed to allow more taxation efforts that approached an income tax .
Finally , with the ratification of the 16th Amendment , any doubt was removed .
The text of the Amendment makes it clear that though the categories of direct and indirect taxation still exist , any determination that income tax is a direct tax will be irrelevant , because taxes on incomes , from salary or from real estate , are explicitly to be treated as indirect .
The Congress passed the Amendment on July 12 , 1909 , and it was ratified on February 3 , 1913 ( 1,302 days ) .
17th Amendment
One of the most common critiques of the Framers is that the government that they created was , in many ways , undemocratic .
There is little doubt of this , and it is so by design .
The Electoral College , by which we choose our President , is one example .
The appointment of judges is another .
And the selection of Senators not by the people but by the state legislatures , is yet another .
The Senatorial selection system eventually became fraught with problems , with consecutive state legislatures sending different Senators to Congress , forcing the Senate to work out who was the qualified candidate , or with the selection system being corrupted by bribery and corruption .
In several states , the selection of Senators was left up to the people in referenda , where the legislature approved the people 's choice and sent him or her to the Senate .
Articles written by early 20th - century muckrakers also provided grist for the popular - election mill .
The 17th Amendment did away with all the ambiguity with a simple premise — the Senators would be chosen by the people , just as Representatives are .
Of course , since the candidates now had to cater to hundreds of thousands , or millions , of people instead of just a few hundred , other issues , such as campaign finances , were introduced .
The 17th is not a panacea , but it brings government closer to the people .
The Amendment was passed by Congress on May 13 , 1912 , and was ratified on April 8 , 1913 ( 330 days ) .
18th Amendment
Consumption of alcohol was discouraged by law in many of the states over the first century of the United States under the Constitution .
By 1855 , 13 of the 31 states had temperance , or alcohol prohibition , laws .
The Civil War distracted the public from the temperance movement , but the proliferation of saloons after the Civil War , and the trappings of the saloons ( like gambling , prostitution , and public drunkenness ) led to the so - called " Women 's War " in 1873 .
Over time , the movement became more organized and the Anti-Saloon League was established in 1893 .
The ASL 's goal was national prohibition , and it set up an office in Washington to that end — it even established its own publishing house in Westerville , Ohio .
The ASL polled candidates on their stand on the temperance question , endorsing candidates with a pro-temperance stance .
In the election of 1915 , ASL - sponsored candidates swept the elections for Congress , and on December 18 , 1917 , Congress passed the 18th Amendment .
It quickly was adopted by the states , being ratified in just over a year , on January 16 , 1919 ( 394 days ) .
19th Amendment
Though the Constitution originally made no mention of a woman 's right to vote , it was implied by society — women simply did not have the right .
The 14th Amendment actually made things worse , by codifying the suffrage right to men only , when its Second Clause punished the denial of suffrage to men ( though this still did not officially deny women the right ) .
As early as 1848 , groups met to discuss how to further women 's rights , and the franchise , it was decided , was the best place to start .
But America was not ready , and the suffragists , as they were called , were branded as immoral .
Famous women 's rights leaders Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton tried to make a stand after the Civil War , to have the language of the 14th Amendment include women , though the issue was thought too volatile by most , and passage of the amendment was thought to be in grave jeopardy if such a provision were included .
Anthony later used the 15th Amendment as rationale for voting in a New York election , and though she was tried and fined for voting , the ordeal proved an impetus for the eventual guarantee of voting rights for women .
By 1918 , about half the states had granted women full or partial voting rights ; the stature gained by women involved in the temperance movement also helped push the suffragist movement along .
The support of women to the war effort convinced many more , even President Woodrow Wilson , who had been staunchly opposed to a federal suffrage amendment .
On June 4 , 1919 , the 19th Amendment was passed by Congress , and it was ratified on August 18 , 1920 ( 441 days ) .
20th Amendment
The term " Lame Duck " originates in the mid 1700's .
It is applied to an elected official who has not been reelected , but still holds office .
For example , in the United States today , the President is elected in November , and inaugurated in January of the following year — the time in between if the President was not reelected , is the lame duck period .
Early in the political history of the nation , the period between the election and swearing - in of elected officials was a small issue .
With slow methods of transportation and the nature of the politician in the 18th century , the lame duck period was almost a necessity .
In fact , once the November election was established , it was more than a year before newly elected congressmen met in December .
But from the start , the lame duck period was a problem , most famously illustrated in the Marbury v Madison case , where lame - duck appointments by out - going President John Adams set the stage for a landmark Supreme Court decision with his series of late - night , last - minute appointments .
The 20th Amendment cleared up this problem to a degree , by shortening the lame duck period .
The Congress is sworn in on January 3 following the election , and the President is sworn in on January 20 , rather than the March 4th prescribed in the 12th Amendment .
The Amendment also closes a gap in Presidential power by specifying what will happen if a President - elect dies before he is sworn in .
The 20th Amendment was passed by Congress on March 2 , 1932 , and was ratified by the states on January 23 , 1933 ( 327 days ) .
The 20th reached some notoriety during the impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton in 1998 ; the final House vote was taken after the 1998 elections , and the Senate was not scheduled to hear the case until after the swearing - in of the next Congress in 1999 .
Arguments that the 20th conceptually required a revote by the new House were fruitless , however .
21st Amendment
It would be a disservice to say that the 18th Amendment was completely ineffective .
It would also be a disservice to say that the 18th Amendment caused the lawlessness embodied by people like Al Capone .
The 18th Amendment did reduce alcohol consumption in the United States , and it did not cause organized crime .
In the Prohibition era , alcohol consumption ( measured in gallons of ethanol consumed ) dropped to an average of less than a gallon per person per year , down from two and a half gallons in 1915 .
And organized crime existed before Prohibition , and existed after it , too .
That having been said , the Prohibition era did have a certain sense of lawlessness ; the very fact that consumption was not eliminated is testimony to that ; and the fact that organized crime manufactured and distributed the bulk of the illicit alcohol of the 1920's and early 1930's is evidence that gangsters were aided by Prohibition .
Enforcement was spotty , with stills and speakeasies popping up in every population center .
Over-zealous police and federal agents violated civil rights when searching for and destroying the paraphernalia of alcohol .
While most Americans respected the law , were in favor of the law , the shine of " dry " began to wear off , especially as the Great Depression set in .
A movement began to form to repeal the 18th Amendment .
Prohibition of alcohol was seen as an affront to personal liberty , pushed on the nation by religious moralists .
Alcohol was also seen as a source of revenue for the local and national governments .
The effort to elect " wet " legislators was as grand as that to elect " dry " ones almost two decades earlier .
The Congress passed the amendment on February 20 , 1933 ( 288 days ) .
It mandated , for the first time , that conventions of the states were to vote on the amendment , rather than the legislatures , feeling that conventions would be more apt to vote to ratify - and they did , quickly — the ratification process was complete on December 5 , 1933 .
The 21st Amendment repealed the 18th , the first time an amendment had been repealed by another .
22nd Amendment
Since the presidency of George Washington , only one thing could be said to be totally consistent — that no President had the job for more than two full terms .
Washington had been asked to run for a third term in 1796 , but he made it quite clear that he had no intention of doing so ; that an orderly transition of power was needed to set the Constitution in stone .
And so it was for almost 150 years .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was first elected President in 1932 , and re-elected in 1936 .
When it came time for the Democrats to nominate a candidate for the Presidency in 1940 , two things had happened .
First , the Republicans had made great gains in Congress in the 1938 elections .
And Hitler happened .
Europe was in the throes of a great war , with trouble in the Pacific , too .
A change away from Roosevelt , who had led the nation through the Great Depression , did not seem wise .
He was nominated for an unprecedented third term , and won .
It was not a landslide victory , however , and it is debatable that FDR would have had a third term had it not been for the war .
When 1944 rolled around , changing leaders in the middle of World War II , which the United States was now fully engaged in , also seemed unwise , and FDR ran for and was elected to , a fourth term .
His life was nearly over , however , and his Vice President , Harry Truman , became President upon FDR 's death less than 100 days after his inauguration .
Though FDR 's leadership was seen by many as a key reason that the U.S. came out of WWII victorious , the Congress was determined , once the war ended , to ensure that Washington 's self - imposed two - term limit become the law of the land .
Specifically excepting Truman from its provisions , the 22nd Amendment passed Congress on March 21 , 1947 .
After Truman won a second term in 1948 , it was ratified on February 27 , 1951 ( 1,439 days ) .
Truman could have run for a third term , but bowed out early before campaigning began .
23rd Amendment
The District of Columbia has been a unique city since its founding in 1800 as the seat of the new government .
When first established , it was a town of 5000 , and it was assumed that it would be the center of government , and not a population center .
But by 1900 , over a quarter of a million people lived within its bounds .
Since it is a federal district , however , and not a state , the inhabitants not only had no real local government , they had no vote in the federal government either .
By 1960 , when 760,000 people lived in Washington , D.C. , it seemed odd that people from a dozen states , with lower populations , had more voting rights than residents of the District .
As citizens , they were required to pay taxes and to serve in the military , but a vote in the Presidential election was available only to the states .
It is important to note that the 23rd Amendment does not make Washington , D.C. , a state ; it just confers upon its citizens the number of electors that it would have if it were a state .
It also did not provide full representation in Congress for the District .
The Congress passed the amendment on June 17 , 1960 ; the amendment was ratified on March 29 , 1961 ( 285 days ) .
24th Amendment
One of the last legal vestiges of segregation was the effort to keep the black population from participating in the vote .
With most methods for keeping the black vote to a minimum declared unconstitutional , several Southern states found an answer — the poll tax .
The poll tax has a long history , and was often used in Europe to raise funds .
With a poll tax , in order to vote , a certain tax must be paid .
The tax is the same for all , which allowed the generally more affluent white population access to the polls with a minimum of pain , while the generally poorer black population would have trouble justifying trading food on the table for a vote in the ballot box .
Worse , different kinds of poll taxes were implemented , some accumulating even if no attempt was made to vote , meaning increasingly higher back - taxes to be paid to gain the vote .
In 1939 , Congress began to try to get rid of the poll tax , but history was not behind them .
After all , in colonial times and when the Constitution first came into effect , land ownership was often a requirement for suffrage .
Though only five states still had a poll tax by the time the amendment passed Congress , Supreme Court rulings made it doubtful that mere legislation would eliminate the tax altogether .
Proposed by Congress on August 27 , 1962 , the 24th Amendment was ratified within a year and a half , on January 23 , 1964 ( 514 days ) .
25th Amendment
When Dwight Eisenhower was president , he suffered from several medical issues that created a power vacuum .
Eisenhower and his Vice President Richard Nixon entered into an agreement that allowed Nixon to become Acting President while Eisenhower was incapacitated .
The agreement was between the two men and did not have constitutional authority , but it set a precedent that was followed by the following presidents , John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson .
Nothing prepared anyone , however , for the national tragedy of the Kennedy assassination .
The 1963 assassination shocked the nation in more ways than the obvious .
The advancement of medical technology had many hoping that the President could have been saved after being shot .
That was not the case , but if he had been , Kennedy could have been in a coma for an extended period of time , perhaps never able to fully function again .
The Eisenhower - Nixon agreement set some things in motion , but was extra-constitutional .
The Vice President would be the President , but would not be able to fulfill his duties .
The resulting power vacuum would cause a constitutional crisis — who has the power of the Presidency ?
Less than two years after Kennedy 's death , on July 6 , 1965 , the Congress passed the 25th Amendment , where the line of succession was not only clarified , but what was to be done in the case of presidential disability was addressed .
The selection of a Vice President for an empty Vice Presidential seat was also provided for .
The states ratified the amendment on February 10 , 1967 ( 584 days ) .
The second clause , dealing with the filling of a vacancy in the Vice Presidency , was used less than six years later when Gerald Ford assumed the Vice Presidency upon the resignation of Spiro Agnew .
26th Amendment
The United States was in the throes of the Vietnam War and protests were underway throughout the nation .
Draftees into the armed services were any male over the age of 18 .
There was a seeming dichotomy , however : these young men were allowed , even forced , to fight and die for their country , but they were unable to vote .
The 14th Amendment only guaranteed the vote , in a roundabout way , to those over twenty - one .
The Congress attempted to right this wrong in 1970 by passing an extension to the 1965 Voting Rights Act ( which itself is enforcement legislation based on prior suffrage amendments ) that gave the vote to all persons 18 or older , in all elections , on all levels .
Oregon objected to the 18 - year - old limit , as well as other provisions of the 1970 Act ( it also objected to a prohibition on literacy tests for the franchise ) .
In Oregon v Mitchell ( 400 U.S. 112 ) , a sharply divided Supreme Court ruled that the Congress had the power to lower the voting age to 18 for national elections , but not for state and local elections .
The case was decided on December 1 , 1970 .
Within months , on March 23 , 1971 , the Congress passed the text of the 26th Amendment , specifically setting a national voting age , in both state and national elections , to 18 .
In just 100 days , on July 1 , 1971 , the amendment was ratified .
Close Up , an organization dedicated to involving youth in government , has produced a PDF pamphlet on the 26th Amendment and history .
You can find the pamphlet on their web site .
27th Amendment
The 27th Amendment was originally proposed on September 25 , 1789 , as an article in the original Bill of Rights .
It did not pass the required number of states with the articles we now know as the first ten amendments .
It sat , unratified and with no expiration date , in constitutional limbo , for more than 80 years when Ohio ratified it to protest a congressional pay hike ; no other states followed Ohio 's lead , however .
Again it languished , for more than 100 years .
In 1978 , Wyoming ratified the amendment , but there was again , no follow - up by the remaining states .
Then , in the early 1980's , Gregory Watson , an aide to a Texas legislator , took up the proposed amendment 's cause .
From 1983 to 1992 , the requisite number of states ratified the amendment , and it was declared ratified on May 7 , 1992 ( 74,003 days ) .

Ding , Dong , the Witz has Fled
The reaction among World Bank employees at the news that Paul Wolfowitz , their president , will resign on June 30 :
‘ “ Everyone ran into the hallways and were clapping and hugging each other , ” one employee , who declined to be named , said . ‘
Bush earlier today complained about journalists dancing on Tony Blair ’s political grave .
He did n’t know the half of it .
Those who missed this earlier posting will be interested in my Salon column this week on “ Wolfowitz ’s Fatal Flaw . ”
Senator John Kerry ( D - MA ) was in New York City on Monday to promote , the book on a new environmentalism that Kerry wrote with his wife , Teresa Heinz Kerry .
The 2004 Democratic presidential nominee spent almost 30 minutes with me discussing his book and the factors that drove him to push for greater public recognition of the dangers caused by global climate change .
We also touched on other issues including the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings this week on the Justice Department scandal , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's trip to Syria , the Democratic drive to withdraw U.S. troops from the Iraqi civil war and why Dick Cheney just can't stop lying to the American people about Iraq and terrorism .
I met with the relaxed and friendly Senator Kerry before his appearance onon Monday .
Here , along with some audio clips , is that interview .
With the passion you have and the voice you 've had on the Iraq war and issues like health care for all American children , what is it in the last two and a half years , since the presidential election , that prompted you to write this book , at this time ?
During the campaign in ' 04 , everywhere we went , I raised environmental issues , every state I went to , we did environment events , from clean coal technology in West Virginia to hog farms in Iowa to wind farms in Minnesota to coastal erosion in Louisiana , I mean , you name it .
And people did n’t seem to connect the dots as much as we thought they should and at the end of the campaign there was a feeling somehow -- there was even an article written ' Is Environmentalism Dead ? ' -- and it was in response to that that we wanted to redefine that environmentalism has been shoved a little bit into a corner until recently and now it 's beginning to break out again , thank heavens .
But mostly , this was an effort to try to connect the dots for people , so they began to see environmentalism not as caring less about the economy and caring less about jobs and caring less about health about education and security -- they 're all linked .
And that environmentalism is those things and more .
And we wanted to show people , other people around America who get it , who are n't your typical environmentalist -- like a Marine who 's taking care of the rivers down in North Carolina or the rancher out in New Mexico who was a Bush organizer who 's fighting to preserve her land .
There 's a lot of folks out there who understand what 's at stake who are doing amazing things to change the direction of the country .
We wanted people to know about it and see it and give a new sense of what it means to care about the environment .
So in 2004 you mentioned the environment in almost every speech you gave on the campaign trail … .
There was no speech that I gave where Italk about energy independence , global climate change and the combined need to put our efforts into alternative and renewable fuels , all of them -- including my acceptance speech .
But what do you think it is over the last year or two that kind of flipped the switch in the heads of a lot of Americans , that 's made them start paying more attention to climate change and global warming ?
Well , several things .
One , the issues are becoming more urgent and the media has begun to cover it with a greater sense of urgency .
Two , Al Gore 's movie obviously helped to penetrate the public consciousness in a very big way .
And I think that had a lot of impact in helping shift the view on that issue and , three , locally there 's sort of a critical mass beginning to gather again , like there was in 1970 , where people are prepared to go out and try to make a difference .
I think also the specter of category one hurricanes becoming category fives overnight and …
Well , you know , you had four hurricanes the summer that we were running in ' 04 , that kept me out of Florida …
But I think the accumulation of all of that , the changes in weather systems locally , people just inherently know something 's happened .
Now , you say in the book that the people actually doing something to address global climate change and who are very active , you said that they 're not " surrendering to pessimism and scare tactics . "
Approaching it from another angle , what do you say about Congressional Republicans like Senator Inhofe who say -- and I think you quote him in your book saying that it's all a hoax , that climate change is all a hoax .
What do you say about Congressional Republicans who say that and then as a follow - up , what do you say to Americans who get confused when they hear you , your wife , Vice President Gore talking about climate change and then they hear a United States Senator saying it 's all BS ?
There have always been professional deniers , in our lives , in society .
What we say to people is you 've got to go look at the science yourself .
Use your God - given talent and brain and thinking ability and just go look at the facts .
Weigh the evidence .
When you have 3,000 scientists from 130 countries , all of whom agree in 928 scientifically - reviewed studies that this is happening , versus one or two or three scientists who sort of raise some questions -- of whom can undo the theory of global climate change .of whom have a peer - reviewed study to refer to .
You 've got to put your measure of common sense against those things and that 's what you ask people to do .
And it seems like when we talked about taking back the Senate -- by a slim margin though it may be -- is n’t that where the change in committee chairmanships really makes a difference , having Senator Boxer as chair of that committee now ?
Oh , it makes a huge difference .
Absolutely .
She 's a terrific champion for the environment , she 's working hard … we can now call hearings , we can now have witnesses , where as we could n’t before .
You could n't air this at all and have accountability .
Now that we 're able to do that , I think it ’s beginning to change the information flow to people .
What is it about the direct link between dependence on foreign oil and national security that the average American just does n’t seem to get and what would you say to a group of those Americans who do n’t make that connection if they were sitting with you right now ?
I 'd look them in the eye and I 'd say , how do you believe that being dependent on the Arabs nations for our oil , with the Middle East being as volatile as it is , transferring billions of your dollars to that part of the world -- and some of it to terrorists -- how does that make America safer ?
It 's a simple question and I think that people when they weigh that begin to see that being able to create jobs here in America , that create our energy here in America , that make us dependent on America for America 's energy , makes you a stronger nation -- economically , in terms of health and our job base and the next generations and obviously that translates into security .
If you 're producing your own energy you 're more secure .
Inyou discuss the collision course that we 're on with our physical health and climate change -- can you talk a little about the health affects of climate change , albeit from a non-physician 's point of view ?
Climate change has already taken enormous numbers of lives …
There were some 35,000 lives lost to the heat wave that we had in Europe last summer and in our country .
It raises the pollution levels in the air , which increases the problems with asthma and those with emphysema and other lung deficiencies feel it more acutely as a consequence .
There 's no question that six of the last 10 years have been the hottest years on record and 10 of the last 20 , I think it is , have been the hottest years on record .
Last year was the hottest year on record , so you 're looking at a complete trend line that keeps threatening species , threatening air quality , threatening sea level rise , threatening crops and the movement of crops .
Certain diseases carried by bugs , the bugs with those diseases that used to die because of the temperature do n’t and they flourish in places they did n’t before .
I 'll give you an example :
In Sweden , they have an infestation of ticks -- ticks used to die , now the ticks are out there spreading disease .
There 's any number of ways that this all flows downstream .
So you talk in the book about an Energy Plan and the first component of it is " reverse and stop emissions that cause global warming . "
What 's the latest with your legislation , theWe 're having a series of hearings in several committees , the Energy Committee with Senator Bingaman , the Environment and Public Works Committee , Senator Boxer , the Commerce Committee , myself and Senator Inouye …
We 're holding those hearings now and focusing on a cap on carbon , you 've got to put a price on carbon .
If you put a price on carbon , then we can begin to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions in the air .
There are three keys : Number one is energy efficiency -- we 've gotta get more energy efficiency in America , there 's all kinds of ways to do it , solar , wind , alternative , renewable …
You design buildings more effectively , there 's any number of things we can do .
The second thing we 've got to do is create more alternative energy supplies for Americans , so they can go fill up their cars and use a fuel that does n't send the same kind of carbon into the atmosphere .
And third , clean coal technology .
We have a lot of coal - fired power plants in America , we have a lot of coal in America , we need to produce power for the future and the key is to make sure that coal burns clean .
I 'd like to ask you some questions on non-environmental issues …
Go right ahead …
We 'll cover whatever you want to cover .
You 're not on the Senate Judiciary Committee , but working as closely as you do with Senator Kennedy and Senator Feingold , how do you see the hearings going tomorrow with Attorney General Gonzales ?
I think he's got a lot of explaining to do and I think that if the homework has been done correctly , as I suspect it has , he 's going to have a hard time doing that .
On the Pelosi trip to Syria …
Can you comment further on the kind of heat Speaker Pelosi took from Republicans for her trip to Syria , that was even more than was lobbed at you and Senator Dodd when you went there last year …
I think it was appropriate for her to go .
I think this is a lot of fuss over nothing and the administration certainly has a right to say it has a different policy but they ought to embrace her going over and say " look , if you learn something important , tell us . "
Why be so defensive about it ?
Why are they so defensive when they 're so chronically stubborn and lazy about diplomacy themselves ?
Yeah ..
And attack Speaker Pelosi when she picks up that ball …
I think it was entirely appropriate for her to go , find the facts , find out what 's going on , listen carefully and get a sense for what the possibilities are for American policy .
And that is a Congressional responsibility and it 's just fine .
Along with Senator Dodd , you were the first to step up to the plate on the Feingold - Reid bill …
I 'm wondering what your comment is on what a lot of us in the Progressive media see as a disheartening lack of spine on the part of some of your colleagues -- and that 's the way we see it -- some of your colleagues in the House and the Senate and them not being willing to stand up and support it as you have and Senator Dodd has and Senator Sanders has .
Are they waiting for more than two - thirds of the American people to agree with them ?
I can't speak for my colleagues .
You 'll have to ask them why .
I 'm doing it because I believe it is the right thing to change the financing .
This is not a cut - off that somehow injures our troops .
This changes what we 're spending for .
This means we 're not spending to send our troops door - to - door to do missions that create more problems .
It means we 're going to spend to help train and finish training the Iraqis .
It means we 're going to spend to chase al - Qaeda .
And we do n’t need to have the escalation of this war , which has brought more violence , more Americans dead , and certainly no great progress on the political side .
I think it 's just deepened the crisis , what the president 's done .
There 's nothing more important to speak your mind on than war .
What can we tell Democrats who continue to argue in Republican talking points by saying that they will not vote for any bill that cuts off funding to the troops , instead of re-framing it as cutting off funding for this disastrous war ?
Well it 's not even cutting funding -- it ’s changing what you 're spending money for .
People like to say cutting money for the war but that just plays into their hands .
It 's not cutting funding .
It 's changing what the money is for -- it 's spending money for a more intelligent mission .
The mission is to complete the training of Iraqis , to chase al - Qaeda , to protect American forces and draw down our troops .
We 're spending to reposition and redeploy and that is a smarter way to resolve what is happening in Iraq today .
I cover the Senate pretty closely .
I understand the way it works , I understand the way things are said .
How does a Democratic Senator balance the need for civility and consensus building and at the same time address a constituency that 'sand that does n't want to reach across the aisle ?
You have to honor the constituency -- any constituency .
I honor peoples ' point of view and respect what they 're saying but try to channel the anger and frustration into a constructive way of getting something done .
I understand the anger -- I share a lot of it .
But what we have to do is persuade some of our colleagues to come over to a different place .
Politics is the art of the possible and so you have to change opinions .
I applaud what the grassroots is doing because the grassroots is helping to change opinions and helping to change peoples ' sense of what 's possible .
And we have to keep doing it .
Remember , last year when I brought the amendment to the floor of the Senate , in the summer of ' 06 , that set a date for withdrawal , I got 13 votes .
And I got a nice front - page story in the New York Times vilifying me , through my colleagues , for even bringing the subject up .
Well , guess what ?
Three months later , the closing argument for the Democratic party in the elections , was Iraq .
And within a year , we had 48 votes and then 50 -- to do exactly what I 'd suggested .
I think it is the right position .
It was the right position then , it 's the right position now .
It has to be -- it 's not in a vacuum .
And it 's very important to write about it as not being in a vacuum .
It is done in the context of serious diplomacy that gets you a leveraged change in the regional security arrangement .
That 's critical to the United States being withdrawn -- I do n’t just say leave chaos .
I 'm not just saying abandon .
If you read the full measure of the proposal , it is , in fact a change in why we 're deployed and what we 're trying to do with that deployment , how we get our troops out and what we ought to be doing .
That 's what it is .
Senator , why does Dick Cheney keep telling the same lies over and over again about Iraq and the substance of what the war on terror is ?
I can't figure out Dick Cheney .
You 'll have to ask Dick Cheney why he keeps telling those …
He wo n’t talk to me .
Well , somebody has to ask him that .
It 's shocking to me that he is able to pass off as much disinformation to the American people as he does and as he has .
From his insurgency in its last throes , to his insistence about al - Qaeda and other things , he simply has not , I think , told the American people the truth about this war .
Last question : Apparently you said something in Denver that has the blogosphere buzzing about you possibly getting into the presidential race …
No .
What I said is the same thing I 've said previously which is , in answer to a question " are you ever going to run for president again -- will you run ? "
I said you never say never .
I 've said that I do n’t know what comes in the future and it 's possible things change and I might end up doing it .
But I have not put that in the context of now and this race .
I 've said I 'm running for reelection , I do n’t think this is the right time .
That 's the decision I 've made and resting with it .
The average human retina has five million cone receptors on it .
Since the cones are responsible for colour vision , you might suppose that this equates to a five megapixel equivilant for the human eye .
But there are also a hundred million rods that detect monochrome contrast , which plays an important role in the sharpness of the image you see .
And even this 105MP is an underestimate because the eye is not a still camera .
You have two eyes ( no kidding ! ) and they continually flick around to cover a much larger area than your field of view and the composite image is assembled in the brain - not unlike stitching together a panoramic photo .
In good light , you can distinguish two fine lines if they are seperate by at least 0.6 arc-minutes ( 0.01 .
Degrees ) .
This gives an equivilant pixel size of 0.3 arc -minutes .
If you take a conservative 120 degrees as your horizontal field of view and 60 degrees in the vertical plane , this translates to ...576 megapixels of available image data .
Curiously - as a counterpoint to this - most people cannot distinguish the difference in quality between a 300dpi and a 150dpi photo when printed at 6x4 " , when viewed at normal viewing distances .
So : although the human eye and brain when combined can resolve massive amounts of data , for imaging purposes , 150d pi output is more than enough to provide adequate data for us to accept the result as photographic quality .
But do n't forget that women have more cones and men have more rods - I kid you not .
Therefore the ladies see colours brighter than gents but can't see as well when it gets dark .

Geotimes - June 2007 - Colossal crystals discovered in cave NEWS NOTES — NEWS Mineralogy
Colossal crystals discovered in cave
In one of the largest lead and silver mines in the world , workers discovered what researchers are calling the “ cathedral ” of giant gypsum crystals about 300 meters ( about 1,000 feet ) belowground .
The Naica mine in Mexico contains “ huge crystalline beams , ” with moonlight luster that is “ unforgettable , ” says Juan Manuel García - Ruiz , a crystallographer at the Universidad de Granada in Spain .
The giant , faceted crystals of gypsum — a soft , whitish mineral — are as long as 11 meters ( 36 feet ) and up to 1 meter ( about 3 feet ) thick .
To figure out how the crystals grew so large , García - Ruiz and colleagues studied tiny bubbles of fluids that were trapped in the crystals while they were growing .
The researchers found that the perfect balance of temperature and salinity of the waters from which the crystals grew spurred the massive crystal growth .
If temperatures were much cooler , millions of small crystals of gypsum would have formed instead , and if temperatures were much warmer , a different mineral would have formed , the researchers reported in the April issue of Geology .
These crystals can continue to bloom if conditions are right , García - Ruiz says .
Currently , the crystals are no longer growing because the water that feeds them is being pumped out of the cave to allow mining and exploration .
If the water were allowed to run naturally through the system , however , the crystals would likely keep on growing .
Although large gypsum crystals have been found in other locations , such as near Segobriga , Spain , and in the Cave of Swords in Chihuahua , Mexico , near the Cave of Crystals , says García - Ruiz , they are unrivaled and should be preserved .
These colossal crystals , he says , are “ every crystallographer ’s dream . ”

But this is simply not going to happen .
There is no feasible way we can achieve the Kyoto targets .
All of the opposition parties in Ottawa say that they support the Kyoto accord , and they insist that any climate change policy must be aimed at achieving the Kyoto targets for greenhouse gas emissions .
Here is a graph of Canada 's greenhouse gas emissions ( GGE ) over the period 1990 - 2004 , taken from the Environment Canada website :
There are several things to note from this graph .
Firstly , the rate of growth of GGE has been remarkably stable throughout this period , at around 1.7 % a year : the only time GGE growth slowed appreciably was during the economic slowdown of 2001 .
A second , related point is that the rate of growth after the 1998 signing the Kyoto accord is pretty much the same as it was before the treaty was signed .
But the big point is just what is involved in getting from where we are to to the Kyoto target in the bottom right - hand corner of the graph .
If we extrapolate the trend to 2007 ( and I do n't see why this would n't be a reasonably good estimate ) , then achieving the Kyoto target would require decreasing emissions by more than 30 % of their current levels .
There are two main channels by which we can reduce GGE :
For a given state of technology , we can cut down on certain activities that generate GGE as a by - product .
For a given choice of activities , we can adopt technologies that generate fewer GGEs .
There 's no reason to choose between these options , of course : we can do both .
What distinguishes them is the horizon in which they work .
Even if the appropriate technologies are already available - and that 's not always the case here - adopting them is a process whose duration is measured in decades .
For example , hybrid cars are a proven technology , and some are already on the market .
But any realistic policy for replacing conventional cars with hybrids would take decades to implement , and it's hard to imagine achieving much more than marginal progress before 2012 .
The same argument applies for the other technologies that have been proposed to reduce GGEs .
There are many good ideas out there , and some will no doubt be part of a long - term solution - but not in time for the Kyoto deadline .
So any serious attempt to achieve the Kyoto goals would have to be based on using the technology we have now .
That can only happen by cutting back on activities that generate GGEs .
Which ones , and by how much ?
The Kyoto target is the equivalent of 563 mt of CO 2 by 2012 .
In 2004 , emissions were the equivalent of 758 mt , making a ' Kyoto gap ' of 195 mt .
What sort of action would generate savings like that ?
Here is a breakdown of the sources of GGEs in 2004 :
The scale of the problem is staggering .
For example , we know that the fossil fuels industry and its associated fugitive sources are a major source of GGEs .
But even if we shut the industry down entirely - a gesture that would have catastrophic implications for the Canadian economy , and important effects worldwide - it would n't be enough .
In the short run , we can expect greenhouse gas emissions to be roughly proportional to economic activity .
Reducing emissions by 30 % in the next 5 years means a reduction of income and employment on a scale commensurate with the Great Depression .
No government would inflict such disruption , nor should it .
Update : The price of Kyoto .
In the ensuing days , the guards became ever more sadistic , denying the prisoners food , water and sleep , shooting them with fire - extinguisher spray , throwing their blankets into dirt , stripping them naked and dragging rebels across the yard .
How bad did it get ?
The guards ordered the prisoners to simulate sodomy .
Why ?
Because the guards were bored .
Boredom is a powerful motive for evil .
I have no idea how much worse things might have gotten .
Q . Why did you pull the plug on the experiment ?
A . On the fifth night , my former graduate student Christina Maslach came by .
She witnessed the guards putting bags over the prisoners ’ heads , chain their legs and march them around .
Chris ran out in tears .
“ I ’m not sure I want to have anything more to do with you , if this is the sort of person you are , ” she said .
“ It ’s terrible what you ’re doing to those boys . ” I thought , “ Oh my God , she ’s right . ”
Q. What ’s the difference between your study and the ones performed at Yale in 1961 ?
There , social psychologist Stanley Milgram ordered his subjects to give what they thought were painful and possibly lethal shocks to complete strangers .
Most complied .
A . In a lot of ways , the studies are bookends in our understanding of evil .
Milgram quantified the small steps that people take when they do evil .
He showed that an authority can command people to do things they believe they ’d never do .
I wanted to take that further .
Milgram ’s study only looked at one aspect of behavior , obedience to authority , in short 50 - minute takes .
The S.P.E. , because it was slated to go for two weeks , was almost like a forerunner of reality television .
You could see behavior unfolding hour by hour , day by day .

Here ’s something that ’s sort of funny .
The first time I spoke publicly about the S.P.E. , Stanley Milgram told me : “ Your study is going to take all the ethical heat off of my back .

American Empire
Noam Chomsky interviewed by Matthew Kennard
Global Empire : Interviste su globalizzazione , dominio petrolifero , libertà , Roma : Datanews , 2005 [ interview conducted on November 21 , 2004 ]
MK : The first question is the most basic I suppose .
To what extent do you think an American Empire exists today ?
NC : The term Empire is so vague and is used in so many different ways that I do n’t think the question can be answered .
There are various power systems in the world .
There are obviously tremendous inequities of power .
The US is far and away the most powerful component of the world system in terms of military force .
In terms of economic force it ’s basically one among three .
That ’s been true for a long time and is even more so today with North East Asia a very dynamic area , Europe roughly on a par with the US economically .
North East Asia and Europe are increasing their ties .
In fact , the EU and China became each others major trading partner this year 2004 and that ’s continuing so there is a complicated system of world domination and the US is , in many ways , pre-eminent but primarily because of its military force and its huge internal economy and it uses the force of course to dominate and control .
If you want to call it Empire okay if not okay word does n’t mean much .
MK : Okay , maybe I can word it differently .
How much is there a conscious pursuit of domination by the US ?
NC : It controls policy all the time .
I mean the US is unusual in that it has a very free society so we have quite good access to internal records – much better than any country I know of .
There ’s rational planning going on all the time and its about domination and control .
What would you expect it to be about ?
If you got the records of a corporation , you ’d find internal planning about increasing profits and market share .
If it ’s a state you find planning about how to control and dominate of the nature that others act in accord of the interests that are represented by the planners .
MK : So how far back does this conscious planning go ?
Is it post - WW2 ?
NC : It goes back to the revolutionary period .
Then they had much less ambitious plans .
But the Founding Fathers , so called , talked pretty openly , in fact , about what they called the “ rising American Empire ” .
They did n’t mean Empire in the sense that it later came to mean in the late 19th century .
This was a century earlier .
But they had plans to expand to the Pacific , to conquer Canada .
They were blocked by British force .
Britain was a deterrent .
They intended to take over the Spanish parts of the continental territory , Cuba go on as far south as they could .
The US did n’t become a major player on the global scene until after the Second World War .
It dominated the region , there were some forays into the Pacific .
But it was secondary to Britain .
I mean in fact even France up until the Second World War .
Then everything changed .
The Second World War , it was clear in the early stages of the war that the US was going to emerge as the world dominate power and there were high level planning meetings intensively going on from 1939 to 1945 , right through the war years .
These happen to be publicly available .
Its State department and Council on Foreign Relations , which is the main so - called private in put to the planning system – they ’re very closely integrated .
They had meetings through the Second World War planning for the post - war world and it was very explicit .
In the early part of the war they expected that Germany would survive and it would be a German controlled world which would be part of Eurasia and the rest they wanted to be US controlled .
They even had a name for it .
They called it the Grand Area .
It was defined as the area necessary for the US economy – which means US industry , agriculture , corporate structure – to enable it to flourish and have the resources it needs and the markets it wants and so on .
And the Grand Area was defined as the entire Western Hemisphere , the Far East and the former British Empire which the US would take over .
That is the minimum and from then on to the whole .
Well by about 1943 it was reasonably clear that Germany was unlikely to survive so the Grand Area extended to include as much of Eurasia as possible and there were explicit and rational plans as to what to do with every area .
If you go into the early pos-war period – and now we have to go to de-classified secret documents - then secret now mostly de-classified , there is extensive planning .
I mean every part of the globe was assigned what was called its “ function ” .
The main “ function ” of South - East Asia , for example , was to provide resources and raw materials for Europe and Japan s that they could re-industrialize as a component of the US dominated system .
The US needed them to overcome what was called the “ dollar gap ” .
The US was producing much more than the rest of the world could import because most of the industrial world was devastated or destroyed .
So you had to overcome the “ dollar gap ” and that meant that , for example , England had to have access to the resources of Malaya so that it could gain dollars to buy US manufacturers .
Very intricate global planning of that nature .
Japan had to have restored to it what the planners called , it ’s “ Empire toward the South ” .
Basically the new order that it had been trying to create but not within US control .
Africa the US was n’t very much interest in so George Kennan who was the Head of the Policy Planning Staff recommended that it be handed over to Europe to “ exploit ” – that was his word – for Europe to exploit for its own reconstruction .
You can think of the different relations between Europe and Africa given the history but that never occurred to anyone .
As for the Middle East , the US took for granted that it would take it over because of what they called its “ stupendous source of strategic power ” and “ one of the great material prizes in world history ” .
Controlling that huge resource provided what was called “ veto - power ” over what their rivals might do – Europe , Japan and later Asia .
We can go on but its all spelled out in considerable detail and its acted on , I mean the plans are implemented so what more is there to say ?
And furthermore , its perfectly reasonable , it would be very surprising if you found anything else .
MK : Is the current “ war on terror ” a new shift in this imperial ambition ?
Before overt military attacks were not common , wars were fought through proxy forces .
Is this a new development ?
NC : First of all the “ war on terror ” was declared quite explicitly in 1981 by the same who are now in Washington or their immediate mentors .
That was during their Reaganite phase .
The Reagan – it ’s mostly the people currently in office – and announced right off that the focus of foreign policy would be fighting terror – state sponsored terrorism – “ plague of the modern age ” ; “ return to the age of barbarism ” and so on and so forth .
Same rhetoric as today and the “ war on terror ” was the cover for major terrorist wars that the US waged against Central America , in South East Asia , in Africa , in the Middle East and elsewhere with horrendous consequences .
No -one wants to talk about because you ’re not supposed to admit those things .
But the fact is that the “ war on terror ” was designated to be the focus of US foreign policy in the early 1980s .
MK : Was n’t it qualitatively different ?
NC : How was it different ?
MK : It did n’t have US ground troops .
NC : Actually they intended at first to use US forces in Central America but there was so much popular reaction that they turned to what is called “ clandestine war ” .
Clandestine means the war that everybody knows about except the American population – it ’s kept from them and it was fought with an international terrorist network , in which Britain contributed incidentally .
So it was Taiwan , Israel , Argentine neo -Nazi ’s until they were thrown out , Saudi Arabian funding , British assistance .
So that ’s a kind of an international terror network that was used to support the murderous state terrorist governments of Central America and in the case of the one government where they did n’t control the security forces , Nicuargua , they were used just to attack .
There was a terrorist war against Nicuargua for which the US was actually condemned by the World Court and the Security Council – the US vetoed the resolution , Britain loyally abstained .
It ’s not a big secret really and that ’s right through the 1980’s .
Meanwhile , in Southern Africa , the US and Britain were backing South Africa , the Reagan administration had to violate the congressional sanctions to keep supporting them .
They were supporting them not only in South Africa but also in their attacks on Angola and Mozambique which left a horrendous toll – maybe a 1,500,000 people killed and so on .
That went on right through the 1980s in the Middle East they supported Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon which killed about 20,000 people and tried to establish a client state did n’t quite work as the occupation remained .
The invasion could continue because the Reagan vetoed Security Council resolutions calling it off .
South East Asia Britain and US continued to support General Suharto – one of the major mass murderers of the modern period – Britain was particularly decisive in supporting his invasion of East Timor which was continuing , the US too .
They were supporting Saddam Hussein .
Britain and the US both supported him right through the worst atrocities – long after the war with Iran was over – that was n’t the reason .
So yes it was all over the world .
And much of this was under the framework of what was called a “ war on terror ” .
Later in the 1980s they started calling it a “ war against drugs ” .
1990s there were other pretexts .
After the 9/11 attacks in New York , they re-declared the “ war on terror ” .
But , in fact , its not a high priority for the US .
I mean its easy to show that .
Like , say , take the invasion of Iraq .
It was anticipated even by their own intelligence agencies that invading Iraq would increase the threat of terror which in fact it did but its just not a high priority .
I mean having a dependant client state in the heart of the world main energy resource is a far higher priority than preventing terror .
They did n’t care about terror .
MK : Do you think Empire bring any benefits to the colonized ?
Historians like Niall Ferguson have talked about the economic benefits …
NC : To England yes .
Actually even in the case of England it ’s a mixed story .
There have been some attempts over the years to try to do a kind of cost benefit analysis of the British Empire – how much did England gain ?
how much did it lose .
You ca n’t really do a careful calculation – its too complicated .
But the rough estimates are probably that it ’s basically in balance – that England gained approximately as much , took from the Empire as much as it cost to run the Empire .
Well let ’s suppose it ’s true .
It does n’t tell you very much .
You have to ask what happened inside England .
Who gained and who lost .
Well the stockholder of the East India Company they became fabulously wealthy .
How about sailors in the British navy ?
They did n’t gain .
So it was essentially a class war inside England with winners and losers .
And the same is true for the American system of domination .
American workers do n’t gain , but American multinationals gain enormously .
As for Ferguson ’s story , yeah it ’s true that most imperial systems lead to some benefits for the victims .
So for example , take East Europe under the Russians .
It developed , Bulgaria for example , developed under Russian domination from a poor Third world country to a low level industrializing country .
We do n’t give Stalin plaudits for that .
The fact that development is usually done for the benefit of the home country .
So , for example , in India there was considerable development of infrastructure under the British .
Almost all for export of raw materials and resources to England .
There was an Indian upper class which of course benefited but every imperial systems is mostly run by domestic clones .
Like under the Nazi ’s there were people in the Vichy government who benefited greatly .
We do n’t therefore praise the Nazi imperial system .
But for most of the people in India it was a disaster .
I mean when the British took over India , started taking it over in the 18th century – it took a while to conquer it all – when they started taking it over , India and China were the commercial and industrial centres of the world .
England was a backward country .
It was much more powerful in military force but not in other respects .
In fact , England had to impose high tariffs to protect English industry from superior Indian goods .
It forced on India a market system which enabled Indian production to be overwhelmed by British goods and stole Indian technology – we now call it illegal , then it was illegal .
Just as England did from Ireland .
And over time England became the richest country – highest per capita country in the world – and India became an impoverished peasant society .
Right through the hideous famines of the Victorian era India was being compelled to export food to England instead of for itself .
But if you look there are more railroads , there ’s a lot of rich people .
Find any system of domination in which that is n’t true .
It was true of Russian controlled areas , its true of Nazi controlled areas .
MK : So how do explain the fact that since decolonization , most of Africa has become considerably less economically well off ?
NC : First of all they were devastated by colonialism .
What was left afterwards was a nationalist elite very closely tied to the imperial powers .
So Britain left , say Nigeria , ensuring it was in the hands of people who would continue the relations to England they wanted .
The French were driven out of Algeria but they retained close connections with the Algerian ruling groups .
In fact in the 1990s French intelligence was probably implicated in many of the worst state massacres that were going on .
And French West - Africa remained quasi - colonial in many respects .
So a large part of the imperial system sort of remained and then it was overcome by other mechanism .
So the South African , Latin America are the two regions of the world that have most rigorously followed the programs of the IMF and the so - called neo-liberal program .
And they are the areas that most suffered .
The countries that have developed like East Asia have largely ignored these principles .
There is a very close correlation and the correlation goes way back in history .
I mean the Third World – what is now called the Third World – is the region that was unable to make its own choices about how to develop and so it became the Third World – black sovereignty .
There is one part of the South that developed , namely Japan , and it ’s the one part that was n’t colonized .
Is that an accident ?
It ’s not an accident .
Southern Africa , Latin America too did pretty rigorously follow the rules .
The elites benefited enormously – you can go to central Africa and find sectors of great wealth and privilege but as usual the population suffered .
And if there was any trouble the European powers that are usually the traditional colonial masters would step in and put it back in order for their benefit .
I mean I ’m not saying there are no internal reasons for the stagnation and decline , there are , but the outside forces played their usual role .
MK : Okay if we accept that Empire or some sort of domination of a smaller power is wrong .
Do you think that most of the American population agree with us ?
I have spoken to quite a few Americans who say “ Maybe keeping pro-business elites in Latin America was immoral but would I be as affluent as an American citizen if we had n’t done it ? ”
NC : Who did you ask ?
Did you ask working people ?
MK : No I suppose not .
NC : You asked Harvard professors .
MK : Well no .
NC : The equivalent then .
The fact of the matter is you can easily find out what public attitudes are .
They ’re very well studied in the US .
For example , right before the last election there were extensive studies of popular opinion released on all sorts of issues .
A large majority , very large , is opposed to the doctrine of both political parties and Tony Blair , that is the doctrine that the US has the right to use force to attack potential challenges – somebody who might harm us in the future – large majority of the population against this force should only be permitted when your under attack or your under imminent attack .
In fact , the majority of the US population even thinks we ought to give up the UN veto and follow the UN lead .
Now if you ask about particular cases – keeping business elites in power in Latin America – that ’s not what working people are going to tell you is a good idea .
I ’m sure your not going to get that answer .
What they are going to say is that it was right to do it because we were defending ourselves against communist attack .
That ’s the mythology that ’s driven into peoples head .
And , yeah , they will say we had to defend ourselves against the Chinese or the Russians .
MK : Were n’t they were told alongside that they would n’t be as economically well off if they were n’t keeping these business elites in place ?
NC : They were n’t told that .
In fact , nobody ever says that because that would be self interest .
You have to pretend that we do n’t do things for self - interest .
We do them altruistically .
So the standard line in British , American , French and other propaganda is that everything we do is altruistic .
And that ’s not what people are told and that ’s not the kind of answer you are going to get .
Maybe a few cynics will say it but almost everyone will give you the conventional – “ we ’re altruistic , we ’re working for the good of others , they do n’t appreciate it , we do n’t understand why they hate us , we ’ve done so much for them ” and so on and so forth .
Very few people are going to say “ they hate us because we rob them ” .
Almost nobody will say that .
So I do n’t think you get the answers you say .
I think you get the answers that are conventional in the propaganda system .
And it ’s not just the Britain , the US , France and others .
Its every system of domination .
Just try someday reading Hitler ’s propaganda or the propaganda of the Japanese fascists .
I mean it ’s just overcome with love for the people of the world , what kind of wonderful things we were going to do for them .
Japan was going to create an earthly paradise in Asia where everyone would work together in peace and Japan has the technology so it would serve them and help them .
The only problem was trying to protect the population from the Chinese bandits , the Chinese who they were conquering .
It ’s just full of , you know , tears come to your eyes its just so beautiful .
And that ’s the standard line of every imperial power plus the line that says look how much good we did for you .
I mean we built railroads so we could export products – the parts not mentioned .
But to say we did that out of self interest is very rare .
MK : You ’ve said previously that all propaganda has some element of truth .
NC : Well some element of truth .
Like , for example , it ’s true that Russia developed Eastern Europe .
Some element of truth .
MK : Well what about the propaganda now .
Can you ever export democracy to another country ?
NC : Well you might if you tried .
But who wants to bring democracy to any other place ?
That ’s just sheer propaganda .
Take a look at the record .
In fact , take a look at the fronts pages of the New York Times .
It ’s so blatant they ca n’t even see what they ’re saying .
So when Arafat died take a look at the main front pages of the New York Times or any newspaper – they ’re all the same .
“ Now we have a hope for a post - Arafat era in which we can have peace and democracy under Arafat we could n’t do it ” .
Well okay the Times starts like this , “ there ’s now a chance to implement the , quintessential American faith , that elections legitimate even the frailest institutions . ”
Read down the article to the last paragraph and it says , “ the US was unwilling to allow elections in Palestine because it knew that Arafat was going to win and that would give him more of a mandate and others might gain credibility too . ”
So what ’s the quintessential American faith ?
Well the quintessential America faith is that elections and democracy are fine so long as they come out the right way and that ’s also the quintessential British and the quintessential French , in fact everybody ’s quintessential faith but bringing democracy ?
That ’s the last thing that the US and Britain would dream of .
Did Britain and the US overthrow the parliamentary government of Iran in order to bring a democracy ?
Did the US , a year later , overthrow the first democratic government in Guatemala to bring it democracy ?
We can go on and on …
MK : What about Germany and Japan after the Second World War ?
Are n’t they examples of the opposite ?
NC : Germany and Japan after the Second World War were under US control in the very early stages when the countries were under the military – McCarther in Japan and Clay in Germany .
They did allow democratic forces to function but the civilians in Washington , the liberals quickly stepped in and reversed it .
Japan was given the name “ reverse course ” .
They wanted to ensure in both Germany and Japan that pretty much the traditional order would remain and that after the war as is usual after wars there were very radical sentiments among the resistance , the workforce and others and they wanted to have a kind of radical democracy .
Britain and the US were not going to allow that so they moved in and allowed a certain kind of democracy as long as it ensures that the right forces are in control – including much of the traditional order – closely linked to the Western power .
In Germany , for example , George Kennan who was one of the top planners insisted that it would be necessary , in his words to “ wall off Western Germany from Eastern influences to prevent a too powerful labor movement from developing ” – interesting choice of terms .
In Italy , where there was a really powerful anti-Nazi resistance ( much more so than in France ) , and in fact had liberated most of northern Italy before the British and the Americans came in .
First thing they did , Britain and the US , was to crush the self managed workplaces , to restore the traditional managers and , in fact to restore pretty much the traditional system .
The US , in fact , intervened radically in the 1948 elections because they were afraid the wrong side would win and Italy was really hit hard by the war so they withheld food , they reinstated the fascist police .
They warned Italy that if the elections came out the wrong way they ’d simply starve them to death .
The National Security Council , the top planning body , was founded in 1948 and its first memorandum discusses what to do if the election comes out the wrong way in Italy as they expected .
And they said if it does we will call a national emergency , we will mobilized the sixth fleet in the Mediterranean and we will support paramilitary activities in Italy to overturn the government .
Other measures like starvation and threats succeeded in getting it to come out the right way .
Much of the traditional was re-established , the labor movement was contained and then it goes on to becoming the kind of democracy that Britain and the US would tolerate .
So yes , as long as democracy comes out the right way .
Actually the same is true internally as well : if it comes out the right way , fine , if not , we do something to change .
The “ quintessential faith ” is clear in the documents and absolutely clear in the actions .
The same is true today in Iraq .
In Britain and the US there is just rapture about President Bush ’s “ messianic vision to bring democracy to Iraq ” .
Ask people in Baghdad .
Well actually at the same time as the messianic vision was announced with great awe in the Britain and the US the US ran a poll in Baghdad asking people why they thought the US invaded .
Some agreed with Western ( British and American ) opinion .
1 % – 1 % said the goal was to bring democracy while the rest said the obvious .
To take Iraq resources , use it to control the Middle East and US interests .
Now they talk about having a democratic election .
Think for a minute what a sovereign , democratic Iraq would do .
It would have a Shi’ite majority .
First thing it would probably do is mend relations with Shi’ite Iran which they were doing already and they would probably move in that direction .
They would try to regain their position as a dominant force in the Arab which would mean re-arming and maybe even developing Weapons of Mass Destruction to confront the main regional enemy , namely Israel .
They might inspire inspire independence movements in Shi’ite areas of Saudi Arabia which happen to be where most of the oil is which may conceivably lead to a kind of Shi’ite dominated alliance – Iran , Iraq , Saudi Arabia – that would control most of the worlds oil .
Are the US and England going to allow any of this to happen ?
Of course not .
I mean as soon as democracy will get out of control if they allow it at all they move in by force like they have done everywhere else .
So yes there is a quintessential faith that democracy fine if it comes out the right way .
You have to be blind not to see that .
It is the consistent lesson of history .
Its perfectly reasonable ; it would be surprising if anything else were true .
Furthermore they often say it .
Like the leading academic expert on democratization of Latin America , Thomas Carruthers , who writes all the main books and articles and happens to be interesting because he was inside the Reagan administration , what they called the “ democracy enhancement programmes ” of the State Department he was involved in them .
And he takes it very seriously : he says it was very noble and sincere .
Then he goes on to describe what happens and he ends up telling the truth .
He says the US supports democracy as long as the result is what he calls a “ top - down form democracy ” with traditional power centres retaining power , namely the ones that were closely related to the US .
In that case the US will be happy to call it democracy and England was the same , France was the same , even Russia was the same .
Stalin called those countries “ people ’s democracies ” .
MK : How do see a movement against the imperial actions of America developing .
There was massive mobilization against the war in Iraq but since …
NC : Well that was actually historic .
I mean that ’s the first time in hundreds of years of the history of Europe – the first time I can think of – when there was actually mass protest against a war before it was actually launched .
That reflects a very significant change of public opinion in the US as well .
It is much harder for the US , Britain and others to carry off the traditional kind of aggression and violence that they are used to because there is just to much domestic resistance and it is necessary to find other ways to control the domestic population .
That ’s why they frighten them with Saddam Hussein is going to get you or he ’s tied up with 9/11 or whatever .
You have to somehow frighten to get to support things that they are opposed to .
Actually Us opinion is quite interesting about this .
SO about now about ¾ of the population say it was wrong to invade Iraq if it did not have WMDs and did not have ties to Al ’ Qaida and \ 9.11 – that ’s 75 % of the population .
About 50 % of the population say it was right to invade : its not a contradiction .
50 % of the country believe that Iraq had WMD ’s or programmes developing and had ties to Al ’ Qaida and was involved in 9/11 .
And that ’s the effect of efficient state - media propaganda .
If you frighten people with terrorist stories they will huddle under the umbrella of power even it is opposed to their own convictions because they are afraid .
When speaking to Michael Mann a few weeks ago I asked him if he believed that US really cared about popular opposition to its policies around the world .
He replied : “ It does n’t care a lot .
Well , in principle it cares but in practice over the last couple of years it has n’t cared , nor has that a major source of its weakness .
I mean there could have been a million or more people demonstrating in London , so what ?
I mean the demonstrators in other countries probably had some impact on their governments not getting involved in Iraq , but again , so what ?
There ’s only two parties that matter in this : one is the US and the other is the Iraqi’s .
Europe is irrelevant , there ’s nothing much that the Europeans could do . ”
Do you agree with that ?
NC : It ’s a point of view which says “ look we have the guns and you shut up ” .
That ’s a point of view , I mean , Hitler ’s point of view ; Stalin ’s point of view , understandable .
Stalin famously asked when he was told the Vatican disapproved of something , “ how many divisions has the Pope ? ”
Okay that ’s what Michael Mann is saying , “ how many divisions does Europe have ? ”
Exactly like Stalin .
It ’s a point of view , I mean , I do n’t accept those attitudes and I also do n’t think its accurate .
Even the most powerful state in the world , and the US is not that , it is the current world but it has plenty of constraints .
Even the most powerful force cannot ignore attitudes and opinions elsewhere .
That ’s why the US elites go berserk if Honduras withdraws fifty soldiers from Iraq .
They must maintain some sort of a façade of international support .
That ’s why Bush and Blair and so on pretend that they are leading a coalition .
Yeah it ’s a coalition of the US , its attack dog England and US mercenary forces which are largely of the British contingent and a couple of other people scattered around .
The attitude in the US and England to democracy was very clearly revealed in connection with the issue that Mann raises about public opinion in Europe .
I mean Europe divided pretty sharply into two groups of countries : those in which the governments took the same position as the overwhelming majority of the public and those in which the government overruled the vast majority of their population and took their orders from Crawford , Texas .
And you remember how they were described in elite circles : that ’s “ Old Europe ” and “ New Europe ” .
“ Old Europe ” are the bad guys , the ones where the governments took the same position as the majority of the population .
“ New Europe ” is the hope for the future , the hope for the new democracies , namely with the governments , like in Spain , where the government overrules 90 % of the population and follow orders from the boss .
That ’s the hope for democracy .
And it was shown very dramatically in the case of Turkey .
In the case of Turkey to everyone ’s surprise the government ended up taking the same position as 90 % of the population .
They were bitterly denounced .
Colin Powell immediately said they would be “ punished ” , “ we ’re going to withdraw aid ” .
They were denounced as “ lacking democratic credentials ” .
That was the phrase that was used .
Paul Wolfowitz who it supposed to be the idealist leading the crusade for democracy , he went so far as to condemn the Turkish military because they did not step in to force the government to follow US demands and he demanded that they apologize to the US and recognise , publicly , that their job is to help the US .
It tells you what their belief in democracy is .
In fact , this was so sharp it takes real discipline not to see it .
That was the criterion for “ Old Europe ” and “ New Europe ” : the “ bad guys ” and the “ good guys ” .
Democracy is fine if you do what we tell you otherwise your worthless .
MK : In what ways can public resistance affect a country as powerful as the US ?
NC : Enormously .
I mean the US is in a lot of trouble in Iraq no because they could not mobilized international support .
Also for other reasons : catastrophic errors in the way they ran the occupation .
Actually the Nazi’s had an easier time in occupied Europe .
That aside , the US is now appealing for international support , pleading for it practically .
Just the other day they got European countries to forgive Iraq ’s debt because the US would have to pay it .
It ’s not Iraq ’s debt : if the US is going to occupy it it ’s going to have to pay the debt so they do n’t want it so they induced or compelled the other countries to withdraw it .
They are trying every imaginable way to get some kind of support for the occupation .
If European countries and others wo n’t go along that restricts US actions and it also has another very important consequence : it affects US public opinion .
In the world there are people living on isolated islands .
Attitudes and opinions in Europe affect hose in the US of course .
And the greatest enemy of the state in the US or anywhere else is its own population .
That ’s what they ’re really afraid of .
In fact , the Founding Fathers called it the “ great beast ” which “ has to be controlled ” because the population can in fact compel the government to change policies .
And these interactions make an enormous difference .
MK : What about the arguments of some of those on the left – like Hitchens here or Hari in England – who say that the job of the left has been to fight fascism throughout the whole of the twentieth century .
NC : It still is .
MK : But they say the “ war on terror ” is a continuation of the same noble trend .
NC : No , of course not .
In fact , Hitchens – I do n’t know Hari – is smart enough to know that US policies are increasing the threat of terror .
I mean do n’t bother with Hitchens and Hari .
Take a look at people who are actually concerned with the threat of terror .
The specialists who write about .
Take , say , Jason Burke in England ( the best specialist on Al - Qaida ) or Michael Schoy or the anonymous bestseller in the US or in fact the intelligence agencies or Israeli intelligence agencies or anyone else .
They all say the same thing : if you want to deal with terrorism there has got to be two approaches .
One is the terrorists themselves – the ones who actually put the bombs in – those are criminal acts you deal with them as criminal acts – basically a police question – if its international its an international police operation .
Its successful .
I mean in Europe and South East Asia and elsewhere there have been real successes in breaking up criminal networks of terrorists – controlling their finances and so on .
But the much more important thing – they all say – is consider the potential reservoir of sympathy and support .
I mean the terrorists see themselves as a vanguard .
They do n’t think they are going to overthrow the West .
They are a vanguard who are trying to mobilize people to support them and join them and that population they are trying to appeal to may fear them , may even hate them , but they hope that it will recognize that there is some justice in their cause and they will be able to recruit among them .
And if you are serious about blocking terrorism what you ’ll do is pay attention to the legitimate grievances of the people they are trying o mobilize .
You do n’t help them mobilize the population by using violence in ways which they can then use to say “ okay see we were right , join us ” .
That ’s exactly the opposite of what Hitchens and Hari say .
I mean according to Hitchens if you try to be reasonable about it , like all the experts on terrorism , your rationalizing terror .
You are supposed to stand up and scream , “ it ’s fascism ” .
But you are not supposed to think and recognize that if your serious about dealing with terrorism you ’ll pay attention to legitimate grievances .
I mean England , it should be second nature .
Take Ireland .
As long as England reacted to IRA terror by violence it just increased the terror and it became pretty serious .
When England finally began to pay attention to the fact that there were some legitimate grievances behind and started to attend to those grievances it improved enormously .
Belfast is n’t utopia but it ’s a lot better than it was a few years ago and that ’s the standard lesson .
You can hear it from Burke , you can hear it from American specialists on terrorism , you can hear it from Israeli intelligence .
They all say the same thing .
The only people who do n’t say it are intellectuals who like to stand up and scream and stand and pretend that they are fighting fascism and therefore denounce anyone who takes the position of the terrorism experts as rationalizing terror .
But notice that Hitchens does n’t condemn Israeli intelligence , Jason Burke , the Wall Street Journal and so on and so forth .
What he condemns is his enemies on the left who say exactly the same thing .
It tells you something about him but it ’s not interesting .
Your latest political book is apocalyptically titled , “ Hegemony or Survival ? ”
Do you really believe the choice is that stark ?
If the US continues in its quest for global dominance do you think we threaten our survival ?
NC : Actually it ’s not particularly my opinion .
Probably the most respectable journal in the West is the Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences which last issue has an article by two leading strategic analysts who say that – they were studying the transformation of the military : the new build up of offensive military weapons that put the entire world at risk of instant annihilation , militarization of space and so on – and they discuss it and they talk about the reactions which are anticipated and are already taking place and they conclude that if this continues there is a fair likelihood of “ ultimate doom ” .
That ’s very respectable strategic analysts , the most respectable journal in the West .
Not given to hyperbole .
In fact they hope that a coalition of peace loving states will coalesce to counter US militarism and aggressiveness .
And they do n’t expect it to be led by England , they hope it will be led by China .
That ’s where we have come to .
They hope that China will organize a coalition of peace loving states to stop the militarism and aggressiveness headed by the US and its British ally .
Well it ’s interesting that they have such contempt for American democracy and British democracy : they do n’t even dream of it coming from within .
I do n’t agree with it – I do n’t think we have to wait for China to save us from all doom – I think we can do it ourselves .
TROY , N.Y . --
By studying the organizational culture of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) and the United States Coast Guard , as well as each organization 's response to last year 's Hurricane Katrina , a team of researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has begun to develop a dynamic model of organizational processes with the capacity to predict how an organization 's culture will affect its ability to respond to an extreme event .
In the wake of Katrina , a category 5 hurricane that devastated much of the nation 's Gulf Coast region in August 2005 , three Rensselaer students traveled to New Orleans to collect paperwork , e-mails , reviews , assessments , and other documents that could provide them with information about how each organization reacted to any given task during the disaster .
The recovered paper trail also provided the researchers with insight into a variety of cultural and organizational characteristics that impacted both agencies ' ability to act during the disaster .
Throughout the group 's research , a vast dichotomy between the cultures of FEMA and the Coast Guard became increasingly evident , according to William " Al " Wallace , professor of decision sciences and engineering systems ( DSES ) at Rensselaer , and principal investigator on the project .
The researchers believe these cultural factors ultimately dictated how well each organization was able to carry out its function and responsibilities .
" FEMA 's fatalist culture , coupled with the loss of its cabinet - level position and budget and rulemaking authority , crippled the agency 's ability to fulfill its normal repertoire of emergency coordination and response during Katrina , " says Wallace .
" On the other hand , the Coast Guard had undergone minimal organizational changes and had its pre-existing routines supported , thus it was better equipped to fulfill its duties during the disaster .
Additionally , because of the Coast Guard 's hierarchical culture , action orders continually disseminated through the organization 's chain of command to the response team . "
Today Wallace is leading a team of researchers to construct a computer simulation that models an extreme disaster situation - similar to that of Hurricane Katrina - where decision - makers are forced to shift their attention from one dimension to another , responses often play out over long durations of time , and information demands vary between interacting response organizations .
They 'll then input a series of " what if " scenarios related to organizational structure and culture into the disaster model .
Algorithms , or automated reasoning , will predict how each organization 's constraints would affect its ability to effectively react to an emergency .
The organizational factors observed by the researchers while studying FEMA and the Coast Guard will be used to test the model and to set the parameters .
" Essentially , the model will be able to determine how well an organization will respond to a disaster based on the rules it is following and its organizational structure , " says Wallace , who warns that the device is not a scenario generator .
" It wo n't tell you 'if you have a disaster and you do n't get enough ice to the victims in time , this will happen . '
Instead it will say ' if you institute these rules and a disaster happens , you will succeed or you will fail . ' "
Wallace sees the model as a diagnostic tool that could help local , state , and federal governments shed light on the vulnerability of certain organizational features .
It could also aid in the development of more flexible , responsive approaches to risk management , which is key to improving organizational responses to extreme events , according to the researchers .
" When a group of people are ingrained in an organization , it can be difficult to identify the day - to - day operations or procedures that could potentially become roadblocks when responding to certain situations , " Wallace says .
" This model will be a tool for organizations to study and reflect on the ways their culture affects their ability to function . "

Story Highlights • Doctor uses ADHD drug Adderall , an amphetamine , to treat childhood obesity
• He says about 90 percent of his patients on Adderall have lost weight .
• Critics say the off - label use , while legal , is questionable and too risky
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) --
When Alex Veith was 11 years old , he was in a bad spot .
He was 30 pounds overweight , and blood tests showed he was headed toward Type 2 diabetes .
His parents say Alex was already physically active and eating a healthy diet .
They did n't know what to do .
Their pediatrician did n't know either , so she referred Lisa and Hank Veith to Dr. Fuad Ziai , a pediatric endocrinologist in nearby Oak Lawn , Illinois .
In the summer before Alex entered sixth grade , Ziai prescribed Adderall , an amphetamine used to treat attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder , or ADHD .
Alex did n't have ADHD , but one of the drug 's common side effects is weight loss .
And that 's what happened to Alex .
" You should have seen everyone when I went back to school the next year .
They did n't believe it was me , " says Alex .
" It was a great feeling to be a thin kid . "
Ziai's approach to treating obesity -- he says he has prescribed Adderall for weight loss to about 800 children and teens -- raises an important ethical question :
Has the obesity epidemic among children become so severe that it 's OK to prescribe a drug not approved for weight loss when the drug can have serious , sometimes life - threatening side effects ?
( Interactive : What is Adderall ? )
The Veiths say they 'd give their son Adderall again .
Now 17 , Alex is a normal weight after being on the drug for more than four years -- from age 11 until about 18 months ago .
Lisa Veith says she was distressed about her son's weight .
She did n't want him to develop diabetes , and she did n't want him to be teased .
" I did n't want him to face what could come as kids turn into teenagers .
I know how brutal kids can be , " she says .
" I just did n't want my child to go through that . "
Alex says the Adderall cut his appetite in half .
Drugs for ADHD are in the amphetamine family and are well - known appetite suppressants .
" I did n't get the urge to eat as often , " Alex says .
" It seemed like I was always full . "
Ziai says about 90 percent of his patients on Adderall have lost weight .
He credits Adderall ( along with a prescription for Glucophage , a diabetes medication ) with helping Alex and many others avert diabetes .
The Food and Drug Administration has not approved ADHD drugs like Adderall for weight loss , but it 's legal , and common , for doctors to prescribe medications " off label . "
Several pediatricians contacted by CNN say they suspect other pediatricians are prescribing ADHD medications off label for weight loss .
" No one admits it , " says Dr. John Lantos , professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago .
" It 's morally and medically questionable , so I do n't think anyone 's proud of doing this . "
The Food and Drug Administration warns that some patients on ADHD drugs with pre-existing heart problems have suffered sudden death .
The agency also warns that some on Adderall develop psychiatric problems , such as hearing voices and becoming manic .
Pediatricians like Lantos say it 's wrong to prescribe Adderall for weight loss when risks are known and the benefits are questionable .
The drug has never been studied for weight loss , so they suggest that Ziai 's success stories may be anecdotal .
" Doctors who prescribe this could end up killing kids by giving them a medication that does n't work for the reason they 're prescribing , " Lantos says .
Ziai says he screens his patients for heart problems , and none of his patients on Adderall has had cardiovascular side effects .
He says about 2 percent of his patients on Adderall have had psychiatric side effects -- mood swings , irritability , crying for no reason -- but most patients are fine after he lowers the dose and then later raises it again .
Ziai says Adderall is the only option for many of his overweight kids .
" Prior to the administration of the medication , there was no solution available medically for these children , " he says .
" In my experience , this is a very rewarding and very effective approach . "
He adds that he knows other doctors are critical .
" I respect their opinions , but I 'm sure I 'd be very happy to have them review the cases that we 've had , " he says .
Lisa Veith counts her son as one of Ziai 's success stories .
" He told us it was given for ADHD , " she says .
" We felt comfortable with what he was doing .
We did n't give it a second guess . "

[ The following is from an undergrad , who wishes to remain anonymous .
Brad Holian sent it on to yours truly , - Pat . ] ----- I was happy to read about your stand against mandatory polygraph examination at LANL .
It resonated very personally with me .
I 'm a physics undergrad student at [ a prestigious California school ] , but this upcoming summer , I was considering interning at the CIA .
I applied in June on a whim , and got a conditional offer of employment in about August after a phone interview and a bunch of paperwork .
In October , they flew me up to Washington to do all their screening for clearance , most of which seemed to revolve around the lengthy polygraph examinations .
I was greatly opposed to needing to do that , as I 've long considered them to be pseudoscientific hoopla .
When it came time for me to have my examination , it began with a long discussion with the examiner .
He asked me what I knew about the polygraph , and I explained what I knew about it 's operation ... how in monitored breathing rate , skin conductance ...etc .
I then expressed my belief that there was little to no evidence for a strong correlation between their tests and truthfulness .
I also noted that it could n't be used in a court of law , and that I thought it was strange it was used in screening by the CIA .
He reassured me that he'd had a lot of training and all sorts of professional certifications , and that there was hard science backing the whole thing .
After he ran the test a couple times , he said that I was n't passing all of the questions .
He asked me which questions stood out in my mind .
I said , " have no clue ; one of the controls made me feel kind of funny . "
He immediately became suspicious , and pressed me as to where I 'd learned the term " control , " as if it were unequivocal proof I was a spy trained to crack his magic machine .
He pressed me as to whether I 'd researched the polygraph in preparation for the test .
I said I 'd certainly read about how it worked in the past , and reiterated my skepticism in its methods .
He warned that he does n't even bother to waste his time with people who refuse to be cooperative .
At this point , I 'd become very frustrated .
He tested me once more , and then interrogated me for about an hour .
There was nothing more I felt I needed to reveal to him .
I told him that it was all just a psychological tactic , and they might as well use " good cop , bad cop " as they were both conceived for the same thing .
He soon afterwards said we were finished .
As a result , they asked me to retake the polygraph a second time .
At this point , I 'd already been interrogated for four hours , and was barely willing to go along with it .
I had come to find the technique insulting .
The second examiner , whom had obviously been informed of my performance the previous day , noted my background in physics , said stuff to the effect of I 'm sure your a pretty sharp guy and all that sort of banter .
He gave me a pep talk on why I should have trust in their technique , how it had been perfected for decades , and mentioned they were doing me a favor by giving me a second chance .
The second time went no better , and I left exhausted and dreadfully unhappy .
A couple weeks ago I got a letter from them informing me that my offer of employment had been rescinded , I would assume because of how I acted at the polygraph .
I was n't terribly unhappy , as I 'd already decided I 'd rather do physics this summer than work for them , and I 'd already begun looking for other summer programs .
I can understand how irritating it must be to be forced to do this to do science .
Thanks and I wish you luck .

AMS - IX First Internet Exchange Worldwide To Break 100 Gbps Barrier
Amsterdam Internet Exchange experiences massive growth in its peering exchange
This news item is older than six months .
Information presented here may no longer reflect current Giganews services or offers .
Today , the Amsterdam Internet Exchange ( AMS - IX ) index set a world record for data transfer speeds over an Internet exchange by achieving throughput of 100 Gigabits per second .
With over 220 international parties connected , this new mark reflects the Dutch peering exchange 's ongoing position as one of the world 's largest independent Exchange Points for Internet traffic .
AMS - IX , a non-profit exchange , has enabled this massive growth partly through the launch of its 10 GE ( Gigabit Ethernet per second ) peering service , which went live in October last year .
The 10GE peering service enables the exchange members ' to handle more Internet traffic while facilitating a potentially faster connection between end -users .
" We expect 30 members to have joined the 10GE peering service before the end of the year , " said Job Witteman , Chief Executive Officer of AMS - IX .
" With these results , AMS - IX holds a unique position in the European market of peering exchanges . "
Large Internet capacity is needed because of the growing variety of high bandwidth Internet applications .
" Rich - media content requires the best possible connections and throughput for delivery to broadband end - users , be it video , music , games or downloads , " said Gary Baldus , VP of Operations at Limelight Networks , one of AMS - IX 's international members .
" We leverage our 10 GE partnership with AMS - IX for high - bandwidth delivery on behalf of some of the world 's top media companies . "
Parties connected to the AMS - IX platform include Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) and carriers as well as content providers , hosting providers , VoIP operators and mobile telecom operators , such as Giganews and XS4ALL .
" This continuous growth demonstrates the crucial role that AMS - IX plays in the health of the Internet , both in the Netherlands and internationally , " said Simon Hania , CTO at XS4ALL .
" Next to its sound technical operation , XS4ALL also welcomes the AMS - IX governance structure as an example of industry self - organisation focussing on the continuity of vital infrastructures . "
Giganews Newsgroups is the largest USENET Newsgroups provider worldwide and one of the more recent AMS - IX members .
" When we joined last year we were amazed at the number of peering partners and volume we could transfer through peering at AMS - IX .
We hit the limits of our first 1 GE connection quite soon after joining , consequently we signed up for the 10GE peering service early and volume has been growing at an incredible rate ever since .
Premium newsgroup services are very popular in Europe and with our recent upgrade to 800 + days text retention and ~ 60 days binary retention Giganews is expecting a huge increase in traffic .
We 're counting on our AMS - IX connectivity to help us serve the growing Usenet Newsgroup needs of our customers . " says Jonah Yokubaitis CEO of Giganews .
About AMS -IX
AMS - IX ( Amsterdam Internet Exchange ) is a neutral and independent not - for - profit Internet exchange providing services since the early 1990's .

Republican Congressional Report on Iran Riddled With Errors
Here is what the professionals are saying about the Republican - dominated Subcommittee on Intelligence Policy report on Iran that slams US intelligence professionals for poor intelligence on Iran :
The report demonstrates that these Republicans have poor intelligence . . . on Iran .
What follows is summaries of things I ’ve seen from other experts but I can’t identify them without permission .
This is the PDF file of the report .
First of all , former CIA professional Larry Johnson and Jim Marcinkowski point out that the Republicans have a lot of damn gall .
It was high members of this Republican administration who leaked to the Iranians and the whole world the name of Valerie Plame , an undercover CIA operative who spent her professional career combatting the proliferation of WMD and was , at the time she was betrayed by Traitor Rove and his merry band , working on Iran .
Had it not been for these Republican figures , none of whom has yet been punished in any way for endangering US national security , we might know more about Iran .
It is being said that the staffer who headed the report is Frederick Fleitz , who was a special assistant to John Bolton when Bolton was undersecretary of state for proliferation issues .
Fleitz was sent to the unemployment line when Condi wisely exiled Bolton to the United Nations , where there is a long history of ill - tempered despots who like to bang their shoes on the podium .
So this report is the long arm of Bolton popping up in Congress .
It is Neoconservative propaganda .
I repeat what I have said before , which is that John Bolton is just an ill - tempered lawyer who has no special expertise in nuclear issues or in Iran , and aside from an ability to scare the bejesus out of young gophers who bring him coffee and to thunderously denounce on cue any world leader on whom he is sicced , he has no particular qualifications for his job .
Nor do the Republican congressmen know anything special about Iran ’s nuclear energy program .
They certainly know much less than the CIA agents who work on it full time , some of whom know Persian and have actually done , like , you know . . . intelligence work .
We are beset by instant experts on contemporary Iran , like the medievalist Bernard Lewis , who wrongly predicted that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would attack Israel on August 22 , based on Lewis ’s weird interpretation of his alleged millenarian beliefs .
Once the Neoconservatives went so far as actually to make fun of reality in the hearing of a reporter , their game was up .
Pete Hoekstra , who is the chair of this committee , has a long history of saying things that are , well , disconnected to reality .
Like when he made a big deal about some old shells with mustard gas found in Iraq left over from the 1980s Iran - Iraq War , and claimed that these were the fabled and long - sought Iraqi WMD over which 2600 of our service people are six feet under and another 8000 in wheelchairs .
Nope .
Bolton at one point was exercised about an imaginary Cuban biological weapons program , which even his own staffers would n’t support him on , and I at one point he was alleging that Iranian mullahs were sneaking into Havana to help with it .
This congressional report is full of the same sort of wild fantasies .
On page 9 , the report alleges that “ Iran is currently enriching uranium to weapons grade using a 164 - machine centrifuge cascade at this facility in Natanz . ”
This is an outright lie .
Enriching to weapons grade would require at least 80 % enrichment .
Iran claims . . . 2.5 per cent .
See how that is n’t the same thing ?
See how you ca n’t blow up anything with 2.5 percent ?
The claim is not only flat wrong , but it is misleading in another way .
You need 16,000 centrifuges , hooked up so that they cascade , to make enough enriched uranium for a bomb in any realistic time fame , even if you know how to get the 80 percent !
Iran has . . . 164 . See how that is n’t the same ?
The report cites the International Atomic Energy Agency only when it is critical of Iran .
It does not tell us what the IAEA actually has found .
By the way , here is what IAEA head Mohamed Elbaradei said in early March , 2003 , about Iraq :
‘ After three months of intrusive inspections , we have to date found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons programme in Iraq . ‘
At the same time , Republicans like Donald Rumsfeld were saying he knew exactly where Iraq ’s WMD was !
Elbaradei was right then , and Fleitz was wrong .
Ca n’t get fooled again .
And here is what the IAEA said about Iran just last January :
” Iran has continued to facilitate access under its Safeguards Agreement as requested by the Agency , and to act as if the Additional Protocol is in force , including by providing in a timely manner the requisite declarations and access to locations . ”
Last April Elbaradei complained about the hype around Iran ’s nuclear research , and said that there is no imminent threat from Iran .
The only thing that the IAEA knows for sure is that Iran has a peaceful nuclear energy research program .
Such a program is not the same as a weapons program , and it is perfectly legal under the Nonproliferation Treaty , which Iran , unlike Israel , has actually signed .
The report allegedly vastly exaggerates the range of Iran ’s missiles and also exaggerates the number of its longer - range ones , and seems to think that Iran already has the Shahab - 4 , which it does not .
It also does n’t seem to realize that Iran ca n’t send missiles on other countries without receiving them back .
Israel has more and longer - range missiles than Iran , and can quickly equip them with real nuclear warheads , not the imaginary variety in Fleitz ’s fevered brain .
Folks , we are being set up again .
Part of the Compact Muon Solenoid particle detector is lowered into place several hundred feet below ground .
COURTESY CERN
The European Organization for Nuclear Research , known as CERN , has its offices on the outskirts of Geneva , in an area once devoted to dairy farms and now given over to sprawl .
The offices occupy several dozen buildings , some of them in Switzerland and the remainder , a few hundred yards away , in France .
The buildings are reachable by roads with names like Route Bohr , Route Schrödinger , and Route Curie .
By the entrance to the complex , there is a museum — nearly empty the day I visited — that attempts to make particle physics comprehensible to the general public .
Behind that there is a park where bits of old cyclotrons are displayed , like playground equipment from Mars .
If you think of the sciences as a tower , with one field resting on another until you reach , say , botany or physiology , then particle physics represents the bottommost floor .
The first key experiment was conducted in 1909 , under the direction of Ernest Rutherford .
When Rutherford shot alpha particles at a wafer - thin sheet of gold foil , a small proportion of the particles bounced right back , a phenomenon that he described as “ almost as incredible as if you fired a fifteen - inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back to hit you . ”
Rutherford ’s work led to the realization that most of an atom ’s mass was concentrated in a tiny area , the nucleus .
“ All science is either physics or stamp - collecting , ” he is supposed to have said .
Since Rutherford ’s discovery , particle physics has provided one extraordinary — if increasingly implausible - sounding — revelation after another : first protons and neutrons , then antimatter , gluons , neutrinos , and quarks .
In 1967 , the existence of particles to mediate the weak force , which is responsible for radioactive decay , was theorized ; in 1983 , at CERN , these particles — the W and the Z— were observed and their properties measured .
In 1977 , the existence of what became known as the “ top ” quark was predicted ; in 1995 , at Fermilab , in Illinois , it , too , was found .
And yet , for all its triumphs , the field has been haunted by failure .
The more physicists have learned about the way matter behaves at its most fundamental level , the more acutely they have become aware that something — a big something — is missing from their accounts .
Among the many possibilities proposed for what ’s often called “ new physics ” is that the universe actually consists of tiny strands ( or strings ) of energy ; that it contains several dimensions beyond those that we perceive ; that it is full of mysterious particles — “ sparticles ” — that have yet to be detected ; that it is not a universe at all but a multiverse ; and that it began not with a bang but with a splat .
Sometime in the next few months , physicists at CERN will finish preparations for the most ambitious particle - physics experiment ever , which will be conducted in an apparatus modestly referred to as the Large Hadron Collider , or L.H.C .
The L.H.C. fills a circular tunnel seventeen miles in circumference .
To get from one side of it to the other , it is necessary to drive through several towns , and then descend three hundred feet in an elevator .
Alternatively , it is possible to ride through the tunnel in one of the dozens of bicycles CERN provides for its staff , but in that case a supply of emergency oxygen is required .
The L.H.C. is considered the best — some would say the only — hope for testing the theories of “ new physics ” against material reality .
Once the collider begins operating at full power — in early 2008 , if all goes well — nearly half the particle physicists in the world will be involved in analyzing its four - million - megabyte - per - hour stream of data .
Few events in the history of science have had a bigger buildup .
It ’s been suggested that the L.H.C. will unlock the secrets of the universe or , barring that , prove this ambition to be hopeless .
The L.H.C. is a kind of Babel built underground .
Dozens of countries have manufactured its components , and dozens more have lent manpower and expertise .
( Some contracts went to Russian physicists who previously worked for the Soviet military ; in this way , the collider has provided a livelihood for scientists whose employment options might otherwise include selling nuclear secrets . )
When I ate in CERN ’s lunchroom , I heard people speaking English , French , German , and Italian , as well as several languages that I could n’t identify .
The place was so crowded that it took me five minutes to pay for a cup of coffee , proving the elemental truth that man can build a superconducting collider but not a functional cafeteria .
CERN ’s chief scientific officer , Jos Engelen , is from the Netherlands .
He serves under the director general , who is from France , and alongside the chief financial officer , who is from Germany .
I went to speak to Engelen in his office ; behind his desk a chart indicated when the various parts of the collider are supposed to be completed .
It was a crazy quilt of multicolored blocks , with lines radiating in all directions .
Engelen greeted me with a half - ironic cheerfulness that struck me as very Dutch .
Among his responsibilities is dealing with the frequent calls and letters CERN receives about the possibility that the Large Hadron Collider will destroy the world .
When I asked about this , Engelen picked up a Bic pen and placed it in front of me .
“ In quantum mechanics , there is a probability that this pen will fall through the table , ” he said .
“ All of a sudden , it will be on the floor .
Because it can behave as a wave , it can go through ; we call that the ‘ tunnel effect . ’
If you calculate the probability that this happens , it is not identical to zero .
It is a very small probability .
But it never happens .
I ’ve never seen it happen .
You have never seen it happen .
But to the general public you make a casual remark , ‘ It is not identical to zero , it is very small , ’ and . . . ” He shrugged .
Worries about the end of the planet have shadowed nearly every high - energy experiment .
Such concerns were given a boost by Scientific American — presumably inadvertently — in 1999 .
That summer , the magazine ran a letter to the editor about Brookhaven ’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider , then nearing completion .
The letter suggested that the Brookhaven collider might produce a “ mini black hole ” that would be drawn toward the center of the earth , thus “ devouring the entire planet within minutes . ”
Frank Wilczek , a physicist who would later win a Nobel Prize , wrote a response for the magazine .
Wilczek dismissed the idea of mini black holes devouring the earth , but went on to raise a new possibility : the collider could produce strangelets , a form of matter that some think might exist at the center of neutron stars .
In that case , he observed , “ one might be concerned about an ‘ ice - 9 ’ - type transition , ” wherein all surrounding matter could be converted into strangelets and the world as we know it would vanish .
Wilczek labelled his own suggestion “ not plausible , ” but the damage had been done .
“ BIG BANG MACHINE COULD DESTROY EARTH ” ran the headline in the London Times .
Brookhaven was forced to appoint a committee to look into this and other disaster scenarios .
( The committee concluded that “ we are safe from a strangelet initiated catastrophe . ” )
5 ways to destroy your credit
Snapping up department store credit cards or skipping out on that parking ticket could send your credit score tumbling .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Taking a wrecking ball to your credit rating is probably best likened to striking a match and burning all of the cash in your wallet .
The concept is simple : a bad credit rating means higher interest rates and ultimately less savings for you .
Poor credit can cost you As shown below , a lower credit score could leave you with a higher mortgage rate .
FICO Score 30 - year fixed mortgage rate 720- 850 6.78 % 700-719 6.91 % 675-699 7.44 % 620-674 8.59 % 560-619 8.53 % 500-559 9.29 % Source : �MYFICO.COM AS OF 7/10/06
Your credit score , or your FICO score , ranges from the worst possible score of a 300 to a perfect 850 , and is determined by such factors as paying your bills on - time , the amount of money you owe as well as the length of your credit history , according to the company Fair Isaac , which runs the scoring system .
But even if you are one of those individuals who is diligent about maintaining your good credit standing , it is still possible that with a few simple missteps you could send your credit score into a tailspin faster than you can say delinquency .
So while closing out those credit card accounts you do n't use or rolling over all your outstanding debt to one card may seem like sensible moves , you might actually be killing your credit rating .
Late payments
The easiest way to lower your credit score is through delinquent payments or by skipping out on a bill altogether .
Since your payment history makes up 35 percent of your credit score , failing to make the minimum payment within 30 days of the due date could send your score plummeting , says Craig Watts , a spokesperson for Fair Isaac .
Say for example you 've never missed a payment and have a credit score in the high 700s or low 800s .
If you were to miss the 30 - day grace period , your score could drop by 100 points or more .
" That first delinquency puts you in a different class of consumers , " says Watts .
" You can make up that 100 points but it will take a lot longer than it took for that score to fall . "
High card balances , low FICO score
Maxing out your credit cards or pushing your account to its limit is another surefire way to bring down that FICO score , says Watts .
Experts say that consumers should aim to keep the balance on their credit card accounts no higher than 35 percent of their credit line .
That means if you have $ 1000 credit limit on your card , try to keep the balance no higher than $ 350 .
" The lower your debt compared to your credit limit , statistics show you are a better credit risk and that you have more self - control , " says Watts .
That also means you might want to reconsider consolidating all of your credit card debt onto one account , especially if that means the new balance is close to your credit limit .
Closing credit cards
Ok , ok , we know what you 're thinking : ' I 've got an unhealthy number of credit cards in my wallet , I think I 'll start closing those out to help my credit score . '
Not so fast , warns Steven Katz , a spokesperson for TransUnion , one of the country 's three major credit reporting agencies .
Since part of your score is based on the length of time certain lines of credit have been open , closing out that 10 - year old credit card could take a bite out of your credit score .
" It 's negative because it 's taking away a reference to a positive credit history , " says Katz .
And if you are trying to trim down your debt by hopping from one low - interest rate offer to the next , closing cards along the way , Katz warns that kind of behavior could send a message to future potential lenders that you might be a credit risk .
Too many in - store cards
It 's always a temptation at the checkout line , but signing up for a Home Depot , Macy 's or any in - store credit card just to get a 10 percent or 15 percent discount may work against your FICO score .
Even if you vow to promptly pay them off , opening up several of these accounts in succession could spell trouble for your score because opening multiple lines of credit in short period of time is considered abnormal behavior by credit agencies , according to Fair Isaac , and it suggests that you might be more of a credit risk .
Fines that add up
A $ 30 library fine or a $ 75 parking ticket .
Who cares , right ?
Well , that could be changing , says Watts .
More often nowadays , municipal governments are turning outstanding fines over to collection agencies , who have the ability to trash your credit rating if you do n't pay up .
Watts says that if a collection agency reports you were not able to pay that overdue library fees or parking ticket , that could drop your credit rating by 100 points or more .
" That will hammer your score , " says Watts .
" Make good on that bill because you do n't know who is or who is not reporting to collection agencies . "
And while you may think you can't be bothered with those petty fines now , just imagine how much more they 'll end up costing you if the collection agency mangles your credit score and you end up with a higher interest rate on that 30 - year mortgage .

But Danah Boyd , a researcher at the University of California and internet sociologist , said populations of different networks were now divided on a rough class basis .
Her evidence , collected through a series of interviews with US teenagers using MySpace and Facebook over the past nine months , showed there was a clear gap between the populations of each site .
" MySpace was the cool thing for high school teens and Facebook was the cool thing for college students , " she wrote in a paper available online .
" The picture is now being blurred ... it seems to primarily have to do with socio- economic class . "
Typical Facebook users , she said , " tend to come from families who emphasise education and going to college .
They are primarily white , but not exclusively . "
MySpace , on the other hand , " is still home for Latino and Hispanic teens , immigrant teens " as well as " other kids who did n't play into the dominant high school popularity paradigm " .
MySpace , which was founded in 2003 and bought by Rupert Murdoch two years later for $ 580 m ( £ 290 ) , has enjoyed huge success , particularly among young music fans , and recently became the most visited site on the web .
But in recent months Facebook , created by the college student Mark Zuckerberg , has started gaining ground on its major rival .
Figures released last month suggested it had more than 3.5 million users in Britain alone .
A number of high - profile individuals , including Prince William , have joined the service , and established companies have approached Mr Zuckerberg about buying Facebook .
The dotcom pioneer Yahoo ! is reputed to have offered $ 1.6 bn for the company last year .
The class difference between the two websites could lie in their origins .
Mr Zuckerberg started his service while studying at Harvard and until late last year membership was limited to university students and individuals with an email address from an academic institution .
This , said Ms Boyd , had given the site higher value among aspirational teens .
In the paper she also conjectured that a recent decision by the US military to ban service personnel from using sites including MySpace showed evidence of social fissures in the forces .
" A month ago , the military banned MySpace but not Facebook .
This was a very interesting move because there 's a division , even in the military .
Soldiers are on MySpace ; officers are on Facebook . "
According to Ms Boyd , Facebook is not used by young soldiers , who are generally less well - educated and from poorer backgrounds , and there is an element of social conflict in the ban .
" The military ban appears to replicate the class divisions that exist throughout the military .
I can't help but wonder if the reason for this goes beyond the purported concerns that those in the military are leaking information or spending too much time online or soaking up too much bandwidth with their MySpace usage . "

Confit is one of the oldest ways to preserve food , and is a speciality of south - western France .
The word comes via the French verb confire , from the Latin word ( conficere ) , meaning " to do , to produce , to make , to prepare " The French verb was first applied in medieval times to fruits cooked and preserved in sugar syrup or honey .
Later it has applied to all kinds of food that has been immersed in a substance that both flavours and preserves it .
Sealed and stored in a cool place it can be stored for several months , and can be reheated to extend its useful life .
( wikipedia )
Meat confit is made by cooking a piece of meat in its own fat .
The meat is then preserved by the surrounding fat .
Fruit confit is made by infusing whole small fruits ( e.g. cherries ) or pieces of larger fruits ( e.g. melon ) with sugar .

For a couple of thousand years , smokers have sought a quick concentration boost by firing up a cigarette .
It turns out that cognitive buzz is n't just in smokers ' heads .
Scientists have found that nicotine really does boost certain transmitters in the brain that can help people think better .
Now , the pharmaceutical industry hopes to improve on the effect , minus the lung cancer .
Earlier this summer , biopharmaceutical company Targacept reported that a compound called ispronicline acted like nicotine to increase memory and concentration in elderly test subjects .
Targacept next plans to test the drug on people with Alzheimer 's disease .
If successful , ispronicline will be at the head of a whole new class of drugs that target neuronal nicotinic receptors .
The receptors , found on nerve cells in the brain , respond to two chemicals : acetylcholine , which is found naturally in the brain , and nicotine .
" They 're like volume knobs for the brain , " said Merouane Bencherif , Targacept 's vice president of preclinical research .
Nicotinic receptors affect almost every human function , including movement , breathing and even mood , which means the potential treatments from a drug that alters the receptor could range widely from Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's to depression and schizophrenia .
While nicotine can take acetylcholine 's place in binding to nicotinic receptors , it 's only a rough substitute .
" It 's a very poor mimic , " said Roger Papke , a nicotinic receptor researcher at the University of Florida .
" Nicotine activates the receptors for a time , but then deadens them for a longer period of time .
There are also many different types of nicotinic receptors , and nicotine does n't specify .
It 's what I call a dirty drug , " Papke said .
Only in the last couple of decades have scientists figured out how nicotine works in the brain .
While nicotine is not responsible for the cancers caused by cigarettes , it can cause increased heart rates and respiratory problems .
And , of course , it 's addictive .
" Pharmaceutical companies are developing compounds that have the beneficial – but not the toxic – properties of nicotine , and selectively act on a subset of the different nicotinic receptors in the brain , " said J. Michael McIntosh , a University of Utah neuroscientist .
Scientists think ispronicline might treat Alzheimer 's because the disease has been linked to acetylcholine deficits in animals .
Nicotinic drugs have already been effective in treating acetylcholine - deficient animals , Papke said .
While Alzheimer 's appears to be the most immediate therapeutic target , there are many more , including Tourette 's syndrome , Lou Gehrig 's disease , schizophrenia , depression and anxiety .
Neuroscientists think nicotinic drugs could even treat the cognitive difficulties of aging .
" One of the things that happens in both aging and Alzheimer 's is that cells start to die , " Papke said .
Stimulating certain nicotinic receptors appears to prevent this death – and that , said Bencherif , is " the holy grail " of such therapies .
Best of all , said Jerry Buccafusco , a neuropharmacology professor at the Medical College of Georgia , the therapies will not simply be surface treatments .
" At least some of them have the potential not just to relieve symptoms , but to modify the disease , " he said .
Another type of nicotinic receptor is found in muscles , which leads scientists to believe that nicotinic drugs could also treat inflammatory diseases and relieve pain – possibly replacing opiate - based analgesics like morphine and oxycontin , which are addictive and often dangerous .
With so many therapeutic possibilities , the nicotinic drug field is crowded by pharmaceutical companies in various stages of research and development .
Abbott Laboratories is testing one compound on Alzheimer 's , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia , and another for pain relief .
Merck , AstraZeneca , Bristol - Meyers Squibb , Eli Lilly , sanofi aventis , Memory Pharmaceuticals , Critical Therapeutics and Pfizer are also developing nicotinic drugs .
Pfizer 's drug , Varenicline , intended to help people quit smoking , is in Phase III clinical trials .
Buccafusco thinks the nicotinic floodgates will open once Varenicline hits the market .
" Nicotinic drugs , " he said , " could be not just a major improvement , but a quantum improvement in the tools physicians have to treat disease . "

Story Highlights • Annual report on global terrorism says nearly half of attacks were in Iraq
• Al Qaeda and other militants reportedly find haven on Pakistan 's northwest border
• Iran is the " most dangerous enabler of terrorism in that region , " official says
• " Progress is mixed , " report says
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Iraq 's sectarian warfare fueled a sharp increase in global terrorism in 2006 , the U.S. State Department reported Monday .
The total number of terrorist attacks was up more than 25 percent from the previous year , according to the State Department 's annual report on global terrorism .
Incidents in Iraq accounted for nearly half of the 14,000 attacks and about two - thirds of the more than 20,000 fatalities worldwide .
The number of deaths blamed on attacks increased by about 40 percent .
The spike comes from the eruption of sectarian killings and bombings that followed the February 2006 bombing of the al - Askariya mosque in the Iraqi city of Samarra , according to Frank Urbancic , the State Department 's acting counterterrorism coordinator .
That attack , blamed on al Qaeda in Iraq , destroyed a revered Shiite Muslim shrine and led to a wave of reprisals between Iraq 's Sunni and Shiite communities .
The number of people killed in terrorist attacks in Iraq rose from 8,262 in 2005 to 13,340 last year , said Russell Travers , deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center .
Militants find new safe haven
Terrorist organizations behind the violence are setting up along Pakistan 's northwest frontier in safe havens created by the country 's September 2006 peace agreement with tribal leaders , the report said .
Despite the presence of 80,000 Pakistani troops and border guards along Afghanistan 's frontier with Pakistan , the tribal areas have become " sources of instability for Pakistan and its neighbors , " Urbancic said .
Tribal leaders are not living up to their agreement to deny shelter to Islamic militants , he said .
That has led to more fighters pouring into Afghanistan , where U.S. troops are battling a resurgent Taliban movement .
Meanwhile , al Qaeda and other groups , including Islamic guerrillas and Kurdish separatists fighting the Turkish government , are fighting to establish sanctuary in Iraq amid the chaos , Urbancic said .
The report accuses Iraq 's neighbors Iran and Syria of fueling violence in Iraq by providing weapons and training to militant groups and allowing fighters to cross into Iraq to attack American troops .
The report also singles out their support for Lebanon 's Hezbollah , the Shiite militia that fought a monthlong war with Israel in 2006 .
Urbancic called Iran " the most dangerous enabler of terrorism in that region . "
The report found that in Africa , al Qaeda operatives remain in Somalia despite the Ethiopian invasion in December that pushed a coalition of Islamic militias out of the capital , Mogadishu .
Islamic fighters continue to fight troops from Ethiopia and the Somali transitional government .
" Somalia remains a concern , as the country 's unsecured borders and continued political instability provide opportunities for terrorist transit and / or organization , " the report found .
Some successes noted
Despite the overall increase in international terrorism , there were some successes in the past year , the report indicated .
The plot to bomb trans -Atlantic airliners last year was foiled , and no major terrorist attacks occurred in Europe in 2006 .
The total number of attacks declined in Indonesia , Pakistan and India , despite attacks on commuter trains in the Indian city of Mumbai that killed more than 200 people in July .
Reid calls for change of course
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said the new document , which comes as President Bush prepares to veto an emergency war - spending bill that calls for U.S. combat troops to leave Iraq in 2008 , " dramatically demonstrates once again the unfortunate results of four years of a failed strategy . "
" Congress is asking the president to change course in Iraq because it is what the American people , military experts and the Iraq Study Group know is necessary to more effectively fight terrorism , " Reid said in a statement issued Monday afternoon .
" We hope the president seizes this opportunity to change course instead of refusing to recognize the reality on the ground . "
The report , however , declares that " progress is mixed , " more than five years after al Qaeda 's September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington .
It concludes that the nature of terrorism is shifting toward " global insurgency . "
" If the battle against terrorism is n't in Iraq , it 's going to be somewhere else , " Urbancic said .
" It started out in Afghanistan .
The terrorists are looking for places where they can operate and that 's what they 're doing .
So we can fight them in Iraq , we can fight them somewhere else .
The fact is , they 're there , and they 're going to find other ungoverned spaces . "
The 2006 report is the second year that the State Department has used a broader definition of terrorism -- " attacks against noncombatants for political reasons , " as Travers put it .
This one appears headed to the courts .
First of all , there 's a question whether a recess appointment can be made with someone who does n't even have a pending confirmation in the Senate .
Sam Fox 's nomination had been pulled from the Senate by Bush .
But that 's not the only legal problem with the recess appointment :
To fight the Fox appointment , Democrats are questioning the Bush administration 's plan to have Fox serve in a voluntary capacity -- receiving no pay for his duties as ambassador .
This is an important legal technicality , as federal law prohibits " payment of services " for certain recess appointments .
However , if the recess appointee in question agrees that he or she will take an unpaid position and not sue the government at a later date for compensation , then the appointment can go forward , at least as the White House sees it .
So as long as Fox -- a multi-millionaire -- agreed not to sue the Bush administration later for not paying him , the White House would be comfortable with giving him an unpaid , " voluntary service " recess appointment as ambassador to Belgium .
But here 's the rub that makes Democrats view Bush 's recess appointment of Fox as a major - league no - no : Federal law prohibits " voluntary service " in cases where the position in question has a fixed rate of pay , as an ambassadorship does .
That 's how the Government Accountability Office , an arm of the Democratic - controlled Congress , interprets the law [...]
" How to reconcile this clear conflict between the pay restriction , which says that Fox cannot be paid , with the voluntary services provision , which says that the State Department cannot accept voluntary services from Fox ? " queried one senior Democratic aide who asked for anonymity to speak frankly about the matter .
" That is the $ 64,000 question , " he added .

Kevorkian says his campaign will continue but within the laws
The 79 - year - old retired pathologist 's release is likely to push the assisted suicide issue back to prominence .
According to reports , Kevorkian 's lawyer says his client has been offered lucrative public speaking contracts .
Throughout the 1990s , Kevorkian waged a defiant campaign to help people end their lives .
His " suicide machine " - an instrument that allowed patients to inject themselves intravenously with a lethal dose of potassium chloride - became notorious .
The man who came to be known as " Dr Death " was linked to about 130 deaths , and was charged , tried and cleared in three assisted - suicide cases .
He was finally convicted of murder in 1999 after injecting a lethal dose himself for the first time , into a patient suffering from a wasting disease .
Showdown
For Kevorkian - who allowed the procedure to be videotaped and broadcast on national television - this was an attempt to prompt a legal showdown on the issue .
LEGAL BATTLES
Vermont : Death - with - dignity bill failed in 2005 and 2007 Hawaii : Came within three votes of becoming the second state to allow doctor - assisted suicide in 2002 .
Similar bills have stalled in the legislature since then Michigan : A law enacted in 1998 made physician - assisted suicide a felony Washington State : Voters in 1991 rejected a proposal to allow doctor - assisted suicide .
This would have overturned an existing ban .
Maine : Voters narrowly rejected a proposal in 2000 .
Similar proposals were rejected by the legislature four times before supporters launched a citizen initiative drive that forced the proposal to the ballot Source : The Associated Press
Kevorkian 's campaign sparked a nationwide debate about patients ' right to die and the role that physicians should play .
Oregon is the only state , so far , to have legalised the procedure .
Now Kevorkian wants to promote more Oregon - like legislation .
" It 's got to be legalised , " he told a Detroit TV station in a phone interview a few days before his release from prison in Michigan .
" That 's the point .
I 'll work to have it legalised , but I wo n't break any laws doing it . "
Kevorkian appears to maintain relatively strong public support .
An AP - Ipsos poll released this week found that 53 % of those surveyed thought he should not have been jailed , while 40 % supported his imprisonment .
The poll also asked whether it should be legal for doctors to prescribe lethal drugs to help terminally ill patients end their own lives : 48 % agreed while 44 % said it should be illegal .
California 's bid
Peg Sandeen , executive director of the Death with Dignity National Centre , told the BBC News website that the absence of right - to - die legislation was " dangerous " .
LEGAL IN EUROPE IN : Switzerland : Physician and non-physician assisted suicide only Belgium : Permits ' euthanasia ' but does not define the method Netherlands : Voluntary euthanasia and physician - assisted suicide lawful since April 2002
" We know that covert and clandestine aid in dying happens every day - studies show that it is prevalent across the country , " she says .
Oregon could get some big company soon .
The spotlight is now on California , where a bill under consideration would allow patients diagnosed with six months or less to live to take lethal pills prescribed by their doctor .
David Masci of the independent Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life believes the bill has a chance to pass the state legislature this year because it has the backing of the assembly speaker , Fabian Nunez
" That could carry the bill through the assembly and give it some momentum in the state senate , " he told the BBC News website .
If both houses approve the bill , it will need Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's signature to become law .
He has previously said he would prefer the issue be decided by voter referendum rather than the legislature .
A poll found last year that nearly 70 % of Californian adults favoured allowing incurably ill patients access to lethal drugs .
Local priorities
A successful passage of the bill would be important on a national scale , says Mr Masci .
California , the nation 's most populous state , has always been a social and cultural bellwether .
It could prompt other state legislatures to debate the issue , he says .
It is just not a high priority item for most voters or politicians [ in California ]
Wesley J Smith
leading campaigner against assisted suicide
But Wesley J Smith , author and leading campaigner against assisted suicide , does not believe the bill has a chance of passing this year .
" I think the opposition has been able to mount a stalwart and coordinated effort to defeat the bill in the assembly , " he told the BBC News website .
" I think most legislators know that the push for assisted suicide comes from a relatively small , if influential , sector of society , and thus are not worried that opposing legalisation will hurt them politically .
It is just not a high priority item for most voters or politicians . "
Oregon 's experience
The Oregon precedent is a battleground for campaigners on both sides of the debate in California .
The disturbing tale of Dr Kevorkian is a tale of the tragic lengths people will go to when they have no legal options
Patty Berg
co-author of California 's right - to - die bill
According to the Oregon Department of Human Services , 292 patients have died under the terms of the law between 1997 and 2006 .
Proof , say supporters , that fears of the law leading to widespread euthanasia are ill - founded .
But opponents say the figures do not tell the whole story .
Oregon 's rules governing assisted suicides stipulate that the patient must have been declared terminally ill by two physicians , have a life expectancy of six months or less and must have requested lethal drugs three times .
Opponents claim that there is no state authority to check fully on this and it is , therefore , open to abuse .
Because Oregon does not require autopsies in such cases , they say , there is no way of knowing the patient 's actual underlying conditions .
" It does not penalise doctors who fail to report assisting suicides and the state destroys the records and its paperwork after each annual report , making it impossible to verify those reports ' conclusions independently , " Tim Rosales , spokesman for Californians Against Assisted Suicide ( CAAS ) , said in a recent statement .
But Patty Berg , co-author of California 's bill and member of the assembly , says there are no facts to back up the claim that the Oregon law has been open to abuse .
" When that state 's data disproves their warnings , they say the data is flawed , " she told the BBC News website .
Euthanasia fears
CAAS - a coalition of disability rights activists , Latino civil rights groups , pro-life groups and medical professionals - is leading the opposition in California .
The group fears that rising health care costs and health rationing could lead hospitals , health insurers and even family members to pressure patients to end their lives prematurely in order to save scare resources .
The California Assembly is scheduled to vote on the bill in the next few days .
Kevorkian 's shadow could loom large .
" In a way , Dr Kevorkian is the poster boy for why we need this law , " says Ms Berg .
" The disturbing tale of Dr Kevorkian is a tale of the tragic lengths people will go to when they have no legal options .
" We do n't need crusaders who think they are above the law . "
Muhammad's Sword
Since the days when Roman Emperors threw Christians to the lions , the relations between the emperors and the heads of the church have undergone many changes .
Constantine the Great , who became Emperor in the year 306 - exactly 1700 years ago - encouraged the practice of Christianity in the empire , which included Palestine .
Centuries later , the church split into an Eastern ( Orthodox ) and a Western ( Catholic ) part .
In the West , the Bishop of Rome , who acquired the title of Pope , demanded that the Emperor accept his superiority .
The struggle between the Emperors and the Popes played a central role in European history and divided the peoples .
It knew ups and downs .
Some Emperors dismissed or expelled a Pope , some Popes dismissed or excommunicated an Emperor .
One of the Emperors , Henry IV , " walked to Canossa " , standing for three days barefoot in the snow in front of the Pope 's castle , until the Pope deigned to annul his excommunication .
But there were times when Emperors and Popes lived in peace with each other .
We are witnessing such a period today .
Between the present Pope , Benedict XVI , and the present Emperor , George Bush II , there exists a wonderful harmony .
Last week 's speech by the Pope , which aroused a world - wide storm , went well with Bush 's crusade against " Islamofascism " , in the context of the " Clash of Civilizations " .
IN HIS lecture at a German university , the 265th Pope described what he sees as a huge difference between Christianity and Islam : while Christianity is based on reason , Islam denies it .
While Christians see the logic of God 's actions , Muslims deny that there is any such logic in the actions of Allah .
As a Jewish atheist , I do not intend to enter the fray of this debate .
It is much beyond my humble abilities to understand the logic of the Pope .
But I cannot overlook one passage , which concerns me too , as an Israeli living near the fault - line of this " war of civilizations " .
In order to prove the lack of reason in Islam , the Pope asserts that the prophet Muhammad ordered his followers to spread their religion by the sword .
According to the Pope , that is unreasonable , because faith is born of the soul , not of the body .
How can the sword influence the soul ?
To support his case , the Pope quoted - of all people - a Byzantine Emperor , who belonged , of course , to the competing Eastern Church .
At the end of the 14th century , the Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus told of a debate he had - or so he said ( its occurrence is in doubt ) - with an unnamed Persian Muslim scholar .
In the heat of the argument , the Emperor ( according to himself ) flung the following words at his adversary : " Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached " .
These words give rise to three questions : ( a) Why did the Emperor say them ?
( b) Are they true ?
( c ) Why did the present Pope quote them ?
WHEN MANUEL II wrote his treatise , he was the head of a dying empire .
He assumed power in 1391 , when only a few provinces of the once illustrious empire remained .
These , too , were already under Turkish threat .
At that point in time , the Ottoman Turks had reached the banks of the Danube .
They had conquered Bulgaria and the north of Greece , and had twice defeated relieving armies sent by Europe to save the Eastern Empire .
On May 29 , 1453 , only a few years after Manuel 's death , his capital , Constantinople ( the present Istanbul ) fell to the Turks , putting an end to the Empire that had lasted for more than a thousand years .
During his reign , Manuel made the rounds of the capitals of Europe in an attempt to drum up support .
He promised to reunite the church .
There is no doubt that he wrote his religious treatise in order to incite the Christian countries against the Turks and convince them to start a new crusade .
The aim was practical , theology was serving politics .
In this sense , the quote serves exactly the requirements of the present Emperor , George Bush II .
He , too , wants to unite the Christian world against the mainly Muslim " Axis of Evil " .
Moreover , the Turks are again knocking on the doors of Europe , this time peacefully .
It is well known that the Pope supports the forces that object to the entry of Turkey into the European Union .
IS THERE any truth in Manuel 's argument ?
The pope himself threw in a word of caution .
As a serious and renowned theologian , he could not afford to falsify written texts .
Therefore , he admitted that the Qur'an specifically forbade the spreading of the faith by force .
He quoted the second Sura , verse 256 ( strangely fallible , for a pope , he meant verse 257 ) which says : " There must be no coercion in matters of faith " .
How can one ignore such an unequivocal statement ?
The Pope simply argues that this commandment was laid down by the prophet when he was at the beginning of his career , still weak and powerless , but that later on he ordered the use of the sword in the service of the faith .
Such an order does not exist in the Qur'an .
True , Muhammad called for the use of the sword in his war against opposing tribes - Christian , Jewish and others - in Arabia , when he was building his state .
But that was a political act , not a religious one ; basically a fight for territory , not for the spreading of the faith .
Jesus said : " You will recognize them by their fruits . "
The treatment of other religions by Islam must be judged by a simple test :
How did the Muslim rulers behave for more than a thousand years , when they had the power to " spread the faith by the sword " ?
Well , they just did not .
For many centuries , the Muslims ruled Greece .
Did the Greeks become Muslims ?
Did anyone even try to Islamize them ?
On the contrary , Christian Greeks held the highest positions in the Ottoman administration .
The Bulgarians , Serbs , Romanians , Hungarians and other European nations lived at one time or another under Ottoman rule and clung to their Christian faith .
Nobody compelled them to become Muslims and all of them remained devoutly Christian .
True , the Albanians did convert to Islam , and so did the Bosniaks .
But nobody argues that they did this under duress .
They adopted Islam in order to become favorites of the government and enjoy the fruits .
In 1099 , the Crusaders conquered Jerusalem and massacred its Muslim and Jewish inhabitants indiscriminately , in the name of the gentle Jesus .
At that time , 400 years into the occupation of Palestine by the Muslims , Christians were still the majority in the country .
Throughout this long period , no effort was made to impose Islam on them .
Only after the expulsion of the Crusaders from the country , did the majority of the inhabitants start to adopt the Arabic language and the Muslim faith - and they were the forefathers of most of today 's Palestinians .
THERE IS no evidence whatsoever of any attempt to impose Islam on the Jews .
As is well known , under Muslim rule the Jews of Spain enjoyed a bloom the like of which the Jews did not enjoy anywhere else until almost our time .
Poets like Yehuda Halevy wrote in Arabic , as did the great Maimonides .
In Muslim Spain , Jews were ministers , poets , scientists .
In Muslim Toledo , Christian , Jewish and Muslim scholars worked together and translated the ancient Greek philosophical and scientific texts .
That was , indeed , the Golden Age .
How would this have been possible , had the Prophet decreed the " spreading of the faith by the sword " ?
What happened afterwards is even more telling .
When the Catholics re-conquered Spain from the Muslims , they instituted a reign of religious terror .
The Jews and the Muslims were presented with a cruel choice : to become Christians , to be massacred or to leave .
And where did the hundreds of thousand of Jews , who refused to abandon their faith , escape ?
Almost all of them were received with open arms in the Muslim countries .
The Sephardi ( " Spanish " ) Jews settled all over the Muslim world , from Morocco in the west to Iraq in the east , from Bulgaria ( then part of the Ottoman Empire ) in the north to Sudan in the south .
Nowhere were they persecuted .
They knew nothing like the tortures of the Inquisition , the flames of the auto - da - fe , the pogroms , the terrible mass - expulsions that took place in almost all Christian countries , up to the Holocaust .
WHY ?
Because Islam expressly prohibited any persecution of the " peoples of the book " .
In Islamic society , a special place was reserved for Jews and Christians .
They did not enjoy completely equal rights , but almost .
They had to pay a special poll - tax , but were exempted from military service - a trade - off that was quite welcome to many Jews .
It has been said that Muslim rulers frowned upon any attempt to convert Jews to Islam even by gentle persuasion - because it entailed the loss of taxes .
Every honest
Jew who knows the history of his people cannot but feel a deep sense of gratitude to Islam , which has protected the Jews for fifty generations , while the Christian world persecuted the Jews and tried many times " by the sword " to get them to abandon their faith .
THE STORY about " spreading the faith by the sword " is an evil legend , one of the myths that grew up in Europe during the great wars against the Muslims - the reconquista of Spain by the Christians , the Crusades and the repulsion of the Turks , who almost conquered Vienna .
I suspect that the German Pope , too , honestly believes in these fables .
That means that the leader of the Catholic world , who is a Christian theologian in his own right , did not make the effort to study the history of other religions .
Why did he utter these words in public ?
And why now ?
There is no escape from viewing them against the background of the new Crusade of Bush and his evangelist supporters , with his slogans of " Islamofascism " and the " Global War on Terrorism " - when " terrorism " has become a synonym for Muslims .
For Bush 's handlers , this is a cynical attempt to justify the domination of the world 's oil resources .
Not for the first time in history , a religious robe is spread to cover the nakedness of economic interests ; not for the first time , a robbers ' expedition becomes a Crusade .
The speech of the Pope blends into this effort .
Who can foretell the dire consequences ?

( CNN ) -- President Bush announced on Friday that the Medal of Honor , the nation 's highest military decoration , will be awarded posthumously to Marine Cpl. Jason Dunham .
In April 2004 , Dunham was leading a patrol in an Iraqi town near the Syrian border when the patrol stopped a convoy of cars leaving the scene of an attack on a Marine convoy , according to military and media accounts of the action .
An occupant of one of the cars attacked Dunham and the two fought hand to hand .
As they fought , Dunham yelled to fellow Marines , " No , no watch his hand . "
The attacker then dropped a grenade and Dunham hurled himself on top of it , using his helmet to try to blunt the force of the blast .
Still , Dunham was critically wounded in the explosion and died eight days later at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland .
" As long as we have Marines like Corporal Dunham , America will never fear for her liberty , " Bush said Friday as he announced that Dunham would receive the award .
Bush spoke at the dedication of the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Virginia .
( Watch announcement of award at museum -- 1:27 )
" His was a selfless act of courage to save his fellow Marines , " Sgt. Maj .
Daniel A. Huff of the 3rd Battalion , 7th Marine Regiment , was quoted as saying in Marine Corps News that April .
" He knew what he was doing , " Lance Cpl. Jason A. Sanders , 21 , of McAllester , Oklahoma , who was in Dunham 's company , was quoted as saying by Marine Corps News .
" He wanted to save Marines ' lives from that grenade . "
In various media accounts , fellow Marines told how Dunham had extended his enlistment shortly before he died so he could help his comrades .
" We told him he was crazy for coming out here , " Lance Cpl. Mark E. Dean , 22 , from Owasso , Oklahoma , said in Marine Corps News .
" He decided to come out here and fight with us .
All he wanted was to make sure his boys made it back home . "
" He loved his country , believed in his mission , and wanted to stay with his fellow Marines and see the job through , " Vice President Dick Cheney said when speaking of Dunham 's heroism at a Disabled American Veterans conference in July 2004 .
The Scio , New York , native would have been 25 years old on Friday .
In a letter urging Bush to honor Dunham with the Medal of Honor , Sen. Charles Schumer , D - New York , called the Marine 's actions " an act of unbelievable bravery and selflessness . "
Dunham 's story was told in the book " The Gift of Valor , " written by Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Phillips .
Dunham will be the second American to receive the Medal of Honor from service in Iraq .
Army Sgt. 1st Class Paul Ray Smith was the other , honored for action near Baghdad International Airport in April 2003 , in which he killed as many as 50 enemy combatants while helping wounded comrades to safety .
Smith was the only U.S. soldier killed in the battle .

From time to time people ask how to develop for the web with PLT Scheme on the PLT mailing list .
The quick answer is " Just as in any other language " , but that 's not how to get people hooked on Scheme .
To write a decent web - application require knowledge of a range of subjects such as HTML , databases , servlets , and web - servers .
For some reason there is a lack of tutorials on these subjects , so I have decided to make an attempt at writing , if not a complete tutorial , then an elaborate get - started example .
The example application will be a mini version of Reddit called ListIt .
The front page consists of a list of links to interesting articles , users can vote the articles up and down , and submit new articles .
The hope is that the example is small enough to be easily understood , but on the other hand large enough to illustrate as many aspects as possible .
Please leave comments on the blog :
Did the example hit home ?
Is a paragraph in need of a rewrite ?
Did I skip something ?
First things first .
How should the program be organized ?
There is no need to reinvent the wheel , so I have chosen to use the Model - View - Controller architecture , which works just as well for web applications as it does for graphical user interfaces .
In a nutshell the Model - View - Controller architecture works like this :
The model holds the data , the view displays data .
User interactions goes through the controller in order to keep a separation between the model and the view .
( See section 22.3 of HTDP or Wikipedia for more on MVC ) .
In our case we will represent the model , the view and the controllers as three separate Scheme modules .
The model will use a database to hold the links , the view will consists of functions generating HTML and the controller will the web - servlet that reacts on the user actions .
Today we will concentrate on the model .
Each entry in our database consists of an entry - id , a title to display , an url to the article and a score representing the votes .
Since we expect many entries in our database , we will think of them as divided into page .
The number of entries in each page is given by the parameter PAGE - LIMIT .
The interface to our model consists of the following functions : Insert a new entry into the database .
Increase the score of an existing entryDecrease the score of an existing entryReturn the given number of entries with the highest scoresReturn the list of entries in the given page .
Is the url already listed ?
These functions are the only ones to be exposed to the controller .
To implement these functions we will use an SQLite database .
It would n't be unreasonable to argue that it would be easier to use a hash - table , but I want to illustrate how to use SQLite .
SQLite is small database engine , which comes in the form of a single self - contained , zero - configuration DLL - file on Windows or a a so - file on other platforms .
We will use Jay McCarthy and Noel Welsh 's PLT Scheme bindings sqlite.plt .
On top of these binding we 'll use a S - expression to SQL - string library written by me ( it will appear on PLaneT soon - it has been submitted ) .
On Windows you download SQLite by pasting the following into the DrScheme interaction window ( the REPL ) : To use the two SQLite packages , we start our module withOpening the database is simple :
At least it will be , after it is created .
The following function creates an empty database with a single table " entries " :
The #<< starts a so called here - string .
The functionexecutes an SQL - statement and ignores the result ( there is no S- expression syntax for CREATE TABLE yet ) .
Once we have created the our table , we can begin writing the functions in our interface .
The first is : The macroconverts an S - expression representation of an SQL - statement into a string , which is then handed to SQLite by .
The string produced by the sql macro frombecomes
The remaining functions from the interface are all simple SQL - statements , which can be studied in the full program below .
A loose end :
In the source below the parameteris used to hold the database .
As a convenience I have with the help of syntax - id - rules defined the identifierto expand to .
But in order make everything work also as when the database is n't created yet , the actual definition below is a little more involved .
To test the model , open the " model.scm " in DrScheme .
In the " Language " menu use " Choose Language " to choose the " Module " language .
Click and " Run " and you are ready to test it :

The U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling last week that made some New Yorkers very happy …
And could have serious worldwide tax implications .
The Supreme Court ruled 7 – 2 that American courts may hear matters involving foreign governments and property taxes .
The ruling now clears the way for New York City to collect the so - called “ pillow tax ” from diplomatic missions and consulates to the United Nations .
Under New York State law , a property owned by a foreign government is exempt from tax if it is used exclusively for diplomatic offices or as housing for an ambassador or a senior minister .
The “ pillow tax ” is the common term for the property tax that New York City hopes to collect from nations using missions to the United Nations for non-diplomatic purposes , such as providing living quarters for certain staff .
The ruling is important from a tax policy ( and foreign policy ) standpoint because it confers jurisdiction on American courts for matters involving property tax which “ run with the property ” rather than with the person or country .
Previously , missions and consulates were believed exempt from property tax .
In cities like New York , that exemption resulted in the loss of millions of dollars .
New York initially filed the suit against the Indian and Mongolian missions to the United Nations ; taxes for those countries alone involved more than $ 25 million .
Those governments argued that they were exempt from paying the tax because of diplomatic sovereignty granted in under a 1976 federal law , the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act .
However , in writing for the majority , Justice Clarence Thomas declared , “ Property ownership is not an inherently sovereign function . ”
The Supreme Court decision upheld the ruling issued last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , in Manhattan .
The Supreme Court ’s decision will likely encourage Washington , D.C. , and others to now aggressively seek taxes from consulates and other diplomatic property .
So what does that have to do with you ?
Well , the potential fall - out from this ruling has many lawyers , advisors , and policy - makers on edge .
The ruling could result in strained relations with other foreign countries depending on how zealously New York City , Washington , DC , and other American cities chase to collect taxes .
Good for the folks in those cities because it is money in the coffers , but bad for future relations .
Even worse ?
What if those countries turn the ruling on its ear and claim a similar lack of an exemption for American consulates and diplomatic missions abroad ?
What if those in India demand that the US pays the pillow tax ?
What about our other friends ?
Chances are that New York just opened up a big can of tax worms – the fallout from this ruling will be worth watching .
When a small consulting company in Chicago was looking to hire a summer intern this month , the company 's president went online to check on a promising candidate who had just graduated from the University of Illinois .
At Facebook , a popular social networking site , the executive found the candidate 's Web page with this description of his interests : " smokin ' blunts " ( cigars hollowed out and stuffed with marijuana ) , shooting people and obsessive sex , all described in vivid slang .
It did not matter that the student was clearly posturing .
He was done .
" A lot of it makes me think , what kind of judgment does this person have ? " said the company 's president , Brad Karsh .
" Why are you allowing this to be viewed publicly , effectively , or semipublicly ? "
Many companies that recruit on college campuses have been using search engines like Google and Yahoo to conduct background checks on seniors looking for their first job .
But now , college career counselors and other experts say , some recruiters are looking up applicants on social networking sites like Facebook , MySpace , Xanga and Friendster , where college students often post risqué or teasing photographs and provocative comments about drinking , recreational drug use and sexual exploits in what some mistakenly believe is relative privacy .
The new modeling system simulated 10 years of phytoplankton development .
Each map corresponds to the biomass density of one of the 18 dominant phytoplankton types .
Red areas indicate the highest density .
Global climate models are missing a good chunk of plant information that could significantly alter long - term climate change predictions .
A new technique for modeling phytoplankton – microscopic plants in the upper layers of the Earth 's waters – could reveal a much more accurate picture .
" ( Other ) modelers have populated their oceans with three or four kinds of plants , said Mick Follows , a researcher in MIT 's Program in Atmospheres , Oceans and Climate .
" We ’ve represented a much more diverse community , and allowed it to have interactions that regulate it more naturally . "
Phytoplankton populations are constantly changing , which makes them difficult to predict .
So the MIT researchers developed an algorithm using evolutionary principles to more accurately represent the microscopic plants .
A more precise count is important because phytoplankton process carbon dioxide – a significant contributor to global warming .
Scientists interviewed for this article said it 's too soon to say whether the more accurate phytoplankton count will be good news or bad news for the global climate 's future .
But climate researchers will have a more accurate picture once they factor the new phytoplankton model into their estimates , they said .
Phytoplankton perform two - thirds of all the Earth 's photosynthesis – the process by which plants turn light , nutrients and carbon dioxide into food .
The amount of CO2 processed by phytoplankton during photosynthesis affects concentrations of CO2 in the water , which determines how much of the greenhouse gas the oceans can absorb .
Follows and his colleagues created a model ocean seeded with dozens of randomly generated types of phytoplankton .
Like the real ocean , the model accounted for variations in light , temperature and food .
Having set the parameters , Follows ' team turned the model on .
Over 10 simulated years , the digital creatures competed to survive .
Some died out , others flourished , and they gradually settled into their respective niches .
Current marine - modeling systems do n't factor in the phytoplankton 's ever - evolving nature .
" We know that if climate changes a lot , the oceanic ecosystem will change , " says Raleigh Hood , a University of Maryland oceanographer .
" This model has the power to change itself under changing conditions . "
When they compared the resulting phytoplankton patterns to real - world data , the team found that their results were similar to those measured in the sea .
The data , published recently in Science , could profoundly impact climate models .
" It ’s a major breakthrough , " says Jorge Sarmiento , director of the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences program at Princeton University .
" It will help us better predict how global warming will affect ocean biology and the carbon cycle . "

MIT ’s furry robot is capable of human learning
For some reason I ca n’t look at MIT ’s Leonardo robot without an involuntary shudder – I think it ’s the lifelike fur and the evil , calculating eyes .
Even scarier is to see it in motion ( and there are videos after the cut ) , when complex facial mapping techniques have taken human expressions and reworked them for the robot ’s face ( which has 32 degrees of freedom ) .
Of course the clever people at MIT are n’t just making a particularly impressive toy ; their intent is to research new ways of human / machine interaction , where robots are used to give a computer a naturalistic interface that users are comfortable working with .
“ Once a task is learned , the robot should then be competent in its ability to provide assistance ; understanding how to perform the task as well as how to perform it in partnership with a human ”
Capable of being instructed by tutelage , where a user guides Leonardo to complete a task , by imitation , where Leonardo copies a demonstration , and social referencing , where Leonardo responds to a users reaction to a task , their goal is to end up with a machine that can learn from humans in their own terms , rather than them needing to be experts in programming .
I still think it looks like an evil squirrel monster .

Once people accept the idea that they have a right to bust heads skulls get broken .
Power corrupts .
It always corrupts .
And that is what ’s wrong with the American police .
The older I get the less and less respect I have for cops .
And I say that reluctantly as I have police officers in my family .
Since many cops are infected with an authoritarian mentality and an obsession for their own authority they simply are not mature enough to deal with most situations .
Like spoiled children they over react constantly .
These doughnut munchers falsely believe that their word is law .
If they order someone to do something they think people are required to obey .
That is not necessarily the case at all .
The authoritarian mentality says that there are laws and that they must rigorously be enforced by whatever strong arm methods are required .
The seriousness of the “ offense ” and the response to it need not be balanced .
So you get the assholes like the Atlanta cops who were arresting people for jaywalking .
And typical of an arrest they manhandle people roughly and try intentionally to humiliate them .
They will force non-violent people to the ground and push their face into the sidewalk , street or dirt to prove they are still the alpha - male on the block .
It is their way of marking you with their scent .
Freud might think it is macho over compensation due to the minute size of their organ .
I would tend to agree , small brains and an infatuation with authority go together .
Doughnut muncher Joey Williams ( I find it a bit sad when adults still use use their childish names ) saw some horrible criminals in Hot Springs , Arkansas .
And the chubby loud mouth went into his bad cop routine .
The horrible criminals were some kids skateboarding .
Listening to Joey you would have thought these kids had done something serious --- like buy the last cinnamon twist at Krispy Kreme .
Kids skateboard all the time .
And they do n’t confine the practice to the few areas where the politicians have given them permission to do so .
Most of the time it is ignored .
But Joey was grumpy that day .
They were out of creme filled .
So he took his anger out on some kids skateboarding .
So Officer
Joey sees these kids and kids are always good for kicking around a bit , especially if no puppy is nearby .
Now the kids probably should have stopped when he told them to just for their own self - defense .
After all people on a sugar high with guns can be dangerous .
But Joey over reacted .
He threatened to mace kids , he put them in choke holds and at no point did these kids try to attack him .
Unfortunately for Officer Joey his over reaction was caught on video .
And now he looks like the school yard bully he probably was in grade school .
Officer Joey is on leave while his actions are being investigated .
Mayor Mike Bush says Officer Joey is “ one of the 100 best and finest we ’ve got ” .
I take it there are only 100 cops on the police force in Hot Springs .
A lawyer friend of mine once pointed out that the big problem in America is that once cops were seen as “ officers of the peace ” .
Their job was to keep society civil .
But along the way they became “ law enforcement ” officers and in any over regulated society people obsessed with enforcing all those laws and regulations , instead of promoting the peace , become a threat to it themselves .
PS : Mayor Mike Bush does n't appear to have an email address .
But I do find two phone numbers for him .
I believe both are in area code 501 .
Home number is 623-6863 and his cell phone is 617-0085 .

Kaboom , indeed .
In a cascade of superlatives that belies the traditional cerebral reserve of their profession , astronomers reported Monday that they had seen the brightest and most powerful stellar explosion ever recorded .
The cataclysm — a monster more than a hundred times as energetic as the typical supernova in which the more massive stars end their lives — might be an example of a completely new type of explosion , astronomers said .
Such a blast — proposed but never seen — would explain how the earliest and most massive stars in the universe ended their lives and strewed new elements across space to fertilize future stars and planets .
“ It is quite possibly the most massive star that has ever been seen to explode , ” said Nathan Smith of the University of California , Berkeley , who estimated the star as “ freakishly massive , ” about 150 times the mass of the Sun .
“ We ’re really excited about this , ” Dr. Smith said .
“ If it really is what we think it is , it forces us to rethink how massive stars die . ”
He led a team of astronomers from the University of California , Berkeley , and the University of Texas , who have submitted a paper about the supernova to the Astrophysical Journal and discussed the results in a news conference from NASA headquarters today .
At 9:30 a.m. on Thursday , 12 boxes of alli , the first FDA - sanctioned diet drug to be sold without a prescription , were placed on the top shelf of a Santa Monica Walgreens ’ diet section .
Four hours later , all but one had been sold .
“ I have never in my life experienced anything like this , ” store manager Roe Love , a pharmacist for 20 years , said as she eyed the empty space next to the last box of 90 capsules selling for $ 59.99 .
The fact that the product is kept with the rest of the diet drugs under locked glass on the shelf -- to prevent theft -- did n’t deter people from requesting it .
The only comparable phenomenon Love could think of was the frenzy over the antibiotic Cipro during the post - 9/11 anthrax scare .
“ You could n’t fill those prescriptions fast enough , ” she said .

The latest diet pill is being rolled out across the country this week by manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline .
The company ’s website , myalli.com , and literature offer the potential for greater weight loss than dieting alone if you do everything right and a warning of extraordinarily unpleasant and embarrassing side effects if you do n’t .
Not all merchants have alli ( pronounced “ ally ” ) in stock yet -- a spokeswoman for Longs Drugs says all stores should have it by Saturday -- but among those that do , the buyers have overwhelmingly been women .
“ And they ’re not fat , ” Love said of the women she saw buying the drug at her store .
In Los Angeles , where thinness is the Holy Grail and people will do just about anything to get there -- including risking some rather unfortunate intestinal distress -- buyers did n’t flinch at possible side effects .
Advertisement
The drug was introduced as the stronger , prescription - only Xenical several years ago .
It works in the digestive system by blocking the absorption of about 25 % of fat that is consumed .
In a theoretical 3,000 calorie - a- day diet with about 100 grams of fat , the drug would eliminate about 225 calories .
But it can also result in what the manufacturer describes as loose stools and gas with an oily discharge .
“ It ’s probably a smart idea to wear dark pants , and bring a change of clothes with you to work , ” the drug ’s official website says .
( The drug maker ’s literature and website say side effects can be minimized with a low - fat , reduced - calorie diet . )

But the women buying alli Thursday were unfazed by the warnings .
At a San Fernando Valley Walgreens that had sold 10 boxes -- with one man among the buyers -- no one was asking the pharmacist about side effects .
“ ‘ Will it work ? ’
That ’s the only question they ’re asking , ” said the store ’s pharmacy manager , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
At a prominent display in a Rite Aid drugstore in Santa Monica , prospective buyers clutched the big alli starter kit and shared war stories from the diet battleground .
“ I ’ve tried so many other things , ” said Monique Brown , a Santa Monica legal secretary who says she ’s been through Metabolife , CortiSlim and various products , some of which made her jittery .
She dreams of losing 30 pounds .

At least , alli wo n’t make her jittery , she said .
“ I ’m just willing to give it a try .
There are side effects to a lot of things ....
I work in an office and I sit all day .
There ’s a bathroom right there .
We ’ve all worked together a long time .
If you have to go , you have to go . ”
Wendy Reid , a 57 - year - old Tallahassee , Fla. , resident visiting Southern California , said she had no qualms about taking alli .
“ I ’ve read about it completely , ” said Reid , carrying her purchase out of the Rite Aid in Santa Monica .
Deeply tan from her daily regimen of tennis , she nonetheless has 15 extra pounds she says she gained since she hit menopause .
She shrugged off the possibility of side effects .
“ I thought I would just deal with them , ” Reid said .
“ So far it ’s been proven safe . ”
Tall and athletic , she said it ’s not about what other people think of her frame .
“ My husband thinks I ’m silly , everyone thinks I ’m silly .
But I want to be the skinny self I always was . ”

Media outlets nationwide reported on the pill ’s introduction Thursday , interviewing dieters eager to try something new ; the manufacturer predicted that 5 million to 6 million Americans a year would buy the drug .
About 130 million Americans are considered overweight .
The materials that accompany alli and are posted on the website stress that people should eat a low - fat , reduced - calorie diet .
If dieters can stick to that discipline , they “ can lose about 50 % more weight than dieting alone , ” according to the drug brochure , which many stores displayed .
They can also allay some of the side effects .
And the manufacturer notes that awareness of possible side effects acts as a disincentive to overeat fatty foods .
Not all buyers seemed to have grasped that concept .
Love said one woman mentioned , as she bought the drug , “ that if she was going to have cheesecake , she ’ll take one .
That ’s ridiculous . ”

Alli is intended for overweight people 18 and older , according to the manufacturer .
However , the controls were unclear .
At some stores , it could simply be picked up off the shelf and taken to a cashier for purchase .
But at a Walgreens in the San Fernando Valley , the drug was being held behind the pharmacy counter , according to the pharmacy manager .
As sales were rung up , “ the register prompts us to check for I.D. for a birth date , ” said the pharmacy manager , who added that she would not sell it to someone under 18 .
Earlier this year , Dr. Adrienne Youdim , a weight - loss specialist at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center , said alli has a good safety record and has helped people lose an average of 10 to 16 pounds .
Not everyone , however , welcomes the product or the hype .
New York - based nutritionist Oz Garcia , who treats clients on both coasts , said : “ There is no real advantage to using alli unless you ’re doing what you ’re supposed to do -- working out , eating a well - balanced diet , all the things you have to pay attention to . ”

Garcia noted that a fat - blocking drug does no good for those gulping down cookies and pasta and other carbohydrates .
“ A lot of the weight gain that has occurred in the last decade is because people are already eating low - fat but they ’re eating high carbs , ” Garcia said .

On Friday , world oil prices climbed to nearly $ US53 a barrel , recovering from 19 - month lows .
New York 's main oil futures contract , light sweet crude for delivery in February , gained $ US1.11 to close at $ US52.99 a barrel .
In London , the price of Brent North Sea crude for February delivery rose $ US1.25 to settle at $ US52.95 a barrel .
The belief that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries would be able to support the price at $ US60 or so has proved as misplaced as last year 's consensus that the next stop after August 's peak of $ US78.40 was $ US100 a barrel .
Now the smart money is looking at $ US50 or even lower .
The behaviour of the oil price has taken almost everyone by surprise .
A year ago , the ugly stand - off between Russia and Belarus and nationalist sabre - rattling by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela would have sent the price soaring .
But the downward pressure is so great that even Vladimir Putin has been out - growled by the bears in the financial markets .
The first whiff of an apparent suspension of hostilities between Russia and its satellite put the skids under the price again .
Most oil experts are pointing the finger at the weather and investors have developed a new fascination with websites like that of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
There they have learned that not only was 2006 the warmest year on record in the US but that , unusually , winter has failed to show up everywhere in the northern hemisphere .
Merrill Lynch commodity strategist Francisco Blanch says : " This winter has so far been substantially warmer than normal , even when factoring in global warming . "
He calculates that " synchronous global warm winter weather " has reduced oil demand by 38 million barrels a day during the first half of winter .
According to the Missouri - based forecaster Weather Derivatives , demand for fuel in the north - eastern states of the US , which account for 80 per cent of American heating oil consumption , will be 24 per cent lower than normal this week .
The US Energy Information Administration has cut its forecast for global oil demand by 210,000 barrels to 86.3 million barrels a day .
The effects of the warm weather have been compounded by a manufacturing slowdown in the fourth quarter and the continuing decline in construction .
Lower demand is only one side of the equation .
On the supply side , too , pressure is easing .
With countries such as Angola , Brazil , Canada and Russia producing an estimated 1.8 million new barrels every day , even a global economy growing at 4.4 per cent a year can't find a use for all the oil sloshing around the system .
Non-OPEC oil output was 3 per cent higher than a year ago at 51.7 billion barrels in the last three months of 2006 , piling the pressure on the OPEC cartel to reduce its own production to keep the market in balance .
OPEC did agree to reduce its output by 1.2 million barrels a day in November , with a further 500,000 cut pencilled in for next month .
But the producers have discovered that calling for a cut and having the discipline to see it through are two different things .
In December , OPEC countries pumped about 700,000 barrels of oil a day more than they had agreed .
Even the most compliant nations - Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates - held back on 20 to 30 per cent of their promised cuts .
The most vocal price hawks , Indonesia and Venezuela , simply left the spigots gushing .
Merrill Lynch 's
Blanch sees potential for the oil price to start rising again if the situation deteriorates in the Middle East .
" While the current supply and demand trends suggest that there is relatively little upside pressure to crude oil prices , the geopolitics of energy is not getting any better , " he says .
He believes pressures arising from Iran 's nuclear program will continue to make it hard for the country to attract the foreign capital it needs to expand its oil and gas output .
The unwillingness of America 's new Democrat Congress to sanction further financial or military commitments to Iraq should hamper improvement in production there .
If Israel or the US launched an attack on Iran , all bets would be off .
But Tony Dolphin , an economist at Henderson Global Investors , thinks downward pressure is unlikely to ease off .
" It depends on the production of non-OPEC countries , which looks like being quite strong , " he says .
" If OPEC has to cut , the risks are on the downside . "
The implications for other financial markets of oil remaining below $ US55 could be significant , Dolphin says .
" It would be good for global growth , with more spending power for importing countries .
A soft landing would be more likely , " he says .
" But if the oil price stays down , the idea of interest rate cuts will disappear - and that could create nervousness and , ironically , be bad for stockmarkets . "
So although a cold snap may kill off those overoptimistic cherry trees , it could soothe the frayed nerves on the trading floor .

Faithful reader and commenter Ann M. wrote recently about her new habit of going meatless for one day a week :
During Lent , I did n’t eat any meat on Fridays .
It did n’t bother me too much because I do n’t eat that much meat anyways because it ’s tough to cook meat for one person !
My plan is to continue this habit of no meat on Friday ’s even though Lent is over .
While it ’s not being vegetarian , it ’s still ( generally ) healthier than eating meat again .
I actually did this for a little while last year too I think .
This is similar to how I became a vegetarian , and it ’s a great idea .
Many of you have gone a day or two without eating meat before , I ’m sure … you might eat at an Indian restaurant and try some of their spicy and delicious dishes … or even try a vegetarian restaurant now and then .
If you have , you know that there are a lot of very tasty dishes that do n’t require meat .
My favorite soup is vegan , as is my favorite chili recipe , and I make some great stir - frys , fried brown rice , and tacos .
My sister and brother - in - law recently made some great vegetarian Greek food for us .
Yum !
The list is endless .
So if you ’re looking for a way to eat healthier , but have a hard time “ dieting ” , try going one day a week without eating meat .
It ’ll cut back on the amount of cholesterol and saturated fat you ’re taking in , increase the fiber , nutrients and healthy fats , and slim down your waste while adding to your lifespan .

Two notable Republican senators ask President Bush to change course on Iraq
• Analysts say prominent senators ' opinions could sway others
• CNN / Opinion Research poll shows GOP support for war at all - time low
• Observers say to expect more defections as Iraq report , elections near
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
With the election season and a key Iraq war progress report perched on the horizon , more Republicans will start to distance themselves from President Bush 's Iraq policy , analysts say .
Two respected senior GOP senators this week publicly asked the president to look for a way out of Iraq .
One of them -- Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana -- is the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
" When Dick Lugar comes out against your foreign policy , it means your dam is breaking , and it means we 're far more likely as a country to move from Plan A to Plan B this fall , when it comes to Iraq , " said David Gergen , who has advised both Republican and Democratic presidents .
( Watch why Lugar has broken with the president on Iraq )
Sen . George Voinovich , R - Ohio , is jumping straight to what he calls Plan " E " for " Exit . "
" It 's time for the United States to put together a comprehensive plan for gradual disengagement in Iraq , " Voinovich said .
" We 're running out of time and I do n't think it 's fair to the next administration to say , ' Hey by the way , we 're leaving this baby for you guys to figure out . ' "
In a letter to the president , Voinovich , also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee , called for military disengagement and increased diplomatic engagement .
Both Lugar and Voinovich said they do n't favor setting timetables for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq but they are trying to get Bush 's attention and convince him that it 's time to develop an exit strategy .
In fact , in the position paper Voinovich sent to Bush , called " The Way Forward in Iraq , " he cited the possibility that voters might elect a president in 2008 who would promise an immediate withdrawal from Iraq as a reason to change course .
( Watch why the defections may spell the end of Republican support )
Voinovich said there are more Republicans who feel the same .
" I think many of my colleagues share my concerns , " he said .
" They 're frustrated . "
Some , however , still support the policy .
When asked about Lugar 's remarks , Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , said , " As much as I respect Sen .
Lugar , I think it 's unfair to the troops in the field to say the surge is not working . "
" The military part of the surge is definitely working , " Graham said .
" There 's no question in my mind that there 's improvement in stability and new political alliances being formed . "
The top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , and the U.S. ambassador , Ryan Crocker , are to issue a report in September on what impact Bush 's surge of troops into the war is having .
Analysts say that report will be pivotal on both the country 's and Congress ' outlook on the war .
Lugar's and Voinovich 's reversal on Iraq are the most significant of a growing number of Republicans who are beginning to distance themselves from Bush 's strategy for Iraq .
And with voters becoming increasingly against the war , look for more to follow , analysts say .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday shows that 38 percent of respondents who identified themselves as Republicans say they oppose the war .
That follows a trickle of Republican lawmakers making their displeasure with Bush 's Iraq policy public .
Earlier in June , several Republican members of Congress called for the Bush administration to follow the recommendations made by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group , which Bush had resisted to follow .
This week , Republican congressmen Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Frank Wolf of Virginia are calling to reconvene the ISG to review Iraq policy and offer new recommendations .
" Last fall , the Iraq Study Group provided Congress a thoughtful assessment on one of the most important issues of our time , " Shays said .
" As we approach another crossroad in this conflict , having that thoughtful insight again will be invaluable . "
A number of Republicans endorsed the amendment , which was passed by the House 355-69 .
Analysts and Republican strategists say it's one thing for a few lesser - known Republicans to go against the White House ; but some believe a respected senior party stalwart like Lugar turning against the war gives cover for other skeptical Republicans of Lugar 's stature , like Sen .
John Warner of Virginia , to make a break from the administration 's position .
Warner , the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , hinted that might be coming .
" I have some thoughts of my own but I will withhold those thoughts until I participate in the debates over the ( Defense Authorization Bill ) after the Fourth of July . "
Analysts say a different surge might be in the offing as September nears -- a Republican surge for withdrawal .
" I think we will certainly see other Republicans following the Lugar lead , " said Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report .
" Most or all of them will wait closer until September , when we get the report from General Petraeus , and when Congress as a whole and in fact the White House will be re-evaluating the policy . "
CNN 's Dana Bash , Brian Todd and Ted Barrett contributed to this report .
Each colored box represents a certain number of megapixels .
The numbers along the top and left side are print dimensions in inches at 300 ppi ( pixels per inch ) .
Most books and magazines require 300 ppi for photo quality .
For example , the chart shows that you can make a 5 " x 7 " photo quality print from a 3 megapixel camera .
inches @ 300 ppi ( numbers inside colored boxes are megapixels )
Notice that as the print size doubles , the megapixels required increases geometrically .
You can make nice 8 " x 10 " prints with a 6 or 8 megapixel camera , but to make a true photo quality 16 " x 20 " print , you need between 24 and 30 megapixels .
Do n't be fooled by manufacturers ' claims that say you can make 16 " x 20 " prints from an 8 megapixel camera .
While you certainly can make a print that size , it will not be true photo quality .
Here 's why :
A megapixel is 1 million pixels .
It 's an area measurement like square feet .
A typical 8 megapixel camera produces images that are 3266 x 2450 * pixels .
If you multiply 3266 by 2450 , you get 8,001,700 or 8 million pixels .
If you multiply 3266 by 2450 , you get 8,001,700 or 8 million pixels .
To find the largest photo quality image you can print , simply divide each dimension by 300 :
3266 / 300 = 10.89 inches
2450 / 300 = 8.17 inches
3266 / 300 = 10.89 inches 2450 / 300 = 8.17 inches
If you are not publishing your images in a book or magazine , and you 're just making prints for yourself or your friends , you can " cheat " .
Good quality inkjet printers can make a nice looking print at 250 or 200 ppi .
At 200 ppi , the maximum print size becomes :
3266 / 200 = 16.33 inches
2450 / 200 = 12.25 inches
3266 / 200 = 16.33 inches 2450 / 200 = 12.25 inches
If you know how to use image editing software like Photoshop , you can " cheat " even more by increasing the image size , and even doubling the number of pixels in the image .
The quality of the camera and lense becomes more important at this point bacause any loss of detail or sharpness is magnified .
If an image is enlarged too much in this manner , it will look " fuzzy " or " pixelated " .

About the Comments
On most Design215 pages you 'll see the newest comments at the top .
On this page however , I decided to show the oldest comments at the top because I tried to answer many of the initial comments about this chart .
Since people keep making the same comments , I thought it best to have my original answers at the top .
Once again , I made this chart as a visual representation of megapixels .
As a photographer , I certainly recognize the importance of sensor quality , optics , compression , post processing , and viewing distance .

" Nice guide , I got a 7 Megapixel Camera and it makes beautiful 8x10s .
Even though 7 is not on the chart it is not difficult to see where it would fit .
I have n't tried anything larger than a 8x10 .
Nice chart , one of many reasons why I opted for the 7 megapixel camera over the 5 ! "

" When you go from 8x10 to 16x20 are n't you quadrupling the area ?
Therefore it would make sense that you would need 24 to 30 megapixels for a 16x20 if you could produce a 8x10 with 6 to 8 megapixels because 6x4=24 and 8x4=32 .
[ Reply from Robert Giordano ]
Strictly speaking in terms of pixels per inch , with no post editing , an 8x10 @ 300 ppi is ( 8x300 ) x ( 10x300 ) , or 7,200,000 pixels ( 7MP ) .
A 16x20 is ( 16x300 ) x ( 20x300 ) , or 28,800,000 pixels ( 28.8 MP ) .
This chart is only about the math and does not take into consideration the subject matter of the image , the media it will be printed on , the amount of post editing that will be done to it , or the viewing distance of the final output . "

" The critical part that is being left out which needs to be tied into this information is sensor size .
And also the work done in post has more to do with achievable print size than megapixels .
The 300dpi mark is indeed " true photo quality " in print terms , but it is n't always needed to get good prints .
I have 20x30 " prints on Fuji Crystal Archive hanging on my wall that turned out wonderful from an 8 mp APS -C sized sensor ( Canon 350D ) .
And perfect 20x30 "s from the full - frame 4 mp Canon 1D .
[ Reply from Robert Giordano ]
Randy , I totally agree but I 'll have to make a different chart on a new page .
A larger 6MP sensor will of course produce better images than a smaller 6MP sensor of the same type .
From there , it gets very complicated .
For one , making an inkjet print is different than producing a print ad where you need 300 ppi for a 150 line screen .
I 've made great looking 16x20 inkjet prints from my 6MP Nikon D70 but the same image did n't quite cut it for a full page magazine ad .
There are a number of factors to consider including subject matter , exposure , focus , and post processing .
How does one begin to make such a chart ?
The chart on this page is purely for a mathematical overview .
As the table underneath the chart shows , I can shoot 35 mm film , scan it , and have at least a 19 megapixel image .
In reality , I shoot digital 90 % of the time , and use my 4x5 film camera if I need to go big . = ) "

" nice , nice , you just forgot to mention that bigger pictures are meant to be looked from farther ... eg if you design a billboard , you 'll need only a resolution of 18 or 20 dpi .
[ Reply from Robert Giordano ]
Yes , you are correct .
For the sake of simplicity , I have selected the " photo quality " standard of 300 ppi as a constant . "
all wrong

" try telling that to this guy : http://www.grafphoto.com/articles/printdogma.html
[ Reply from Robert Giordano ]
What 's funny is I agree with what he says .
He explains that he made a 24 x 36 print from his 4MP Nikon D2H .
Yes , 4 megapixels at 72 ppi will give you roughly a 24 x 36 image .
Actually the D2H gives you 2464 x 1632 pixels which is 34.22 " x 22.66 " @ 72 ppi .
He says he used USM ( Unsharp Mask ) at 500 % and 0.1 R to " correct for digital capture " .
The thing is , he started with a top of the line , $ 3000 USD camera and a high quality lens .
He captured a RAW image file ( not a jpeg ) then he did some post processing in Photoshop .
Finally , he sent the file to a print shop , where the image was most likely processed again in the RIP software .
A consumer with a $ 200 4MP camera who has no idea how to use Photoshop , is not going to achieve the same results .
In the table below the chart , I 've listed print sizes at 200 ppi and 150 ppi as alternatives to the 300 ppi standard .
The chart simply serves as a visual comparison of various megapixel areas . "
all right
08 Oct 2006 5:33 pm
" Great chart , and handy too .
You 're spot on about the link above - the guy is using top quality gear and the photo was sent to a printer who obviously applied interpolation either in Photoshop or through the RIP ( more likely ) .
Sending the image to a different printer would produce a different result .
Another point is that resolution is fast becoming less important than it has been to date .
As sensors become more detailed , so lenses , sensor size , lag time and other functions become more important "

" Nice chart , although there is definately something to be said about the absolutes of mathematical analysis vs. real life .
The best way to decide on maximum print size is to look at actual prints .
To give some hope to those who would push the 300dpi limit , when I purchased my 8 mp APS -C DSLR I thought max size would be 8x12 .
Recently with simple Photoshopping and a good printer ( meaning a person who prints rather than a machine ) I took them up to 16x24 .
It really surprised me how good they looked ! "
good chart , but IRL ....
09 Oct 2006 5:16 pm
" This is a good reference chart .
But the fact is that I have made high quality 11x14 prints from my older 4 mp point and shoot .
THese are as good , if not better , in quality as some of the 11x14 35 mm prints I have made in the darkroom with ISO 100 film .
They were not pixelated , blurred , or distorted .
Granted they have to be high quality images to start with .
In real life the numbers are a good guide , but only experience can tell you for sure what your camera will actually do for you . "
Yeah I guess so , but ...
10 Oct 2006 4:15 am
" If you use a simple trick in photoshop you can easily get great looking prints beyond the " maximum " size .
Basically you increase the size by 110 % .
You can repeat it 5 - 7 times before you start to notice any real image loss .
Of course results vary depending on photographs but I have started with a photograph at 300dpi 10.02x6.67 and gone up to 300dpi at 19.5x13 inches and gotten great results .

" Your chart is misleading IMHO in that beyond certain types of Professional publishing most photographers and printers consider 250dpi to be acceptable for high quality prints .
Any digital camera from 3MP on will satisfy the average user printing at 4x6 through 8x10 .
The only time the rule does n't hold is they happen to need to do extensive cropping .
I know you put in the fine print about inkjets working at 200d pi but I just wanted to emphasize that 3MP - 5MP digicams is all most people need . "

" Yes you can try that 110 % trick but I 'm not sure there is much point .
I found I could achieve the same effect by using Bicubic Sharper in the Image Size dialogue box in Photoshop .
I simply selected Bicubic Sharper and entered in the pixel dimensions I wanted .
I tried doing the 110 % thing with a 1500 pixel square image .
It took it to 2925 after a number of 110 % up sizes .
Using Bicubic sharper in one hit achieved exactly the same result . "

Thanks
[ Reply from Robert Giordano ]
I was just including 35 mm film as a reference , probably 100 ISO transparency film .
Film has grain , not pixels so you could use 1600 ISO film and it still would n't become little square pixels no matter how much you enlarged it .
That being said , there are many other differences between film and digital .
Each has its advantages and disadvantages . "

It also confirms the old saying " the proof is in the pudding " or something like that .
From this chart how do you print smaller ?
By doubling the DPI ?

" I 've heard about the +110 % trick from a few different sources .
I experimented within photoshop and found slightly better results using the one - step " bicubic smoother " setting .
I found it to be smoother AND sharper .
I also found two things that have n't been mentioned yet ... increasing by 110 % 5 times gave me slightly more apparent chromatic abberations , and a dramatic color shift towards yellow .
The one - step approach is just a better way to resize in my opinion . "

" Excellent chart .
Well done .
You are correct that , in the strictest sense , to get an image that looks good to any pair of eyes from any distance one should be printing at 300 ppi at native resolution .
But things are not quite that simple .
The average pair of eyes is less acute , and the average viewing distance is further away .
Skill with interpolation software can double native resolution while retaining unpixelated edges and all details .
Which is why the D2H can do posters with certain subjects . "
ppi vs distance GW
26 May 2008 4:51 am
" Great explanation of print size vs. megapixels .
This is great info , especially for those not handy with post - processing .
The only thing that could be considered missing is a chart that shows ppi vs viewing distance .
If the image was placed farther away from the audience the ppi's can reduce , as Smartie alluded to when refering to billboards , with no reduction in quality being seen .
300 ppi is considered optimum when viewing a print from about 12in .

" Nice !
But some people are using this chart to say that more mega-pixels than X is n't needed or desirable .
To them I would like to remind of : Panorama photography , Scrolling backgrounds for film , and the common practice of cropping .
An 8 MP camera might look good printed to A4 but not after you decide to crop 60 or 80 % of the pixels because you want a tighter shot or you want to zoom up and see the actual facial expression on your 6 - year - old 's face as as he / she was blowing out the candles . "

" This chart helps me feel comfortable creating shots for magazine publications with 6.1 Megapixel Nikon D50 .
I 've been out of photography for a while and got back in by stumbling across this .
I 'm creating views of classroom lessons and activities .
Should be enough for that . "

" I beg to differ with your 35 mm film numbers .
You can scan 35 mm chrome up to about 5,500 ppi and still get detail .
Above that your are just scanning the film grain .
I have produced spectacular 30 " x40 " prints from 35 mm chromes .
Film still records far more information than any digital camera .

Another Idea

" Another " trick " for increasing actual megapixel size involves using a calibrated panoramic head on a tripod .
If you are shooting at a native 12 megapixelx , and you want to print very large images , taking multiple 12 megapixel images , and stitching them together to form the finished image can resolve the relatively low resolution of even higher end digital cameras when compared with traditional film stock .
By merely taking a 2 x 2 grid of pictures , you quadruple the native megapixel count . "

35 mm Film Exposure = 60MP

" 35 mm chrome film scanned at high res can produce a much larger print than shown on your chart .
I have 30 " x40 " prints from 35 mm Fujichrome Velvia film ... long exposures shot at night and it's very detailed and sharp .
This chart is not accurate where film is concerned at all .
I have read that 35 mm exposures = around 60 MP of information .
That 's more than even the current medium format digital cameras
[ Reply from Robert Giordano ]
I agree .
I have 35 mm negatives on Agfa APX25 that I had to have professionally scanned with a drum scanner in order to reproduce the detail I could see under a 15 x loupe .
My 35 mm reference in the chart is an average of 19 MP .
I arrived at this number after scanning many , many slides and negatives .
Most people are not shooting Velvia or Agfa 25 . = ) "

" I just wanted to say Thank you for creating this chart and page .
I found the information extremely helpful and was fully able to understand that this is meant to be an average .
There are always exceptions to the rule and I feel photography is about bending the limits of perception quite often , even through outside sources .
Essentially many things are possible through diligence and hard work , then there are the rest of us .
I am grateful to the time you spent on this for us .

The Early 35 and Megapixels
28 Dec 2010 11:34am
" When 35 mm cameras were first used by photographers working for LOOK , LIFE , and National Geographic magazines , the camera - lens - film combination then available probably resolved lots less line pairs than a modern 35 .
I wonder if there is a way to estimate the approximate " megapixel equivalence " of those early Leicas and Contaxes of the time when 35 gained wide acceptance .
Any thoughts on how to arrive at this ?
[ Reply from Robert Giordano ]
I disagree with the assumption that older camera - lens - film combinations resolved to less detail than modern cameras .
I believe its the opposite .
I am , of course , disregarding all " consumer grade " cameras and film .
First of all , many of the famous photographs from 40s , 50s , and 60s that we recognize today , were shot with a Speed Graphic or similar camera on 4x5 film .
For years , I shot Agfa APX25 35 mm black and white film with an old Nikon FM2 and a manual focus , Nikkor 105 mm F2.5 .
I developed my film by hand and I have 20 " x 30 " prints on my wall with virtually no grain and detail that surpasses any DSLR I 've seen , up to 16 megapixels .
Personally , I 've been waiting a long time for digital to catch up to film .
It 's now 2011 and I think its just beginning to happen . "

I have read several of your very well articulated articles , thank you for devoting the time and energy to help many people out with these concepts .
I am thinking and planning ahead for potential exhibitions and the relationship between ppi and viewing distance has been of particular interest .
I was wondering if you had published an article or table of this somewhere ?

" Glad to find this again ... forgot to bookmark it before .
Good chart , and you did a good job in the comments of explaining the caveats .
I would add that some photo editors and printing utilities allow you to print a test strip before you print large ( or have it printed by a lab ) .
For example , you can set the print size at 16x20 and the paper size at 4x6 .
The resulting 4x6 print will be a strip or patch at the scale of the 16x20 .
I do this regularly with Qimage and it saves a lot of paper and ink . "
Very helpful chart !

" Funny , but depending on your source , maximum size of 35 mm film is about ~ 20 megapixels .
And still , as of start of 2012 most of compact cameras , do n't have this resolution .
But probably most professional will have at the end of year ... "

" I really like the longevity of relevance to this article , where in 2012 the math still of course applies but the printers and sensors have progressed dramatically beyond the 6 or 7MP the original respondents were discussing back in 2006 .
I 'm shooting a Canon 7D @ 17.9 effective MP and typically print on an Epson 3880 @ 240 dpi to achieve excellent quality results for artistic display ( using Epson Ultra Luster paper ) .
It will be fun to check back in a few years and see where this page is ! "

" Actually , 150d pi can give acceptable results for color photographic images ( i.e. an image you would use JPEG format for ) , and you will not notice any visible pixels from normal " reading distance " .
This does not hold true for high contrast " line art " type images ( lettering , logos , " graphic art " , etc ) .
In this case , vector formats are desired , and if it must be rasterized , then 300dpi is considered to be low and 600 is recommended . "

It depends on what kind of film you are scanning and how it was developed .

" Note that aspect ratio is n't talked about here .
When you make a print the aspect ratio of the print is not always the same as the image that the camera took .
Images are likely cropped .
So the individual numbers of separately measuring the height and width is the correct way to estimate .
The chart does not always show the same aspect ratio .
A regular camera is likely 4:3 but a SLR camera is likely to mimic 35 mm film and use 3:2 .
Some cameras shoot wide ratio of 16:9 .
Some can be changed . "

While regular multivitamin use is not linked with early or localized prostate cancer , taking too many multivitamins may be associated with an increased risk for advanced or fatal prostate cancers , according to a study in the May 16 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
Millions of Americans take multivitamins because of a belief in their potential health benefits , even though there is limited scientific evidence that they prevent chronic disease .
Researchers have wondered what impact multivitamin use might have on cancer risk .
Karla Lawson , Ph.D. , of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Md. , and colleagues followed 295,344 men enrolled in the National Institutes of Health - AARP Diet and Health Study to determine the association between multivitamin use and prostate cancer risk .
After five years of follow - up , 10,241 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer , including 8,765 with localized cancers and 1,476 with advanced cancers .
The researchers found no association between multivitamin use and the risk of localized prostate cancer .
But they did find an increased risk of advanced and fatal prostate cancer among men who used multivitamins more than seven times a week , compared with men who did not use multivitamins .
The association was strongest in men with a family history of prostate cancer and men who also took selenium , beta - carotene , or zinc supplements .
" Because multivitamin supplements consist of a combination of several vitamins and men using high levels of multivitamins were also more likely to take a variety of individual supplements , we were unable to identify or quantify individual components responsible for the associations that we observed , " the authors write .
In an accompanying editorial , Goran Bjelakovic , M.D. , of the University of Nis in Serbia , and Christian Gluud , M.D. , of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark , discuss the positive and negative health effects of antioxidant supplements .
" Lawson [ and colleagues ] add to the growing evidence that questions the beneficial value of antioxidant vitamin pills in generally well - nourished populations and underscore the possibility that antioxidant supplements could have unintended consequences for our health , " the authors write .

SAN FRANCISCO , Jan. 5 — It bears the hallmarks of a classic urban scourge : back - channel sales , assaults on enforcement officials and even death .
It is the price of parking in San Francisco .
Burdened with one of the densest downtowns in the country and a Californian love for moving vehicles , San Franciscans have been shocked in recent months by crimes related to finding places to park , including an attack in September in which a young man was killed trying to defend a spot he had found .
More recently , the victims have been parking control officers — do not call them meter maids — who suffered four attacks in late November , and two officers went to a hospital .
Over all , 2006 was a dangerous year for those hardy souls handing out tickets here , with 28 attacks , up from 17 in 2005 .
Which Medical Practice Will Be Discredited Next ?
An editorial in the current British Medical Journal makes a very sharp point that many of us have probably been thinking about in the last few weeks while reading the latest medical news in the papers :
It ’s easy to feel contempt for deluded practitioners of the past who advocated bloodletting and tonsillectomies for all .
Easy , that is , until one considers emerging evidence that coronary stenting and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy may well be the contemporary equivalents of those now discredited practices .
This recent New York Times article tells of the compelling study which found that coronary stenting is typically no more effective than heart drugs , even though it is far more invasive — and , to be sure , profitable for the medical personnel involved .
Indeed , another article in the same issue of BMJ suggests that stenting is less common in Europe than in the U.S. mainly because “ there have not been the same financial incentives to carry out some stenting . ”
FWIW , we mentioned this subject briefly in Freakonomics :
If you were to assume that many experts use their information to your detriment , you ’d be right .
Experts depend on the fact that you do n’t have the information they do .
Or that you are so befuddled by the complexity of their operation that you would n’t know what to do with the information if you had it .
Or that you are so in awe of their expertise that you would n’t dare challenge them .
If your doctor suggests that you have angioplasty - even though some current research suggests that angioplasty does little to prevent heart attacks - you are n’t likely to think that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars for himself or his buddy .
But as David Hillis , an interventional cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , explained to the New York Times , a doctor may have the same economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director or a mutual - fund manager : “ If you ’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith , the local internist , is sending you patients , and if you tell them they do n’t need the procedure , pretty soon Joe Smith does n’t send patients anymore . ”
The BMJ editorial also asks a wise question .
Perhaps some of you can offer an answer : “ What other medical orthodoxies might join hormone replacement therapy and stenting on the ever - growing list of discredited interventions ? ”
I have one prediction : late - stage chemotherapy for many types of cancer .
The World Service survey , conducted in 25 nations including the US , found that three in four respondents disapproved of how Washington had dealt with Iraq .
The majority of the 26,381 respondents also disapproved of the way five other foreign policy areas had been handled .
The poll , released ahead of President Bush 's State of the Union speech , was conducted between November and January .
Poll findings in more detail
At-a-glance
The number of those who said the US was a positive influence in the world fell in 18 nations polled in previous years .
In those countries , 29 % of people said the US had a positive influence , down from 36 % last year and 40 % two years ago .
Across the 25 countries polled , 49 % of respondents said the US played a mainly negative role in the world .
In Kenya , Nigeria , the Philippines and the US most of those polled said they thought America had a positive role .
But among Americans , the number of those who viewed their country 's role positively fell to 57 % - six percentage points down from last year and 14 percentage points down from two years ago .
Mid-East role
Respondents were also asked about the Bush administration 's handling of six areas of foreign policy :
The war in Iraq : an average of 73 % of respondents disapproved ( 57 % in the US ) .
Disapproval was strongest in Argentina and France , while people in Nigeria , Kenya and the Philippines were more likely to approve .

Vision Robotics is developing a machine to trim grapevines in the fall .

As if the debate over immigration and guest worker programs was n't complicated enough , now a couple of robots are rolling into the middle of it .
Vision Robotics , a San Diego company , is working on a pair of robots that would trundle through orchards plucking oranges , apples or other fruit from the trees .
In a few years , troops of these machines could perform the tedious and labor - intensive task of fruit picking that currently employs thousands of migrant workers each season .
The robotic work has been funded entirely by agricultural associations , and pushed forward by the uncertainty surrounding the migrant labor force .
Farmers are " very , very nervous about the availability and cost of labor in the near future , " says Vision Robotics CEO Derek Morikawa .
Agricultural groups hope Vision Robotics can build this harvester to replace labor crews .
Image : Vision Robotics
It's a surprising new market for Vision Robotics , which had been focused on developing consumer devices , including a robotic vacuum cleaner to compete with iRobot 's Roomba .
When a member of the California Citrus Research Board approached the company in 2004 , Morikawa was doubtful that an effective robotic picker was even feasible .
A citrus grower brought the skeptical engineers to an orange farm in California 's fertile Central Valley , where they walked down the neat rows of trees and stared at the oranges hanging in the branches .
Previous attempts at making a mechanical harvester were thwarted by inefficiency , explains Morikawa .
In the past , experimental machines approached a tree as a human would , picking one piece of fruit and then looking for the next .
In this slow process , the machine circled the tree repeatedly until it was sure it had picked all the fruit .
Morikawa says his engineers had their breakthrough idea right there in the orange grove .
They realized that the task could be divided between two robots :
One would locate all the oranges , and the second would pick them .
" Once you know where all the fruit is , then it becomes an easy job to calculate the most efficient way to pick it all , " says Morikawa .
The eight - armed orange harvester will strip ripe fruit from trees .
Image : Vision RoboticsBut it was n't just technological challenges that held back previous attempts at building a mechanical harvester –- politics got involved , too .
Cesar Chavez , the legendary leader of the United Farm Workers , began a campaign against mechanization back in 1978 .
Chavez was outraged that the federal government was funding research and development on agricultural machines , but not spending any money to aid the farm workers who would be displaced .
In the ' 80s , that simmering anger merged with a growing realization that the technology was nowhere near ready , and government funding dried up .
This time around , growers ' associations are funding the research .
By the end of this year , the orange growers will have invested almost $ 1 million in the project , says Ted Baskin , president of the California Citrus Research Board .
He estimates that it will take about $ 5 million more to get to the finished product .
The farmers are willing to pay up because they 've been rattled by a labor shortage over the past few years – California growers tell horror stories of watching their fruit rot on the trees as they waited for the picking crews to arrive .
Last fall , growers rallied in front of the U.S. Capitol , frustrated that Congress still had n't created a program to ease the passage of foreign guest workers across the Mexico border .
With the supply - and - demand equation uncertain , growers see the robots as a better option .
" You can predict what it 's going to cost to buy a machine and maintain it , " says Baskin .
" You can't predict the bargaining that we go through with contract labor , " he says .
The two robots would work as a team : one an eagle - eyed scout , the other a metallic octopus with a gentle touch .
The first robot will scan the tree and build a 3 - D map of the location and size of each orange , calculating the best order in which to pick them .
It sends that information to the second robot , a harvester that will pick the tree clean , following a planned sequence that keeps its eight long arms from bumping into each other .
The Vision Robotics engineers are currently building the scout .
They expect to have a prototype ready next year , with the harvester to follow two or three years later .
Baskin says he does n't expect the mechanical systems to pose any serious problems .
The hard work is writing the software .
After the scout robot makes a 3 - D map of the tree , it has to evaluate each piece of fruit .
What size is the orange ?
What color is it ?
Does it have black spots on it ?
" It 's a question of gathering the information , and then judging whether it meets the parameters that are equal to a good orange , " Baskin says .
Vision Robotics has been working on that problem for almost four years now , which might give some reassurance to human pickers .
The United Farm Workers ' leaders say they are n't worried about the robots , because they do n't believe the machines will ever be able to do the job as well as people .
Spokesman Marc Grossman predicts that mechanical hands will damage the fruit and make it unappealing for supermarket shoppers .
" There are already machines that will pick wine grapes , but the high end wine growers do n’t use them , because they want the quality , " Grossman says .
Farmers do n't seem to share that concern .
The Washington Tree Fruit Commission started investing in the project last year , and Vision Robotics is talking to other agricultural groups with crops ranging from cherries to asparagus .

When my young son comes to the point on Saturdays when he 's supposed to do his chores -- and believe me , he 's hardly in a forced - labor camp -- he sometimes needs adult guidance in how to get the job done .
He complains , he procrastinates , he gets overwhelmed by the tasks at hand until I step in and provide direction .
Hey , he 's nine years old .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) is doing much the same thing with George W. Bush when it comes to his presidential responsibilities .
Pelosi has come under fire from the White House for her trip to Syria to meet with the country 's leaders and to observe the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group , which have been all but ignored by the Bush administration .
â€ œAs recommended by the Iraq Study Group , a bipartisan delegation led by Speaker Pelosi intends to discuss a wide range of security issues affecting the United States and the Middle East with representatives of governments in the region , including Syria , â€ said Pelosi Spokesman Brendan Daly last week .
And nobody is saying that dealing with Syria , from which the U.S. withdrew its ambassador in 2005 , is an easy thing to do .
We 're not exactly what anyone would call fast friends with Damascus and the hard work of negotiating with enemies or potential enemies is not for the weak or intellectually lazy .
Sadly , Bush is both of those things .
Throughout his unfortunate presidency , Bush has shown that he does his best when surrounded by people who give him positive reinforcement , tell him how wonderful he is , deny him nothing and make it easy for him to run from hard work .
Sounds a lot like a child , right ?
So , when it comes to worldwide diplomacy , the new House Speaker has had to step in because we have an executive branch of government led by a man-child who just has no interest in playing well with others .
Bush , Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice have had years to do the right thing and to care for America 's security and prestige in the world by reaching out to all countries and , to paraphrase Sun Tzu , keeping our potential enemies closer than our friends .
They have failed as miserably as they possibly could have .
It ca n't hurt for Pelosi to go to Syria to open a dialog -- as did Senators Chris Dodd and John Kerry in 2006 -- and it can only help show our strength through assertive leadership , and that Democrats are doing what needs to be done in the total absence of coherent foreign policy from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
And talks such as the one Pelosi had with Syrian President Bashar al - Assad have already been fruitful , including discussions about peace with Israel .
" We were very pleased with the reassurances we received from the president ( Assad ) that he was ready to resume the peace process .
He was ready to engage in negotiations ( for ) peace with Israel , " Pelosi said .
" ( Our ) meeting with the president enabled us to communicate a message from prime minister Olmert that Israel was ready to engage in peace talks as well . "
Pelosi was also clear on broaching the subject of Syrian involvement in the Iraq war saying " We called to the attention of the president our concern about fighters crossing the Iraq - Syria border to the detriment of the Iraqi people and our soldiers . "
And , like the parent that she is , Pelosi calmly dealt with criticism from a White House that comes down hard on her for visiting the Middle East , but says nothing about the presence of Republican Congressmen Frank Wolf , Joe Pitts and Robert Aderholt in Syria this week .
" It 's interesting because three of our colleagues , who are all Republicans , were in Syria yesterday and I did n't hear the White House speaking out about that , " Pelosi said Monday .
" I think that it was an excellent idea for them to go .
And I think it 's an excellent idea for us to go , as well . "
Diplomacy and handling the foreign affairs of the world 's only current superpower is n't easy and it's been at our peril that we 've had a White House occupant where , when it comes to the hard work of governing and leading , the best we can hope for is that we 've left the kids alone in the house for the weekend and we 'll come home to find it only slightly trashed .
George W. Bush is a child , a toddler , on the world stage at a time when the American people cannot afford to have things done wrong , or not at all .
Nancy Pelosi is simply stepping up , doing the right thing and showing Bush how a grown - up gets the job done .

How the Internet Came to Be
By Vinton Cerf , as told to Bernard Aboba
The birth of the ARPANET
My involvement began when I was at UCLA doing graduate work from
1967 to 1972 .
There were several people at UCLA at the time
studying under Jerry Estrin , and among them was Stephen Crocker .
Stephen was an old high - school friend , and when he found out
that I wanted to do graduate work in computer science , he
invited me to interview at UCLA .
When I started graduate school , I was originally looking at
multiprocessor hardware and software .
Then a Request For
Proposal came in from the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency , DARPA .
The proposal was about packet switching , and it
went along with the packet - switching network that DARPA was
building .
Several UCLA faculty were interested in the RFP .
Leonard
Kleinrock had come to UCLA from MIT , and he brought with him his
interest in that kind of communications environment .
His thesis
was titled Communication Networks : Stochastic Flow and Delay ,
and he was one of the earliest queuing theorists to examine what
packet - switch networking might be like .
As a result , the UCLA
people proposed to DARPA to organize and run a Network
Measurement Center for the ARPANET project .
This is how I wound up working at the Network Measurement Center
on the implementation of a set of tools for observing the
behavior of the fledgling ARPANET .
The team included Stephen
Crocker ; Jon Postel , who has been the RFC editor from the
beginning ; Robert Braden , who was working at the UCLA computer
center ; Michael Wingfield , who built the first interface to the
Internet for the Xerox Data System Sigma 7 computer , which had
originally been the Scientific Data Systems ( SDS ) Sigma 7 ; and
David Crocker , who became one of the central figures in
electronic mail standards for the ARPANET and the Internet .
Mike
Wingfield built the BBN 1822 interface for the Sigma 7 , running
at 400 Kbps , which was pretty fast at the time .
Around Labor Day in 1969 , BBN delivered an Interface Message
Processor ( IMP ) to UCLA that was based on a Honeywell DDP 516 ,
and when they turned it on , it just started running .
It was
hooked by 50 Kbps circuits to two other sites ( SRI and UCSB ) in
the four - node network : UCLA , Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ) ,
UC Santa Barbara ( UCSB ) , and the University of Utah in Salt Lake
City .
We used that network as our first target for studies of network
congestion .
It was shortly after that I met the person who had
done a great deal of the architecture : Robert Kahn , who was at
BBN , having gone there from MIT .
Bob came out to UCLA to kick
the tires of the system in the long haul environment , and we
struck up a very productive collaboration .
He would ask for
software to do something , I would program it overnight , and we
would do the tests .
One of the many interesting things about the ARPANET packet
switches is that they were heavily instrumented in software , and
additional programs could be installed remotely from BBN for
targeted data sampling .
Just as you use trigger signals with
oscilloscopes , the IMPs could trigger collection of data if you
got into a certain state .
You could mark packets and when they
went through an IMP that was programmed appropriately , the data
would go to the Network Measurement Center .
There were many times when we would crash the network trying to
stress it , where it exhibited behavior that Bob Kahn had
expected , but that others did n't think could happen .
One such
behavior was reassembly lock - up .
Unless you were careful about
how you allocated memory , you could have a bunch of partially
assembled messages but no room left to reassemble them , in which
case it locked up .
People did n't believe it could happen
statistically , but it did .
There were a bunch of cases like
that .
My interest in networking was strongly influenced by my time at
the Network Measurement Center at UCLA .
Meanwhile , Larry Roberts had gone from Lincoln Labs to DARPA ,
where he was in charge of the Information Processing Techniques
Office .
He was concerned that after building this network , we
could do something with it .
So out of UCLA came an initiative to
design protocols for hosts , which Steve Crocker led .
In April 1969 , Steve issued the very first Request For Comment .
He observed that we were just graduate students at the time and
so had no authority .
So we had to find a way to document what we
were doing without acting like we were imposing anything on
anyone .
He came up with the RFC methodology to say , " Please
comment on this , and tell us what you think . "
Initially , progress was sluggish in getting the protocols
designed and built and deployed .
By 1971 there were about
nineteen nodes in the initially planned ARPANET , with thirty
different university sites that ARPA was funding .
Things went
slowly because there was an incredible array of machines that
needed interface hardware and network software .
We had Tenex
systems at BBN running on DEC - 10s , but there were also PDP8s ,
PDP - 11s , IBM 360s , Multics , Honeywell ... you name it .
So you had
to implement the protocols on each of these different
architectures .
In late 1971 , Larry Roberts at DARPA decided that
people needed serious motivation to get things going .
In October
1972 there was to be an International Conference on Computer
Communications , so Larry asked Bob Kahn at BBN to organize a
public demonstration of the ARPANET .
It took Bob about a year to get everybody far enough along to
demonstrate a bunch of applications on the ARPANET .
The idea was
that we would install a packet switch and a Terminal Interface
Processor or TIP in the basement of the Washington Hilton Hotel ,
and actually let the public come in and use the ARPANET , running
applications all over the U.S .
A set of people who are legendary in networking history were
involved in getting that demonstration set up .
Bob Metcalfe was
responsible for the documentation ; Ken Pogran who , with David
Clark and Noel Chiappa , was instrumental in developing an early
ring - based local area network and gateway , which became Proteon
products , narrated the slide show ; Crocker and Postel were
there .
Jack Haverty , who later became chief network architect of
Oracle and was an MIT undergraduate , was there with a holster
full of tools .
Frank Heart who led the BBN project ; David
Walden ; Alex McKenzie ; Severo Ornstein ; and others from BBN who
had developed the IMP and TIP .
The demo was a roaring success , much to the surprise of the
people at AT&T who were skeptical about whether it would work .
At that conference a collection of people convened : Donald
Davies from the UK , National Physical Laboratory , who had been
doing work on packet switching concurrent with DARPA ; Remi
Despres who was involved with the French Reseau Communication
par Paquet ( RCP ) and later Transpac , their commercial X.25
network ; Larry Roberts and Barry Wessler , both of whom later
joined and led BBN's Telenet ; Gesualdo LeMoli , an Italian
network researcher ; Kjell Samuelson from the Swedish Royal
Institute ; John Wedlake from British Telecom ; Peter Kirstein
from University College London ; Louis Pouzin who led the
Cyclades / Cigale packet network research program at the Institute
Recherche d'Informatique et d'Automatique ( IRIA , now INRIA , in
France ) .
Roger Scantlebury from NPL with Donald Davies may also
have been in attendance .
Alex McKenzie from BBN almost certainly
was there .
I 'm sure I have left out some and possibly misremembered others .
There were a lot of other people , at least thirty , all of whom
had come to this conference because of a serious academic or
business interest in networking .
At the conference we formed the International Network Working
Group or INWG .
Stephen Crocker , who by now was at DARPA after
leaving UCLA , did n't think he had time to organize the INWG , so
he proposed that I do it .
I organized and chaired INWG for the first four years , at which
time it was affiliated with the International Federation of
Information Processing ( IFIP ) .
Alex Curran , who was president of
BNR , Inc. , a research laboratory of Bell Northern Research in
Palo Alto , California , was the U.S. representative to IFIP
Technical Committee 6 .
He shepherded the transformation of the
INWG into the first working group of 6 , working group 6.1 ( IFIP
WG 6.1 ) .
In November 1972 , I took up an assistant professorship post in
computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford .
I was
one of the first Stanford acquisitions who had an interest in
computer networking .
Shortly after I got to Stanford , Bob Kahn
told me about a project he had going with SRI International ,
BBN , and Collins Radio , a packet radio project .
This was to get
a mobile networking environment going .
There was also work on a
packet satellite system , which was a consequence of work that
had been done at the University of Hawaii , based on the
ALOHA - Net , done by Norman Abramson , Frank Kuo , and Richard
Binder .
It was one of the first uses of multiaccess channels .
Bob Metcalfe used that idea in designing Ethernet before
founding 3COM to commercialize it .
The birth of the Internet
Bob Kahn described the packet radio and satellite systems , and
the internet problem , which was to get host computers to
communicate across multiple packet networks without knowing the
network technology underneath .
As a way of informally exploring
this problem , I ran a series of seminars at Stanford attended by
students and visitors .
The students included Carl Sunshine , who
is now at Aerospace Corporation running a laboratory and
specializing in the area of protocol proof of correctness ;
Richard Karp , who wrote the first TCP code and is now president
of ISDN technologies in Palo Alto .
There was Judy Estrin , a
founder of Bridge Communications , which merged with 3COM , and is
now an officer at Network Computing Devices ( NCD ) , which makes X
display terminals .
Yogen Dalal , who edited the December 1974
first TCP specification , did his thesis work with this group ,
and went on to work at PARC where he was one of the key
designers of the Xerox Protocols .
Jim Mathis , who was involved
in the software of the small - scale LSI - 11 implementations of the
Internet protocols , went on to SRI International and then to
Apple where he did MacTCP .
Darryl Rubin went on to become one of
the vice presidents of Microsoft .
Ron Crane handled hardware in
my Stanford lab and went on to key positions at Apple .
John
Shoch went on to become assistant to the president of Xerox and
later ran their System Development Division .
Bob Metcalfe
attended some of the seminars as well .
Gerard Lelann was
visiting from IRIA and the Cyclades / Cigale project , and has gone
on to do work in distributed computing .
We had Dag Belsnes from
University of Oslo who did work on the correctness of protocol
design ; Kuninobu Tanno ( from Tohoku University ) ; and Jim Warren ,
who went on to found the West Coast Computer Faire .
Thinking
about computer networking problems has had a powerful influence
on careers ; many of these people have gone on to make major
contributions .
The very earliest work on the TCP protocols was done at three
places .
The initial design work was done in my lab at Stanford .
The first draft came out in the fall of 1973 for review by INWG
at a meeting at University of Sussex ( Septemer 1973 ) .
A paper by
Bob Kahn and me appeared in May 1974 in IEEE Transactions on
Communications and the first specification of the TCP protocol
was published as an Internet Experiment Note in December 1974 .
We began doing concurrent implementations at Stanford , BBN , and
University College London .
So effort at developing the Internet
protocols was international from the beginning .
In July 1975 ,
the ARPANET was transferred by DARPA to the Defense
Communications Agency ( now the Defense Information Systems
Agency ) as an operational network .
About this time , military security concerns became more critical
and this brought Steve Kent from BBN and Ray McFarland from DoD
more deeply into the picture , along with Steve Walker , then at
DARPA .
At BBN there were two other people : William Plummer and Ray
Tomlinson .
It was Ray who discovered that our first design
lacked and needed a three - way handshake in order to distinguish
the start of a new TCP connection from old random duplicate
packets that showed up later from an earlier exchange .
At
University College London , the person in charge was Peter
Kirstein .
Peter had a lot of graduate and undergraduate students
working in the area , using a PDP - 9 machine to do the early work .
They were at the far end of a satellite link to England .
Even at the beginning of this work we were faced with using
satellite communications technology as well as ARPANET and
packet radio .
We went through four iterations of the TCP suite ,
the last of which came out in 1978 .
The earliest demonstration of the triple network Internet was in
July 1977 .
We had several people involved .
In order to link a
mobile packet radio in the Bay Area , Jim Mathis was driving a
van on the San Francisco Bayshore Freeway with a packet radio
system running on an LSI - 11 .
This was connected to a gateway
developed by .i. Internet : history of : Strazisar , Virginia ;
Virginia Strazisar at BBN .
Ginny was monitoring the gateway and
had artificially adjusted the routing in the system .
It went
over the Atlantic via a point - to - point satellite link to Norway
and down to London , by land line , and then back through the
Atlantic Packet Satellite network ( SATNET ) through a Single
Channel Per Carrier ( SCPC ) system , which had ground stations in
Etam , West Virginia , Goonhilly Downs England , and Tanum , Sweden .
The German and Italian sites of SATNET had n't been hooked in
yet .
Ginny was responsible for gateways from packet radio to
ARPANET , and from ARPANET to SATNET .
Traffic passed from the
mobile unit on the Packet Radio network across the ARPANET over
an internal point - to - point satellite link to University College
London , and then back through the SATNET into the ARPANET again ,
and then across the ARPANET to the USC Information Sciences
Institute to one of their DEC KA - 10 ( ISIC ) machines .
So what we
were simulating was someone in a mobile battlefield environment
going across a continental network , then across an
intercontinental satellite network , and then back into a
wireline network to a major computing resource in national
headquarters .
Since the Defense Department was paying for this ,
we were looking for demonstrations that would translate to
militarily interesting scenarios .
So the packets were traveling
94,000 miles round trip , as opposed to what would have been an
800 - mile round trip directly on the ARPANET .
We did n't lose a
bit !
After that exciting demonstration , we worked very hard on
finalizing the protocols .
In the original design we did n't
distinguish between TCP and IP ; there was just TCP .
In the
mid-1970s , experiments were being conducted to encode voice
through a packet switch , but in order to do that we had to
compress the voice severely from 64 Kbps to 1800 bps .
If you
really worked hard to deliver every packet , to keep the voice
playing out without a break , you had to put lots and lots of
buffering in the system to allow sequenced reassembly after
retransmissions , and you got a very unresponsive system .
So
Danny Cohen at ISI , who was doing a lot of work on packet voice ,
argued that we should find a way to deliver packets without
requiring reliability .
He argued it was n't useful to retransmit
a voice packet end to end .
It was worse to suffer a delay of
retransmission .
That line of reasoning led to separation of TCP , which
guaranteed reliable delivery , from IP .
So the User Datagram
Protocol ( UDP ) was created as the user - accessible way of using
IP .
And that 's how the voice protocols work today , via UDP .
Late in 1978 or so , the operational military started to get
interested in Internet technology .
In 1979 we deployed packet
radio systems at Fort Bragg , and they were used in field
exercises .
The satellite systems were further extended to
include ground stations in Italy and Germany .
Internet work
continued in building more implementations of TCP / IP for systems
that were n't covered .
While still at DARPA , I formed an Internet
Configuration Control Board chaired by David Clark from MIT to
assist DARPA in the planning and execution of the evolution of
the TCP / IP protocol suite .
This group included many of the
leading researchers who contributed to the TCP / IP development
and was later transformed by my successor at DARPA , Barry
Leiner , into the Internet Activities Board ( and is now the
Internet Architecture Board of the Internet Society ) .
In 1980 ,
it was decided that TCP / IP would be the preferred military
protocols .
In 1982 it was decided that all the systems on the ARPANET would
convert over from NCP to TCP / IP .
A clever enforcement mechanism
was used to encourage this .
We used a Link Level Protocol on the
ARPANET ; NCP packets used one set of one channel numbers and
TCP / IP packets used another set .
So it was possible to have the
ARPANET turn off NCP by rejecting packets sent on those specific
channel numbers .
This was used to convince people that we were
serious in moving from NCP to TCP / IP .
In the middle of 1982 , we
turned off the ability of the network to transmit NCP for one
day .
This caused a lot of hubbub unless you happened to be
running TCP /IP .
It was n't completely convincing that we were
serious , so toward the middle of fall we turned off NCP for two
days ; then on January 1 , 1983 , it was turned off permanently .
The guy who handled a good deal of the logistics for this was
Dan Lynch ; he was computer center director of USC ISI at the
time .
He undertook the onerous task of scheduling , planning , and
testing to get people up and running on TCP / IP .
As many people
know , Lynch went on to found INTEROP , which has become the
premier trade show for presenting Internet technology .
In the same period there was also an intense effort to get
implementations to work correctly .
Jon Postel engaged in a
series of Bake Offs , where implementers would shoot kamikaze
packets at each other .
Recently , FTP Software has reinstituted
Bake
Offs to ensure interoperability among modern vendor
products .
This takes us up to 1983 .
1983 to 1985 was a consolidation
period .
Internet protocols were being more widely implemented .
In 1981 , 3COM had come out with UNET , which was a UNIX TCP / IP
product running on Ethernet .
The significant growth in Internet
products did n't come until 1985 or so , where we started seeing
UNIX and local area networks joining up .
DARPA had invested time
and energy to get BBN to build a UNIX implementation of TCP / IP
and wanted that ported into the Berkeley UNIX release in v4.2 .
Once that happened , vendors such as Sun started using BSD as the
base of commercial products .
The Internet takes off
By the mid-1980s there was a significant market for
Internet - based products .
In the 1990s we started to see
commercial services showing up , a direct consequence of the
NSFNet initiative , which started in 1986 as a 56 Kbps network
based on LSI - 11s with software developed by David Mills , who was
at the University of Delaware .
Mills called his NSFNet nodes
" Fuzzballs . "
The NSFNet , which was originally designed to hook supercomputers
together , was quickly outstripped by demand and was overhauled
for T1 . IBM , Merit , and MCI did this , with IBM developing the
router software .
Len Bozack was the Stanford student who started
Cisco Systems .
His first client : Hewlett - Packard .
Meanwhile
Proteon had gotten started , and a number of other routing
vendors had emerged .
Despite having built the first gateways
( now called routers ) , BBN did n't believe there was a market for
routers , so they did n't go into competition with Wellfleet , ACC ,
Bridge , 3COM , Cisco , and others .
The exponential growth of the
Internet began in 1986 with the NSFNet .
When the NCP to TCP
transition occurred in 1983 there were only a couple of hundred
computers on the network .
As of January 1993 there are over 1.3
million computers in the system .
There were only a handful of
networks back in 1983 ; now there are over 10,000 .
In 1988 I made a conscious decision to pursue connection of the
Internet to commercial electronic mail carriers .
It was n't clear
that this would be acceptable from the standpoint of federal
policy , but I thought that it was important to begin exploring
the question .
By 1990 , an experimental mail relay was running at
the Corporation for National Research Initiatives ( CNRI ) linking
MCI Mail with the Internet .
In the intervening two years , most
commercial email carriers in the U.S. are linked to Internet and
many others around the world are following suit .
In this same time period , commercial Internet service providers
emerged from the collection of intermediate - level networks
inspired and sponsored by the National Science Foundation as
part of its NSFNet initiatives .
Performance Systems
International ( PSI ) was one of the first , spinning off from
NYSERNet . UUNET Technologies formed Alternet ; Advanced Network
and Systems ( ANS ) was formed by IBM , MERIT , and MCI ( with its
ANS CO+RE commercial subsidiary ) ; CERFNet was initiated by
General Atomics which also runs the San Diego Supercomputer
Center ; JVNCNet became GES , Inc. , offering commercial services ;
Sprint formed Sprintlink ; Infonet offered Infolan service ; the
Swedish PTT offered SWIPNET , and comparable services were
offered in the UK and Finland .
The Commercial Internet eXchange
was organized by commercial Internet service providers as a
traffic transfer point for unrestricted service .
In 1990 a conscious effort was made to link in commercial and
nonprofit information service providers , and this has also
turned out to be useful .
Among others , Dow Jones , Telebase ,
Dialog , CARL , the National Library of Medicine , and RLIN are now
online .
The last few years have seen internationalization of the system
and commercialization , new constituencies well outside of
computer science and electrical engineering , regulatory
concerns , and security concerns from businesses and out of a
concern for our dependence on this as infrastructure .
There are
questions of pricing and privacy ; all of these things are having
a significant impact on the technology evolution plan , and with
many different stakeholders there are many divergent views of
the right way to deal with various problems .
These views have to
be heard and compromises worked out .
The recent rash of books about the Internet is indicative of the
emerging recognition of this system as a very critical
international infrastructure , and not just for the research and
education community .
I was astonished to see the CCITT bring up an Internet node ; the
U.N. has just brought up a node , un.org ; IEEE and ACM are
bringing their systems up .
We are well beyond critical mass now .
The 1990s will continue this exponential growth phase .
The other
scary thing is that we are beginning to see experimentation with
packet voice and packet video .
I fully anticipate that an
Internet TV guide will show up in the next couple of years .
I think this kind of phenomenon is going to exacerbate the need
for understanding the economics of these systems and how to deal
with charging for use of resources .
I hesitate to speculate ;
currently where charges are made they are a fixed price based on
the size of the access pipe .
It is possible that the continuous
transmission requirements of sound and video will require
different charging because you are not getting statistical
sharing during continuous broadcasting .
In the case of
multicasting , one packet is multiplied many times .
Things like
this were n't contemplated when the flat - rate charging algorithms
were developed , so the service providers may have to reexamine
their charging policies .
Concurrent with the exponential explosion in Internet use has
come the recognition that there is a real community out there .
The community now needs to recognize that it exists , that it has
a diversity of interests , and that it has responsibilities to
those who are dependent on the continued health of the network .
The Internet Society was founded in January 1992 .
With
assistance from the Federal Networking Council , the Internet
Society supports the IETF and IAB and educates the broad
community by holding conferences and workshops , by
proselytizing , and by making information available .
I had certain technical ambitions when this project started , but
they were all oriented toward highly flexible , dynamic
communication for military application , insensitive to
differences in technology below the level of the routers .
I have
been extremely pleased with the robustness of the system and its
ability to adapt to new communications technology .
One of the main goals of the project was " IP on everything . "
Whether it is frame relay , ATM , or ISDN , it should always be
possible to bring an Internet Protocol up on top of it .
We've
always been able to get IP to run , so the Internet has satisfied
my design criteria .
But I did n't have a clue that we would end
up with anything like the scale of what we have now , let alone
the scale that it 's likely to reach by the end of the decade .
On scaling
The somewhat embarrassing thing is that the network address
space is under pressure now .
The original design of 1973 and
1974 contemplated a total of 256 networks .
There was only one
LAN at PARC , and all the other networks were regional or
nationwide networks .
We did n't think there would be more than
256 research networks involved .
When it became clear there would
be a lot of local area networks , we invented the concept of
Class A , B , and C addresses .
In Class C there were several
million network IDs .
But the problem that was not foreseen was
that the routing protocols and Internet topology were not well
suited for handling an extremely large number of network IDs .
So
people preferred to use Class B and subnetting instead .
We have
a rather sparsely allocated address space in the current
Internet design , with Class B allocated to excess and Class A
and C allocated only lightly .
The lesson is that there is a complex interaction between
routing protocols , topology , and scaling , and that determines
what Internet routing structure will be necessary for the next
ten to twenty years .
When I was chairman of the Internet Activities Board and went to
the IETF and IAB to characterize the problem , it was clear that
the solution had to be incrementally deployable .
You can deploy
something in parallel , but then how do the new and old
interwork ?
We are seeing proposals of varying kinds to deal with
the problem .
Some kind of backward compatibility is highly
desirable until you can't assign 32 - bit address space .
Translating gateways have the defect that when you 're halfway
through , half the community is transitioned and half is n't , and
all the traffic between the two has to go through the
translating gateway and it's hard to have enough resources to do
this .
It 's still a little early to tell how well the alternatives will
satisfy the requirements .
We are also dealing not only with the
scaling problem , but also with the need not to foreclose
important new features , such as concepts of flows , the ability
to handle multicasting , and concepts of accounting .
I think that as a community we sense varying degrees of pressure
for a workable set of solutions .
The people who will be most
instrumental in this transition will be the vendors of routing
equipment and host software , and the offerers of Internet
services .
It 's the people who offer Internet services who have
the greatest stake in assuring that Internet operation continues
without loss of connectivity , since the value of their service
is a function of how many places you can communicate with .
The
deployability of alternative solutions will determine which is
the most attractive .
So the transition process is very
important .
On use by other networks
The Domain Name System ( DNS ) has been a key to the scaling of
the Internet , allowing it to include non-Internet email systems
and solving the problem of name - to - address mapping in a smooth
scalable way .
Paul Mockapetris deserves enormous credit for the
elegant design of the DNS , on which we are still very dependent .
Its primary goal was to solve the problems with the host .
txt
files and to get rid of centralized management .
Support for Mail
eXchange ( MX ) was added after the fact , in a second phase .
Once you get a sufficient degree of connectivity , it becomes
more advantageous to link to this highly connected thing and
tunnel through it rather than to build a system in parallel .
So
BITNET , FidoNet , AppleTalk , SNA , Novell IPX , and DECNet
tunneling are a consequence of the enormous connectivity of the
Internet .
The Internet has become a test bed for development of other
protocols .
Since there was no lower level OSI infrastructure
available , Marshall Rose proposed that the Internet could be
used to try out X.400 and X.500 .
In RFC 1006 , he proposed that
we emulate TP0 on top of TCP , and so there was a conscious
decision to help higher - level OSI protocols to be deployed in
live environments before the lower - level protocols were
available .
It seems likely that the Internet will continue to be the
environment of choice for the deployment of new protocols and
for the linking of diverse systems in the academic , government ,
and business sectors for the remainder of this decade and well
into the next .

Cat dander has become a complete puzzle , with some studies finding that exposure early in life leads to asthma , and others saying it protects against asthma .
At this point , nobody knows which study to believe , but most experts agree that when people already have asthma , being around cats can make it worse .
Under some of the theories , I should have had the world ’s worst asthma .
Clearly , I had allergic tendencies , and the experts would have shuddered at my environment .
I grew up in New York in a small apartment with parents who were heavy smokers , on a busy street with trucks rumbling by and a bus stop in front of the door .
Buildings all around us burned coal .
At times , we had a dog , a cat , parakeets and , briefly , a duck .
It ’s amazing that the pets survived the smoke .
My mother was a decent housekeeper , but she would n’t have won any prizes .
I never wheezed .
Go figure .
Obesity and asthma have also been linked in some studies , but the link , if it exists , is not understood .
Researchers say it is simply not a matter of asthmatic children growing fat because they cannot exercise .
The weight gain can be first .
Nutrition is another mystery .
Studies of fruits , vegetables , cereals , fatty acids , vitamins , minerals and antioxidants have been inconclusive , and little is known about the effects from what pregnant women eat .
Experiments in which pregnant women avoided cow ’s milk and eggs in hopes of preventing asthma in their infants did not work , and breast - feeding does n’t prevent the disease , either .
One theory that has received attention recently is the “ hygiene hypothesis , ” the idea that children today are raised in homes that are too clean and that asthma is somehow caused by the lack of exposure to infections and bits of microbes early in life .
Under this theory , germs are supposed to help the immune system develop normally , and without them the system may overreact to other substances in the environment , producing allergies and asthma .
There is some evidence to support the idea .
Studies find that children raised on farms are less prone than others to asthma , maybe because they are exposed to plenty of microbes in barns and stables .
But the connection is still not fully understood , and some viral infections clearly make asthma worse .
A related idea is that the increased use of antibiotics in recent decades contributes to asthma by changing the type of the bacteria that live in the gut .
But that has not been proved .
Some researchers have suggested that acetaminophen , used to treat pain and fever , may be linked to asthma .
Its use increased in the 1980s , after pediatricians declared aspirin unsafe for children .
But that theory has not been proved , either .

This is a basic overview of various possible languages that we could move to , for Bugzilla .
Please put discussion on the discussion page .
This page is only for technical pros and cons of each language from the perspective of Bugzilla .
Of all of the ones I ( mkanat ) have used , I 'm most in favor of Ruby as a language , because I think it'd be the fastest to write code in and it seems well - designed for writing large applications .
That does n't necessarily mean it has the best frameworks or libraries available .
In addition to looking at the languages themselves , we should also investigate various tookits available for the languages that would make our development easier .
For example , Python has Pylons and lots of other frameworks , and Ruby has Rails and Nitro .
If one particular language has a framework that would be perfect for us , that could swing the decision .
The existance of this page does not mean that Bugzilla is abandoning Perl .
This is only some research being done , and it may or may not ever happen ( and consensus among the developers currently says it wo n't , but the discussion is probably worth having anyway ) .
Primary Considerations in Picking a Language
1. Ease of Development :
We want to rapidly create new features and not have to wory about little details .
2. Ease of Modification :
We want to be able to change the code without too much work .
The more " abstraction " opportunities a language or framework offers , the better off we are .
3. Performance :
It should n't perform significantly worse than current Bugzilla code .
4. Available libraries :
We do n't want to have to re-write the things that we 're using now from CPAN .
We also want libraries generally available or built - in to the language that we can use in the future .
5. i18n and l10n : We want to be able to easily localize Bugzilla in different languages without people having to re-write the templates like they do now .
Anything supporting GNU Gettext in an easy way would be great .
6. Security : Perl has a Taint mode , which encourages security .
We want a language that has good security - oriented features , and that has a community with a history of paying attention to security issues .
7. Enforcement of Good Code :
One place where Perl falls down is that it does n't enforce any good coding standards .
A language that does would be welcome .
Frameworks Under Investigation
This lists the particular frameworks that we 're actually considering .
Perl with Catalyst DBIx : : Class for ORM .
Perl with CGI :: Application Easy short - term goal , stepping stone towards Frameworks like Catalyst , Maypole , Jifty , etc
Ruby with Rails Also investigate Hobo .
Want to look at Globalize for i18n .
Python with Pylons Using SQLAlchemy Mako for templating , or use the upcoming Python TT port .
Examine ToscaWidgets and FormEncode Possibility of using AuthKit
PHP with CakePHP
The " serious PHP framework " space it boiling down to one of two these days - Symfony , which yahoo !
have used or Zend 's Framework which has serious backers like IBM ( financially and contributing manpower I believe )
Pros/Cons of Individual Languages
This section goes over the various advantages and disadvantages of the languages themselves , from Bugzilla 's perspective .
Perl
Pros
Lots of modules available in CPAN .
They are very well tested due to distributed test system .
Anybody can participate in testing .
Relatively fast .
mod_perl is very mature and extremely fast .
Would make us not have to port , avoiding possible Second System Effect and making any transitions ( such as to a web framework ) easier .
Excellent Unicode handling .
Excellent regex support .
Core is actively developed but not released as often as Python and Ruby .
PAR can create standalone executables .
Moose allows complex class definitions , though it is n't part of Perl itself .
Cons
See The Problems of Perl .
Private Methods are n't well supported require additional scaffolding .
Multiple Inheritance can be problematic in extreme edge cases .
Certain elements of syntax can be confusing for new users , by long experience in training new Perl users :
The difference between ( ) and [ ] .
The fact that %var is a ( ) ( which is also the array notation ) but {} is $var .
The fact that subroutine arguments are n't really subroutine arguments , they 're just an array that gets passed to a function .
( This also brings up confusion on the difference between using $ _[ 1 ] , my $var = shift , and my ( $var ) = @_. )
The fact that $ hash { ' key'} and $ hash{key} are the same . qq [ ] is a string ( as is qq{} , etc. ) , q [ ] is a string , though qw ( ) is an array .
& sub ( ) is resolved at runtime but sub ( ) is resolved at compile time , except for methods .
The conversions from one type to another can sometimes be horrendous to read .
Eg : [ keys %{ @{ $ var } } ] . $ $ foo [ 1 ] and $ foo - > [ 1 ] mean the same thing .
That numbers are compared with " == " but strings are compared with " eq " , even though in other places strings are interpreted as numbers if used numerically .
Figuring out what 's $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 , etc. from a regex result .
And the fact that $ 1 and $ 2 do n't get reset if there 's no match .
Perl 5.10 will have named captures .
That Perl errors are in $ @ but system errors are in $ ! , and when to use which one .
That Perl does n't really have a class system , it just has a package system with @ISA or " use base , " " bless , " and SUPER : :.
That " my ( $var ) = @_ " will get you the first item of the array , but " my $ var = @_ " will get you a number .
In a hash created with ( ) , if you accidentally have invalid items , you have an invalid hash .
That is , you can't really do %hash = ( key1 => $ cgi -> param ( ' unset_param ' ) , key2 => ' something ' ) , because then you 'll actually just have an invalid hash .
( key1 will equal " key2 " and " something " wo n't even have a real value . )
In general it 's safer to always make hashrefs when in doubt .
In array context , $ cgi -> param ( ' value ' ) returns an empty list if " value " was n't passed to the CGI .
It does n't return undef .
This is why we have " scalar $ cgi -> param ( ) " all over the code .
Perl6
Pros
Implements many features we'd like to have that Perl5 does n't have .
Would be the easiest language to port our current code to , since it 's so similar to Perl5 .
Cons
Essentially vaporware .
There is an interpreter written for it , but it's in Haskell and it's not very popular yet .
Perl 6 is still very punctuation - heavy and very influenced by Perl 5 .
Python
Pros
Quite popular .
Stable .
Actively developed .
Quite a lot of modules ( but fewer than CPAN )
Cons
Not having curly - braces on " if " statements and other blocks makes it hard to figure out where you are in the block structure without a special editor to help ( like Komodo ) .
Poor Unicode handling -- strings are ASCII by default , and are Unicode only if you prepend them with u , like u" string " .
No standard way of installing modules like CPAN .
( Cheeseshop and easy_install exist , but they 're not universally standard . )
Python has no equivalent to Perl 's " taint " mode .
Sometimes has unclear error messages .
Basically only compiler error message is " syntax error "
Python lacks variable declarations , which means that invalid variables are caught at runtime instead of compile - time .
The " you need to upgrade the whole of python " problem with applications that require or use newer libraries .
Does n't use OS threads , so individual python programs can't take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor systems .
Lacks any type declarations ( can make code more verbose , as more tests for data validity need to be done in the code . )
Ruby
Pros
Extremely modern language , lots of great features built - in to the language .
RubyGems , a CPAN - like method of installing modules .
Becoming more and more popular .
Very easy to learn , development is very natural and very fast .
Very actively developed .
Has a taint mode , just like Perl .
Cons
Not yet as well - known as Perl and other languages ( lacks the large userbase of Perl , Python , or PHP )
Not installed by default in most distros or in hosting services
Good Unicode handling is n't coming out until 1.9 , but that 's the next release .
Performance is apparently considerably slower than Python ( something like 2 - 3 x ) .
Interesting Blog Post About Ruby Cons
Java
Pros
Excellent " design by contract " features ( compared to the other languages in this listing ) .
Very stable .
Fast .
Popular , although more in Enterprise apps and less in Open Source than scripting languages .
Allows for easy web application installation .
Adopted by many enterprises .
Strongly typed language .
This makes it easier to detect errors before runtime .
Secure .
Policy files can be used to control what the JVM is allowed to do on yur system .
Cons
Generally slower to write in than scripting languages .
Nothing like CPAN 's client - side module installer until Java 7 ( see JSR 277 ) .
The standard Java Classpath is not FOSS , but Sun 's OpenJDK is .
Code is sometimes is more verbose than in other languages .
Java 5 improves on this .
PHP 5 or 6
May be worth investigating PHP :: Interpreter
Pros
Extremely popular
Easy to setup / get hosting
Basically fast
mod_php is basically intrinsically as fast as mod_perl
Decent object - oriented features
There is no " Higher Order PHP " that only experienced hackers can understand .
Cons
Lacks strict ( variables ) mode Note : Enabling PHP E_NOTICE error messages ( e.g. in php.ini ) does something similar .
But PHP security is an issue ( many gotchas for the inexperienced ) - a framework could help a lot here
Lacks a taint mode .
Not historically designed for applications in the classic sense , but rather focused on scripting .
( This also affects its reputation with application programmers . )
Charset encoding is not yet well supported ( PHP6 should solve this )
PHP is more focused on writing web pages than being a general - purpose language .
( Might not be as good for our command - line scripts . )
mod_php is stateless and can't store data beyond a single request , but we do n't do that now in Bugzilla anyway .
It also parses all program for every request , unless an accelerator such as APC or eAccelerator is installed .
No separate comparison operators for strings and numbers , so to be sure operators like ' === ' , strval and intval are required .
Too many different functions for one purpose
No namespace support .
D Programming Language
D
Pros
Can compile to native code as fast as C++'s
Language support for " Design by Contract "
GPL implementation ( gdc )
Native Unicode character support
Easy to learn
Can do Imperative / OOP / TMP programming paradigms
Under active development
Enthusiastic user community
Cons
Not as well known as other languages
Tool support is n't as comprehensive
Not as many libraries available
C #
I hear lots of good things about C# , but I 've never actually worked with it .
Maybe somebody else could fill this in ?
I 'm be slightly wary of it , since the Windows .NET stack will probably always be ahead of Mono ( the * nix . NET stack ) , and thus the language is essentially controlled by Microsoft .
The media circus surrounding this sad , sad story has pained me , so I really needed this .
While the Bush administration is using the New York Times again to sell dubious claims about why we need to attack another middle eastern country , our entire media establishment ( with rare exception ) has morphed into the 24 - hour National Enquirer Network .
It 's Jon-Benet all over again .
You just gotta love these politically expedient stories .

Life Without Cars
Are n't cars great ?
In the last sixty years , we 've built such a great network of roads and service stations and restaurants that whenever you feel like it , you can get into your car and drive and drive and drive and ...
Oh , no time ?
Got to fly .
Between motels and gas prices and all , it 's cheaper anyway , when you 've got any real distance to travel .
So what 's this car for ?
Oh , yeah -- to commute to work , because there are no trains any more , no streetcars , the buses only run once an hour and they do n't go anywhere near home or work , and what if I have to work late ?
And errands .
Kids go to lessons , practices , games , movies , parties , play dates .
Grocery store .
WalMart Target K - Mart .
Home Depot , Barnes & Noble .
Starbucks Chick - Fil - A McDonalds P.F.Chang .
Blockbuster .
And , of course , to the gas station to fill up for the next day 's driving .
Anything we want to do , anywhere we want to go , we have to get into the car .
Thank heaven for the Internet , so we can order stuff without having to find a parking place .
Went downtown the other day -- it felt weird .
Like a mall without a roof .
Only it was mostly banks and parking garages now .
Very few stores that were open and selling anything .
Vast empty sidewalks , except the homeless people .
Downtown is more of a museum .
How we used to live .
Real life : the mall .
The strip center .
The big box store .
And parking lots as far as the eye can see .
Our life regulated by stripes marking the parking places .
Shopping carts so we can make the long trek back to the far end of the parking lot and fill the back of our SUV with stuff we had to drive to get .
On the Sabbath , drive to church .
On the weekend , drive somewhere to get away from it all -- and park the car between the same white lines we left behind at every store back home .
How Did We Get Here ?
Cars were fun , but people in the city did n't actually need them .
There were streetcars and subways and elevated railways in the big cities ; in smaller cities , you simply walked or rode a bus .
But we wanted to move out of the city .
Get away from the crowds , to a place where we could have estates with vast lawns and woods like the rich people .
OK , so we could n't afford an estate .
But we 'd buy enough land to pretend .
None of these houses butting right up against the sidewalk -- we'd have lawns and trees !
Patios !
Meanwhile , the government set about boosting the automobile industry by building a vast network of roads .
Gradually , the purpose of local government ( besides ruining education , of course ) was to redesign our cities so that cars could get everywhere and do everything .
Want to build a store ?
Ca n't do it unless you comply with the parking requirements .
Stores have to be separated from each other , set far back from the street , and supplied with vast stretches of parking places .
And while we 're zoning , let 's protect property values by making sure that neighborhoods consist of houses of comparable value and lot - size .
And let 's make sure everybody gets quiet streets and cul - de - sacs , so we 'll wind the streets around until you can't actually tell where you are or how neighborhoods fit together .
We got our wish .
We no longer live in cities .
We do n't live in towns .
We do n't live in the country , either .
We do n't live anywhere at all .
Just island neighborhoods in splendid isolation , with roads so convoluted that half our driving is just to get out of the island and onto a road that goes somewhere .
You want to take a walk ?
No sidewalks in most places , and nowhere to walk to .
You just walk around looking at other people 's yards and houses .
The only people you see are the other walkers -- or the yard guys working on other people 's lawns and shrubs .
You 're at WalMart .
You want to go to Home Depot .
You can see it from where you are , but please do n't be stupid and try to walk there .
Our streets hate pedestrians .
You have to walk all the way out to the street -- or cut through prickly hedges or climb fences .
Nobody is ever required to provide pedestrian access .
Lots of parking and strict rules about turn lanes and such .
But if you just want to walk from store to store , unless they 're in the same shopping complex , you can't get there .
Was this what we wanted ?
Some of us , sure .
Some people love their cars .
Some people hate the idea of walking on their errands , breathing all that ... oxygen .
Some people want to live on an island and hardly see anybody except on television .
Some people want to drive to work , every day , the same route , the same parking hassles , hours and hours and hours of stepping on the gas , the brake , the gas , flipping the signal , turning the wheel .
There 's Another Way
But here and there , a new generation of planners are recreating what we once had , and threw away .
Neighborhoods that are part of a town or city .
Homes that provide access for pedestrians to get somewhere quickly and actually do something without ever having to get into a car .
I recently read a book called Suburban Nation : The Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream .
The authors ( Andrews Duany , Elizabeth Plater - Zyberk , and Jeff Speck ) lay down the principles of the life many of us -- maybe most of us -- wish we were living .
A life that is n't lived inside these tiny moving hovels we call cars .
Narrow streets with sidewalks on both sides .
When people are parked at the curb , cars can't pass each other going both ways .
So cars go very slowly and the drivers are constantly alert .
( Same traffic speeds as cul - de - sacs , in fact . )
No collisions .
Nobody gets run over .
Kids on bikes do n't get hit .
In fact , pedestrians and bikers and skaters act like they own the street .
Because they do .
Yards are small .
A patch of lawn , a garden .
But they 're pretty .
Alleys hold the garbage cans and the garages or parking places so the street stays clean .
Children walk to school .
Adults walk to stores that are only a few blocks away .
Nobody lives more than three short blocks from a bus stop or other public transportation , and because so many people use public transit , the buses come frequently ; you never wait more than fifteen minutes during the peak times .
During that waiting time , or while riding the bus or train , people read or listen to recordings or -- get this -- talk to each other .
People meet their neighbors because they 're not all locked inside metal - and - plastic shacks moving down the street .
You pass each other going to and from schools and stores and work .
Not only that , but the houses are n't all alike .
There are multi-family dwellings , there are apartments over the stores .
Some houses are bigger , some smaller .
In fact , the neighborhood is designed so that people from every walk of life ( except , of course , the very rich , whom nobody likes anyway ) see each other and even talk to each other every day .
What happens to property values in small - yard , narrow - street , pedestrian - oriented , mixed - use neighborhoods like this ?
They soar .
Houses sell and apartments get rented instantly .
Because people love to live this way .
Imagine ... spending three days in a row without getting in your car one time , not because it's in the shop and you 're trapped at home , but because you live in a town , a village , a neighborhood that is n't a desert island with yards .
You live in a human community .
You live in the neighborhood of Dandelion Wine and you do n't have to spend your days steering between white lines .
Why We Need to Get Cars Under Control
How ironic .
We redesigned our living patterns and got rid of public transportation so that we could boost the American automobile industry .
Now we are forced to pay huge taxes to Iran , Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , and other oil - producing countries -- and we 're buying half our cars from Japan and Germany and Korea .
Even if you do n't want to live in the neighborhood I described , there are compelling reasons for us to cut way back on the number of hours we spend on the road in cars :
1. Stop Funding Our Enemies .
As long as we 're burning oil to buy groceries that used to be in the corner store and to take the kids to games and lessons that used to take place in neighborhoods and to get to work that we used to get to by bus or train , there 's going to be a vast pool of oil money from which the sponsors of terrorism can draw .
2. Get Back That Wasted Time .
If you cut your driving hours in half , how much time would you get back every day , to use on things you want to do ?
Even if all you want to do is veg out in front of the television , that 's your choice .
It 's a lot better than spending that time driving .
For a lot of us , though , that would be an hour to spend with spouse and children .
Goofing off .
Talking .
Visiting with friends .
Going out to eat , or cooking a real sit - down meal at home .
Having a life .
2. Saving Lives .
In 2005 , 43,200 people died on American highways .
( John Crawley , " U.S. traffic deaths hit 16 - year high in 2005 , " Reuters , 20 April 2006 . )
If we were fighting a war in which 40,000 people died every year and it had gone on that way for the past twenty years , would n't you join the anti-war movement ?
And this is a war in which the victims are children , teenagers , elderly people , adults in their prime .
Men and women in equal numbers .
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for people from 4 through 33 years old .
If the American people drove only half the number of miles every year , it 's reasonable to assume that the death rate would also be cut in half .
But we might save even more lives than that .
People do n't die randomly -- they die because of drunks , reckless teenagers , sleepy drivers , stressed - out drivers in a rage , and drivers so desperate not to be driving that they 're trying to do something else at the same time .
If we drove half the number of hours , the quality of our driving would likely improve .
If our kids could get somewhere without cars , we could save their lives by not letting them drive when they 're still so immature they endanger themselves and everyone else .
If all drinkers walked to and from the bar , it would save 16,000 lives a year from alcohol - caused accidents .
How many of you personally knew someone who died in a car crash ?
How many of you have friends or family members whose lives were torn apart by a traffic death or deaths ?
Why do we continue to allow our governments to require businesses and builders to follow rules that force us to spend our lives in cars ?
3. A Tax on the Poor .
Not that anyone cares -- if we worried about taxing the poor , we would n't have government lotteries -- but remember that because we design our cities so that you can't function without owning at least one car , the working poor have to spend a huge portion of their income on gasoline and car costs .
Since the poor are barely taxed , income tax cuts will never help the poor .
The tax cut they need is to be able to live and work without cars .
Right now , we systematically oppress the poor with our zoning laws .
We require that neighborhoods consist of housing that is approximately alike , so the poor are isolated and forced to live far from everyone else .
We pretend we are n't doing it , but the isolation of the poor may contribute more than we realize to crime rates in low - income neighborhoods .
As isolated poor neighborhoods become more crime - ridden , retail business moves farther and farther away .
Rich people who own and run businesses move their worksites close to their own island neighborhoods .
As a result , the poor are actually farther from any chance of employment , and therefore need cars more desperately , than the middle class .
Mixed neighborhoods within walking distance of retail and with good , subsidized public transit would be like giving the poor a huge tax cut -- because they could live without cars .
4. Oil Is Not Forever .
I know , the eco-alarmists have been warning us of the collapse of oil for so long that mentioning the topic puts us to sleep .
But that 's because they overclaimed .
The fact is , most of the easy - to - reach oil is gone .
We 're already extracting the dregs .
People who are as insanely religious about capitalism as the eco-alarmists are about the environment make stupid promises :
" The free market will take care of the oil problem , because when gas prices rise high enough , alternate energy sources will become profitable . "
What they do n't mention is that there is no guarantee that alternative sources can do the job in time .
If there is a global economic collapse during the transition , then the free market cannot make alternative energy or anything else profitable .
We can only make drastic changeovers in a time of surpluses .
Anybody who thinks the " free market " will always guarantee surpluses understands neither the market nor history .
It is strict government oversight that has softened the economic booms and busts that used to devastate us ; the free market is perfectly happy to collapse under stress and leave us eating acorns .
The surest way to avoid economic ruin when the oil runs out is to need less of it .
Not by absurd government regulations that amount to making wishes , but by stopping the government regulations that force us to use our cars far more than we really want to .
5. Parking Lot Land .
Drive around and look at what we 've done to our beautiful land .
Because we wanted to live in park - like neighborhoods with grass and trees , we have paved over the landscape .
Most of the time , most of those parking lots do nothing at all :
They 're just sitting there , waiting for cars that only show up during peak times -- basically , a few hours each day during the Christmas shopping season .
If we used public transit or walked to do our shopping , we could build on that land .
We could have far more compact neighborhoods , making it all the more possible to do our living and shopping within easy walking distance .
6. Air Pollution .
We 'd all be healthier without cars pumping poisons into the air .
7. Exercise .
If we actually used our legs to get from place to place , instead of cars , we'd get plenty of exercise without having to set aside special time to do it .
Our kids would be vastly healthier ( besides being not - killed - in - car - crashes ) .
8. Making Al Gore Happy .
He did n't get to be President .
Now he believes in the religion of Global Warming .
CO 2 probably has nothing to do with global temperature trends , but if we cut our driving in half , CO 2 levels will go down , and when the next natural cooling cycle comes , Al will think he saved the world .
Can We Actually Do It ?
Politics and the free market got us where into the oil - burning , car - trapped mess we 're in .
But if we reversed government policies and started encouraging carless or low - car neighborhoods , we already know that people flock to such neighborhoods wherever they exist , and property values rise .
If we were allowed to create real towns and cities again , following the living patterns humans have chosen for themselves for thousands of years , it would be profitable and it would cut down oil consumption while raising productivity and freeing up resources for consumers to buy more .
It can't be done by half - measures .
Greensboro 's many pathetic attempts at reviving downtown provide case studies in failure .
It takes intelligent cooperation between government , business , and developers to create walking neighborhoods -- but it can be done at no greater cost than the destructive patterns that zoning laws force on us right now .
It also takes a public that is sick to death of living in cars instead of our homes , of having our children and young people die at a rate that would be intolerable in war , of being held hostage to enemy nations .
But if we make it a noble national cause to change our living patterns so we can drive less than half as much as we do now , we could absolutely transform our cities and towns -- and our lives -- in a decade .
The amount of time it took us to change from vinyl to cds .
From VHS to DVD .
From station wagons to minivans to SUVs .
From one bathroom to two bathrooms .
We are still a rich society .
We can afford to change -- and if we do change , we can stay rich .
Indeed , we can be both richer and fairer as a result of these changes .
Next week , I 'll explore some of the things that would allow us to transform our cities -- starting with the reinvention of the neighborhood store .

" Boredom is what boring people feel . "
So goes the parental adage used against restless offspring .
If true , then ours is a nation of very boring people .
You 're stuck in an instant that appears to be an eternity , but it appears to be a bad eternity
Dr Lars Svendsen on boredom
Volunteers sought for Mars test
It 's almost as if we have been conditioned to endure boredom , with ever - lengthening commutes and working hours .
It has been blamed for all manner of ills , from stress and infidelity to obesity and overspending .
And now 12 volunteers will be locked in an isolation tank for 17 months to simulate a trip to Mars for the European Space Agency .
Killing time
But like all bosses , the agency 's Dr Thu Jennifer Ngo - Anh hopes to keep her employees too busy - in this case maintaining the module and preparing scientific research - to be bored .
But they will be surrounded by the same faces - and in the same place , doing the same things - day in and day out .
" They have to be mentally capable of enduring that .
Part of why we 're doing this is to find people that will endure the whole programme , " she says .
What is boredom ?
It seems hard to imagine that a trip to Mars could be boring , However the same cannot be said of spending the equivalent time pretending to do this journey .
Dr Lars Svendsen , author of A Philosophy of Boredom , says there is more than one type of boredom .
Nothing to do , nowhere to go
So rather than complain about feeling bored , should we celebrate our ability to endure it and regard this as a valuable skill in a job market increasingly dominated by carrying out repetitive tasks ad nauseum ?
Dr Svendsen thinks not , being no fan of the emotion .
" You 're stuck in an instant that appears to be an eternity , but it appears to be a bad eternity , and there seems to be virtually no escape .
You ca n't just say ' I do n't want to be bored now ' . "
But there is no easy way to grasp the concept of boredom , because it " does n't really have any qualities " , he says .
Asked for a definition , he pauses before offering , " a lack of personal meaning " .
Human touch
Dr Richard Ralley , of Edge Hill University , is currently researching how boredom affects people , to determine whether some personality types cope better than others .
Sound familiar ?
" I 'm bored , there 's nothing on TV "
" But quite obviously what humans want is social interactivity - so parents would be better off taking their children on a picnic than to a theme park .
And with the internet , people want to engage with each other - that 's where the blogs and the chatrooms came from .
The other stuff is seen as nerdy now . "
Perhaps the astronauts , and those who will simulate their voyage , can learn from oil rig workers , many of whom endure weeks of isolation in remote locations .
Jake Molloy , general secretary of the rig workers ' union OILC , says that boredom can be a problem .
" If you go to some of the older installations there is very little to do .
You just have to sit and read a book in the evenings . "
But there is no special training for his workers to deal with the psychological effects of isolation and boredom , despite it being part of the job description .
" You 've just got to learn to fit in .
If you are in any way easily upset or offended , or have a short fuse , then you should n't get into the industry .
There are a lot of people who just can't cope . "
So , excitable , voluble types need not apply .
Yet that is exactly who turns out every year for Big Brother , the reality TV equivalent of the Mars simulation .
But the volunteers - and the eventual astronauts - will not have recourse to copious amounts of alcohol , the favoured boredom tonic of the housemates .
They will just have to find their own solution .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Boredom is really a form of over - excitement , where your mind has too much energy - and so you feel you want to do something - but is finding it difficult to focus the energy .
Sometimes this is through lack of interest in what is around , but generally because you 've become over - passive and let your mind run wherever it likes .
To counter it , you just have to place your attention on something , and replace it when it moves , until your mind settles .
Concentrate !

Andrew has it right .
How many people read on public transport these days compared to 20 years ago ?
Many of the problems occur in childhood where nowadays children demand constant provision of things to watch and do .
When I was a kid ( and I 'm only 25 so not some old crusty ) I used to read by myself for hours .
I 'd while away whole weekends playing with friends or by myself re-enacting scenes from the aforementioned books .
I 'll admit I also spent a lot of time failing to shoot birds with a hand - made bamboo bow and arrow .
I watched TV occasionally , but usually only for limited times .
We 'd never eat food in front of the TV so at mealtimes we always talked to each other .
Maybe it is the decline of these values over time that adds to our propensity to boredom as well as dysfunctional families .

I am astonished to hear that boredom is just the " second most commonly suppressed emotion at work " .
What is the first then ?
Am I missing something here ?

I was a submariner for may years and can vouch for the boredom factor .
A three month patrol will stretch the most interesting individual 's patience .
The type of trip the scientists are describing would probably be similar to my own experiences .
Long hours , confined spaces , same faces and no contact with home .
Submariners spend their life trying to avoid boredom , maybe the scientists should talk to the Navy ?
John Hayzen - Smith , Northamptonshire
A desire for instant or near - instant gratification is an obvious cause of boredom in many - an inability to find out how a book develops ; to hear a piece of music through to its end ; to give oneself enough space without distractions to think interesting thoughts .
Witness the free newspapers advertising themselves on the strength that they are " lite " .
Or the MTV videos that change shot twice a second .
I have no evidence for making the claim , but have a gut feeling that the more we limit our capacity to wait , to think , to anticipate , to discover , the greater is our propensity for boredom .
Andrew , Bromley
What a pointless exercise .
If they want to see the effects of being locked up for days / weeks / months / years , go and study a group of prisoners - they 've gone through it all .
We have 80,000 of them who would probably be glad of a little distraction from the mind - numbing life of being locked up .
Trevor , London
I can truthfully say that I never get bored .
There are always more things that I want to do than I have time to do , and even when I have to sit and wait for a train or a bus , I can always occupy my mind with planning what I 'm going to do next .
Boredom is totally inexplicable in a world with so much possibility all around us .

This is a PR stunt .
All this work on the psychological effects of boredom has already been done by the military .
British Antarctic Expedition have already done the work on selecting appropriate individuals .
Big Brother merely does the diametric opposite of their recommendations .
Stuee , Bristol
The people chosen will probably be ok as they will be intelligent , highly educated and , unless suffering from personal problems or prone to depression , will be happy and satisfied thinking interesting thoughts .

I 've often heard people say they are dreading retirement as they fear boredom .
Why ?
How can you be bored when you can choose what to do with your time ?
It does n't cost money to find plenty of things to do .
Boredom is being dictated to by an employer or more often these days by the programme writer of whatever computer system you are using .
Roll on retirement .
I wonder how many people find their paid employment interesting ?
There is so much tedious , repetitive and boring work that needs doing , someone has to do it so getting a more interesting job is n't always an option even for the well educated .
Linda , Aberystwyth , Wales
I only clicked on this story cos I was bored .
Now I wish I had n't , as it was a very boring story .
I 'm bored .
David Gow , Nottingham
Why is there no recourse to alcohol ?
I can see that alcohol in moderation would work very well to oil the wheels of social interaction .
After all it's not going to destroy the spaceship and so long as people do n't consume more than the equivalent earth - bound daily amount it 's not going to harm them any more than they would do to themselves .
If you ask me it 's political correctness gone too far , you can ban smoking , you can ban drinking , you can ban chocolate and driving and in fact anything else that might make your life vaguely interesting , and what are you left with ?
Boredom .

I think it would be absolutely mind - numbing , I spent nine hours waiting in Heathrow for a flight and that has shops and TVs and I was bored to the point of exasperation .
Joe Jones , UK
I have a very active 16 month old toddler who gets me up at 6 am and keeps me busy pre and post work till about 8.30 pm .
To me there 's now no such thing as boredom as I cherish every bit of quiet time to myself staring into space when I 'm not on the move and I can think straight .
Oh for nine hours to myself at Heathrow or anywhere .

Tens of thousands of bright children in the poorest parts of England and Wales are being let down by schools that fail to nurture their talent , a leading government adviser has warned Tony Blair .
Sir Cyril Taylor , chairman of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust , said those who opposed spending more time and money on gifted and talented children held an ' anti-elitist ideology ' that would hold back the economy .
' We are wasting our talent , ' said Taylor , who this week will present a report to the government recommending a 20 - fold increase in spending on very able children , to £ 100 m .
' Many gifted children from socially disadvantaged areas are not realising their potential , not becoming role models in their local communities and not contributing as much to the economy as they could . '
In his report Taylor will recommend that the names of the 30,000 children aged 11 who have been identified as ' gifted and talented ' by their standard attainment tests ( Sats ) should be sent to top universities , including Oxford and Cambridge , arguing that pupils can then be targeted earlier to maximise their chance of getting a place .
He will also call for the children to get places at summer schools , extra classes at weekends , online training , and the chance to be taught in ' sets ' that separate children by ability .
Children who were exceptionally gifted had a ' special educational need ' , said Taylor , and deserved extra support like those with learning and physical disabilities .
His recommendations will be sent to Lord Adonis , the Schools Minister , who is already looking at giving schools credits to spend on their most able pupils .
Taylor said critics of the plans were egalitarians , who believed in a ' one size fits all ' approach , and those who feared selection through the back door .
' Every child is different , ' he said .
' There should be equal opportunities for all , not a lowest common denominator approach . '
He said he supported comprehensive education and that his recommendations would not mean a return to selection because the ' talent search ' would happen after children had received their places in secondary schools .
' The nurturing of our very able children is not only in this country 's economic self - interest but also a matter of social justice - to ensure that every child , whatever their social background , achieves the potential of which they are capable , ' he writes in the report .
' It is not about elitism . '
Taylor has included new research from Professor David Jesson of York University that showed only 28 per cent of pupils identified as gifted and talented in 1999 went on to achieve their expected three ' A ' grades at A - level .
However , Jesson pointed out that many teenagers not highlighted as very able did achieve top grades , and warned that pupils not picked out at primary school should not be neglected .
' That is why it is important that [ identifying pupils as talented ] is not a one - off exercise , ' he said .
' We need to watch to see which pupils develop later on . '
His research also showed that the higher the number of gifted and talented children in the same school year , the better grades each pupil achieved .
However , where grammar schools and comprehensives had equal numbers of gifted and talented children , the pupils at the latter did better in exams .
Steve Sinnott , general secretary of the National Union of Teachers , said the needs of talented children could be met through the state system .
Saturday classes and summer courses already existed , he said , and had not attracted the take - up or enthusiasm hoped .
And it was not only the most gifted who were not achieving their potential , he warned : ' There is a huge problem of under - achievement among boys in their teenage years . '

In the west we breathlessly report on new breakthroughs in science , but it ’s easy to forget that ideas are bought , rented and sold , as surely as deckchairs .
Last week the academic blogger Shelley Batts received threats of legal action from academic publisher Wiley , simply for using a diagram on her blog , in a discussion about a foolish news story , which was based on an academic article published in a Wiley journal .
But the big unreported intellectual property issue from science this week is in Thailand , where there are more than half a million people living with HIV , and 120,000 have Aids , requiring treatment .
First - line Aids drugs are becoming ineffective , as the virus becomes resistant , and so people need the expensive new drugs like Kaletra , made by the US drug company Abbott .
Fighting HIV with drugs is an incredibly clever field .
Some work by blocking the molecular machinery that produces virus DNA .
Kaletra is a “ protease inhibitor “ , and it works by blocking the activity of an enzyme called protease which cleaves proteins into smaller chunks which can then be assembled into a functioning HIV virus .
Abbott has been charging $ 2,200 ( Â£ 1,100 ) a year for Kaletra in Thailand , which is – by macabre coincidence – roughly the same as the gross income per capita .
I am no economist , but it seems to me that if you charge people ’s entire annual income for a drug like that , then your customers will die .
Do n’t pharmaceutical companies need to charge high fees , to recoup their research costs , and develop new ideas ?
Yes , they do , so let ’s be fair .
And if we ’re going to be really fair , we might also mention that they spend twice as much on administration and advertising as they do on research .
So in January the Thai government put their hands up and announced they were going to use Abbott ’s idea , and make Abbott ’s drug , only for the country ’s poor , in their own factories , to save lives .
Abbott has retaliated by completely withdrawing its new heat - stable version of Kaletra from the Thai market and withdrawing six other new drugs from the country for good measure .
It has refused to bring its products back to the Thai market until the government promises not to use a “ compulsory license ” on its drug ideas .
To some this might seem on a par with taking hostages ( or making them say sorry “ like they mean it ” ) .
In fact , the Thai government has a good history of forcing the drug companies to release their wares at more realistic prices and , interestingly , it has broken no laws .
The 2001 Doha declaration made it clear that governments should put public health before companies ’ patent rights , and under the TRIPS agreement from the WTO , governments can sign up to respect a patent , with the caveat that they can make the drug themselves , or import a generic version , in a national emergency .
So the US , for example , announced its intention to import generic Ciprofloxacin following the anthrax panic , sidestepping the patent on that drug , in the name of practicality in a crisis .
The US terrorist anthrax epidemic killed six people , which says a lot about how the definition of national emergency can shift depending on who is dying .
But the fact that we feel entitled to be outraged at Abbott is almost more interesting than the question of intellectual property : because for some reason , we expect higher standards of the people and companies involved in healthcare , when in reality , this is just one of the many everyday ways in which we screw the developing world .
The World Health Organisation estimates that half of HIV transmissions in Thailand come from contact between sex workers and their clients .
There are said to be 2 million women and 800,000 children under 18 working in the sex trade , and much of this trade is servicing western men .
It does n’t spread itself , you know .

5.7 Columnar Formatting
tab -to
space - to
( columnar < column > ...)
< column >
( fmt #t ( columnar ( dsp " abcndefn " ) ( dsp " 123n456 n " ) ) )
outputs
abc 123 def 456
assuming a 16 - char width ( the left side gets half the width , or 8 spaces , and is left aligned ) .
Note that we explicitly use DSP instead of the strings directly .
This is because columnar treats raw strings as literals inserted into the given location on every line , to be used as borders , for example :
( fmt #t ( columnar " / * " ( dsp " abcndefn " ) " | " ( dsp " 123n456 n " ) " */ " ) )
would output
/* abc | 123 */ /* def | 456 */
You may also prefix any column with any of the symbols ' left , ' right or ' center to control the justification .
The symbol ' infinite can be used to indicate the column generates an infinite stream of output .
You can further prefix any column with a width modifier .
Any positive integer is treated as a fixed width , ignoring the available width .
Any real number between 0 and 1 indicates a fraction of the available width ( after subtracting out any fixed widths ) .
Columns with unspecified width divide up the remaining width evenly .
Note that columnar builds its output incrementally , interleaving calls to the generators until each has produced a line , then concatenating that line together and outputting it .
This is important because as noted above , some columns may produce an infinite stream of output , and in general you may want to format data larger than can fit into memory .
Thus columnar would be suitable for line numbering a file of arbitrary size , or implementing the Unix yes ( 1 ) command , etc .
As an implementation detail , columnar uses first - class continuations to interleave the column output .
The core fmt itself has no knowledge of or special support for columnar , which could complicate and potentially slow down simpler fmt operations .
This is a testament to the power of call / cc - it can be used to implement coroutines or arbitrary control structures even where they were not planned for .
( tabular < column > ...)
columnar
( fmt #t ( tabular " | " ( dsp " a \
bc\
def \
" ) " | " ( dsp " 123n45n6 n " ) " | " ) )
outputs
|a | 123 | |bc | 45 | |def|6 |
This makes it easier to generate tables without knowing widths in advance .
However , because it requires generating the entire output in advance to determine the correct column widths , tabular cannot format a table larger than would fit in memory .
( fmt-columns < column > ...)
columnar
< column >
( < line - formatter > < line - generator > [ < infinite ? > ] )
where < line - generator > is the column generator as above , and the < line - formatter > is how each line is formatted .
Raw concatenation of each line is performed , without any spacing or width adjustment .
< infinite ? > , if true , indicates this generator produces an infinite number of lines and termination should be determined without it .
( wrap - lines < format > ...)
cat
fmt(1 )
( justify < format > ...)
wrap - lines
( define func '( define ( fold kons knil ls ) ( let lp ( ( ls ls ) ( acc knil ) ) ( if ( null ? ls ) acc ( lp ( cdr ls ) ( kons ( car ls ) a cc ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define doc ( string - append " The fundamental list iterator .

for the NeoFiles Website ( disbanded in favor of the NeoFiles Podcast Show ) back in 2003 .
I figured with Henson 's recent arrest on charges related to his battle with Scientology , people would be interested in a broader view of Henson .
In this interview , we talk about a range of topics , finally ending with a discussion on his thoughts about his problems with Scientology at that time .
The interview appears below in full , including the title and introduction : Keith Henson is sort of an ur- transhumanist .
In the 1970s - ' 80s , he was one of the founders and leaders of The L5 Society , an organization dedicated to building homes in high orbit using raw materials from the lunar surface .
The L5 group attracted the interests of those seeking practical solutions to predicted resource scarcities , among them K. Eric Drexler .
Henson formed a friendship with him , and was among his contacts as Drexler was conceiving nanotechnology
Once Henson was convinced that nanotech was feasible , he became a member of Alcor , an organization advocating and providing cryonic services .
In the late 1980s , he became associated with the much - storied Extropy Institute , a transhumanist organization that was the subject of substantial media coverage during the cyberculture hype of the 1990s .
But none of this work brought Henson as much notoriety — or heartache — as his conflict with the Scientologists .
It all started when the Scientologists tried to close down alt.religion .
scientology , a newsgroup that fostered open discussion of the church and its activities .
When Scientology sued critic Grady Ward , Henson responded by posting a secret church document , " NOTs 34 , " which Henson claimed was an instruction manual for criminal acts , including the practice of medicine without a license .
He was successfully sued by the church who also got an injunction preventing Henson from supplying law enforcement agencies with a copy .
Protesting the death of two women in 2000 — Ashlee Shaner and Stacy Moxon — at the church 's headquarters , Henson picketed that location .
As a result , in April 2001 , he was convicted in a California court of " terrorizing " the Scientologists .
Henson was forbidden by the court ( motions in limine ) from bringing up either why he was picketing or Scientology 's vindictive " fair game " policy .
( The same kind of motions were used to forbid Ed Rosenthal in his more famous case from telling the jury he was acting for the City of Oakland growing pot for sick people . )
While visiting Canada — in bankruptcy and facing a year in prison as the result of court decisions —
Henson made a spontaneous decision to seek refuge from our " neighbor to the north . "
His request for refugee status is still pending in the Canadian refugee processing system .
I interviewed Henson via email about his personal evolution within the context of transhumanist philosophy .
When did you first realize that you were a novelty - seeker ?
When I was about 8 years old .
My mother read Robert A. Heinlein's Farmer in the Sky to me .
I was enthralled and eventually read every published Heinlein ( and many other SF authors ) I could find .
She could not have imagined that 25 years later I would be giving a paper at Princeton University , " Closed Ecosystems of High Agricultural Yield , " that was partly based on descriptions in Farmer in the Sky :
What are some of the qualities that people can notice perhaps even in children that might indicate a progressive , neophiliac potential ?
That 's a hard one because most kids are interested in new things .
The rare person is still interested in new advances when they are adults .
There is possibly a correlation with intelligence .
In any case , you have to be fairly bright to keep learning and changing attitudes as you get older .
The L5 society received a lot of attention in the 1970s ; after that , public interest or at least media coverage dissipated .
Can you briefly tell my audience what the L5 society was about and what has happened with it in the intervening years ?
L5 was a group set up to promote space colonies and solar power satellites .
It eventually merged with von Braun 's National Space Institute forming the National Space Society , which still exists today ... though the fire has certainly gone .
How did your participation and leadership in the L5 society come about ?
It was indirectly related to " Limits to Growth " memes that were so active in the early 70s .
In The Selfish Gene , Dawkins discussed anxiety - provoking memes such as the hellfire meme — linked to the western religious memes by natural selection among memes .
( The linking came about simply because the combination is more successful in gaining and keeping active meme spreaders for both memes . )
Something like this happened to me linking the Limits to Growth ( LTG ) meme to the space colony meme .
Dr. O'Neill 's writings and early issues of the L5 News made the link explicit .
( Princeton physics professor Dr. Gerard O'Neill generated the space colony concept with the assistance of his undergrads ) Personally , I found that the distasteful worldview implied by the Limits to Growth meme raised my anxiety level much like good hellfire sermon affects conventionally religious people .
( It was much worse for the people in whom the LTG meme first arose .
Rumor has it that one of them boarded himself up in a cabin in the remote woods and waited for the food riots to start and , for all I know , he may be there yet . )
Disaster memes like Limits to Growth capture the imagination and spread well .
But only a small fraction of the population actively responds to threats as remote and indirect as those of the LTG meme .
At that time , joining the Zero Population Growth organization and having a vasectomy were some of the few possible responses .
A small subset of those who were concerned , however , took the step of searching for a meme — or of creating a meme — that would counter the bleak LTG meme .
Eric Drexler , for example , hunted down Dr. O'Neill in 1973 by asking questions of his professors at MIT about who was working on the exploitation of space resources .
A copy of the first widespread space colony publication ( the 1974 Physics Today article ) was in my hands within hours after reaching Dan Jones ( Ph.D. in Physics and occasional rock climbing partner ) who knew of my interest in this topic .
The space colony meme reduced anxiety about the long - term future by providing an alternative , but it raised anxiety too .
It was apparent from the start that we would have to work hard to bring about a world that included space colonies .
Our beginning point was to infect all the people we could with the space colony meme .
Inducing people to spend effort in spreading a meme , as well as successfully spreading itself in competition with innumerable other memes , is the definition of a successful meme .
In this sense , the space colony meme was moderately successful .
( Though it did n't lead to colonies in space . )
As for leadership , I am the kind who leads reluctantly and more by example than anything else .
Someone had to be on the incorporation papers as president .
After two years I fobbed it off on my former wife .
In the sense that my thoughts on the subject had a lot of influence , I was a leader .
I think you have to agree that the " Space Colony " meme lost some of its currency in terms of media coverage and general cultural excitement after the 1970s .
Would you care to reflect on why that happened ?
In 1975 we expected a program ( such as Solar Power Satellite ) leading to space colonies would start by the early 80s , and that we could disband by about 1995 .
By 1985 it was clear nothing leading in that direction in space was likely to happen for a long time .
The problem was mainly one of cost .
Had the cost to get into space been proportional to the Pilgrims or the Mormon migration , we would have been there on our own , but it was about 10,000 times too expensive .
Memes lose their intense hold on people with the passage of time , especially when the promise of the meme is at great variance with reality .
The Society carried on from inertia for a while before merging with the National Space Institute .
Does cyberspace in some ways satisfy some of the needs and desires raised by space colonization ?
Perhaps .
Games provide a lot of previously unknown " area " to explore .
You can't live there yet though [ed .
Today , we have Second Lives .
]
Do you still believe that the L5 plans laid out by O'Neill are the best bet for moving into space ?
Based on old technology , that of the middle of the last century , yes .
I suspect that when people actually move off the planet they will do it with the awesome powers of nanotechnology .
Many advocates of space colonization seem to have changed their focus to nanotechnology which , in turn , would make colonization less expensive and more feasible .
I do n't know that 's the right way to put it .
Nanotechnology will give us vast wealth in terms of control over the environment .
It also might completely destroy us at either a physical level or just from giving us so much synthetic enjoyment we never bother going into space .
Reducing cost or increasing wealth , colonizing space will become something an individual or a small group can do , provided we maintain the desire to do so .
Moving forward a bit in time , did you consider yourself part of the Extropian movement and do you agree with their principles ?
I contributed to the early private extropian mailing list and seem to have had some degree of influence there , i.e. , what Extropians and related transhumanists consider important is very close to what I consider important .
I knew Max More through Alcor before he started the movement and was the ( not very active ) memetics editor for the magazine when it was in paper .
I do n't disagree with the principles , though they are perhaps a bit optimistic .
On the other hand , my view is certainly colored by being driven out of the US .
Do you consider yourself a utopian ?
No .
I can't think of anyone who is up on evolutionary psychology and related areas who is deluded enough to be called a utopian .
I think most of us consider staying out of ugly distopian states is about as good as we can get — pre- Singularity , anyway .
After that who knows ?
How did you enter into your epic battle with the Scientologists ?
It 's a well - documented story .
I had mentioned scientology in an article or two but had taken no serious interest in it before January 1995 .
At that time Helena Kobrin , a lawyer for Scientology , issued a command ( rmgroup ) to remove the Usenet news group alt.religion .
scientology from the Internet , apparently thinking that this " denial of service " attack on the Internet would end critical discussion about Scientology .
This attack on free speech backfired , having somewhat the effect of a gang of thugs riding into town and burning down the newspaper .
This attempted censorship drew in dozens of Internet free speech advocates , me among them .
A Google search on Kobrin rmgroup turns up hundreds of pages .
How would you define the boundary between an organization that constitutes a " cult " and a group that simply shares a set of intentions and an overall memeplex ?
There is n't a clear - cut boundary .
Humans evolved in tribes and our reward circuits are still set up to reward behaviors that aided reproductive success in tribes .
People still do things that reward them , such as socializing with others and doing things which gain the respect ( and attention ) of their associates just like they did 100,000 years ago when such behaviors were more directly connected to gaining the status needed to reproduce ( i.e. , obtain a wife or two ... or three ) .
Cults tap into this reward mechanism , but so does every other rewarding activity from local sports clubs to the Nobel Prize .
Still , you can say that some groups are cults .
LaRouche 's bunch , Moonies , scientology , Heaven 's Gate , etc .
There are published scales to measure how much some group is a cult .
From your experience , do all organizations ( like L5 or the Extropians ) tend to accumulate cult - like behaviors over time ?
No .
If anything , L5 lost the cult kind of intensity as it aged .
I do n't think the Extropians ever had even the level of the early L5 Society , but then I was not deeply involved with them .
If a group stays around long enough , it tends to lose its cult aspects .
Religious cults tend toward main stream religions .
Calvinism started as an intense cult .
Heck , Calvin had a dozen and a half people publicly executed , something the scientology leadership would drool over , but 300 years later the Methodists are as mellow as you could ask for .
Would you agree that there are quasi-religious overtones in the belief that we are headed towards a singularity ; in the sense that it promises to resolve so many problems and existential dilemmas ( sickness , death , material scarcity , other limits ) that Salvation is n't too strong a word for the hopes that it evokes ?
It definitely has the potential to be the techno - rapture .
It is deeply connected to SETI and the searches for planets around other stars .
Oddly , the worse things look out there , the better they look here .
The logic runs this way , if planets with life ( and particularly life that eventually becomes technologically capable the way we are headed ) are common then it looks really dire for us , because we do n't see any evidence of a " tamed " universe .
Everywhere we look there are massive wastes of energy and matter .
If technophilic civilizations are common , then something happens that removes them from the observable universe .
Contrary wise , if the universe does n't harbor any others inside our light cone , then we are looking at an unknown future instead of a deadly one .
There is n't much hope for controlling the final stages ; all we can do is build in as much good will as we can .
How would you compare life in Canada to life in the US ?
Colder . :-)
The cult seems to have less influence here .
I suspect going back would be as disorienting as coming here in the first place .
I understand the money does n't look the same now and the US is talking about reinstating the draft .
Plus there have been lots of changes — few of them good — since 9/11 .
If anyone wonders why the airlines are not doing well it is because flying has been made such an unpleasant and degrading experience .
How can people help you to defeat this attack on your liberty and everyone 's freedom of speech ?
It 's really hard to do anything effective .
The problem is that the individuals in law enforcement agencies know they will be targeted personally if they take steps against the cult 's abuses and corruption .
Not only by private investigators stealing their trash and stalking their children , but if they take action against the cult , Scientology will turn a scary part of the government against them by suing them in the courts .
This fact of life was picked up in an episode of Millennium : Starving Scientology of new members is perhaps the best we can do .
To do that , inform yourself , inform your friends .
If you really want to help , picket them .
Scientology has this " chosen people " status they got by intimidating or perhaps even blackmailing IRS management .
A Jewish guy name of Sklar tried to get the same deal for his religious practice and was turned down .
The judge in the appeal said that if what Sklar claimed about the IRS 's treatment of Scientology was true , the IRS was violating the law and that someone should file a suit to put an end to that practice .
It has been nearly two years and nobody has stepped up to file this invited lawsuit .
The few lawyers who used to go up against Scientology will no longer do so because Scientology is just too good at using lots of money to pervert the courts .
Put Rosen Exhibit 185 in Google to see a listing of $ 35 million they spent over a few years to destroy critics .
( Over a million on me . )
And if you want to understand how cults use the same brain reward pathway that drugs activate , go here to look at my paper on the subject .
You know you ’re a stupid burglar when you fall through the store ’s roof , walk around with a shopping cart , and smoke cigs while waiting for the cops to come arrest you .

The local Moonie paper ( " Moonie " as in the cult , the cult owns the paper ) that the Republicans are all in bed with here in DC the other day printed a false quote that they attributed to Abraham Lincoln .
The quote was used to bash Democrats who oppose the Bush / McCain escalation policy in Iraq .
Putting aside the irony of a lie being used , again , as the basis for sending our soldiers to die in Iraq , now that it 's been proven that the quote is a fake , Republican members of Congress are still using it in their public speeches , and the cult 's newspaper wo n't print a correction .
I 'd like to say that I expect more of GOP congressmen than I expect from a cult , but that is n't really true .

WASHINGTON --
Is there anything more depressing than yet another promise of energy independence in yet another State of the Union address ?
By my count , 24 of the 34 State of the Union addresses since the oil embargo of 1973 have proposed solutions to our energy problem .
The result ?
In 1973 we imported 34.8 percent of our oil .
Today we import 60.3 percent .
And what does this president propose ?
Another great technological fix .
For Jimmy Carter , it was the magic of synfuels .
For George Bush , it 's the wonders of ethanol .
Our fuel will grow on trees .
Well , stalks , with even fancier higher - tech variants to come from cellulose and other ( literal ) rubbish .
It is very American to believe that chemists are going to discover the cure for geopolitical weakness .
It is even more American to imagine that it can be done painlessly .
Ethanol for everyone .
Farmers get a huge cash crop .
Consumers get more supply .
And the country ends up more secure .
This is nonsense .
As my colleague Robert Samuelson demonstrates , biofuels will barely keep up with the increase in gasoline demand over time .
They are a huge government bet with goals and mandates and subsidies that will not cure our oil dependence or even make a significant dent in it .
Even worse , the happy talk displaces any discussion about here - and - now measures that would have a rapid and revolutionary effect on oil consumption and dependence .
No one talks about them because they have unhidden costs .
Politicians hate unhidden costs .
There are three serious things we can do now :
Tax gas .
Drill in the Arctic .
Go nuclear .
First , tax gas .
The president ostentatiously rolled out his 20 - in - 10 plan : reducing gasoline consumption by 20 percent in 10 years .
This with Rube Goldberg regulation -- fuel - efficiency standards , artificially mandated levels of " renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 " and various bribes ( er , incentives ) for government - favored technologies -- of the kind we have been trying for three decades .
Good grief .
I can give you a 20 - in - 2 : tax gas to $ 4 a gallon .
With oil prices having fallen to $ 55 a barrel , now is the time .
The effect of a gas - tax hike will be seen in less than two years , and you do n't even have to go back to the 1970s and the subsequent radical reduction in consumption to see how .
Just look at last summer .
Gas prices spike to $ 3 -- with the premium going to Vladimir Putin , Hugo Chavez and assorted sheiks , rather than the U.S. treasury -- and , presto , SUV sales plunge , the Prius is cool and car ads once again begin featuring miles per gallon ratings .
No regulator , no fuel - efficiency standards , no presidential exhortations , no grand experiments with switchgrass .
Raise the price and people change their habits .
It 's the essence of capitalism .
Second , immediate drilling to recover oil that is under U.S. control , namely in the Arctic and on the Outer Continental Shelf .
No one pretends that this fixes everything .
But a million barrels a day from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is 5 percent of our consumption .
In tight markets , that makes a crucial difference .
We will always need some oil .
And the more of it that is ours , the better .
It is tautological that nothing more directly reduces dependence on foreign oil than substituting domestic for foreign production .
Yet ANWR is now so politically dead that the president did not even mention it in the State of the Union , or his energy address the next day .
He did bring up , to enthusiastic congressional applause , global warming .
No one has a remotely good idea about how to make any difference in global warming without enlisting China and India , and without destroying the carbon - based Western economy .
The obvious first step , however , is an extremely powerful source of energy that produces not an ounce of carbon dioxide : nuclear .
What about nuclear waste ?
Well , coal produces toxic pollutants , as does oil .
Both produce carbon dioxide that we are told is going to end civilization as we know it .
These wastes are widely dispersed and almost impossible to recover once they get thrown into the atmosphere .
Nukes produce waste as well , but it comes out concentrated -- very toxic and lasting nearly forever , but because it is packed into a small manageable volume , it is more controllable .
And it does n't pollute the atmosphere .
At all .
There is no free lunch .
Producing energy is going to produce waste .
You pick your poison and you find a way to manage it .
Want to do something about global warming ?
How many global warming activists are willing to say the word nuclear ?
So much easier to say ethanol .
That it will do farcically little is beside the point .
Our debates about oil consumption , energy dependence and global warming are not meant to be serious .
They are meant for show .

 What is Buddhism ?
Buddhism is a religion to about 300 million people around the world .
The word comes from ' budhi ' , ' to awaken ' .
It has its origins about 2,500 years ago when Siddhartha Gotama , known as the Buddha , was himself awakened ( enlightened ) at the age of 35 .

Is Buddhism a Religion ?
To many , Buddhism goes beyond religion and is more of a philosophy or ' way of life ' .
It is a philosophy because philosophy ' means love of wisdom ' and the Buddhist path can be summed up as : ( 1 ) to lead a moral life ,
( 2 ) to be mindful and aware of thoughts and actions , and
( 3 ) to develop wisdom and understanding .
 How Can Buddhism Help Me ?
Buddhism explains a purpose to life , it explains apparent injustice and inequality around the world , and it provides a code of practice or way of life that leads to true happiness .

Why is Buddhism Becoming Popular ?
Buddhism is becoming popular in western countries for a number of reasons ,
The first good reason is Buddhism has answers to many of the problems in modern materialistic societies .
It also includes ( for those who are interested ) a deep understanding of the human mind ( and natural therapies ) which prominent psychologists around the world are now discovering to be both very advanced and effective .

Who Was the Buddha ?
Siddhartha Gotama was born into a royal family in Lumbini , now located in Nepal , in 563 BC .
At 29 , he realised that wealth and luxury did not guarantee happiness , so he explored the different teachings religions and philosophies of the day , to find the key to human happiness .
After six years of study and meditation he finally found ' the middle path ' and was enlightened .
After enlightenment , the Buddha spent the rest of his life teaching the principles of Buddhism  called the Dhamma , or Truth  until his death at the age of 80 .

Was the Buddha a God ?
He was not , nor did he claim to be .
He was a man who taught a path to enlightenment from his own experience .
 Do Buddhists Worship Idols ?
Buddhists sometimes pay respect to images of the Buddha , not in worship , nor to ask for favours .
A statue of the Buddha with hands rested gently in its lap and a compassionate smile reminds us to strive to develop peace and love within ourselves .
Bowing to the statue is an expression of gratitude for the teaching .

Why are so Many Buddhist Countries Poor ?
One of the Buddhist teachings is that wealth does not guarantee happiness and also wealth is impermanent .
The people of every country suffer whether rich or poor , but those who understand Buddhist teachings can find true happiness .
 Are There Different Types of Buddhism ?
There are many different types of Buddhism , because the emphasis changes from country to country due to customs and culture .
What does not vary is the essence of the teaching  the Dhamma or truth .
 Are Other Religions Wrong ?
Buddhism is also a belief system which is tolerant of all other beliefs or religions .
Buddhism agrees with the moral teachings of other religions but Buddhism goes further by providing a long term purpose within our existence , through wisdom and true understanding .
Real Buddhism is very tolerant and not concerned with labels like ' Christian ' , ' Moslem ' , ' Hindu ' or ' Buddhist ' ; that is why there have never been any wars fought in the name of Buddhism .
That is why Buddhists do not preach and try to convert , only explain if an explanation is sought .

Is Buddhism Scientific ?
Science is knowledge which can be made into a system , which depends upon seeing and testing facts and stating general natural laws .
The core of Buddhism fit into this definition , because the Four Noble truths ( see below ) can be tested and proven by anyone in fact the Buddha himself asked his followers to test the teaching rather than accept his word as true .
Buddhism depends more on understanding than faith .

What did the Buddha Teach ?
The Buddha taught many things , but the basic concepts in Buddhism can be summed up by the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path . 
What is the First Noble Truth ?
The first truth is that life is suffering i.e. , life includes pain , getting old , disease , and ultimately death .
We also endure psychological suffering like loneliness frustration , fear , embarrassment , disappointment and anger .
This is an irrefutable fact that can not be denied .
It is realistic rather than pessimistic because pessimism is expecting things to be bad .
lnstead , Buddhism explains how suffering can be avoided and how we can be truly happy .

What is the Second Noble Truth ?
The second truth is that suffering is caused by craving and aversion .
We will suffer if we expect other people to conform to our expectation , if we want others to like us , if we do not get something we want , etc .
In other words , getting what you want does not guarantee happiness .
Rather than constantly struggling to get what you want , try to modify your wanting .
Wanting deprives us of contentment and happiness .
A lifetime of wanting and craving and especially the craving to continue to exist , creates a powerful energy which causes the individual to be born .
So craving leads to physical suffering because it causes us to be reborn .

What is the Third Noble Truth ?
The third truth is that suffering can be overcome and happiness can be attained ; that true happiness and contentment are possible .
lf we give up useless craving and learn to live each day at a time ( not dwelling in the past or the imagined future ) then we can become happy and free .
We then have more time and energy to help others .
This is Nirvana . 
What is the Fourth Noble Truth ?
The fourth truth is that the Noble 8 - fold Path is the path which leads to the end of suffering .

What is the Noble 8 - Fold Path ?
In summary , the Noble 8 - fold Path is being moral ( through what we say , do and our livelihood ) , focussing the mind on being fully aware of our thoughts and actions , and developing wisdom by understanding the Four Noble Truths and by developing compassion for others .

What are the 5 Precepts ?
The moral code within Buddhism is the precepts , of which the main five are : not to take the life of anything living , not to take anything not freely given , to abstain from sexual misconduct and sensual overindulgence , to refrain from untrue speech , and to avoid intoxication , that is , losing mindfulness .

What is Karma ?
Karma is the law that every cause has an effect , i.e. , our actions have results .
This simple law explains a number of things : inequality in the world , why some are born handicapped and some gifted , why some live only a short life .
Karma underlines the importance of all individuals being responsible for their past and present actions .
How can we test the karmic effect of our actions ?
The answer is summed up by looking at ( 1 ) the intention behind the action , ( 2 ) effects of the action on oneself , and ( 3 ) the effects on others .

What is Wisdom ?
Buddhism teaches that wisdom should be developed with compassion .
At one extreme , you could be a good hearted fool and at the other extreme , you could attain knowledge without any emotion .
Buddhism uses the middle path to develop both .
The highest wisdom is seeing that in reality , all phenomena are incomplete , impermanent and do not constitute a fixed entity .
True wisdom is not simply believing what we are told but instead experiencing and understanding truth and reality .
Wisdom requires an open , objective , unbigoted mind .
The Buddhist path requires courage , patience , flexibility and intelligence .

What is Compassion ?
Compassion includes qualities of sharing , readiness to give comfort , sympathy , concern , caring .
In Buddhism , we can really understand others , when we can really understand ourselves , through wisdom .

How do I Become a Buddhist ?
Buddhist teachings can be understood and tested by anyone .
Buddhism teaches that the solutions to our problems are within ourselves not outside .
The Buddha asked all his followers not to take his word as true , but rather to test the teachings for themselves .
ln this way , each person decides for themselves and takes responsibility for their own actions and understanding .
This makes Buddhism less of a fixed package of beliefs which is to be accepted in its entirety , and more of a teaching which each person learns and uses in their own way .

The small size of Japanese living space is legendary – but Tokyo architecture proves to be a marvel of minaturisation
“ Do n’t expect too much from my apartment …it ’s a glorified portapotty , basically ” .
So Lindy warned me in an email just before I arrived in Tokyo to visit her .
This I could cope with – whether Lindy could stand being cooped up with me in her small but private space away from the madness of the city was another matter .
There ’s no getting around it .
Tokyo apartments are small , as befits one of the most expensive cities on earth where land is at an absolute premium .
But what impressed me with Lindy ’s apartment was the thought that had gone into using the space that it had .
Compared to most places in London I ’d lived in , Lindy ’s place was clean , modern and purpose - built , all qualities that made it a far more preferable residence .
It came as part of the contract for her job teaching English in Japan .
This impressed me enough to take some photos .
So , then , with apologies to Eric Newby for the excruciating half - pun , I present a very short walk around a Tokyo apartment …
From the outside , the apartment block has that distinctly pre-fabricated look to it .
Note the clothes hanging out the window to dry .
Everyone does this because there are no gardens .
The front door which looks vaguely nautical and also distinctly un - door like .
Every door along the landing is identical , which meant I almost walked into the neighbours ’ house on several occasions .
Normal keys are eschewed in favour of a shiny dog - tag - look - a- like piece of metal that slides and turns into a cylindrical lock .
Once in through the door , the very narrow entry corridor doubles as the kitchen , with the cooking hob and sink over on the right .
There ’s a fridge and a washing machine in this corridor too , which are n’t in shot .
Lindy is petite so she does n’t notice the narrowness – as a big fat bloke , I do .
This makes me realise just how slim built most Japanese are .
You certainly would n’t catch a Sumo wrestler moving in here .
I should say something about this article having everything including the kitchen sink , but screw it .
The two ring hob , complete with extractor fan , is controlled from that little button panel you see in the foreground .
Note the authentic washing up in the sink to give that “ lived in ” feel .
Whilst it ’s a great hob , superhot and quick to warm up , cooking is a cramped experience , and you ca n’t escape that you are indeed standing in a corridor whilst you ’re doing it .
The toilet , just off the corridor .
Perhaps my favourite bit in the whole apartment .
I ’ve never seen this before .
When you flush the toilet , the cistern refills by pumping the water through the tap on top of the toilet , so you can wash your hands as it refills .
At first this confused my logic , making me think it was a bit unhygenic .
But as the water being pumped through the tap is clean , and the water from your hands going back into the cistern will be flushed away again , it makes complete sense .
Deeply clever .
Now wash your hands .
The shower room , just off the toilet .
A louvre - style plastic door extends across to keep the water in .
There ’s a half - bath in there too , which is quite strange – you could be fully immersed but would have to be in a crouching position .
Good for kids though .
The shower runs off the same taps as the washsink , with a switch to flip between the water flow going to the tap or the showerhead .
On numerous occasions I forgot the switch was on shower , went to wash my hands and wound up with the back of my t- shirt getting soaked .
How we laughed .
The lounge , at the end of the corridor .
Lindy ’s “ Future Home - Maker Of America ” credentials lie in ruins with the arrival of me and all my crap .
The big pile of bedding to the left is our futons which I ’ve expertly arranged into a sitting position .
The writing desk in the corner doubles as the TV stand , and then on the right is a very small two person dining table .
The apartment ’s only window is a big one , looking out over some other apartments .
The ladder leads up to the sleeping area , and also doubles as a handy clothes horse .
There ’s a large cupboard behind it running off to the left .
The corridor starts just on the right back out to the kitchen and front door .
The view from the top of the ladder into the sleeping area .
We would n’t both fit up here – not without one of us being suffocated up against a wall , anyway - and apparently it gets very hot up here even with the air conditioning on .
Also looks a bit claustrophobic to my mind .
The sleeping area extends back over and above the toilet and shower area .
And there you have it .
The complete tour of a Tokyo apartment – compact and bijou , but clean , light and equipped with modern equipment to make the best of the limited space .
If you ’re looking for some actual useful info about Tokyo , check out TrulyTokyo.com , an online guide written by my friend Chris Rowthorn .
Finally , just to prove I really was in Tokyo , this is the Phillip Starck sculpture on top of the Asahi Brewing Company ’s offices .
It ’s meant to represent the froth on a glass of beer , but it was promptly dubbed by the Japanese as “ the golden turd ” .
Clearly they are a nation at one with the British in their sense of humour .
Study : ' Gay - friendly ' cities enjoy more economic prosperity David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Saturday June 23 , 2007 Print This Email This Richard Florida , a professor from George Mason University and author of the book The Rise of the Creative Class argued that the more " gay - friendly " a city is , the more economically prosperous it will be .
In his March 2007 paper " There Goes the Neighborhood , " Florida uses something he calls the " Bohemian - Gay Index " to demonstrate that " artistic , bohemian , and gay populations " have a " substantial effects on housing values across all permutations of the model and across all region sizes . "
He also found that more open and " gay - friendly " areas generally support higher income levels .
( A PDF of the paper can be read at this link . )
This morning on CNN's
In the Money , Florida argued that educated kids are generally moving to the most " gay- friendly " cities after graduating from college because those cities tend to have the best job markets .
After realizing that the top 5 " gay - friendly " cities in the US -- San Francisco , Seattle , Boston , Portland ( Oregon ) , and Tampa -- are also prosperous centers of technological innovation , Florida decided to do a more thorough study .
The results , he said , held up for other cities as well .
" Places that were open to gay and lesbian people were also the kind of places that could attract not only smart young people , but also Indian and Chinese immigrants who come here and start a lot of high tech companies , " he said .
" They were attracting people across the board , building up a talent base , and then innovating and starting these new enterprises . "
Florida said he thinks it is the open mindedness of these cities that has allowed economically successful communities to emerge , rather than prior economic success attracting open minded people .
" Places that a large gay and lesbian community gravitated to , a large group of musicians and other open minded people gravitated to .
When these kind of geeky entrepreneurs became important economic growth , those were the places that accepted them , too , " he told CNN .
The following video is from CNN's In the Money , broadcast on June 23 .
Baghdad Burning
... I 'll meet you 'round the bend my friend , where hearts can heal and souls can mend ...
Oops ...
Oh my .
Remember Muhsin Abdul Hameed ?
He ’s the head of the Iraqi Islamic Party in Iraq - a Sunni political party that was basically the only blatantly Sunni party taking part in post- occupation politics in Iraq .
For those who have forgotten ,
The last couple of days , we ’ve been hearing about raids and detentions in various areas .
One of these areas is Amriya .
We ’ve been hearing about random detentions of ‘ suspects ’ who may be any male between the ages 15 – 65 and looting by Iraqi forces of houses .
It ’s like the first months after the occupation when the American forces were conducting raids .
We woke up this morning to the interesting news that
The Americans are saying Muhsin was “ detained and interviewed ” , which makes one think his car was gently pulled over and he was asked a few questions .
What actually happened was that his house was raided early morning , doors broken down , windows shattered and he and his three sons had bags placed over their heads and were dragged away .
They showed the house , and his wife , today on Arabiya and the house was a disaster .
The cabinets were broken , tables overturned , books and papers scattered , etc .
An outraged Muhsin was on tv a few minutes ago talking about how the troops pushed him to the floor and how he had an American boot on his neck for twenty minutes .
Talabani was seemingly irritated .
He wondered why no one asked him about the arrest before it occurred - as if the he is personally consulted on every other raid and detention .
The detention is disturbing .
Now I am not personally fond of Muhsin Abdul Hameed - he looks somewhat like a dried potato , and he ’s a Puppet .
It is disturbing , though , because if this was really a mistake , then just imagine how many other ‘ mistakes ’ are being unfairly detained and possibly tortured in places like Abu Ghraib .
Abdul Hameed is one of their own and even he was n’t safe from a raid , humiliation and detention .
He was out the same day , but other Iraqis do n’t have the luxury of a huffy Talabani and outraged political party .
Was it meant to send a message to Sunnis ?
That ’s what some people are saying .
Many people believe it was meant to tell Sunnis , “ None of you are safe - even the ones who work with us . ”
It ’s just difficult to believe this is one big misunderstanding or mistake .
On the other hand , watching the situation unfold was somewhat like watching one of those annoying reality tv shows where they take someone off of a farm , for example , and put them in New York and then watch how they cope - what was it called ?
“ Faking It ” ?
How will Muhsin feel about raids and detentions now that he ’s been on the other side of them ?
Oh my .
Remember Muhsin Abdul Hameed ?
He ’s the head of the Iraqi Islamic Party in Iraq - a Sunni political party that was basically the only blatantly Sunni party taking part in post- occupation politics in Iraq .
For those who have forgotten , Abdul Hameed was chosen as one of the rotating presidents back in 2003 .
Mohsin was actually , er , Mr. February 2004 , if you will .
The last couple of days , we ’ve been hearing about raids and detentions in various areas .
One of these areas is Amriya .
We ’ve been hearing about random detentions of ‘ suspects ’ who may be any male between the ages 15 – 65 and looting by Iraqi forces of houses .
It ’s like the first months after the occupation when the American forces were conducting raids .
We woke up this morning to the interesting news that Muhsin Abdul Hameed had also been detained !
A member of the former Iraqi Governing Council , a rotating puppet president , and * The Sunni* .
He is The Sunni they hold up to all Sunnis as an example of cooperation and collaboration .
Well , he ’s the religious Sunni .
There is a tribal Sunni ( supposedly to appease the Arab Sunni tribes ) and that is Ghazi Al Yawir and there is the religious Sunni - Muhsin Abdul Hameed .
The Americans are saying Muhsin was “ detained and interviewed ” , which makes one think his car was gently pulled over and he was asked a few questions .
What actually happened was that his house was raided early morning , doors broken down , windows shattered and he and his three sons had bags placed over their heads and were dragged away .

Shia Leaders ...
In Baghdad there 's talk of the latest " Operation Lightning " .
It has n't yet been implemented in our area but we 've been hearing about it .
So far all we 've seen are a few additional checkpoints and a disappearing mobile network .
Baghdad is actually split into two large regions - Karkh ( west Baghdad ) and Rasafa ( east Baghdad ) with the Tigris River separating them .
Karkh , according to this plan , is going to be split into 15 smaller areas or sub- districts and Rasafa into 7 sub - districts .
There are also going to be 675 checkpoints and all of the entrances to Baghdad are going to be guarded .
We are a little puzzled why Karkh should be split into 15 sub - districts and Rasafa only seven .
Karkh is actually smaller in area than Rasafa and less populated .
On the other hand , Karkh contains the Green Zone - so that could be a reason .
People are also anxious about the 675 check points .
It 's difficult enough right now getting around Baghdad , more check points are going to make things trickier .
The plan includes 40,000 Iraqi security forces and that is making people a little bit uneasy .
Iraqi National Guard are not pleasant or upstanding citizens - to have thousands of them scattered about Baghdad stopping cars and possibly harassing civilians is worrying .
We 're also very worried about the possibility of raids on homes .
Someone ( thank you N.C. ) emailed me Thomas L. Friedman 's article in the New York Times 10 days ago about Quran desecration titled
In the article he talks about how people in the Muslim world went out and demonstrated against Quran desecration but are silent about the deaths of hundreds of Iraqis in the last few weeks due to bombings and suicide attacks .
In one paragraph he says ,
" Yet these mass murders - this desecration and dismemberment of real Muslims by other Muslims - have not prompted a single protest march anywhere in the Muslim world .
And I have not read of a single fatwa issued by any Muslim cleric outside Iraq condemning these indiscriminate mass murders of Iraqi Shiites and Kurds by these jihadist suicide bombers , many of whom , according to a Washington Post report , are coming from Saudi Arabia . "
First of all - it 's not only Kurds or Shia who are dying due to car bombs .
When a car detonates in the middle of a soug or near a mosque , it does not seek out only Shia or Kurdish people amongst the multitude .
Bombs do not discriminate between the young and the old , male and female or ethnicities and religious sects - no matter what your government tells you about how smart they are .
Furthermore , they are going off everywhere - not just in Shia or Kurdish provinces .
They seem to be everywhere lately .
One thing I found particularly amusing about the article - and outrageous all at once - was in the following paragraph :
" Religiously , if you want to know how the Sunni Arab world views a Shiite 's being elected leader of Iraq , for the first time ever , think about how whites in Alabama would have felt about a black governor 's being installed there in 1920 .
Some Sunnis do not think Shiites are authentic Muslims , and they are indifferent to their brutalization . "
Now , it is always amusing to see a Jewish American journalist speak in the name of Sunni Arabs .
When Sunni Arabs , at this point , hesitate to speak in a representative way about other Sunni Arabs , it is nice to know Thomas L. Friedman feels he can sum up the feelings of the " Sunni Arab world " in so many words .
His arrogance is exceptional .
It is outrageous because for many people , this is n't about Sunnis and Shia or Arabs and Kurds .
It 's about an occupation and about people feeling that they do not have real representation .
We have a government that needs to hide behind kilometers of barbed wire and meters and meters of concrete - and it's not because they are Shia or Kurdish or Sunni Arab - it 's because they blatantly supported , and continue to support , an occupation that has led to death and chaos .
The paragraph is contemptible because the idea of a " Shia leader " is not an utterly foreign one to Iraqis or other Arabs , no matter how novel Friedman tries to make it seem .
How dare he compare it to having a black governor in Alabama in the 1920s ?
In 1958 , after the July 14 Revolution which ended the Iraqi monarchy , the head of the Iraqi Sovereignty Council ( which was equivalent to the position of president ) was Mohammed Najib Al - Rubayi- a Shia from Kut.
From 1958 - 1963 , Abdul Karim Qassim , a Shia also from Kut in the south , was the Prime Minister of Iraq ( i.e. the same position Jaffari is filling now ) .
After Abdul Karim Qassim , in 1963 , came yet another Shia by the name of Naji Talib as prime minster .
Even during the last regime , there were two Shia prime ministers filling the position for several years - Sadoun Humadi and Mohammed Al - Zubaidi .
In other words , Sunni Arabs are not horrified at having a Shia leader ( though we are very worried about the current Puppets ' pro-Iran tendencies ) .
Friedman seems to conveniently forget that while the New Iraq 's president was a polygamous Arab Sunni - Ghazi Al - Yawir - the attacks were just as violent .
Were it simply a matter of Sunnis vs. Shia or Arabs vs. Kurds , then Sunni Arabs would have turned out in droves to elect " Al Baqara al dhahika " ( " the cow that laughs " or La Vache Qui Rit- it 's an Iraqi joke ) as Al - Yawir is known amongst Iraqis .
This sentence ,
" Some Sunnis do not think Shiites are authentic Muslims , and they are indifferent to their brutalization . "
... Is just stupid .
Friedman is referring to Sunni extremists without actually saying that .
But he does n't add that some Shia extremists also feel the same way about Sunnis .
I 'm sure in the " Christian World " there are certain Catholics who feel that way about Protestants , etc. Iraqis have intermarried and mixed as Sunnis and Shia for centuries .
Many of the larger Iraqi tribes are a complex and intricate weave of Sunnis and Shia .
We donÂt sit around pointing fingers at each other and trying to prove who is a Muslim and who is n't and who deserves compassion and who deserves brutalization .
Friedman says ,
" If the Arab world , its media and its spiritual leaders , came out and forcefully and repeatedly condemned those who mount these suicide attacks , and if credible Sunnis are given their fair share in the Iraqi government , I am certain a lot of this suicide bombing would stop "
The Arab world 's spiritual and media leaders have their hands tied right now .
Friedman better hope Islamic spiritual leaders do n't get involved in this mess because the first thing they'd have to do is remind the Islamic world that according to the Quran , the Islamic world may not be under the guardianship or command of non-Muslims - and that would n't reflect nicely on an American occupation of Iraq .
Friedman wonders why thousands upon thousands protested against the desecration of the Quran and why they do not demonstrate against terrorism in Iraq .
The civilian bombings in Iraq are being done by certain extremists , fanatics or militias .
What happened in Guantanamo with the Quran and what happens in places like Abu Ghraib is being done systematically by an army - an army that is fighting a war - a war being funded by the American people .
That is what makes it outrageous to the Muslim world .
In other words , what happens in Iraq is terrorism , while what happens to Iraqis and Afghanis and people of other nationalities under American or British custody is simply " counter - insurgency " and " policy " .
It makes me naseous to think of how outraged the whole world was when those American POW were shown on Iraqi television at the beginning of the war - clean , safe and respectfully spoken to .
Even we were upset with the incident and wondered why they had to be paraded in front of the world like that .
We actually had the decency to feel sorry for them .
Friedman focuses on the Sunni Arab world in his article but he fails to mention that the biggest demonstrations were not in the Arab world - they happened in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan .
He also fails to mention that in Iraq , the largest demonstration against the desecration of the Quran was actually organized , and attended by , Shia .
Luckily for Iraqis , and in spite of Thomas Friedman , the majority of Sunnis and Shia just want to live in peace as Muslims - not as Sunnis and Shia .
In Baghdad there 's talk of the latest " Operation Lightning " .
It has n't yet been implemented in our area but we 've been hearing about it .
So far all we 've seen are a few additional checkpoints and a disappearing mobile network .
Baghdad is actually split into two large regions - Karkh ( west Baghdad ) and Rasafa ( east Baghdad ) with the Tigris River separating them .
Karkh , according to this plan , is going to be split into 15 smaller areas or sub- districts and Rasafa into 7 sub - districts .
There are also going to be 675 checkpoints and all of the entrances to Baghdad are going to be guarded .
We are a little puzzled why Karkh should be split into 15 sub - districts and Rasafa only seven .
Karkh is actually smaller in area than Rasafa and less populated .
On the other hand , Karkh contains the Green Zone - so that could be a reason .
People are also anxious about the 675 check points .
It 's difficult enough right now getting around Baghdad , more check points are going to make things trickier .
The plan includes 40,000 Iraqi security forces and that is making people a little bit uneasy .
Iraqi National Guard are not pleasant or upstanding citizens - to have thousands of them scattered about Baghdad stopping cars and possibly harassing civilians is worrying .
We 're also very worried about the possibility of raids on homes .
Someone ( thank you N.C. ) emailed me Thomas L. Friedman 's article in the New York Times 10 days ago about Quran desecration titled " Outrage and Silence "
In the article he talks about how people in the Muslim world went out and demonstrated against Quran desecration but are silent about the deaths of hundreds of Iraqis in the last few weeks due to bombings and suicide attacks .
In one paragraph he says , " Yet these mass murders - this desecration and dismemberment of real Muslims by other Muslims - have not prompted a single protest march anywhere in the Muslim world .
And I have not read of a single fatwa issued by any Muslim cleric outside Iraq condemning these indiscriminate mass murders of Iraqi Shiites and Kurds by these jihadist suicide bombers , many of whom , according to a Washington Post report , are coming from Saudi Arabia .
" First of all - it 's not only Kurds or Shia who are dying due to car bombs .
When a car detonates in the middle of a soug or near a mosque , it does not seek out only Shia or Kurdish people amongst the multitude .
Bombs do not discriminate between the young and the old , male and female or ethnicities and religious sects - no matter what your government tells you about how smart they are .
Furthermore , they are going off everywhere - not just in Shia or Kurdish provinces .
They seem to be everywhere lately .
One thing I found particularly amusing about the article - and outrageous all at once - was in the following paragraph : " Religiously , if you want to know how the Sunni Arab world views a Shiite 's being elected leader of Iraq , for the first time ever , think about how whites in Alabama would have felt about a black governor 's being installed there in 1920 .

The Dead and the Undead ...
She stood in the crowded room as her drove of minions stood around her ...
A huddling mass trying to draw closer to her aura of evil .
The lights flashed against her fangs as her cruel lips curled into a grimace .
It was meant to be a smile but it would n't reach her cold , lifeless eyes
It was a leer - the leer of the undead before a feeding ...
The above was not a scene from Buffy the Vampire Slayer - it was just Condi Rice in Iraq a day ago .
At home , we fondly refer to her as The Vampire .
She 's such a contrast to Bush - he simply looks stupid .
She , on the other hand , looks utterly evil .
The last two weeks have been violent .
The number of explosions in Baghdad alone is frightening .
There have also been several assassinations - bodies being found here and there .
It 's somewhat disturbing to know that corpses are turning up in the most unexpected places .
Many people will tell you it 's not wise to eat river fish anymore because they have been nourished on the human remains being dumped into the river .
That thought alone has given me more than one sleepless night .
It is almost as if Baghdad has turned into a giant graveyard .
The latest corpses were those of some Sunni and Shia clerics - several of them well - known .
People are being patient and there is a general consensus that these killings are being done to provoke civil war .
Also worrisome is the fact that we are hearing of people being rounded up by security forces ( Iraqi ) and then being found dead days later - apparently when the new Iraqi government recently decided to reinstate the death penalty , they had something else in mind .
But back to the explosions .
One of the larger blasts was in an area called Ma'moun , which is a middle class area located in west Baghdad .
It s a relatively calm residential area with shops that provide the basics and a bit more .
It happened in the morning , as the shops were opening up for their daily business and it occurred right in front of a butchers shop .
Immediately after , we heard that a man living in a house in front of the blast site was hauled off by the Americans because it was said that after the bomb went off , he sniped an Iraqi National Guardsman .
I didnt think much about the story - nothing about it stood out : an explosion and a sniper - hardly an anomaly .
The interesting news started circulating a couple of days later .
People from the area claim that the man was taken away not because he shot anyone , but because he knew too much about the bomb .
Rumor has it that he saw an American patrol passing through the area and pausing at the bomb site minutes before the explosion .
Soon after they drove away , the bomb went off and chaos ensued .
He ran out of his house screaming to the neighbors and bystanders that the Americans had either planted the bomb or seen the bomb and done nothing about it .
He was promptly taken away .
The bombs are mysterious .
Some of them explode in the midst of National Guard and near American troops or Iraqi Police and others explode near mosques , churches , and shops or in the middle of sougs .
One thing that surprises us about the news reports of these bombs is that they are inevitably linked to suicide bombers .
The reality is that some of these bombs are not suicide bombs - they are car bombs that are either being remotely detonated or maybe time bombs .
All we know is that the techniques differ and apparently so do the intentions .
Some will tell you they are resistance .
Some say Chalabi and his thugs are responsible for a number of them .
Others blame Iran and the SCIRI militia Badir .
In any case , they are terrifying .
If you 're close enough , the first sound is a that of an earsplitting blast and the sounds that follow are of a rain of glass , shrapnel and other sharp things .
Then the wails begin- the shrill mechanical wails of an occasional ambulance combined with the wail of car alarms from neighboring vehicles and finally the wail of people trying to sort out their dead and dying from the debris .
The day before yesterday , a bomb fell on Mustansiriya University -
We 've been watching the protests about
Juan Cole has some good links about the topic .
Now Newsweek have retracted the story - obviously under pressure from the White House .
Is it true ?
Probably
We 've seen enough blatant disregard and disrespect for Islam in Iraq the last two years to make this story sound very plausible .
On a daily basis , mosques are raided , clerics are dragged away with bags over their heads Several months ago the world witnessed the execution of an unarmed Iraqi prisoner inside a mosque .
Is this latest so very surprising ?
Detainees coming back after weeks or months in prison talk of being forced to eat pork , not being allowed to pray , being exposed to dogs , having Islam insulted and generally being treated like animals trapped in a small cage .
At the end of the day , it 's not about words or holy books or pork or dogs or any of that .
It 's about what these things symbolize on a personal level .
It is infuriating to see objects that we hold sacred degraded and debased by foreigners who felt the need to travel thousands of kilometers to do this .
That 's not to say that all troops disrespect Islam - some of them seem to genuinely want to understand our beliefs .
It does seem like the people in charge have decided to make degradation and humiliation a policy .
By doing such things , this war is taken to another level - it is no longer a war against terror or terrorists - it is , quite simply , a war against Islam and even secular Muslims are being forced to take sides .

We 've been watching the protests about the Newsweek article with interest .
Im not surprised at the turnout at these protests - the thousands of Muslims angry at the desecration of the Quran .
What did surprise me was the collective shock that seems to have struck the Islamic world like a slap in the face .
How is this shocking ?
It 's terrible and disturbing in the extreme - but how is it shocking ?
After what happened in Abu Ghraib and other Iraqi prisons how is this astonishing ?
American jailers in Afghanistan and Iraq have shown little respect for human life and dignity - why should they be expected to respect a holy book ?
Now Newsweek have retracted the story - obviously under pressure from the White House .
Is it true ?
