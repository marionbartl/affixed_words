It took us a more than a century , but finally this crazy inconsistent theory of relativity got outvoted .
Common sense cries victory !
Fortunately , science does not work that way .
Science is no democracy , and we do not render a theory invalid by popular vote .
Einstein 's theory of relativity has stood the test of time and its correctness is beyond any doubt .
But ... there is an issue with what is arguably the most famous equation in the history of natural sciences .
So what is the problem with Einstein 's mass - energy relation Well , to put it bluntly , there is no such thing as a mass - energy relation .
What does exist is a mass - energy - momentum relation .
The equation Einstein came up with more than a century ago can be considered a degenerate form of the mass - energy - momentum relation for vanishing momentum .
Einstein was very well aware of this , and in later papers repetitively stressed that his mass - energy equation is strictly limited to observers co-moving with the object under study .
However , very , very few people seem to have paid attention to Einstein 's warnings , nor to any of the more recent warnings .
Even worse , the vast majority of authors of popular science books take great liberty in applying E=mcto objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light , and then declare mass to increase with velocity in an attempt to recover consistency in what has become an incoherent mix of relativistic and Newtonian dynamics .
Theoretical physicist Lev Okun refers to this practice as a “ pedagogical virus ” .
What I consider truly amazing , is how few people are aware of the mass - energy - momentum relation .
In contrast to the widely popularized equation E=mc , the mass - energy - momentum relation is a direct result of the fundamental principles of relativity theory , and provides true insight into the basics of relativity .
Moreover , and contrary to what one might expect , the mass - energy - momentum relation is far from complicated .
In fact , the mass - energy - momentum relation does not even need a mathematical equation , a simple drawing with annotations suffices .
Einstein meets Pythagoras : the mass - energy - momentum relation .
In the rectangular triangle , the hypotenuse represents energy times c ( c denoting the speed of light ) , the vertical edge momentum times c , and the base mass times
cThe above figure graphically captures the mass - energy - momentum relation for a particle of mass m and total energy E , moving at velocity v.
The parameter c denotes the speed of light .
Shown is a right triangle with labeled edges .
The hypotenuse labeled Ec is proportional to the energy of the particle , and has length energy E times speed of light c .
The vertical edge labeled Ev is proportional to the momentum of the particle and has length E times v. Finally , the base labeled mcis proportional to the mass of the particle and has length m times
cThe full relativistic kinematics is captured in this annotated triangle .
Knowing two out of the three quantities mass , energy and momentum , using this simple diagram one can easily derive the third .
For instance , suppose one wants to know the total energy of a particle , when given that it moves at a velocity of 3/5 the speed of light .
With v:c equal to 3:5 , it is clear that the vertical edge Ev and the hypotenuse Ec are in the same ratio .
Applying the Pythagorean theorem immediately leads to the conclusion that we are dealing with a 3:4:5 triangle .
Hence , the hypotenuse is 5 / 4 times the base : E = 5/4 mc .
Who told you relativity theory is heavy stuff ?
We can also use the above triangle to derive some generic relativistic results .
For instance , as the vertical edge can not be longer than the hypotenuse , one of the core axioms of relativity follows : no particle can move with a speed v larger than the speed of light c.
Notice that to achieve this result , we do n't need any misleading constructions like ' mass increases with velocity ' .
Also the extreme case of m = 0 , applicable to massless particles like photons , is well captured in the triangle .
For m = 0 the triangle collapses to a vertical line element and it follows immediately that Ev = Ec or v = c. Massless particles move at the speed of light .
Needless to say that Einsteins mass - energy relationship is captured as well in the special case Ev = 0 ( i.e. for the triangle collapsing into a horizontal line element ) .
For those brave enough to battle some math equations : it can also be shown that when Ev is non-zero but much smaller than Ec , the non-relativistic ( Newtonian ) limit is firmly captured in the mass - energy - momentum triangle .
For Ev <<
Ec the triangle takes a flat shape with Ec ≈ mcso that the Pythagorean equation can be written ( Ev ) = ( Ec ) – ( mc= ( Ec + mc ) ( Ec - mc ) ≈ 2 m c( Ec– mc ) .
Hence , Ec – mc= ( Ev ) / 2 mcor E = mc+ ( Ev ) / 2 m c≈ mc+ ( mc / ( 2 mc ) = mc+ mv / 2 .
If you managed to follow this math reasoning , surely you will recognize the well - known Newtonian kinetic energy expression in this result .
A few more relativistic insights are captured in the mass - energy - momentum triangle .
For instance , the mere fact that the momentum edge is labeled not mv ( nor mcv ) but rather Ev is significant .
It stresses the fact that the total energy ( and not mass ) is a measure of inertia .
Once one realizes this , it should be clear that statements like “ mass increases with velocity ” are plainly wrong .
You might wonder , why is it that this mass - energy - momentum relation can be represented in a simple rectangular triangle ?
This question brings us to the heart of Einstein 's relativity theory .
In four - dimensional spacetime , energy and momentum lose their meaning as separate quantities .
Instead , a four - component spacetime vector emerges that describes energy and momentum in a unified fashion .
In loose loose terms one can envision this spacetime vector as a flow of energy at speed v in space and speed c in time .
The space ( Ev ) and time ( Ec ) components of this energy - momentum vector do depend on the frame of reference of the observer , but the length of this vector is an absolute quantity , that is independent of the choice of observe .
This quantity is called mass
In a normal Euclidean space , the length of a vector is determined by a Pythagorean sum of the components .
Spacetime vectors behave subtly different as the space and time components contribute to the vector length with opposing signs .
As a consequence , when grouped into a space and a time component , the length of a spacetime vector is given by the Pythagorean difference of the two components .
What results is a rectangular triangle with the length of the spacetime vector being represented by one of the short edges .
Will we ever see mass - energy - momentum triangles replacing E=mcas slogan on t- shirts ?
I do n't hold my breath .
A technically superior product in itself is unlikely to replace a strong brand .
And “ E=mc ” certainly is a strong brand for 20 century physics .
In fact , it is more than that .
A true symbol and icon of mankind 's intellectual achievements .
The fact that it is more than often represented in an inconsistent way is a shame , but can not take away that luster .

GREEN VALLEY - Arizona ants are going to be famous .
A British film crew spent part of last week in Green Valley shooting scenes for a National Geographic Television film tentatively titled " Planet of the Ants . "
Martin Dohrn , a producer with Ammonite Ltd. in Bristol , England , led a crew that is one week into a 10 - week shoot that will also take them to Europe and Costa Rica .
But why here ?
" Stunning desert , bright sunlight and big , glorious ants , " Dohrn said Friday .
" It 's a gift for filmmakers , really . "
The crew filmed in Sycamore Canyon and central Green Valley .
Their target : red harvester ants and their close cousins , long - legged ants .
" Desert ants are quite easy to find because they always make obvious holes and piles , " Dohrn said , adding that Arizona is known for ant research .
Dohrn is an internationally known natural - history cameraman and producer .
His work has involved everything from lions to flies , including the Emmy - nominated " Terminal Velocity , " about skydiving with peregrine falcons .
In 1990 , he worked on " The Ghosts of Ruby " for the BBC , about wildlife near the Arizona - Mexico border .
" Planet of the Ants , " scheduled to be released in September 2010 , answers the question , " What is it that makes an ant an ant ? "
Dohrn said .
" They have quite a bit of a society , quite a bit of a division of labor , " he said .
Dohrn also planned to film a colony of ants in Phoenix that has set up a police force of sorts in a lab setting .
Trouble - making ants are roughed up and tossed out , he said .
The 10 weeks of shooting will stretch over the next eight months , with the editing process taking another four months , he said .
So how do they get those great camera shots down those tiny ant holes ?
" With great difficulty , " Dohrn said dryly .
The good news is that desert ants " make nice , big holes . "
That , coupled with camera lenses as small as 2 to 3 millimeters , helps get the shot .
Detailed footage of ant behavior is captured using cutaways of colonies in controlled settings .
Getting those shots in the wild , Dohrn said , would be virtually impossible .

Anderso ... by Wayne Price Anarchism , Class Struggle and Political Organization north america / mexico | anarchist movement | opinion / analysis Friday July 24 , 2009 10:21 Friday July 24 , 2009 10:21 by Tom Wetzel by Tom Wetzel tomwetzel at sbcblogal dot net Description of organized class struggle - related anarchism in USA and an explanation and defense of this perspective .
Anarchism , Class Struggle and Political Organization
As Cindy Milstein points out in her essay  Anarchisms Promise for Anti-capitalist Resistance ,  anarchists have been involved in numerous visible protest actions , such as the various protests at meetings promoting corporate globalization from the 1999 " Battle of Seattle " on , or the Direct Action to Stop the War protests in San Francisco in 2002 .
Activists who are already radicalized converge in such actions .
Of course a variety of organizations mobilize to participate in some of these protests , from environmental groups to the unions who mobilized for the 1999 World Trade organization meetings .
But what is the relationship of the anarchists to the other social movements and mass organizations ?
Anarchists are a part of the layer of already - radicalized activists .
But this is a very thin layer in American society .
What about the majority of the population who make up the exploited and oppressed in society ?
What is the relationship between anarchism and anarchist activists and the mass of the population ?
The slogan " the emancipation of the working class must be the work of the workers themselves " was included by Marx in the principles of the " First International " in the 1860s - 70s and anarcho - syndicalists and other social anarchists have always strongly supported this principle .
But what is the relationship between anarchism and anarchists , on the one hand , and the masses who are supposed to be , in libertarian Left thinking , the agency of social transformation ?
Cindy Milstein writes :
" Anarchism has valiantly tried to meld the universalistic aims of the Left and its expansive understanding of freedom with the particularistic goals of the newe social movements in areas such as gender , sexuality , ethnicity , and ableism . "
This is a reasonable summary of much of the discussion and thinking among anarchists , but it does n't quite answer my question about the relationship between anarchism and the mass of the population and their potential for self - liberation .
During the past decade a number of anarchists have developed a critique of various weaknesses in American anarchism , such as anti-organizational prejudices , fragmentation , tyranny of structurelessness  and excessive focus on " actions " without relating this to ongoing mass organizing in workplaces and communities .
Some of the influences on anarchism mentioned by Cindy Milstein ... such as European " autonomism ,  Situationism and the model of the small informal affinity group  ... have contributed to these weaknesses .
Some anarchists believe that any sort of formal or large organization is inevitably authoritarian . 
Some of the anarchists who had been involved in " protest hopping " have , in more recent years , become more interested in workplace and community organizing , building a more long - term presence in working class communities , and building a social base for libertarian Left ideas .
Last year about a hundred activists ( from the USA and Canada ) attended a Class Struggle Anarchist Conference in New York City .
To ensure a productive and friendly experience , the conference was invitation - only .
There were panels on  Anarchists in the workplace ,   Anarchism and Feminism ,   Anarchists in Communities of Color ,   Anarchists in Anti-fascist / Anti-racist Movements  , and a variety of other subjects .
According to the report in issue 14 of Northeastern Anarchist :
 One comrade said that  The discussion went beyond all regional differences , and commonality was emphasized .
The presenters were not afraid to learn from failures , and there was a lack of posturing .
 There was an overall broad class focus ,  said another .... On the panels themselves , one person said  the panels on feminism and communities of color were for everyone , not ... just by those interested in the subjects .
Another comrade said  the focus of the workshops was experiential , not theoretical , but the two ... were merged in many instances .
Since then two inter-organizational discussion bulletins have been produced and another Class Struggle Anarchist Conference is scheduled for later this year .
The purpose of this process is to see what level of agreement we have , share experiences , and develop a better - organized and more coordinated movement .
This process has involved three regional federations ( on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts ) , five local groups ( in the Great Lakes area ) , and one continent - wide organization .
I would estimate that these organizations include between three and four hundred activists ... overwhelmingly people in their 20s and 30s .
I havent obtained permission to name all the groups , but I can say that North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists , Workers Solidarity Alliance and Solidarity & Defense have played a role in initiating and organizing this process .
Except for the continent - wide group ( Workers Solidarity Alliance ) , which was founded 25 years ago , all the groups have been formed within the last decade .
Activists in these groups are involved in anti-racist organizing , support for immigrant rights , for reproductive freedom , tenant organizing , workplace organizing and support for worker struggles , radical popular education , and dissemination of anarchist ideas , among other things .
I would estimate that pro-organizational anarchism with a class struggle perspective in the USA has reached its highest point since World War 2 .
In what follows I m giving my own interpretation of this sector of anarchism .
 Anarchism with a class - struggle perspective doesnt mean it is " class reductionist " but that it disagrees with Bookchin and others who fail to see the continued reality and importance of the class structure that is at the heart of capitalism and the struggle that grows out of this .
To change society , it 's not adequate to appeal to " humanity " or " citizens " in general , as Bookchin proposed .
The capitalist and coordinator classes are also part of humanity but they are entrenched in maintaining their power and privilege .
At the same time , the division of society along the various lines of oppression generates movements and struggles in opposition .
In the years after World War 2 , seeing the increasing cooptation and bureaucratization of unionism in the industrial countries , Bookchin adopted the view that there was , somehow , an epochal change in which struggles in workplaces were no longer relevant to popular empowerment and the struggle for social transformation .
Other anarchists in that era , such as Paul Goodman and Colin Ward , followed a similar path .
In the period of the Cold War , talk of class struggle was also readily associated with Communism .
At its heart capitalism is a system of exploitation of people who are subordinated in the work process , and a continual resistance or tug of war ensues because of this ... sometimes on a small scale , sometimes breaking out in large social events such as general strikes .
Ultimately there is no liberatory replacement for capitalism unless workers are able to gain control over their own productive activities and potentials .
If we take seriously the principle that  the emancipation of the working class is the work of the workers themselves ,  its hard to see how this emancipatory result is going to happen without a movement actively developed by workers themselves .
That said , class is n't just about struggles in workplaces between workers and bosses .
The power of the dominating classes spreads outward throughout society , in their control over the state and media .
Class struggles occur at the point of consumption , among tenants and public transit riders for example .
The working class is highly heterogeneous .
Workers are women , African - Americans , gays and lesbians , skilled and less skilled , and so on .
Many anarchists who work with a class struggle perspective these days operate with an " intersectional " analysis of oppression .
Structural racism and structural gender inequality ( patriarchy ) or homophobia / transphobia have their own sources though they are also exploited by capitalism , to weaken the working class .
It is equally important to fight all of them .
They intersect in the lives of actual working class people .
An African - American woman working as a postal clerk at the post office is subject to the gender , race and class systems , but she lives her life as a totality ... these opprressions are n't in separate worlds .
How does this large and heterogeneous population acquire the ability to change the society ?
Here it is useful to consider the process that Marxists call " class formation . "
" Class formation " is the more or less protracted process by which the working class develops from an objectively oppressed group ... a class " in itself " ... into a group with the consciousness and capacity to liberate itself ... a class " for itself , " in Marx 's words .
People are shaped by the power relations and oppressive systems they face within the current society .
Workers are in a relatively powerless position and , if they are isolated , may have little sense of having an ability to change things .
The social relations of production may develop a conflicted consciousness ... both resentment and also going along or deference , or even accepting the idea that the bosses must be the right people to make the decisions because they have more formal eduation .
These same social relations in the work process also encourage the managers and professionals and owners to have a bloated sense of their entitlement to make the decisions .
Much of the working class is forced into dead - end or de-skilled jobs where they have few opportunities to develop themselves , their knowledge or sense of self - esteem .
Working class people are also less likely to have access to resources to help them develop their knowledge , such as college education or better schools .
There are effects of this we need to consider .
First , this tends to generate passivity and inaction , if a person does n't see collective struggle as an avenue for enhancement of their circumstances .
And , second , it also generates inequality in skills and knowledge that can effect the way organizations or movements are run .
Gender and race / national oppression also shape this inequality .
This also tells us why a liberatory social transformation is unlikely to occur " spontaneously " ... contrary to the thinking of " autonomists " and some anarchists .
As Marx pointed out , it is through the process of mass struggle and building their own movements that the working class ... the oppressed and exploited in general ... develop themselves ... their knowledge and capacities to effectively " self - manage " their own movements and create the conditions for their social liberation .
Because collective action can be a source of power ... as when workers shut down a workplace , it encourages a belief in the ability of the participants to make change .
Developing a unity of social movements that develop in opposition to the various forms of oppression that working class people are subject to is an essential part of this process .
I believe this presupposes that people from a variety of backgrounds and situations and movements have an opportunity to come together to explore their concerns and achieve mutual understanding .
To have the power to transform the society , the various social movements and strands of struggle have to come together , to forge a unity through alliance .
To be an authentic alliance , it must take seriously and incorporate the concerns of the various movements .
In my own essay in the Reimagining Society discussion I referred to this as a labor / social movement alliance .
That is , the mass organizations created by workers in the struggles with the employers develop an alliance with other social movements that emerge in the struggles against the various forms of oppression in society .
In a period of fundamental challenge to the dominating classes , this alliance might be expressed through the kind of decision - making body that Ezekiel Adamovsky calls an assembly of the social movements . 
Thus I think anarchists who emphasize organization and a class struggle perspective see mass struggles and mass organizing as the process for changing society ... because it is through the active participation of growing numbers of ordinary people , building and controlling their own movements , that they develop the capacity and aspirations for changing society .
From the point of view of " organized anarchism with a class - struggle perspective , " two kinds of organization are needed : ( 1 ) forms of mass organization through which ordinary people can grow and develop their collective strength , and ( 2 ) political organizations of the anarchist or libertarian socialist minority , to have a more effective means to coordinate our activities , gain influence in working class communities , and disseminate our ideas .
In the World War 1 era , Italian anarchists coined the term " dual organization " for this perspective .
An organization does not have to be large to be a " mass organization " as I 'm using this term .
If 30 tenants in a building get together and have meetings and form a tenants union , this is a " mass organization . "
A mass organization is put together to fight in some area and people join because they support the aims ... such as having a union at work to oppose management or an organization at a college to fight tuition hikes .
Membership in a political organization , on the other hand , is based on agreement with a particular ideology or political perspective .
A political organization is desireable for a variety of reasons .
To pool resources for projects , to provide each other feedback and support , to achieve greater public visibility for social anarchism , to coordinate organizing .
We learn from trying to put our ideas into practice , and political organizations enable activists to discuss lessons of practical experience and develop their ideas .
Of course , a major historical example of dual organizational anarchism with a class - struggle perspective was in the Spanish revolution in the 30s .
The Iberian Anarchist Federation ( FAI ) was formed as a loose federation of groups active in the National Confederation of Labor ( CNT ) .
It was formed originally to better coordinate responses to efforts by a Leninist organization ( a predecessor of the POUM ) to gain control of CNT unions , also opposition to tendencies of some union officials to become less accountable to the rank and file .
Spanish anarchism of that era was dual in three ways .
First , there was the distinction between the political organization ( FAI ) and the mass organizations - both neighborhood centers and CNT unions .
Second , in addition to the FAI there was another anarchist political organization  Mujeres Libres .
This was an organization dedicated to the organizing of poor peasant and urban working class women .
The activists in this organization were anarcho - syndicalists but they viewed womens liberation and class liberation as distinct , equally important , aspects of social liberation .
And , third , class struggle was viewed as occurring not only in workplaces but also in the community .
In the mid-20s anarcho - syndicalist union activists had begun to worry about being boxed in through collective bargaining with employers .
Catalan syndicalist theoretician Joan Peiro recommended building neighborhood organizations and developing a broad discussion over issues of importance to workers outside the workplace .
This organizing eventually led to the massive rent strike in Barcelona in 1931 , which brought into action new sectors of the population ... for example , women played a dominant role in the rent strike .
It was because of this experience with community struggle that the anarcho - syndicalist movement in Spain modified its vision  at its congress in May 1936 , adding neighborhood assemblies and resident - based councils as an equal building block of governance in a libertarian socialist society along with workplace assemblies and worker councils .
Bookchin also drew on this concept of libertarian municipality  rooted in assemblies .
But this was not separate from class struggle .
Most of the actual free municipalities  formed in the revolution of 1936 were in rural villages and towns in Aragon .
But it was the CNT rural unions who took the initiative to overthrow the old municipal councils , invoke an assembly of the residents , elect a new revolutionary commmittee , and collectivize land .
The collectivization of land was directed in particular against the Spanish kulak class ... wealthy farmers who employed farm hands .
The aim of both the Socialist and anarchist rural unions in Spain was destruction of wage - slavery in the countryside .
This is why the rural unions insisted that no farmer could privately control more land than he could farm through his own labor .
During the Spanish revolution in 1936 the FAI moved away from the very affinity group model that Bookchin recommended .
To have a more effective organization to counter the growing influence of the Communist Party , the FAI moved to large geographic chapters .
After this change the FAI grew to 140,000 members .
In recent years many dual organizational working class - oriented anarchists in the USA have moved away from the older model of an anarchist federation formed as a link among pre-existing collectives .
Through various experiences with such formations , from the 70s to more recent years , it was found that this tends to get in the way of the level of theoretical and practical unity needed to work effectively together .
Thus many dual organizational anarchists these days tend to think in terms of a unitary organization based on a common program and individual membership , with local branches and a federal council of delegates of some sort .
Dual organizational class struggle - oriented anarchism continued to have a social base in some countries after World War 2 ... particularly in South America .
In the decades leading up to the military takeover in Uruguay , the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation ( FAU ) had a significant influence in the CNT labor federation and in the housing movement , and also played a role in the resistance ( including armed struggle ) to the dictatorship .
The legacy of the FAU in that era and the ideas it developed from its experience are still an important influence on South American anarchism .
I will mention one of the FAUs ideas that I agree with ... the idea of social insertion . 
They believed it was necessary for the anarchist activists to be committed to long - term involvement in organizations and struggles in workplaces and neighborhoods .
The role of the organized anarchist minority is not to try to gain top - down control through bodies such as executive commmittees or manipulate to impose its line on the mass organization .
Rather , through their long term involvement and personable relations with others they can gain an influence and be a voice for self - management of organizations and for militant collective action .
The development of the working class is an organic process but the activists and rank - and - file organizers can play a role .
Dual organizational anarchists often say that the role of the anarchist political organization is to win the battle of ideas ,  that is , to gain influence within movements and among the mass of the population by countering authoritarian or liberal or conservative ideas .
Bakunin had said that the role of anarchist activists was a leadership of ideas . 
But disseminating ideas is nt the only form of influence .
Working with others of diverse views in mass organizations and struggles , exhibiting a genuine commitment , and being a personable and supportive person in this context also builds personal connections , and makes it more likely ones ideas will be taken seriously .
How does this conception of the anarchist political organization differ from vanguardism ?
To answer this question we need to start with some idea of what  the vanguard is .
I think there are two aspects to this .
Both anarchists and Marxists in the past have talked about uneven consciousness  within the working class population .
People vary in terms of how far they aspire to change society for example or to the knowledge they gained about how capitalism works , and so on .
But also there are some people who exhibit more leadership skills than others ... speaking ability , self - confidence , a disposition to take initiative , ability to articulate a viewpoint or rally others behind them , ability to write , self - education about various aspects of society , knowledge about how to organize .
This is shaped by various things , including past experience , being involved in organizations , and the kinds of differences in skills , confidence and education that reflect a society that is unequal along class , gender , and race / nationality lines .
To put it another way , some people have more human capital as far as being effective in , and disposed to , activism and organizing .
Thus understood , the vanguard within the working class consists of the layer of people who are active , do organizing , have some influence through the sorts of leadership qualities Ive referred to , take on leadership positions in organizations , can articulate and theorize situations and do things like publishing leaflets and newsletters .
The vanguard in this sense is extremely various in its ideas but most right now may not be anti-capitalist in their thinking .
The idea of a vanguard party  is that a political organization is to try to draw to it the layer of the working class that has these sorts of leadership qualities and to use this human capital to achieve a hegemonic position within mass movements .
It s aim is to use this position of dominant influence to eventually achieve power for its party .
And along the way it also thinks in terms of achieving power within the various union or mass movement organizations .
This means congealing the partys power through various methods of hierarchical control .
This is formal leadership power and not just influence .
Moreover , the idea is that the partys dominant position would flow from its relative monopolization over a certain kind of theoretical knowledge  its absorption of Marxist theory  which is supposed to provide effective guidance for the success of a revolutionary movement .
Putting aside the question of the value of Marxist - Leninist theory , a libertarian Left approach to this question should differ from the vanguard party  concept in two ways .
First , the aim of libertarian socialism is that the masses themselves should achieve power , through mass direct democracy , not that a leadership group should do so through a party gaining control of a state .
Reflecting this , the aim of the libertarian Left activists should be to encourage self - management of movements / organizations .
After the October 1917 revolution in Russia , most of the worlds libertarian syndicalist labor organizations ... which then had a membership of 3 to 4 million ... affiliated tentatively to the new labor international initiated by the Russian Communist Party .
However , at the actual founding conference the libertarian syndicalists were confronted by Communist Party officials insisting that the union organizations should be mere transmission belts of the Communist Parties in their respective countries .
This led the libertarian syndicalist unions to withdraw .
Autonomy of the mass movements is itself a libertarian socialist principle .
Second , we shouldnt take for granted the unequal distribution of human capital crafted by a highly ineqalitarian and oppressive society .
Although  We Are All Leaders  is maybe not always an accurate description of what is , it should be the ideal that we strive towards .
We need methods of working against the relative monopolization of skills and knowledge and organizational resources in the hands of a minority .
Historically when some activists and organizers gain knowledge through practical experience , it often happens that members of that organization become dependent on them .
This was part of the process that led to bureaucratization of unions in the USA .
Thus working to make rank and file self - management effective requires that we have conscious programs and methods for democratizing knowledge , doing popular education , nurturing people as organizers , developing skills from writing to public speaking to theorizing ones experience .
For example , local worker schools that draw on the experience of activists and organizers who teach , or share their experiences with , classes .
In the 30s in Spain the Mujeres Libres activists talked about a process of capacitacion  developing the capacities of ordinary people .
This was the focus of their organizing of working class women .
They created literacy classes , public speaking classes , and circles to study social theory , created child care programs , and worked with the anarcho - syndicalist unions to develop apprentice programs for women .
These were all part of their efforts at developing the capacities of women for effective participation in the unions and other organizatins and control over their lives .
Direct democracy is necessary but not sufficient for effective self - management of movements .
People are better able to participate effectively as knowledge is democratized and skills are more widely developed .
This prefigures the more equal sharing of resources to develop peoples potential in a libertarian socialist society .
As Cindy Milstein points out in her essay  Anarchisms Promise for Anti-capitalist Resistance ,  anarchists have been involved in numerous visible protest actions , such as the various protests at meetings promoting corporate globalization from the 1999 " Battle of Seattle " on , or the Direct Action to Stop the War protests in San Francisco in 2002 .
Activists who are already radicalized converge in such actions .
Of course a variety of organizations mobilize to participate in some of these protests , from environmental groups to the unions who mobilized for the 1999 World Trade organization meetings .
But what is the relationship of the anarchists to the other social movements and mass organizations ?
Anarchists are a part of the layer of already - radicalized activists .
But this is a very thin layer in American society .
What about the majority of the population who make up the exploited and oppressed in society ?
What is the relationship between anarchism and anarchist activists and the mass of the population ?
The slogan " the emancipation of the working class must be the work of the workers themselves " was included by Marx in the principles of the " First International " in the 1860s - 70s and anarcho - syndicalists and other social anarchists have always strongly supported this principle .
But what is the relationship between anarchism and anarchists , on the one hand , and the masses who are supposed to be , in libertarian Left thinking , the agency of social transformation ?
Cindy Milstein writes : This is a reasonable summary of much of the discussion and thinking among anarchists , but it does n't quite answer my question about the relationship between anarchism and the mass of the population and their potential for self - liberation .
During the past decade a number of anarchists have developed a critique of various weaknesses in American anarchism , such as anti-organizational prejudices , fragmentation , tyranny of structurelessness  and excessive focus on " actions " without relating this to ongoing mass organizing in workplaces and communities .
Some of the influences on anarchism mentioned by Cindy Milstein ... such as European " autonomism ,  Situationism and the model of the small informal affinity group  ... have contributed to these weaknesses .
Some anarchists believe that any sort of formal or large organization is inevitably authoritarian .
Some of the anarchists who had been involved in " protest hopping " have , in more recent years , become more interested in workplace and community organizing , building a more long - term presence in working class communities , and building a social base for libertarian Left ideas .
Last year about a hundred activists ( from the USA and Canada ) attended a Class Struggle Anarchist Conference in New York City .
To ensure a productive and friendly experience , the conference was invitation - only .
There were panels on  Anarchists in the workplace ,   Anarchism and Feminism ,   Anarchists in Communities of Color ,   Anarchists in Anti-fascist / Anti-racist Movements  , and a variety of other subjects .
According to the report in issue 14 of Northeastern Anarchist : Since then two inter-organizational discussion bulletins have been produced and another Class Struggle Anarchist Conference is scheduled for later this year .
The purpose of this process is to see what level of agreement we have , share experiences , and develop a better - organized and more coordinated movement .
This process has involved three regional federations ( on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts ) , five local groups ( in the Great Lakes area ) , and one continent - wide organization .
I would estimate that these organizations include between three and four hundred activists ... overwhelmingly people in their 20s and 30s .
I havent obtained permission to name all the groups , but I can say that North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists , Workers Solidarity Alliance and Solidarity & Defense have played a role in initiating and organizing this process .
Except for the continent - wide group ( Workers Solidarity Alliance ) , which was founded 25 years ago , all the groups have been formed within the last decade .
Activists in these groups are involved in anti-racist organizing , support for immigrant rights , for reproductive freedom , tenant organizing , workplace organizing and support for worker struggles , radical popular education , and dissemination of anarchist ideas , among other things .
I would estimate that pro-organizational anarchism with a class struggle perspective in the USA has reached its highest point since World War 2 .
In what follows I m giving my own interpretation of this sector of anarchism .
Anarchism with a class - struggle perspective doesnt mean it is " class reductionist " but that it disagrees with Bookchin and others who fail to see the continued reality and importance of the class structure that is at the heart of capitalism and the struggle that grows out of this .
To change society , it 's not adequate to appeal to " humanity " or " citizens " in general , as Bookchin proposed .
The capitalist and coordinator classes are also part of humanity but they are entrenched in maintaining their power and privilege .
At the same time , the division of society along the various lines of oppression generates movements and struggles in opposition .
In the years after World War 2 , seeing the increasing cooptation and bureaucratization of unionism in the industrial countries , Bookchin adopted the view that there was , somehow , an epochal change in which struggles in workplaces were no longer relevant to popular empowerment and the struggle for social transformation .
Other anarchists in that era , such as Paul Goodman and Colin Ward , followed a similar path .
In the period of the Cold War , talk of class struggle was also readily associated with Communism .
At its heart capitalism is a system of exploitation of people who are subordinated in the work process , and a continual resistance or tug of war ensues because of this ... sometimes on a small scale , sometimes breaking out in large social events such as general strikes .
Ultimately there is no liberatory replacement for capitalism unless workers are able to gain control over their own productive activities and potentials .
If we take seriously the principle that  the emancipation of the working class is the work of the workers themselves ,  its hard to see how this emancipatory result is going to happen without a movement actively developed by workers themselves .
That said , class is n't just about struggles in workplaces between workers and bosses .
The power of the dominating classes spreads outward throughout society , in their control over the state and media .
Class struggles occur at the point of consumption , among tenants and public transit riders for example .
The working class is highly heterogeneous .
Workers are women , African - Americans , gays and lesbians , skilled and less skilled , and so on .
Many anarchists who work with a class struggle perspective these days operate with an " intersectional " analysis of oppression .
Structural racism and structural gender inequality ( patriarchy ) or homophobia / transphobia have their own sources though they are also exploited by capitalism , to weaken the working class .
It is equally important to fight all of them .
They intersect in the lives of actual working class people .
An African - American woman working as a postal clerk at the post office is subject to the gender , race and class systems , but she lives her life as a totality ... these opprressions are n't in separate worlds .
How does this large and heterogeneous population acquire the ability to change the society ?
Here it is useful to consider the process that Marxists call " class formation . "
" Class formation " is the more or less protracted process by which the working class develops from an objectively oppressed group ... a class " in itself " ... into a group with the consciousness and capacity to liberate itself ... a class " for itself , " in Marx 's words .
People are shaped by the power relations and oppressive systems they face within the current society .
Workers are in a relatively powerless position and , if they are isolated , may have little sense of having an ability to change things .
The social relations of production may develop a conflicted consciousness ... both resentment and also going along or deference , or even accepting the idea that the bosses must be the right people to make the decisions because they have more formal eduation .
These same social relations in the work process also encourage the managers and professionals and owners to have a bloated sense of their entitlement to make the decisions .
Much of the working class is forced into dead - end or de-skilled jobs where they have few opportunities to develop themselves , their knowledge or sense of self - esteem .
Working class people are also less likely to have access to resources to help them develop their knowledge , such as college education or better schools .
There are effects of this we need to consider .
First , this tends to generate passivity and inaction , if a person does n't see collective struggle as an avenue for enhancement of their circumstances .
And , second , it also generates inequality in skills and knowledge that can effect the way organizations or movements are run .
Gender and race / national oppression also shape this inequality .
This also tells us why a liberatory social transformation is unlikely to occur " spontaneously " ... contrary to the thinking of " autonomists " and some anarchists .
As Marx pointed out , it is through the process of mass struggle and building their own movements that the working class ... the oppressed and exploited in general ... develop themselves ... their knowledge and capacities to effectively " self - manage " their own movements and create the conditions for their social liberation .
Because collective action can be a source of power ... as when workers shut down a workplace , it encourages a belief in the ability of the participants to make change .
Developing a unity of social movements that develop in opposition to the various forms of oppression that working class people are subject to is an essential part of this process .
I believe this presupposes that people from a variety of backgrounds and situations and movements have an opportunity to come together to explore their concerns and achieve mutual understanding .
To have the power to transform the society , the various social movements and strands of struggle have to come together , to forge a unity through alliance .
To be an authentic alliance , it must take seriously and incorporate the concerns of the various movements .
In my own essay in the Reimagining Society discussion I referred to this as a labor / social movement alliance .
That is , the mass organizations created by workers in the struggles with the employers develop an alliance with other social movements that emerge in the struggles against the various forms of oppression in society .
In a period of fundamental challenge to the dominating classes , this alliance might be expressed through the kind of decision - making body that Ezekiel Adamovsky calls an assembly of the social movements .
Thus I think anarchists who emphasize organization and a class struggle perspective see mass struggles and mass organizing as the process for changing society ... because it is through the active participation of growing numbers of ordinary people , building and controlling their own movements , that they develop the capacity and aspirations for changing society .
From the point of view of " organized anarchism with a class - struggle perspective , " two kinds of organization are needed : ( 1 ) forms of mass organization through which ordinary people can grow and develop their collective strength , and ( 2 ) political organizations of the anarchist or libertarian socialist minority , to have a more effective means to coordinate our activities , gain influence in working class communities , and disseminate our ideas .
In the World War 1 era , Italian anarchists coined the term " dual organization " for this perspective .
An organization does not have to be large to be a " mass organization " as I 'm using this term .
If 30 tenants in a building get together and have meetings and form a tenants union , this is a " mass organization . "
A mass organization is put together to fight in some area and people join because they support the aims ... such as having a union at work to oppose management or an organization at a college to fight tuition hikes .
Membership in a political organization , on the other hand , is based on agreement with a particular ideology or political perspective .
A political organization is desireable for a variety of reasons .
To pool resources for projects , to provide each other feedback and support , to achieve greater public visibility for social anarchism , to coordinate organizing .
We learn from trying to put our ideas into practice , and political organizations enable activists to discuss lessons of practical experience and develop their ideas .
Of course , a major historical example of dual organizational anarchism with a class - struggle perspective was in the Spanish revolution in the 30s .
The Iberian Anarchist Federation ( FAI ) was formed as a loose federation of groups active in the National Confederation of Labor ( CNT ) .
It was formed originally to better coordinate responses to efforts by a Leninist organization ( a predecessor of the POUM ) to gain control of CNT unions , also opposition to tendencies of some union officials to become less accountable to the rank and file .
Spanish anarchism of that era was dual in three ways .
First , there was the distinction between the political organization ( FAI ) and the mass organizations - both neighborhood centers and CNT unions .
Second , in addition to the FAI there was another anarchist political organization  Mujeres Libres .
This was an organization dedicated to the organizing of poor peasant and urban working class women .
The activists in this organization were anarcho - syndicalists but they viewed womens liberation and class liberation as distinct , equally important , aspects of social liberation .
And , third , class struggle was viewed as occurring not only in workplaces but also in the community .
In the mid-20s anarcho - syndicalist union activists had begun to worry about being boxed in through collective bargaining with employers .
Catalan syndicalist theoretician Joan Peiro recommended building neighborhood organizations and developing a broad discussion over issues of importance to workers outside the workplace .
This organizing eventually led to the massive rent strike in Barcelona in 1931 , which brought into action new sectors of the population ... for example , women played a dominant role in the rent strike .
It was because of this experience with community struggle that the anarcho - syndicalist movement in Spain modified its vision  at its congress in May 1936 , adding neighborhood assemblies and resident - based councils as an equal building block of governance in a libertarian socialist society along with workplace assemblies and worker councils .
Bookchin also drew on this concept of libertarian municipality  rooted in assemblies .
But this was not separate from class struggle .
Most of the actual free municipalities  formed in the revolution of 1936 were in rural villages and towns in Aragon .
But it was the CNT rural unions who took the initiative to overthrow the old municipal councils , invoke an assembly of the residents , elect a new revolutionary commmittee , and collectivize land .
The collectivization of land was directed in particular against the Spanish kulak class ... wealthy farmers who employed farm hands .
The aim of both the Socialist and anarchist rural unions in Spain was destruction of wage - slavery in the countryside .
This is why the rural unions insisted that no farmer could privately control more land than he could farm through his own labor .
During the Spanish revolution in 1936 the FAI moved away from the very affinity group model that Bookchin recommended .
To have a more effective organization to counter the growing influence of the Communist Party , the FAI moved to large geographic chapters .
After this change the FAI grew to 140,000 members .
In recent years many dual organizational working class - oriented anarchists in the USA have moved away from the older model of an anarchist federation formed as a link among pre-existing collectives .
Through various experiences with such formations , from the 70s to more recent years , it was found that this tends to get in the way of the level of theoretical and practical unity needed to work effectively together .
Thus many dual organizational anarchists these days tend to think in terms of a unitary organization based on a common program and individual membership , with local branches and a federal council of delegates of some sort .
Dual organizational class struggle - oriented anarchism continued to have a social base in some countries after World War 2 ... particularly in South America .
In the decades leading up to the military takeover in Uruguay , the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation ( FAU ) had a significant influence in the CNT labor federation and in the housing movement , and also played a role in the resistance ( including armed struggle ) to the dictatorship .
The legacy of the FAU in that era and the ideas it developed from its experience are still an important influence on South American anarchism .
I will mention one of the FAUs ideas that I agree with ... the idea of social insertion . 
They believed it was necessary for the anarchist activists to be committed to long - term involvement in organizations and struggles in workplaces and neighborhoods .
The role of the organized anarchist minority is not to try to gain top - down control through bodies such as executive commmittees or manipulate to impose its line on the mass organization .
Rather , through their long term involvement and personable relations with others they can gain an influence and be a voice for self - management of organizations and for militant collective action .
The development of the working class is an organic process but the activists and rank - and - file organizers can play a role .
Dual organizational anarchists often say that the role of the anarchist political organization is to win the battle of ideas ,  that is , to gain influence within movements and among the mass of the population by countering authoritarian or liberal or conservative ideas .
Bakunin had said that the role of anarchist activists was a leadership of ideas .
But disseminating ideas is nt the only form of influence .
Working with others of diverse views in mass organizations and struggles , exhibiting a genuine commitment , and being a personable and supportive person in this context also builds personal connections , and makes it more likely ones ideas will be taken seriously .
How does this conception of the anarchist political organization differ from vanguardism ?
To answer this question we need to start with some idea of what  the vanguard is .
I think there are two aspects to this .
Both anarchists and Marxists in the past have talked about uneven consciousness  within the working class population .
People vary in terms of how far they aspire to change society for example or to the knowledge they gained about how capitalism works , and so on .
But also there are some people who exhibit more leadership skills than others ... speaking ability , self - confidence , a disposition to take initiative , ability to articulate a viewpoint or rally others behind them , ability to write , self - education about various aspects of society , knowledge about how to organize .
This is shaped by various things , including past experience , being involved in organizations , and the kinds of differences in skills , confidence and education that reflect a society that is unequal along class , gender , and race / nationality lines .
To put it another way , some people have more human capital as far as being effective in , and disposed to , activism and organizing .
Thus understood , the vanguard  within the working class consists of the layer of people who are active , do organizing , have some influence through the sorts of leadership qualities Ive referred to , take on leadership positions in organizations , can articulate and theorize situations and do things like publishing leaflets and newsletters .
The vanguard in this sense is extremely various in its ideas but most right now may not be anti-capitalist in their thinking .
The idea of a vanguard party  is that a political organization is to try to draw to it the layer of the working class that has these sorts of leadership qualities and to use this human capital to achieve a hegemonic position within mass movements .
It s aim is to use this position of dominant influence to eventually achieve power for its party .
And along the way it also thinks in terms of achieving power within the various union or mass movement organizations .
This means congealing the partys power through various methods of hierarchical control .
This is formal leadership power and not just influence .
Moreover , the idea is that the partys dominant position would flow from its relative monopolization over a certain kind of theoretical knowledge  its absorption of Marxist theory  which is supposed to provide effective guidance for the success of a revolutionary movement .
Putting aside the question of the value of Marxist - Leninist theory , a libertarian Left approach to this question should differ from the vanguard party  concept in two ways .
First , the aim of libertarian socialism is that the masses themselves should achieve power , through mass direct democracy , not that a leadership group should do so through a party gaining control of a state .
Reflecting this , the aim of the libertarian Left activists should be to encourage self - management of movements / organizations .
After the October 1917 revolution in Russia , most of the worlds libertarian syndicalist labor organizations ... which then had a membership of 3 to 4 million ... affiliated tentatively to the new labor international initiated by the Russian Communist Party .
However , at the actual founding conference the libertarian syndicalists were confronted by Communist Party officials insisting that the union organizations should be mere transmission belts of the Communist Parties in their respective countries .
This led the libertarian syndicalist unions to withdraw .
Autonomy of the mass movements is itself a libertarian socialist principle .
Second , we shouldnt take for granted the unequal distribution of human capital crafted by a highly ineqalitarian and oppressive society .
Although  We Are All Leaders  is maybe not always an accurate description of what is , it should be the ideal that we strive towards .
We need methods of working against the relative monopolization of skills and knowledge and organizational resources in the hands of a minority .
Historically when some activists and organizers gain knowledge through practical experience , it often happens that members of that organization become dependent on them .
This was part of the process that led to bureaucratization of unions in the USA .
Thus working to make rank and file self - management effective requires that we have conscious programs and methods for democratizing knowledge , doing popular education , nurturing people as organizers , developing skills from writing to public speaking to theorizing ones experience .
For example , local worker schools that draw on the experience of activists and organizers who teach , or share their experiences with , classes .
In the 30s in Spain the Mujeres Libres activists talked about a process of capacitacion  developing the capacities of ordinary people .
This was the focus of their organizing of working class women .
They created literacy classes , public speaking classes , and circles to study social theory , created child care programs , and worked with the anarcho - syndicalist unions to develop apprentice programs for women .
These were all part of their efforts at developing the capacities of women for effective participation in the unions and other organizatins and control over their lives .
Direct democracy is necessary but not sufficient for effective self - management of movements .
People are better able to participate effectively as knowledge is democratized and skills are more widely developed .
This prefigures the more equal sharing of resources to develop peoples potential in a libertarian socialist society .

So last night Rep. Kathy Castor held a health care reform town hall meeting in Tampa , Florida , a meeting crashed by wingnuts yelling " Tyranny !
Tyranny !
Tyranny ! " , and a riot basically broke out .
Reports the St. Petersburg Times :
" Tyranny !
Tyranny ! Tyranny ! " dozens of people shouted as U.S. Rep.
Kathy Castor , D - Tampa , struggled to talk about health insurance reforms under consideration in Washington , D.C. " There is more consensus than there is disagreement when you get right down to it , '' Castor offered , immediately drowned out by groans and boos .
She pressed on , mostly unheard among screams from the audience estimated by Tampa police to be about 1,500 .
" Tell the truth !
Tell the truth ! "
" Read the bill ! " " Forty - million illegals !
Forty million illegals ! "
So who were these unhinged animals ?
Where did they come from ?
Who inspired them ?
We 'll give you one guess .
Hundreds of vocal critics turned out , many of them saying they had been spurred on through the Tampa 912 activist group promoted by conservative radio and television personality Glenn Beck .
Others had received e-mails from the Hillsborough Republican Party that urged people to speak out against the plan and offered talking points .
Glenn Beck !
Shocking , right ?
Here 's a couple of the videos that popped up on YouTube tonight , one from inside the hall and the other from outside as the angry right - wing mob tries to storm the meeting hall after it was filled to capacity .
This sort of nonsense is only going to escalate over the next month , so buckle your seat belts .
Lingerie Day
Não há ABSOLUTAMENTE NADA de errado e feio em admirar a beleza feminina .
E as feminazis com seu discursinho de que “ mulher que se expõe é tudo puta e biscate ” tão soando mais machista do que qualquer homem que eu já interagi na vida .
Se o seu valor está nas roupas que você usa , que valor você tem ?
Mas fazer o que .
Somos o Brasil , um país dividido entre a sexualidade naturalmente latina e a influência religiosa de séculos .
Só mesmo o brasileiro poderia simultaneamente tolerar imagens de mulhers nuas em plena via pública sendo transmitidas em rede nacional em horário nobre ( É A NOSSA CULTURA !!!!! ) , e condenar meninas que publicam fotos de 300x300 pixels mostrando a renda da calcinha ( MAS QUE POUCA VERGONHA !!!!! ) .
Sabe quando algum filho da puta divulga fotos íntimas da ex-namorada sem autorização , e uma cambada de imbecil corre pra demonizar a menina nos scraps dela ?
Curioso que poucos criticam o sujeito que postou as imagens - ele é o comedor .
Já a vítima é uma vagabunda , uma puta .
Isso é um retrato da nossa cultura machista , e isso é essencialmente a mesma coisa que as “ feministas ” tão fazendo .
Depois do #lingerieday , sinto que floodar com impropérios o scrap de uma menina que passou por isso é a postura feminista padrão .
Porque na cabeça das feministas , parece que funciona assim :
“ Oi @fulana , vi sua foto no #lingerieday .
Muito bacana , gostei :) ” = PORCO CHAUVINISTA
“ Olha essa vagabunda da @fulana participando do #lingerieday !!!! ” = LÍDER DA LUTA FEMINISTA
E depois nós somos os machistas opressores da liberdade feminina ?
Pff .

The Arctic Sea was reportedly boarded by up to 10 gunmen Russia 's navy has been deployed to find a ship reportedly hijacked three weeks ago in the Baltic Sea .
Up to five vessels - reported to include nuclear submarines - will be involved in the search for the Maltese - flagged Arctic Sea , the navy confirmed .
It has a 15 - strong Russian crew and was reportedly taking timber worth $ 1.5 m ( £ 900,000 ) from Finland to Algeria when it was boarded by gunmen on 24 July .
The Arctic Sea was last sighted off the north coast of France on 30 July .
British authorities say the 4,000 - tonne vessel may have been spotted subsequently by a Portuguese coastal patrol aircraft , but its current location remains unknown .
Maltese authorities have said it is unlikely to be in the Mediterranean .
Click here for a map charting sightings of the Arctic Sea " It would appear that the ship has not approached the Straits of Gibraltar , which indicates that the ship is headed out into the Atlantic Ocean , " the Malta Maritime Authority said in a statement .
The Portuguese Navy too has said that the missing cargo ship has not passed through Portuguese waters .
Massive search Russian naval commander Adm Vladimir Vysotsky told Itar - Tass news agency that all Russian navy ships in the Atlantic had joined the search for the vessel .
There did n't seem anything suspicious when contact was made .
It could well be that a crew member had a gun put to his head
Mark Clark
Maritime and Coastguard Agency Operations will be centred on the patrol ship Ladny , which is part of Russia 's Black Sea fleet .
UK authorities , which made contact with the Arctic Sea before it entered the busy shipping waters of the English channel , described the situation as " bizarre " .
" Who would think that a hijacked ship could pass through one of the most policed and concentrated waters in the world ? " said Mark Clark of the UK's Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) .
" There did n't seem anything suspicious when contact was made , " he added .
" It could well be that a crew member had a gun put to his head by a hijacker when contact was made . "
The Finnish shipping line operating the ship reportedly said it was boarded by up to 10 armed men claiming to be anti-drugs police as it sailed through the Baltic Sea on 24 July .
But the intruders are reported to have left the vessel 12 hours later on an inflatable boat , and it is unclear who is in current command of the ship .
Commercial dispute ?
The Arctic Sea had been scheduled to dock in the Algerian port of Bejaia on 4 August .
While world leaders have become increasingly concerned about pirates operating off the coast of Somalia , maritime experts suggest the case of the Arctic Sea reflects a different kind of piracy .
Nick Davis , who runs the private security firm Anti-Piracy Maritime Security Solutions , told the BBC that the relatively low value of the cargo suggested the ship 's seizure may be the result of a " commercial dispute " in which one party had decided to " take matters into their own hands " .
But he added : " Piracy is piracy - if someone 's wanting to take that vessel , and they 're not authorised , and they use a speedboat to go and get it , then it's no different to what the Somalis do . "
Relatives of the Arctic Sea 's 15 crew members - all of whom are said to come from the northern Russian port city of Arkhangelsk - have so far been unwilling to speak to the media .

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
Naked , bound and blindfolded , a crudely shot video shows a man being pushed to the ground by men wearing what appear to be military , camouflage fatigues .
Sri Lanka 's military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara claims the video was staged .
One of the men kicks the blindfolded man in the back .
Another man raises a gun , points it at the back of the man 's head and pulls the trigger .
A loud crack is heard ; the man slumps to the ground .
Off - camera , someone can be heard saying in Sinhala , the majority language of Sri Lanka , " I think he looked back . "
The execution - style shooting is repeated with a second man , also bound and naked .
Off - camera , a voice can be heard saying , " This is like hitting midgets . "
All the while someone is recording the scene , apparently with a cellphone camera .
Panning across the open field , the camera reveals nine bodies , some lying in pools of blood .
From the video alone , it 's impossible to tell who they were or who killed them .
The video was obtained by Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka , an advocacy group based in Berlin , Germany , that accuses the Sri Lankan government of harassing and intimidating journalists .
CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the video nor could it determine when or where it was shot , but sources in Sri Lanka told CNN they believe it was shot in January as the army closed in on the remnants of the Tigers .
Journalists for Democracy says it is evidence of atrocities committed during the final months of the 26 - year conflict that became infamous for its merciless killing : the jungle warfare between the Sri Lankan army and the Tamil Tiger rebels .
Each side has accused the other of atrocities , though evidence surfaced to support the claims has surfaced only rarely .
A Sri Lankan official said the video proves nothing .
Watch footage from the video »
" Sri Lankan soldiers never get involved in this kind of a situation , " Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara told CNN .
" We are 100 percent sure it has nothing to do with Sri Lankan soldiers ; it is all created and staged . "
Asked if he was saying the video was faked , he answered , " This is all fake ... I feel it 's not an actual situation , it 's a created one . "
The Sri Lankan High Commission ( Embassy ) in London issued a statement to CNN affiliate Channel 4 News , which first aired the video , saying that , " in many instances in the past , various media institutions used doctored videos , photographs and documents to defame the Sri Lankan government and armed forces . "
But Journalists for Democracy -- which would divulge neither how it obtained the video nor from where -- said the the men carrying out the executions are wearing Sri Lankan military uniforms .
Independent observers were largely excluded from the conflict zone during the war in Sri Lanka .
Even today access remains tightly restricted .
Not everyone is buying the government 's assertion that it was not involved in the killings .
" The Sri Lankan government has had a pattern of lying during this conflict , " said Yolanda Foster , Amnesty International 's Sri Lankan expert .
While the video's authenticity cannot be independently verified , the organization has received reports from survivors of the conflict that suggest war crimes were committed , she said .
" Given the restrictions given on the media , the fact that the government is not allowing people to freely interview the displaced who may be able to share accounts of what happened in the final months of the war , it is urgent that there is an independent investigation , " Foster said .
That appears unlikely to occur any time soon .
The government routinely rejects calls by human rights groups for independent investigations into its campaign against the Tigers .
But Nanayakkara told CNN the government will try to find out who is trying to discredit the Sri Lankan government by releasing what it called a faked video .
" This is to tarnish the image of Sri Lanka , " he said .

Statistically speaking , you 're not watching Mad Men , and the fact that season three premiers on Sunday likely has no affect on you .
I 'm here , out of the kindness of my heart , to gently explain to you why you 're wrong , and why you 're a bad person for doing the things you do .
Watch Mad Men .
Watch the shit out of it .
Now , I do n't normally shill things here on Cracked .
That 's not for any ethical or artistic reasons , or anything like that , it 's just that sponsors learned long ago that it 's more beneficial to them if they pay menot to associate myself with their products ( I 'm what advertisers call " brand AIDs " ) .
Incidentally , this is why we 'll never get sponsored by Band - Aids .
I 'd like to stress that neither AMC nor the creators of Mad Men are paying me .
( Funny story .
Turns out , no one is paying me .
I was fired from Cracked about eight months ago and I 've been hacking into the site ever since to get my articles up . )
I 'm only bringing up Mad Men because I genuinely think it 's one of the best shows on television .
Not too long ago , I asked " What the fuck happened to TV ? " , and I brought up The Hills , Jon & Kate Plus 8 Minus Several Crucial Chromosomes , A Show That Is n't Actually About Cougars So Who Gives a Shit and I'm a Celebrity - Go Fuck Yourself as not only examples of television 's horrible degeneration , but also fairly convincing signs of the coming apocalypse .
If you agreed with my thesis that those shows were like a like a special kind of cancer that insulted your masculinity as it slowly killed you , you 're probably wondering where all the good shows have gone .
Mad Men is the answer to that .
Here 's why .

for your version of An Owned Life .
I wrote a great deal in the past about the differences between real time and online .
There was extensive differences mentioned in my book , An Owned Life .
Many seem to believe that what they read about and see in pictures online is what this lifestyle is all about .
Sadly , they are shocked to realize this is not the case .
Reality offers a much different view .
The easiest analogy I can come up with is to compare this lifestyle to marriage .
Many have the " Prince Charming " idea of the state of matrimony .
From the time of being small , girls are conditioned to think of their wedding day .
It is something of fantasy and excitement .
I am sure the mind drifts to the wonderful life that two will share after the ceremony .
In short , it is a heavenly experience that will last until death .
Okay , my question is how many people experience anything close to this ?
With more than half the marriages ending in divorce , I would guess that fewer than 10 % of the people even get close to this ideal .
At the same time , those who have wonderful marriages realize that life still occurs .
They face the everyday problems that all others are confronted with .
The fairy tale is replaced with a solid understanding of the regular challenges of life .
Unfortunately , few make this same distinction to this lifestyle .
Regardless of the alternative lifestyle selected , life still happens .
D/s and M/s people face the same challenges .
So do swingers , BDSMers , and homosexuals .
Regardless of the life you choose to lead , there is no escaping reality .
Online is not reality .
This is true no matter what the circumstances are .
Many suffer from the illusion that the people in chatrooms , as an example , are real .
The truth is they are usernames on a screen .
Their persona is a creation which might or might not be accurate .
The anonymity of the Internet allows for misrepresentation .
The online illusion is bought into on a daily basis .
So many enter chatrooms and sites believing their interaction with another is real .
This is not the case unless there is something done to take the relationship to the next level .
I feel online is a wonderful way to " meet " people although it is fantasy unless there is some other interaction .
People are often surprised when I initially ask if they are willing to meet at some point .
If one is not willing to meet in person , what is the point of even chatting .
The relationship will never move from online to real time in that instance .
Life in the real world is vastly different than the fantasy played out online .
Few have dungeons in their house to be able to offer the complete BDSM scene .
Life is not 24 hours a day of play and interaction .
Subs / slaves are distraught to find they are not the main focus of a Dom / Master .
Sometimes football takes preference whether it is a husband or a Dom .
In other words , life happens .
Bear this in mind when you are tempted to believe what you are experiencing online is real .
While there is a relationship when interacting in this manner , there is also a large portion of reality missing .
The shift from online to real time is bigger than many imagine .
A self - proclaimed reality TV “ millionaire ” is being sought by police after the dead body of Playboy model Jasmine Fiore - believed to be his wife - was found hacked to pieces , crammed into a suitcase and dumped in a rubbish bin on a suburban street in Los Angeles .
Ryan Alexander Jenkins , a 32 - year - old businessman from Canada who recently achieved celebrity on a dating show for wealthy men seeking a trophy girlfriend , has not been seen since he reported Fiore missing on Saturday evening .
He was yesterday named a “ person of interest ” by police trying to establish what happened to Fiore , a swimsuit model , after she left her Hollywood flat on Thursday night bound for a poker tournament in San Diego , carrying a suitcase full of money .
The web of intrigue surrounding the case , which already boasts all the ingredients of an extravagant TV murder mystery , has been heightened by reports of the bizarre circumstances under which the couple first met , earlier this year .
Jenkins , an investment banker from Calgary , ran into Fiore , 28 , at a strip club in Las Vegas , where he was drowning his sorrows after being voted off the VH1 programme Megan Wants a Millionaire .
They were reportedly married 48 hours later .
The TV show , currently in the middle of its run , had seen him as one of 17 finalists hoping to woo Megan Hauserman , a pneumatic blonde from Florida .
Each of the eligible males was required to possess a personal fortune in excess of one million dollars .
In a personal profile on the VH1 website , which was recently removed , Jenkins boasted of being worth $ 2.5 million and said , “ He has left many amazing women in his life primarily because he wanted more women . ”
He claimed to enjoy “ moulding girls into princesses . ”
Since going on the run , Jenkins has used his publicist to communicate with the police through the tabloid website TMZ .
“ Ryan is currently speaking to his attorney and will fully cooperate with the police in this matter , ” claimed the publicist yesterday .
“ He is planning on meeting them in the near future . "
It emerged today that court records from Clark County , Nevada , showed that Jenkins was charged in June with battery constituting domestic violence for allegedly hitting Fiore in the arm .
Jenkins was facing a December non-jury trial in the matter .
His lawyer , Neal Tomlinson , declined to comment .
Court records also show Jenkins was sentenced to 15 months ' probation in January 2007 in Calgary for assault .

Adobe announced this week that it has not tested and will not support its Creative Suite 3 line of products , including Photoshop CS3 , on Apple 's new Snow Leopard operating system .
John Nack , the principal product manager for Photoshop at Adobe , announced on his official blog that CS3 and earlier have not been tested on Snow Leopard .
He provided a link to a compatibility document from Adobe that went even further .
" While older Adobe and Macromedia applications may install and run on Mac OS X Snow Leopard ( v10.6 ) , they were designed , tested and released to the public several years before this new operating system became available , " the document states .
" You may therefore experience a variety of installation , stability , and reliability issues for which there is no resolution .
Older versions of our creative software will not be updated to support Mac OS X Snow Leopard ( v10.6 ) . "
General support for CS3 applications , the company notes , exists through Adobe 's paid support program .
Adobe released Creative Suite 4 in 2008 , effectively replacing CS3 .
Clearly this latest move is designed to encourage users to upgrade to the latest version of Adobe 's software .
The Mac upgrade retails for $ 699.99 .
Nack said that there are a few minor problems with CS4 in Snow Leopard , though most of the suite works fine under Apple 's new operating system .
He said that problems remain in Flash panels and Adobe Drive / Version Cue .
The company 's support document states it will support and upgrade CS4 within Snow Leopard .
Currently , none of the applications in the CS4 suite require an upgrade to work within the new operating system , to be released Friday .

You 've got what you want , girls , stop whining :
Has feminism made women unhappy ?
( well THIS certainly will )
One of these days , women really ought to make up their minds about what it is exactly they want .
Then they could do us all a big favour by stating , unequivocally , what they have decided it is they want .
And then they could cover themselves with glory by sticking to what they say .
In other words , it 's about time women - especially their self - appointed mouthpieces - started behaving like fully grown - up adults and citizens .
Or is that asking too much ?
Apparently , it is .
A survey published this week tells us that women today are far from happy with their lot and wish they could live more like their mothers and grandmothers - not having to work so much and free to spend more time with their children .
The fact is , if women do succeed in having it all , the effort and the burden will probably break their back
The survey , The Paradox Of Declining Female Happiness , reports that women of all ages and income are less happy than women of 40 years ago and less happy than today 's men .
Despite sexual and marital liberation , massively increased career opportunities and earning power , educational privileges and the wholesale demolition of the inhibiting conventions that restricted the lives of women in the past , today 's women report themselves as feeling a low sense ' of life satisfaction and well - being ' .
Well , men might be entitled to retort , welcome to the real world , sweethearts .
What you are complaining about is the very same life that you promoted and celebrated when you were swanking around chanting ' sisters are doing it for themselves ' .
One woman commentator perfectly expressed the problem illustrated by this report , explaining : ' It 's almost as if , in some ways , we got it all and then found out it was n't quite exactly what we wanted . '
This is exactly what I have been predicting - against a torrent of vilification and derision from feminists - for more than 20 years .
My book , No More Sex War : The Failures Of Feminism , was not only the first radical , egalitarian , progressive critique of the ideology of feminism ( the last and most durable of the 20th century 's false secular faiths , like the Marxism from which it drew its cardinal tenets ) .
The book also analysed in detail the intolerable consequences that were bound to result for women if they were expected both to contribute substantial earnings to family life and , at the same time , be solely or even chiefly responsible for child - care .
It has been obvious to me for some 25 years that social and political equality for women ( which I wholeheartedly and unreservedly welcome ) could not work unless men became equal as parents at home .
Having it all ?
Women like Madonna and Angelina Jolie are the most privileged , most cosseted and indulged women in the history of humanity
The selfish , conceited , man - despising yet predatory ' have - it - all ' feminism of the Cosmopolitans was always a recipe for insupportable burdens for women , for intolerable stress , for a self - rebuking , guilt - laden failure to cope and , in the end , for being downright miserable about it all .
The fact is , lady , if you do succeed in having it all , the effort and the burden will probably break your back .
Before we sympathise with this sad plight , however , perhaps we should remind ourselves of the multitude of unprecedented benefits , blessings and advantages that have been showered upon the modern women who are now whingeing about the poverty of their ' life satisfaction ' .
They have become the most privileged , the most cosseted and indulged women in the history of humanity .
They are the first to live their whole lives without threat of war or plague .
They are the first women ever born who could control and regulate their fertility with complete reliability , and they are the first to have the means and the right to choose an abortion if they slipped up or changed their minds about being pregnant .
The selfish , conceited , man - despising yet predatory ' have - it - all ' feminism of the Cosmopolitans was always a recipe for insupportable burdens for women
They are the first to be free of any constraints in dress or manners , and the first for whom no limit exists to the heights to which they can aspire in any pursuit - be it politics , public service , commerce , the professions , the arts and sport .
You would never think it if you listened to feminists , but the truth is that every one of those benefits has been advanced and secured for women by men .
Motivated by conscience and a desire for justice and equality , it was primarily men who revolutionised the position of women .
I can see your jaw dropping at this peculiar idea , but if you do n't believe it , ask yourself these questions : how many women MPs were sitting on the benches of the House Of Commons when , by a majority of two - to - one , Parliament passed the Bill in 1918 which extended the franchise to women ?
Answer : not one .
Who was responsible for the Abortion Act of 1967 and the Divorce Reform Act of 1969 ?
Men .
Who brought into law the Equal Opportunities Act and the Sex Discrimination Act ?
Men .
Yet women of our time have lived all their lives with an unquestioning belief that they are members of an oppressed class of victims who have had to struggle heroically for liberation against a society cruelly organised by men for the benefit of men ( ' Women are the n*****s of the world , ' as that irredeemable twit Yoko One once declared ) .
This is the unpardonable fault of feminism .
Of all the disservices to our age fostered by that pernicious and poisonous ideology , none has been more ruinous than this preposterous lie - that men keep women down in order to preserve their own powers .
The manifest truth of the past 200 years is that men wanted change for women as much as they wanted it for themselves .
It is because we all go along with that feminist fiction that we cannot even begin to recognise the inequalities and the disadvantages of men in family life .
It simply does n't register on our barometer of injustice that unmarried men still have no automatic rights in law as parents .
Similarly , because we suppose that all gender injustice and inequality is to be found in the position of women , we do n't take any notice of the inequalities of men in divorce .
In survey after survey , men report that they resent the demands of work and that they wish they could have more time with their growing children .
Yet the law continues to discriminate against fathers in the provision of time away from work to care for children .
We do n't even count it as an intolerable injustice and inequality that men are still required to work five years longer than women before they become eligible for a state pension ( it is entirely typical of feminists ' capacity to pervert the truth that Germaine Greer once described that inequality as an advantage for men ) .
Men do n't go on about it , but the truth is that things are n't entirely wonderful for us , either .
The difference is that we do n't suppose we 've got a God - given right to blame women for it .
Much of southern Somalia is controlled by al - Shabab and its militia allies A French security adviser seized by Islamist militants in Somalia has escaped his captors , officials say .
The Frenchman , who was kidnapped from a hotel in Mogadishu along with a colleague last month , reportedly killed three militants as he fled .
French foreign ministry officials confirmed that he had escaped but denied there had been any violence .
They also said the second hostage was still being held .
An earlier report that said he was free was retracted .
The pair were part of a team who are in the country to train forces for the UN - backed interim government - who are battling Islamist rebels for control of the country .
Ransom denial A spokesman for the interim government , Abdulkadir Hussein Wehliye , said the escaped Frenchman was in the presidential palace and " in a good mood " .
A government military official , Farhan Asanyo , said the man had approached government soldiers early on Wednesday , identified himself and said he had escaped .
" The man told them that he was one of the French officials held by militants , " Mr Asanyo said .
Meeting al - Shabab Somali justice , Islamist - style " He said he escaped after killing three of his captors , and we sent him to the presidential palace . "
However , witnesses suggested that the rebels had allowed the Frenchman to go free , prompting speculation that a ransom might have been paid .
France 's foreign ministry denied reports of any money changing hands or of violence taking place .
" The hostage held by Hizbul - Islam was able to escape his kidnappers , " spokesman Eric Chevallier told reporters .
" Despite certain allegations and rumours , this happened without violence and France did not pay a ransom . "
Hours after the first hostage was released , French news agency AFP reported that Somali Information Minister Dahir Mohamud Gele had said the second hostage was also free .
But AFP later retracted the report , after Mr Gele confirmed only one hostage was free .
Mr Chevallier reiterated that the second hostage was still being held .
Foreign reinforcements
The BBC's Mohammed Olad Hassan , in Mogadishu , says the two French captives were being held by different factions .
While fighters from the Hizbul - Islam group were holding the man whose release has been confirmed , their allies from al - Shabab were thought to be holding the other man .
The two groups control much of southern Somalia , but analysts say al - Shabab is known for being the more radical of the two groups .
Al - Shabab fighters care little for their public image and they have carried out killings on camera .
Both groups are said to have links to al - Qaeda and have been reinforced by foreign fighters .
Somalia has not had a functioning central government since 1991 .
Moderate Islamist Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was sworn in as president in January after UN - brokered peace talks .
He promised to introduce Sharia law but the hardliners accuse him of being a Western stooge .

UK coastguards were told the ship was heading for Bejaia in Algeria A search is under way for a cargo ship which may have travelled through the English Channel after apparently being hijacked by pirates .
Coastguards fear the Maltese - flagged Arctic Sea , carrying up to 15 Russian crew , was hijacked in the Baltic sea .
UK authorities had the last known contact with it as it entered the Strait of Dover .
Up to five Russian navy warships are seeking the vessel .
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the situation was " bizarre " .
Spokesman Mark Clark said : " Who would think that a hijacked ship could pass through one of the most policed and concentrated waters in the world ?
" It seems strange to think that a ship which had been hijacked was passing along the channel along with ships carrying day - trippers going over to Calais . "
See the ship 's route Hijackers may have been coercing the ship 's crew when they made radio contact with coastguards at Dover on 28 July , the MCA fears .
Mr Clark said the person on board whom coastguards had spoken to had told them the ship was due to arrive in Bejaia , northern Algeria , on 4 August at 2300 BST .
Reports say Swedish authorities have been told by the Finnish shipping line operating the 3,988 - tonne cargo ship that on July 24 it was boarded by up to 10 armed men claiming to be anti-drugs police as it sailed through the Baltic sea .
It could well be that a crew member had a gun put to his head
Mark Clark
Maritime and Coastguard Agency
Russian navy joins hunt for ship
The intruders apparently left the vessel - which was carrying about £ 1 m worth of sawn timber from Finland to Algeria - 12 hours later on an inflatable boat after damaging the Arctic Sea 's communications equipment .
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said many questions remained unanswered .
He said : " If masked men took over the ship off the coast of Sweden , which in itself if pretty staggering ... then made off by speedboat ... why did n't the crew report all of this immediately and where are they now ?
" The worrying thing is that this happened right off the British coast .
Piracy in this country is unheard of , not since the days of Cornish brigands a long , long time ago . "
On 3 August , Interpol told Dover Coastguard the crew had been hijacked in the Baltic Sea and asked UK authorities to be alert as the vessel passed through the channel .
But by then the ship had already left the Strait of Dover , having last been recorded off the coast of Brest , northern France , just before 0130 BST on 30 July .
Nuclear submarines
The MCA said it was told the vessel had seemingly been spotted by a Portuguese coastal patrol aircraft but its current location was unknown .
Mr Clark said nothing seemed suspicious when the ship made contact , adding : " It could well be that a crew member had a gun put to his head by a hijacker when contact was made , but who knows ? "
Two nuclear submarines are among the five Russian navy vessels searching for the ship , according to Moscow 's Itar - Tass news agency .
Commander - in - chief Vladimir Vysotsky told the agency : " On orders from President Dmitry Medvedev , all ships and vessels of the Russian Navy in the Atlantic have been dispatched to search for the missing ship . "
Naval staff had no indication of the ship 's location , despite reports it may be off West Africa , he added .
Commercial dispute ?
Mark Dickinson , general secretary of seafarers ' union Nautilus International , said the situation was " unbelievable " and criticised authorities for their " relaxed " view of marine hijacking , in comparison with that of aircraft .
" It is alarming that , in the 21st Century , a ship can apparently be commandeered by hijackers and sail through the world 's busiest waterway with no alarm being raised and no naval vessel going to intercept it , " he said .
World leaders have become increasingly concerned about pirates operating off the coast of Somalia .
But Nick Davis , who runs the private security firm Anti-Piracy Maritime Security Solutions , told the BBC's Today programme the relatively low value of the cargo suggested this was a different kind of piracy to that seen off the coast of East Africa .
Instead , he suggested , it was more likely that the apparent seizure was the result of a " commercial dispute " in which one party had decided to " take matters into their own hands " .
He added : " Piracy is piracy - if someone 's wanting to take that vessel , and they 're not authorised , and they use a speedboat to go and get it , then it's no different to what the Somalis do .
" However , I do n't believe they would have boarded that vessel firing weapons in the air , and threatening to kill the crew . "

Jon Stewart got in his licks at Fox News the other night , accusing them of being " the new liberals " for their , umn , tolerant approach to the town hall health - care protesters .
Stewart caught Bill O'Reilly saying recently :
O'Reilly :
When we cover the town - hall meetings , we do n't describe the protesters as " loons . "
Stewart :
Of course you do n't describe the protesters as loons !
What kind of monster would describe honest Americans voicing their political opinions that way ?
[ Reverts to earlier clip of O'Reilly , describing an anti-war protest ]
O'Reilly : Surveys show many protesters are simply loons .
So last night on The O'Reilly Factor , the Falafel Master offered , by way of excuse , to demonstrate that Stewart had edited out the exculpatory parts of his monologues which made it clear he did n't mean all the protesters .
And indeed , on the longer clip , O'Reilly can be heard to say :
O'Reilly : There are the anti-Bush protesters in New York City .
While most of these people have been peaceful , more than a thousand have been arrested and surveys show , many protesters are simply loons , calling for the destruction of the American system , calling for retreat in the face of terrorism .
Here 's a bulletin for you Bush - haters :
These protesters are not helping John Kerry .
O'Reilly somehow thinks this demonstrates his innocence :
O'Reilly :
We were talking about the arrested protesters .
Actually , no , you were n't , Bill .
Look at the transcript :
You were talking about the protesters who were surveyed -- and that included all the protesters , not just those who were arrested .
Moreover , no one on the left or among the Democrats that I 'm aware of has called all of the town - hall participants " loons . "
They 've been careful to parse out the behavior of the people interested in civilized discourse .
When protesters have been characterized as " loons " or some variation thereof , it 's been because of their disruptive behavior .
So if BillO 's excuse -- that he was just talking about some of the protesters -- is good enough for Bill , why not for everyone else ?
But then , we already know that the standards BillO applies to others do n't apply to his own august self .
That 's the real " O'Reilly Factor . "
It seems I have a conservative “ family ” group angry with me because of this website .
And they ’re trying to attack my character ( and my teaching position ) as a result .
Some background : The Illinois Family Institute has a habit of saying ridiculous things .
And I ’ve been calling them out on it .
Most recently , they said that parents should keep their children away from Chicago ’s Millennium Park .
Why ?
Because gays ( and straights ) were going to be kissing each other as part of the Great Nationwide Kiss - In .
IFI said kissing itself was n’t obscene , but certain kinds of kissing were obscene :
An adult kissing a pre-pubescent child or a high school - age adolescent in a sexual or romantic manner is both obscene and inappropriate despite the protestations of the North American Man Boy Love Association ( NAMBLA ) to the contrary .
Romantic or sexual kissing between two consenting adults who are in love and who are closely related by blood is both obscene and inappropriate despite the protestations of defenders of incest to the contrary .
Romantic or sexual kissing among “ multi- partner ” unions , like those profiled in a recent Newsweek article , are both obscene and inappropriate despite the protests of polyamorists to the contrary .
Romantic or sexual kissing between two people of the same biological sex is both obscene and inappropriate despite the voluble , vigorous , and often vitriolic protests of homosexuals to the contrary .
In other words , IFI director Laurie Higgins is saying witnessing two gay guys kissing is the same as witnessing pedophilia and incest .
Like I said , ridiculous .
In my posting , I sarcastically wrote that “ The only thing that could make this kiss - in even better is if it took place just outside Higgins ’ house . ”
Obviously , I did n’t mean on her property ( that ’d be illegal ) .
And not purposely in front of her children .
In fact , I also wrote in my posting :
Meanwhile , Higgins can do whatever she ’d like to with her children .
She might feel more comfortable if each kid came equipped with a blindfold .
She could then tie it around them in case they dare go out in public where ( * gasp * ) gay people might be engaging in some harmless PDA .
Unless you want to ban kissing altogether ( which IFI says they do not want to do ) , then you have to deal with the fact that it happens — in public places and even in public schools .
To avoid reality and warn families that gays might be kissing ( so keep your kids away ! ) is paranoid and extreme .
Back to the story .
I posted my piece .
A couple days later , I discovered that Higgins emailed my boss , my high school ’s entire administrative staff , and every school board member to inform them that what I do in my private life was very unprofessional .
… He , of course , has a First Amendment right to write whatever he pleases on his blog “ The Friendly Atheist ” during his free time , but it ’s unfortunate that a role model for students would write some of the things he writes . …
What more could parents hope for in their children ’s teachers than a little old fashioned vindictiveness .
The underlying message , of course , is : “ Look !
You hired an ATHEIST !
And he BLOGS ! ”
What my private life ( i.e. this site , the volunteer work I do with non-theistic groups , etc ) has to do with my ability to teach high school math , I do n’t know .
I keep them separate .
What goes on in my “ atheist ” life does n’t come into play when I teach .
I respect church / state separation .
I would never talk about my religious beliefs in class .
Hell , I teach math .
Religion rarely comes up in discussion .
I should also mention that this email never got sent to me … in fact , Higgins sent it to everyone except me .
( I later received it from another source . )
Not surprisingly , everything is fine at work .
My superiors respect my right to free speech and their concern is with my professional work , not my private life .
For what it ’s worth , my teaching evaluations over the past couple years have been excellent , thank you very much .
Anyway , school officially begins tomorrow .
And I still have my job .
Maybe that fact upset Higgins .
Because yesterday , she tried another tactic : Sending out an official press release condemning me to her followers :
Judging from his blog , Mehta ’s mission in life is to spread the gospel of atheism to students across the country , making disciples of all men and women .
Judging from his blog , he also seeks to spread the message that homosexuality is morally equivalent to heterosexuality .
I love how she uses Christian imagery to attack me .
( Spreading a gospel and making disciples of men and women is a bad thing ?
Higgins must really dislike Jesus then … )
I am an atheist ( shocking , I know ) and spreading science and reason is a passion of mine .
But , like I said , the “ godless ” thing is what I do in my private life .
When I ’m at work , I teach math .
In the classroom , I do n’t discuss my religious and social views .
And I ’d be outraged if any teacher ( atheist , Christian , whatever ) did that .
Higgins links to my page of speaking engagements .
Does she realize that many of the engagements involve me talking about my visits to churches ?
Does she realize I am sometimes invited to speak by pastors , at their churches ?
Does she realize that if I speak to a primarily - atheist audience , there ’s no need to “ spread atheism ” ?
She makes it sound like I teach children that 1 + 1 = 2 , homosexuality should be mandatory , a2 + b2 = c2 , and that God is imaginary .
Maybe I should n’t be surprised by Higgins ’ accusations .
People like her constantly dismiss ideas that contradict their pre-existing beliefs .
It ’s the type of thinking that makes the Creation Museum possible .
Higgins goes on to argue ( emphases mine ) :
Of course , teachers have a First Amendment right to blog or speak publicly about anything they want .
And parents have every right not to have their children in the classroom under the tutelage of someone whose publicly articulated views they find fallacious and deeply troubling .
Having a First Amendment right to speak freely does not guarantee public approval or public silence .
And the public response may be that parents choose not to have their children in the class of those who espouse views that parents find foolish and destructive .
Parents have a justifiable concern that the personal views of teachers may find their way into the classroom , either through curricular choices or classroom commentary .
Those parents who want nothing more than that their children will believe in God may find someone whose mission in life is to persuade young people to reject a belief in God to be a poor role model .
So let me get this straight … if you ’re a parent , Higgins would like you to find out the religious and social views of all your kids ’ teachers ahead of time .
Then you can decide whether or not your child should be in their classroom ?
I do n’t think she believes that .
Her main concern , as she writes , is that those views will find their way into the classroom .
That ’s a concern I share , too .
Guess what ?
My personal beliefs have n’t made their way into my classroom .
They would n’t .
( They could n’t — school has n’t even started yet . )
In the years that I have been teaching , no parent or student has ever accused me of spreading atheism in the classroom .
Still , Higgins goes on about how “ emboldened , hubristic liberal activists ” are making their views known in public classrooms .
After writing about how those teachers want to make their students ideological clones , she then points out that I have never done these things .
( Subtext :
He ’s still an atheist , and he teaches your children ! )
But even if Mr. Mehta does not view his math classes as opportunities to proselytize , there still remains the fact that he is a role model and he regularly engages in very public discourse on very controversial topics .
For many parents , views on homosexuality and belief in God are two of life ’s most important issues — issues that are critical to both civilized and eternal life .
Really ?
Homosexuality is one of the most important things parents worry about ?
I know I ’m not a Christian , but I would think homosexuality does n’t play much of a role in any parent ’s day - to - day thoughts .
Not unless their kid is gay .
Higgins might be one of the few exceptions to that rule , because she seems to be obsessed with other peoples ’ sexuality .
But again , she admits I never mixed my personal beliefs with my professional life .
That fact alone makes the rest of her press release completely irrelevant .
Instead of stopping there , though , she digs the hole a little deeper by comparing atheism to racism :
Many parents would recoil at having their children spend a school year under the tutelage of a teacher — particularly a charismatic teacher — who in his or her free time blogs favorably about racism and travels the length and breadth of the country preaching racism .
Similarly , some parents may recoil at having their children spend a year under the tutelage of a teacher who spends his free time blogging favorably about atheism and homosexuality and traveling the length and breadth of the country preaching favorably about atheism .
You would think someone with this much of a concern for education would know a bad analogy when she sees one …
…
So to summarize :
I have opinions in my private life that I am very passionate about , opinions which I do not share with my students when I am teaching .
Therefore , parents should be frightened of me .
Thanks for clearing that up , Ms. Higgins .
Next time you ’d like to wage a personal attack on me , at least do me the favor of mentioning my book — the publicity is always nice .

The August edition of Vogue USA is entitled The Age Issue and its front cover features 40 - year old model Christy Turlington .
Turlington achieved global recognition as one of the original ‘ Big Five ’ Supermodels who exploded onto the fashion scene in 1990 .
Cindy Crawford , Linda Evangelista , Claudia Schiffer , Naomi Campbell and Turlington graced the catwalks and were adored in all circles in which they moved ; media , music , movies , fashion and royalty .
In 1990 singer George Michael asked them to appear in his ‘ Freedom ’ music video , lip - syncing to male voices .
They became famous for commanding record - breaking fees for their looks .
At the time , Evangelista said to Vogue , “ We do n’t wake up for less than $ 10,000 a day ” .
Turlington signed a contract with cosmetics giant Maybelline earning her $ 800,000 for 12 days work .
She went on to win million dollar contracts with Chanel and Calvin Klein and has appeared on over 500 magazine covers .
Despite her continuing success as a model , Turlington rejected the ‘ Supermodel ’ label and the fanfare that that went with it .
She became committed to yoga and vegetarianism ( although she now eats meat ) and went back to school to study Comparative Religion and Eastern Philosophy .
She is married to actor - director Ed Burns and has two children .
As well as being an ambassador for humanitarian organisation CARE , she is studying for a Masters degree in Public Health .
Despite Turlington ’s more academic pursuits these days , it is good to see ‘ fashion bible ’
Vogue celebrating older women by featuring the ex-supermodel on the cover .

The Department of Defense has identified 4,322 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war .
It confirmed the death of the following American yesterday :
WILHELM , Keiffer P. , 19 , Pvt. , Army ; Plymouth , Ohio ; First Armored Division .
Rachel Maddow reports on the " town halls gone wild " that industry backed astroturf groups like Americans for Prosperity are involved in disrupting .
Maddow :
This is orchestrated outrage .
There is a script for this stuff that was written before these events happened and that appears to be instructions to people to shut down these efforts at civic discourse .
The web site Think Progress obtained a leaked memo from a group that calls itself Right Principles .
The three page memo details how protesters should behave at town hall events .
Under the heading " Inside the Hall " it says :
You need to rock - the - boat early in the Rep 's presentation , Watch for an opportunity to yell out and challenge the Rep 's statements early .
If he blames Bush for something or offers other excuses -- call him on it , yell back and have someone else tallow - up with a shout - out .
The goal is to rattle him .
When the formal Q&A session begins get all your hands up and keep them up ....
The balance of the group should applaud when the question is asked , further putting the Rep on the defensive .
Who 's giving these rent - a - mob instructions like this ?
Well that memo was written by a man named Bob MacGuffie .
Bob McGuffie is associated with an organization called Freedom Works .
Freedom Works is a Washington DC lobbying firm , run by former Republican Majority leader Dick Armey .
Corporate lobbyists are organizing far right hooligan tactics to disrupt civic meetings about health care reform .
This is the organized use of intimidation as a political tool in the United States , and I do n't mean intimidation euphemistically .
I mean literal intimidation .
New York Congressman Tim Bishop who we showed you earlier .
He ended up having to be escorted to his car by five police officers for his own safety after his town hall event was over .
And this type of harassment is not just reserved for elected officials .
[.....]
This type of tactic , this type of intimidation is a deliberate choice .
And it appears to be stoked and organized by corporate lobbyists .
And it is not something that is happening in a vacuum .
[.....]
This is well paid lobbyists doing this as a strategy .
It 's the same thing with the deathers .
These scare your grandmother myths that the whole point of health care reform is secretly to kill old people .
This patently , patently false rumor about health care reform as we talked about earlier on this show was started by a woman who sits on the board of directors of one of the nations biggest medical device companies .
Everybody says well politics ai n't beanbags .
Right .
Obviously this is not beanbags .
But this is n't hardball either , no offense to Chris .
This just is n't even politics .
This is orchestrated , mob mentality intimidation .
This is called hooliganism .
Spending more than you earn is a financially devastating recipe for individuals and nations .
I ’ve read countless pop financial books on how to gain and sustain wealth and those that have any substance always emphasize saving your money , spending less than you earn , and being prudent with your funds .
In no book did I ever read that going with a cash for clunkers gimmick was a way to automatic wealth .
Many Americans faced with a deep unemployment crisis have had to morph their spending habits by force .
I ’ve talked about this new found austerity and how it is having a profound impact on society .
These will be fundamental structural changes .
Just like the Great Depression generation some of these new habits will stick for life .
Now Americans are coping with the recession by spending less and saving more :
As you can see , the savings rate spiked up since the start of the recession and retail sales are still declining .
You do n’t need to read 100 financial books to understand this simple rule of finance .
In tough times , you need to spend less than you earn .
It is a simple equation .
And this fact also applies to our entire country :
As a country we are exporting and importing less .
Many other countries are doing this in this global recession .
Given that this was an epic bubble spurred by easy access to debt and the housing bubble , you would expect that the market is trying to find a true bottom .
Yet here we are giving tax credits for people to buy homes and massive incentives for people to buy cars .
Is n’t this the reason we entered the crisis in the first place ?
Spending more than we earn is not the solution for a problem caused by , spending more than we earn .
Wall Street would like to keep the game going further and has easy access to the American Visa Card known as the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve .
Most Americans do not have access to this and are seeing credit card companies hiking up minimum payments and charging fees for many items looking to collect more revenues .
It would be one thing if we spent $ 13 trillion on education , infrastructure , fixing healthcare , or lowering the tax rate .
Instead , that $ 13 trillion has gone straight to Wall Street .
Some Americans are being lured back into the stock market because the 50 percent rally has been too good to resist .
After all , saving money seems to be for chumps if we look at Bank of America and Chase regular savings account rates :
And this goes beyond these two banks .
For your typical brick and mortar savings account , here are some of the top bailout recipients and the rates they are offering customers :
Why would you want to put your money in a savings account at this rate ?
And keep in mind , banks not only have cheap access to the Federal Reserve but now , they can offer you no interest rate while lending out mortgages at 5.5 to 6 percent to quality customers .
Many Americans are now jumping back into the volatile stock market simply because they feel they have no other alternative :
If you did n’t look closely , you would miss the P/E ratio for the S&P 500 .
The P/E ratio for the S&P 500 as of August 5th is at a ridiculous high of 146 putting the blue line off the chart .
I know that the mainstream media is reporting better than expected earnings but these targets are set by Wall Street so take that for what it is worth .
Companies have lower earnings from 2008 and that was already a dismal year .
During the Great Depression , we saw some true P/E values below 10 .
Right now people are buying over valued stocks on hype .
They are assuming unprecedented earnings and a resumption of bubble spending .
Look at the previous graphs .
Americans have lost nearly $ 14 trillion in household wealth and many will never go back to spending how they once did .
Credit card companies realize this and have cut access off to 8,000,000 credit card users .
Limits are being lowered .
So the era of financing everything on debt is coming to an end .
All these gimmicks are desperately trying to keep in place a system that no longer functions .
Our biggest trading partner in Europe is buying less from us :
In the same fashion we are importing less from them .
The average American understands that things are different .
Daily necessity items like food are going up in price .
Energy is slowly creeping up again .
Healthcare costs are still sky high and outpacing inflation at a time when baby boomers are going to retire in large numbers .
We are witnessing price destruction deflation in housing and automobiles .
It is a mixed bag but the reality is , most Americans realize that spending with no second thought is now over .
For many this is a new concept .
I shop at a local store and most of the time , you would see a cart full of expensive goods during the boom times charged on a credit card .
Now , you see the family making an outing of shopping and you see parents cutting back to necessities and using a debit card more often .
This is a middle class area .
But seeing someone checkout with $ 300 in goods was common .
Now , I see people checking out with $ 100 to $ 150 and I ’m betting this is for their weekly food .
The reality is things are different now .
Wall Street through its proxy in our government wants Americans to go back and spend .
But on what ?
Housing and cars ?
We have decimated our manufacturing sector and now all we have are cars and homes ?
There has to be some resurgence in real industry and bringing back a mixed economy .
The financial industry on Wall Street does n’t understand this because they can’t envision their world without getting their hands dirty and breaking a sweat .
They like to think that screwing people over by funneling money to unproductive industries like subprime loans and collecting middleman fees is the way to a healthy economy .
In past times , the financial industry served the purposes of the real economy .
Now , the real economy seems to work for the financial industry .
Yet the plans being put on the table will ultimately fail .
Average Americans are largely cutting back because they know what their family balance sheet looks like .
Even though we are told that everything will be back to normal , the vast majority know this is n’t the case .

In response to this post , a fifth photographer , Terril Jones , has shared with Lens his picture of the impending confrontation , from street level .
It has never before been published .
Many readers of “ Tank Man of Tiananmen ” have mentioned a video of the same incident .
Arthur Edelstein provided a link to the footage on YouTube .
Few images are more recognizable or more evocative .
Known simply as “ tank man , ” it is one of the most famous photographs in recent history .
Twenty years ago , on June 5 , 1989 , following weeks of huge protests in Beijing and a crackdown that resulted in the deaths of hundreds , a lone man stepped in front of a column of tanks rumbling past Tiananmen Square .
The moment instantly became a symbol of the protests as well as a symbol against oppression worldwide — an anonymous act of defiance seared into our collective consciousnesses .
“ It all started with a man in a white shirt who walked into the street and raised his right hand no higher than a New Yorker hailing a taxi , ” James Barron wrote the following day in The New York Times .
The picture appeared on the front page of this newspaper as well as in countless other publications around the world .
To this day , the identity and fate of the man in the picture remain unclear .
A riveting documentary , “ The Tank Man , ” by PBS Frontline in 2006 explored his fate .
Yet still no one knows for certain who he is or what exactly happened to him .
The image is largely blocked on the Internet in China .
Despite its iconic status and historical significance elsewhere , most young people there do not recognize the photograph .
There was not just one “ tank man ” photo .
Four photographers captured the encounter that day from the Beijing Hotel , overlooking Changan Avenue ( the Avenue of Eternal Peace ) , their lives forever linked by a single moment in time .
They shared their recollections with The Times through e-mail .
Charlie Cole
Charlie Cole was in Beijing on June 5 , 1989 for Newsweek magazine .
His version of the moment is tight — three stacked tanks , painted lines in the road emphasizing the direction of the tanks , all paths leading towards one man .
The details are clear and striking : the red star on the tank and the bags held by the man , making it seem like his protest was an afterthought on the way home from work or from the market .
Simple , striking , and powerful .
As the sun rose on the morning of the fourth , the automatic weapons fire that had punctuated the night tapered off .
Vehicles were smoldering along the main avenues .
Information from around the city was difficult to come by , as movement was pretty much shut down by the PLA ( People ’s Liberation Army ) , who had thousands of troops stationed throughout the city and checkpoints at all the main intersections .
Stuart Franklin and I had been shooting much of this time together .
We had photographed a number of wounded at the hospitals and tried to get as close to citizen - and - army encounters as possible without being detected or arrested .
On the morning of the fifth , we were back on the vantage point of the Beijing Hotel balcony , trying to get a look into what was happening within the square itself .
We had not been on the balcony very long when a line of at least 20 Armored Personnel Carriers left the square coming down Changan Avenue .
At this point , they opened up on the crowd .
I could n’t tell if they were firing above the crowd or into them , but needless to say , it cleared the streets of the thousand or so persons there .
The APC ’s continued on down the avenue , followed not long after by the line of tanks .
As the tanks neared the Beijing Hotel , the lone young man walked toward the middle of the avenue waving his jacket and shopping bag to stop the tanks .
I kept shooting in anticipation of what I felt was his certain doom .
But to my amazement , the lead tank stopped , then tried to move around him .
But the young man cut it off again .
Finally , the PSB ( Public Security Bureau ) grabbed him and ran away with him .
Stuart and I looked at each other somewhat in disbelief at what we had just seen and photographed .
I think his action captured peoples ’ hearts everywhere , and when the moment came , his character defined the moment , rather than the moment defining him .
He made the image .
I was just one of the photographers .
And I felt honored to be there .
After taking the picture of the showdown , I became concerned about the PSB ’s surveillance of our activities on the balcony .
I was down to three rolls of film , with two cameras .
One roll held the tank encounter , while the other had other good pictures of crowd and PLA confrontations and of wounded civilians at a hospital .
I replaced the final unexposed roll into the one of the cameras , replacing the tank roll , and reluctantly left the other roll of the wounded in the other camera .
I felt that if the PSB searched the room or caught me , they would look even harder if there was no film in the cameras .
I then placed the tank roll in a plastic film can and wrapped it in a plastic bag and attached it to the flush chain in the tank of the toilet .
I hid my cameras as best I could in the room .
Within an hour , the PSB forced their way in and started searching the room .
After about five minutes , they discovered the cameras and ripped the film out of each , seemingly satisfied that they had neutralized the coverage .
They then forced me to sign a confession that I had been photographing during martial law and confiscated my passport .
Sometime later , I was able to return to the room and retrieve the film , which I took over to the A.P. office and developed .
Afterwards , David Berkwitz , who had been sent to Beijing as the Newsweek photo tech - photographer , transmitted the picture to Newsweek in time for our deadline .
In my opinion , it is regretful that this image alone has become the iconic “ mother ” of the Tiananmen tragedy .
This tends to overshadow all the other tremendous work that other photographers did up to and during the crackdown .
Some journalists were killed during this coverage and almost all risked being shot at one time or another .
Jacques Langevin , Peter and David Turnley , Peter Charlesworth , Robin Moyer , David Berkwitz , Rei Ohara , Alon Reininger , Ken Jarecke and a host of others contributed to the fuller historical record of what occurred during this tragedy and we should not be lured into a simplistic , one - shot view of this amazingly complex event .
Stuart Franklin
Stuart Franklin ’s photograph feels like a painting .
Mr. Franklin , a Magnum photographer on assignment to Time magazine , was shooting from the rooftop with Mr. Cole .
He gives us the entire scene .
The lone figure ’s small space in the frame emphasizes what he ’s up against — a burned bus looms in the background , broken remains of the previous night ’s violent clashes .
Shadows dominate the left side , like storm clouds .
I woke up in the Beijing Hotel to find Changan Avenue occupied by a line of students facing a line of soldiers and a column of tanks .
I was hunched down on a balcony on the fifth floor ( I think ) .
Three others were also on the balcony : Charlie Cole , a reporter for Actuel in France and one from Vanity Fair .
I tried to photograph the whole series of events , but like any photographer working in film , I was always fearful of running out on frame 36 !
At some point , shots were fired and the tanks carried on down the road toward us , leaving Tiananmen Square behind , until blocked by a lone protester .
I photographed the protester .
He carried two shopping bags and remonstrated with the driver of the tank in an act of defiance .
He then disappeared into the crowd after being led away from the tank by two bystanders .
The remainder of the day was spent trying to gain access to hospitals to determine how many had died or were wounded .
In the two hospitals I could get access to , I found young Chinese — probably students — being treated on the floor of hospital corridors .
It was mysterious that there were no dead .
I understood later that the majority of the fatalities were taken to children ’s hospitals in the city to avoid media attention .
Chinese officials worked very hard obscure evidence of the massacre .
The film was smuggled out in a packet of tea by a French student and delivered to the Magnum office in Paris .
Jeff Widener
Jeff Widener framed his picture a little tighter , similar to Mr. Cole ’s , but with an additional tank in the frame and a street light protruding mysteriously from the bottom .
Mr. Widener ’s version , shot for The Associated Press , was probably the most circulated of the four .
It was made from a lower floor of the hotel , closest to the ground , and captured a face - to - face meeting between the lone man and the driver of the first tank .
Sometime in the morning of June 5 , 1989 , I stumbled out of the Jianguo Hotel in Beijing and navigated my way past burned out buses and smashed bicycles to The Associated Press office .
I was sick as a dog with the flu and suffering from a severe concussion .
A stray rock had struck my face while photographing a burning armored car during the Tiananmen uprising .
The Nikon F3 Titanium camera had had absorbed the shock and thus saved my life .
As I entered the A.P. office , which was located at the diplomatic compound , I read a message from A.P. headquarters in New York .
“ We do n’t want anyone to take any unnecessary risk but if someone could please photograph Tiananmen Square , we would appreciate it . ”
Boy , that was not what I wanted to read following the terror I witnessed the night before .
I was really scared and very spaced out from the injury and I had to find the courage to make that long bicycle ride to the Beijing Hotel , which had the best vantage point .
In the end , I managed to smuggle my camera gear into the Beijing Hotel and past security police , thanks to a young college kid named Kirk or Kurt .
Two decades later , I still have not been able to locate him and express my gratitude .
For without his help , the world would have lost a memorable image .
As I shot pictures out the sixth floor of the Beijing Hotel balcony , I was going through film pretty fast .
Tanks crashed through burned out buses .
Dead and wounded were peddled on little carts .
I asked Kurt / Kirk to help find me some more film .
He returned an hour later with one roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film .
Only one tourist could be found in the deserted lobby .
I normally shoot 800 ASA .
This would be a critical factor later on .
I loaded the single roll of film in a Nikon FE2 camera body .
It was small and had an auto - exposure meter .
As I tried to sleep off the massive headache that pounded my head , I could hear the familiar sound of tanks in the distance .
I jumped up .
Kurt / Kirk followed me to the window .
In the distance was a huge column of tanks .
It was a very impressive sight .
Being the perfectionist that I am , I waited for the exact moment for the shot .
Suddenly , some guy in a white shirt runs out in front and I said to Kurt / Kirk , “ Damn it — that guy ’s going to screw up my composition . ”
Kurt / Kirk shouted , “ They are going to kill him ! ” I focused my Nikon 400 mm 5.6 ED IF lens and waited for the instant he would be shot .
But he was not .
The image was way too far away .
I looked back at the bed and could see my TC - 301 teleconverter .
That little lens adapter could double my picture .
With it , I could have a stronger image but then I might lose it all together if he was gone when I returned .
I dashed for the bed , ran back to the balcony and slapped the doubler on .
I focused carefully and shot one … two … three frames until I noticed with a sinking feeling that my shutter speed was at a very low 30 th - 60th of a second .
Any camera buff knows that a shutter speed that slow is impossible hand - held with an 800 mm focal length .
I was leaning out over a balcony and peeking around a corner .
I faced the reality that the moment was lost .
I had earlier accomplished my mission of photographing the occupied Tiananmen Square so I gave all my rolls of film to Kurt / Kirk who smuggled it back to the A.P. office in his underwear .
The long - haired college kid was wearing a dirty Rambo T - shirt , shorts and sandals .
Security would never suspect him of being a journalist .
Five hours later , without any film and exhausted , I called the A.P. bureau in Beijing .
The photo editor , Mark Avery , asked , “ Jeff , what shutter speed were you shooting ? ”
My heart sank .
Mark said : “ It was O.K .
We used it , but it was n’t very sharp . ”
The next day I arrived at the office , where Liu Heung Shing jokingly said that I had “ very bad messages from New York . ”
On the clipboard were message after message of congratulations from all over the world : “ Congratulations .
Widener ’s tank man fronting all UK newspapers half page . ”
“ Tank man fronting all European papers . ” “ Wish I was there , Horst Faas , London . ”
“ French newspaper Liberation wants exclusive interview with Jeff Widener . ”
“ Tank man fronting USA Today and International Herald Tribune . ”
“ Please contact Life magazine for tank man image . ”
The response was overwhelming .
My unexpected 20th anniversary return to Beijing was filled with emotions .
On one particular day , I recall walking down a very tranquil tree - lined boulevard by the American embassy .
As I strolled through Beijing ’s Ritan Park and sniffed that pleasant wood burning smell of Asia , I found it hard to imagine such hell took place on those streets two decades earlier .
Arthur Tsang Hin Wah
Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters was beaten two nights earlier by students who mistook him for a spy .
His photograph of the tank man , divided into thirds by two light poles , was taken seconds before the others , as the tanks jostled for position behind the lone man .
The burned bus looms heavy in Mr. Tsang ’s version .
Gun shots can be heard coming in from east and west .
I felt unsafe going back to the square where the students stayed , so I went up to the 11th floor of the Beijing Hotel , where some of my press friends stayed .
The square was clear but by now there were more than 100 tanks assembled .
We watched people protesting near the hotel .
Troops opened fire and killed many of them .
We took pictures from the balcony while , across the street , police watched everything we did .
Sometimes bullets hit the hotel rooms when the troops drove past and fired into the sky to scare off people .
Rumors went around that they were going to clear the hotel .
Many press people , especially the Chinese , packed up and left .
At around noon .
we heard the roar of tanks .
More than 20 of them , in a big column , pulled out from the square and came our way .
I loaded my Nikon F3HP with film and started shooting with a 300 mm telephoto lens .
Suddenly one of my friends shouted , “ This guy is crazy ! ” I saw from the viewfinder a man carrying two plastic shopping bags walk out onto the empty Changan Avenue from the sidewalk , blocking the tanks .
The first tank pulled over a little but the man moved in the same direction , preventing it from advancing .
I put on a 2 x teleconverter and took a couple of tighter shots .
Then the man climbed up the first tank and tried to talk to the soliders inside .
When he came down , four or five people came out from the sidewalk and pulled him away .
He disappeared forever .
I called my office and told them I had a great shot .
A colleague rode over on a bike and picked up the film .
I stayed behind in the hotel for the following two days .
For some reason , the editor in the office did not pick the frame of the man blocking the tanks .
Instead , they picked the frame of the man climbing up the tank .
The next day , A.P. ’s version was widely played .
They called me up at the hotel and I told them to have a close look again .
So my photo of the man blocking the tank was released more than 12 hours later than my competitor’s .
I am glad that it still has impact after 20 years .
Four different versions but one same focus . ”
Patrick Witty is the international picture editor at The Times .
Calling it a " terrible decision " that undermines national security and devastates CIA morale , former Vice President Dick Cheney slammed the Obama administration 's probe of aggressive interrogation of terrorists .
" It 's an outrageous political act that will do great damage , long - term , to our capacity to be able to have people take on difficult jobs , make difficult decisions , without having to worry about what the next administration is going to say , " Cheney told " FOX News Sunday " in a no-holds - barred interview .
In blunt , unsparing language , Cheney accused President Obama of setting a " terrible precedent " by allowing an " intensely partisan , politicized look back at the prior administration . "
He said the decision by Attorney General Eric Holder to launch a probe into alleged abuse of prisoners under the prior administration " offends the hell out of me , " as he seemed to question Obama 's fitness as commander - in - chief .
" I have serious doubts about his policies , " Cheney told FOX News ' Chris Wallace in Jackson Hole , Wyo .
" Serious doubts , especially , about the extent to which he understands and is prepared to do what needs to be done to defend the nation . "
As evidence , Cheney pointed to Obama 's decision last week to assert White House control over a newly formed unit that will interrogate terrorists .
The new arrangement shifts control of such interrogations away from the CIA and toward the FBI , although oversight will be exercised by the National Security Council , which is located in the White House and reports directly to the president .
Administration officials are vague about which agency will retain ultimate authority .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton initially said the new unit " will report to the director of the FBI , " although the Justice Department , which encompasses the FBI , insisted the unit is " not a sub-unit of the FBI or the Justice Department . "
Burton explained : " Just like other interagency processes , if there are disagreements , the different agencies are able to come together and make a decision . "
Cheney ridiculed the new unit , which will be known as the High - Value Detainee Interrogation Group ( HIG ) .
" It 's not even clear who 's responsible , " he marveled .
" The Justice Department is , then they claim they are n't .
The FBI is responsible , and they claim they are n't .
It 's some kind of interagency process by which they 're going to be responsible for interrogating high - value detainees .
" If we had tried to do that back in the aftermath of 9/11 , when we captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the mastermind of 9/11 , we'd have gotten no place , " he said .
Cheney predicted the new unit will be incapable of effectively interrogating " people that may have knowledge about imminent attacks . "
" They 're going to have to have meetings and decide who gets to ask what question and who 's going to Mirandize the witness , " he said .
" I think it 's silly .
It makes no sense .
It does n't appear to be a serious move in terms of being able to deal with the nation 's security . "
Cheney warned that curtailing the CIA 's role in interrogations is a grave mistake .
" I think it 's a direct slap at the CIA .
I do n't think it will work , " he said .
" It moves very much in the direction of going back to the old way of looking at these terrorist attacks -- that these are law enforcement problems , that this is n't a strategic threat to the United States . "
But Cheney reserved his strongest criticism for Holder 's decision Monday to appoint a prosecutor and open a criminal investigation into alleged abuses by CIA agents who interrogated terrorists during the administration of former President George W. Bush .
The former vice president accused Obama of breaking a promise not to prosecute the agents .
" We had the president of the United States , President Obama , tell us a few months ago there would n't be any investigation like this , that there would not be any look back at CIA personnel who were carrying out the policies of the prior administration , " Cheney said .
" Now they get a little heat from the left wing of the Democratic Party , and they 're reversing course on that . "
In January , just days before he took office , Obama assured CIA agents they need not worry about prosecution .
" We need to look forward , as opposed to looking backwards , " the president - elect said .
" At the CIA you 've got extraordinarily talented people who are working very hard to keep Americans safe .
I do n't want them to suddenly feel like they 've got to spend all their time looking over their shoulders and lawyering up . "
In April , after disclosing classified documents that detailed the CIA 's enhanced interrogation techniques , Obama said : " This is a time for reflection , not retribution . "
" Nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past , " the president added .
" For those who carried out some of these operations within the four corners of legal opinions or guidance that had been provided from the White House , I do not think it 's appropriate for them to be prosecuted . "
At the time , Holder added : " It would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the Justice Department . "
In his interview with FOX News , Cheney disputed the administration 's assertion last week that the decision to go after the CIA agents was made by Holder , not Obama .
" If you look at the Constitution , the president of the United States is the chief law enforcement officer in the land , " Cheney said .
" The attorney general 's a statutory officer .
He 's a member of the Cabinet .
The president 's the one who bears this responsibility . "
Cheney said it was disingenuous of Obama " to say , ' Gee , I did n't have anything to do with it , ' especially after he sat in the Oval Office and said this would n't happen .
Then Holder decides he 's going to do it .
So now he 's backed off and is claiming he 's not responsible .
" I just think he 's trying to duck the responsibility for what 's going on here , " Cheney concluded .
" And I think it 's wrong . "
Cheney pointed out that the Justice Department already investigated all the cases in question during the Bush administration and decided to prosecute only one contractor , who received a jail sentence .
" The matter 's been dealt with the way you would expect it to be dealt with by professionals , " Cheney said .
" Now we 've got a political appointee coming back , and supposedly without the approval of the president , going to do a complete review , or another complete investigation , possible prosecution of CIA personnel . "
He added : " A review is never going to be final anymore now .
We can have somebody , some future administration , come along 10 years from now , 15 years from now , and go back and rehash all of these decisions by an earlier administration .
Cheney vigorously defended the CIA .
" In the intelligence arena , we ask those people to do some very difficult things , sometimes , that put their own lives at risk , " he said .
" They do so at the direction of the president .
In this case , we had specific legal authority from the Justice Department .
And if they are now going to be subject to being investigated and prosecuted by the next administration , nobody 's going to sign up for those kinds of missions .
" It 's a very , very devastating , I think , effect that it has on morale inside the intelligence community . "

The August War for Health Care Reform has begun .
The forces for health care reform and those against it ( working with those who are against it right now ) have both begun to wage the battle for public opinion and to influence Congress .
Many on the pro-reform side are not sure if they are happy with the plans being considered – and are frustrated with what they see as the lack of forthrightness in selling the plan .
There are currently multiple versions of the legislation in Congress – and the president has yet to state what he will require to be in the bill .
This all seems part of a strategy , but it makes organizing more difficult .
In the end , there is little choice but to trust that if given the proper space and pressure politically , Obama and the Democratic Congress will do the right thing .
But while this may be frustrating what has become very clear is that the opponents of reform are willing to lie outrageously in order to turn the tide in this fight .
And those people who favor reform must beat back these complaints vigorously .
Here ’s a roundup of recent lies told by the opponents of reform :
1 . Last week in an opening volley , I received a charming email from Townhall.com stating that “ ObamaCare =Gov’t Funded Abortion and Euthanasia . ”
This is clearly not true .
2 . Then , this morning , I opened up the Drudge Report and found as his main link a heavily edited video claiming that it showed Obama “ IN HIS OWN WORDS ” saying his health care plan will eliminate private insurance .
Even in its heavily edited version , it did n’t show this .
Instead it showed Obama endorsing the generally accepted idea that we should gradually end our employer - based health insurance .
Obama ’s views on single - payer health insurance have been gone over repeatedly .
His campaign website gave three examples of him using the same formulation – which incidentally he also used in at least one debate that I recall :
If you ’re starting from scratch , then a single - payer system ’- a government - managed system like Canada ’s , which disconnects health insurance from employment - ‘ would probably make sense .
But we ’ve got all these legacy systems in place , and managing the transition , as well as adjusting the culture to a different system , would be difficult to pull off .
So we may need a system that ’s not so disruptive that people feel like suddenly what they ’ve known for most of their lives is thrown by the wayside .
So , what we have is a obviously edited video of Obama at various times in the past ten years saying that he supports a single - payer system ( cutting out the second half of the statement ) and his admission that he believes we should move away from employer - based health insurance .
The video though is being promoted as proving that Obama is admitting that his plan would secretly impose government insurance on everyone .
The video very clearly shows no such thing .
Yet , even so , the Libertarian sub - reddit was fooled and promoted the video .
The White House has helpfully provided the videos with some context in what I think is an excellent effort to combat this smear .
3 . The hysteria over Obama ’s health care reform even bled over into my walk home through Midtown Manhattan .
On the way , I passed a booth run by the LaRouche PAC with a picture of Obama with a Hitler mustache ( similar to this one ) and an older black woman explaining to passers - by that Obama was seeking to kill older Americans just like Hitler did .
Everyone knows the LaRouchites are a bit crazy .
But how different is this from what Rush Limbaugh says ?
Or Fox News ?
I took a flyer from the women – though not before telling the person she was preaching to that Obama really was n’t actually trying to kill her .
The flyer explained ( the PDF linked is slightly different version from what I received ) :
U.S. President Barack Obama delivered a nationally - televised press conference at 8 p.m. on July 22nd , in which on five separate occasions he called for health reform legislation featuring the establishment of “ an independent board of doctors and health care experts ” to make the life - and - death decisions of what care to provide , and what not , based on cost - effectiveness criteria – exactly the infamous “ T - 4 ” policy imposed by Adolf Hitler in 1939 , for which the Nazi regime was tried and condemned at Nuremberg .
Lyndon LaRouche commented , within minutes of Obama ’s remarks : “ President Obama is now impeachable , because he has , in effect , proposed legislation which is an exact copy of the legislation for which the Hitler regime was condemned in the post - war trials .
This is an impeachable offense : to propose such a thing in this time , is an impeachable offense .
The time has come that the President of the United States deserves impeachment .
With this statement from him , the President now deserves impeachment . ”
On how many levels is this ridiculous ?
The independent board of doctors and health care experts would replace MedPAC – a board that currently provides guidance to Congress in setting Medicare rates .
Instead of advising , Obama ’s new board – the IMAC – would make recommendations as to levels of pay that would be sent to the president and , if then endorsed by him , would be subject to the approval of Congress .
They would also do studies of the comparative effectiveness of different types of treatments .
Does this sound like a euthanasia program to you ?
4 . There is also an email is circulating that makes all sorts of outrageous claims about the bills under consideration on health care reform – including many of the above claims – and pretends to cite the pages and lines of the bill that mandate what it describes .
Like many of these viral email lists of lies , it relies on the laziness and gullibility of the American people – trusting that people will pass it on rather than check the truthfulness of the claims themselves .
The email was pretty thoroughly debunked by Linda Bergthold , a health care policy consultant and researcher who has been working in the field for 25 years , and Politifact , an arm of the St. Petersburg Times that analyzes the truth of political statements .
A lot of this stuff is hard to believe – but as Bill Maher pointed out last week – if you let even stupidest arguments stand unchallenged , they will take root and destroy even one ’s best efforts .
Which is why I ’m going to try to make a point of calling bullshit on these outrageous lies as they come by …and you should too …

‘ The USS Liberty ’ : America ’s Most Shameful Secret
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
This article was written in 2001 .
NEW YORK —
On the fourth day of the 1967 Arab Israeli War , the intelligence ship " USS Liberty " was steaming slowly in international waters , 14 miles off the Sinai Peninsula .
Israeli armored forces were racing deep into Sinai in hot pursuit of the retreating Egyptian army .
" Liberty , " a World War II freighter , had been converted into an intelligence vessel by the top - secret US National Security Agency , and packed with the latest signals and electronic interception equipment .
The ship bristled with antennas and electronic " ears " including TRSSCOMM , a system that delivered real - time intercepts to Washington by bouncing a stream of microwaves off the moon .
" Liberty " had been rushed to Sinai to monitor communications of the belligerents in the Third Arab Israeli War : Israel and her foes , Egypt , Syria , and Jordan .
At 0800 hrs , 8 June , 1967 , eight Israeli recon flights flew over " Liberty , " which was flying a large American flag .
At 1400 hrs , waves of low - flying Israeli Mystere and Mirage - III fighter - bombers repeatedly attacked the American vessel with rockets , napalm , and cannon .
The air attacks lasted 20 minutes , concentrating on the ship ’s electronic antennas and dishes .
The " Liberty " was left afire , listing sharply .
Eight of her crew lay dead , a hundred seriously wounded , including the captain , Commander William McGonagle .
At 1424 hrs , three Israeli torpedo boats attacked , raking the burning " Liberty " with 20 mm and 40 mm shells .
At 1431hrs an Israeli torpedo hit the " Liberty " midship , precisely where the signals intelligence systems were located .
Twenty - five more Americans died .
Israeli gunboats circled the wounded " Liberty , " firing at crewmen trying to fight the fires .
At 1515 , the crew were ordered to abandon ship .
The Israeli warships closed and poured machine gun fire into the crowded life rafts , sinking two .
As American sailors were being massacred in cold blood , a rescue mission by US Sixth Fleet carrier aircraft was mysteriously aborted on orders from the White House .
An hour after the attack , Israeli warships and planes returned .
Commander McGonagle gave the order : " prepare to repel borders . "
But the Israelis , probably fearful of intervention by the US Sixth Fleet , departed .
" Liberty " was left shattered but still defiant , her flag flying .
The Israeli attacks killed 34 US seamen and wounded 171 out of a crew of 297 , the worst loss of American naval personnel from hostile action since World War II .
Less than an hour after the attack , Israel told Washington its forces had committed a " tragic error . "
Later , Israel claimed it had mistaken " Liberty " for an ancient Egyptian horse transport .
US Secretary of State , Dean Rusk , and Joint Chiefs of Staff head , Admiral Thomas Moorer , insisted the Israeli attack was deliberate and designed to sink " Liberty . "
So did three CIA reports ; one asserted Israel ’s Defense Minister , Gen. Moshe Dayan , had personally ordered the attack .
In contrast to American outrage over North Korea ’s assault on the intelligence ship " Pueblo , " Iraq ’s mistaken missile strike on the USS " Stark , " last fall ’s bombing of the USS " Cole " in Aden , and the recent US - China air incident , the savaging of " Liberty " was quickly hushed up by President Lyndon Johnson and Defense Secretary Robert McNamara .
The White House and Congress immediately accepted Israel ’s explanation and let the matter drop .
Israel later paid a token reparation of US $ 6 million .
There were reports two Israeli pilots who had refused to attack " Liberty " were jailed for 18 years .
Surviving " Liberty " crew members would not be silenced .
They kept demanding an open inquiry and tried to tell their story of deliberate attack to the media .
Israel ’s government worked behind the scenes to thwart these efforts , going so far as having American pro-Israel groups accuse " Liberty ’s " survivors of being " anti-Semites " and " Israel - haters . "
Major TV networks cancelled interviews with the crew .
A book about the " Liberty " by crewman James Ennes ’ was dropped from distribution .
The Israel lobby branded him " an Arab propagandist . "
The attack on " Liberty " was fading into obscurity until last week , when intelligence expert James Bamford came out with Body of Secrets , his latest book about the National Security Agency .
In a stunning revelation , Bamford writes that unknown to Israel , a US Navy EC - 121 intelligence aircraft was flying high overhead the " Liberty , " electronically recorded the attack .
The US aircraft crew provides evidence that the Israeli pilots knew full well that they were attacking a US Navy ship flying the American flag .
Why did Israel try to sink a naval vessel of its benefactor and ally ?
Most likely because " Liberty ’s " intercepts flatly contradicted Israel ’s claim , made at the war ’s beginning on 5 June , that Egypt had attacked Israel , and that Israel ’s massive air assault on three Arab nations was in retaliation .
In fact , Israel began the war by a devastating , Pearl - Harbor style surprise attack that caught the Arabs in bed and destroyed their entire air forces .
Israel was also preparing to attack Syria to seize its strategic Golan Heights .
Washington warned Israel not to invade Syria , which had remained inactive while Israel fought Egypt .
Bamford says Israel ’s offensive against Syria was abruptly postponed when " Liberty " appeared off Sinai , then launched once it was knocked out of action .
Israel ’s claim that Syria had attacked it could have been disproved by " Liberty . "
Most significant , " Liberty ’s " intercepts may have shown that Israel seized upon sharply rising Arab - Israeli tensions in May - June 1967 to launch a long - planned war to invade and annex the West Bank , Jerusalem , Golan and Sinai .
Far more shocking was Washington ’s response .
Writes Bamford : " Despite the overwhelming evidence that Israel attacked the ship and killed American servicemen deliberately , the Johnson Administration and Congress covered up the entire incident . "
Why ?
Domestic politics .
Johnson , a man never noted for high moral values , preferred to cover up the attack rather than anger a key constituency and major financial backer of the Democratic Party .
Congress was even less eager to touch this " third rail " issue .
Commander McGonagle was quietly awarded the Medal of Honor for his and his men ’s heroism — not in the White House , as is usual , but in an obscure ceremony at the Washington Navy Yard .
Crew member ’s graves were inscribed , " died in the Eastern Mediterranean . " as if they had be killed by disease , rather than hostile action .
A member of President Johnson ’s staff believed there was a more complex reason for the cover - up : Johnson offered Jewish liberals unconditional backing of Israel , and a cover - up of the " Liberty " attack , in exchange for the liberal toning down their strident criticism of his policies in the then raging Vietnam War .
Israel , which claims it fought a war of self defense in 1967 and had no prior territorial ambitions , will be much displeased by Bamford ’s revelations .
Those who believe Israel illegally occupies the West Bank and Golan will be emboldened .
Much more important , the US government ’s long , disgraceful cover -up of the premeditated attack on " Liberty " has now burst into the open and demands full - scale investigation .
After 34 years , the voices of " Liberty ’s " dead and wounded seamen must finally be heard .

Visualization works if you work hard .
That ’s the thing .
You ca n’t just visualize and go eat a sandwich .
— Jim Carrey
I have learned the secret to getting rich in math and science .
And now , for the first time ever , I am making these secrets available to you .
I can teach you everything you need to know to debunk Gödel ’s incompleteness theorems , and help put you on the fast track to validating your proofs .
With my program , you will literally rewrite the book on formal logic .
Looking to untangle the origins of the universe ?
No sweat .
I will show you how , in just 30 minutes a day , using simple techniques that anyone can learn , you will discover how you can create revolutionary new approaches to thinking about the Big Bang , string theory , and even the nature of God itself .
( Did you know , for example , that God is neither a man nor a woman , but made up , in fact , of a fairly inexpensive set of ingredients that can be bought at almost any Italian food store ? )
But that ’s not all .
The normal price of this 24 CD , 2 volume course is $ 1,999 .
But if you order now , you will get the entire “ MATHEMILLIONS ” box set , that ’s over 50 hours of groundbreaking material , a signed copy of my new book “ Awaken the Giant Mathematician Within ” , and I ’ll throw in a coupon for 10 % off my live , 3 - day “ 1 + 1 = $ 1,000,000 !!11 ! ” bootcamp , a coupon worth over $ 3000 , all for the incredibly low price of $ 119.95 !!!
So do n’t wait .
This offer can only last a short time .
Do me yourself a favour and CALL NOW .
∞
Framed in the context of objective and rational pursuits , the above comes across as obvious drivel .
But it ’s amazing how much of the multi-billion dollar self - help industry is fueled by offers like these .
This mock sales letter may seem like an exaggeration , but in many ways it is not .
If anything , I ’ve gone conservative on the markup and punctuation .
I only offer two bonus gifts , instead of the usual five or six .
My discount may be a little exaggerated , but it is not that far from the truth .
And , in the interests of time and space , I ’ve kept the length of my sales letter to a mere fraction of the real spiel .
But the purpose of this article is not to rant about sales letters .
I think most people can detect an infomercial when they see one .
Instead , the purpose of this article is to declare war on the false premise that motivates people to write sales letters , the same belief that can undermine your efforts in the pursuit of happiness :
The idea that there ’s a secret to creating the life you want , and that some random person you ’d never heard of until now can offer it to you at an unbeatable low price .
The Key ( words ) to Success
In no other realm of human endeavour are we so focussed on hugely unrealistic metrics as in the realm of personal growth .
Here , for example , are the results of a keyword search I did in the self - help section of Amazon .
The number in parentheses represents the number of matches as a percentage of the total number of items in that category :
Secret : 21,287 matches ( 20.5 % )
Million : 18,223 matches ( 17.6 % )
Instant : 13,998 matches ( 13.5 % )
Unlimited : 7,727 matches ( 7.5 % )
Effortless : 3,620 matches ( 3.5 % )
Compare that with , say , the Computer and Internet section .
There are three times as many books in this section , so the most useful comparison is by percentages :
Million : 30,939 matches ( 8.0 % )
Instant : 25,469 matches ( 6.6 % )
Secret : 23,602 matches ( 6.1 % )
Unlimited : 19,117 matches ( 4.9 % )
Effortless : 2,246 matches ( 0.6 % )
In the vocabulary of false promises , self - help books dominate the competition .
And while the statistical difference here is large , the cultural difference between these two worlds is even larger .
Whereas books that offer instant results ( “ Learn Java in 24 Hours ” ) and “ secrets ” are generally laughed at in computer circles , they take center stage in the world of self - improvement .
In fact , one of the most popular self - help titles of all - time is called The Secret .
Fantasy Positions
My favourite chess book ever is Jeremy Silman ’s How to Reassess Your Chess
.
One of the insights that stuck with me most from that book was the use of “ fantasy positions . ”
The idea was that you learned a set of principles for evaluating a chess position , and then you used them to imagine the ideal position you wanted to create on the board .
The key was to forget about what it took to get there at first , and focus exclusively on the desired outcome .
From there , you looked for moves in the current position that brought you closer to the fantasy position .
Lather , rinse , repeat until you found a feasible course of action .
This technique was a great way of approaching chess strategy for me .
I ’d never quite thought in terms of fantasy positions before , and doing so gave me a much clearer sense of what I was doing .
Of course , the fantasy position is just another name for visualization applied to chess .
The fantasy position , in other words , is chess ’s version of The Secret .
Ask , Believe , FAIL
In the chess world — and this is true of most fields of human knowledge — there are some manuals written to teach you some things , and other manuals written to teach you other things .
While I was blown away by how useful it was to think in terms of fantasy positions , I did n’t for a second think that this was the key that could unlock my potential as a chess player .
I knew there were still hundreds of volumes of chess wisdom out there for me to consume — so many nuances of opening , middlegame , and endgame theory — and thousands of games yet to be played and analyzed before I would have any hope of being really good .
Visualizing was a nice little tool , but only a tiny part of the overall arsenal I needed to win .
But in the self - help industry , visualization is presented as decisive , a “ key to success . ”
In fact , a search for “ visualize ” in Amazon ’s self - help section turns up 9,170 matches , which is 8.8 % of everything in that category , or more than double the total number of chess items for sale .
The self - help form of visualization takes on an entirely new dimension , and an entirely new name : The Law of Attraction .
And the Law states that all you need to do is place your order with the universe and the universe will respond .
Back to Reality
If you ’re not careful , the vastly overstated claims of self - help literature can make you feel ripped off , and even downright cynical about personal change .
After all , if you were one of the many people who spent hundreds of dollars on a course that claimed it would triple your reading speed , but it made no difference at all , how could you not feel let down ?
In the case of someone trying to start a business , whose 30 minutes a day does n’t * gasp * turn into a million dollar company , the worst that happens is they keep their day job .
A tad unfortunate to see all that effort wasted , but not the end of the world .
But the consequences of deception can get much worse than that .
For someone trying to , say , quit drinking , following a trail of false hope can lead to disaster .
As the chess example shows , a good way to gain perspective on the strange and sometimes mystical advice of self - help authors is to frame those ideas , where possible , in terms of something concrete and familiar and see how they measure up .
I ’ve found this to be an effective way to manage my expectations .
The other thing I do is follow a simple rule of thumb :
Do n’t read stuff by people who got successful by telling other people how to be successful .
This is especially true when I can find no other evidence of their past achievements in the real world .
There are just too many insanely smart people out there , whose claims are supported by reasoned argument and scientific evidence to waste a single minute on stuff that is n’t .
I have n’t always followed this rule , but since I have I ’ve been able to fully engage with what I read .
No more having to ask myself why an author would include a well - known email chain letter at the end of his book and claim it was written to him by a dying young girl , or wondering why I can find no trace of their history on Google outside of their promotional campaign .
These ideas are both pretty common sense , but not always common practice .
It ’s so easy to start out with a genuine desire to live a better life , and end up confused and disappointed when met with the junk science ( Law of Attraction , NLP , “ Power of the Subconscious Mind ” , etc. ) and made - up anecdotes ( Yale Goals Study , claims of winning some world championship somewhere that no one is able to verify ) that are so painfully common to self - help literature .
If you want to improve the quality of your life , self - help is the wrong route to take .
But the growth mindset itself is vital .
Things like visualization , gratitude , early rising , and all those fuzzy things are truly wonderful ideas .
They do work well .
But even if you add them all together and multiply by 42 , you still wo n’t find the key to success .
Oh , BTW , Hi
Speaking of personal growth , welcome to my blog .
It ’s been a while .
You might not remember me .

Barack Obama frowns during a December 2008 news conference in Chicago .
Obama 's pet peeves
It was one of those nonstop days : President Barack Obama was flying back to Washington from Los Angeles to meet President Mahmoud Abbas , then he was scheduled to tape an interview for " The Colbert Report " and sit down for his regular briefing with advisers .
But he was missing something equally important : one of his daughters ’ concerts at school .
“ When he learned about it , he came up and asked us how it happened , ” an aide at the White House recalls .
“ He was annoyed and he let us know . ”
Advertisement
“ This is unacceptable , ” the aide recalls Obama saying .
“ Make sure it never happens again . ”
With that , White House staffers quickly learned one of their boss ’s pet peeves :
Never put something on the calendar that interferes with his duties as First Dad .
For the most part , staffers say the president , who earned the nickname “ No Drama Obama ” during the campaign , is a pretty laid - back guy .
Even so , like everyone , the commander in chief has a few peccadilloes that are best avoided .
Some are easy to identify with .
As White House senior adviser David Axelrod puts it , the president dislikes it when “ folks try to get him to wear baseball gear for teams other than the White Sox . ”
Other issues are related to the schedule and scrutiny of living in presidential bubble .
He does n’t like to miss his daily workout , which usually takes place in the morning or before an evening event .
“ If there ’s no workout time , he ’ll get a little upset , ” said one senior aide who has worked with Obama for more than four years .
He also does n’t appreciate the seemingly endless click - click - click of the cameras when photographers take photos of him .
“ OK , guys , ” Obama told a gaggle of photographers snapping his every move before a golf game in Hawaii last December .
“ How many shots do you need ? ”
Obama also confessed recently that one of his biggest pet peeves is what he calls “ the shine police ” — aides and makeup artists who powder his face before he does television .
“ You notice that even before this interview , they constantly want to powder my nose and forehead and it's never enough — that I find quite irritating , ” Obama told The Associated Press .
As a workplace , the White House can generate small annoyances for the 44th president , such as events that are overstaffed and overplanned .
Do n’t bother mapping out his every move and giving him step - by - step instructions .
“ If you spend too much time telling him where to go , how you get there , and everything in between , it drives him crazy , ” said an aide who has worked with Obama for more than two years .
When staffers tell him not to take questions , for example , Obama will often take them anyway .
“ If we tell him to take one question , he ’ll take two , ” one senior administration official said .
“ He does n’t like too much instruction . ”
Obama also does n’t like people to regurgitate what he ’s already read in a detailed briefing book .
“ He sees it as a waste of time . ”
At meetings , the staff knows the do ’s and don’ts .
And the key to it all is being prepared and precise .
Axelrod said Obama bristles when “ people talk too much at meetings and prevent others from speaking . ”
When it ’s time to go around the table to talk about something , “ You better make sure you have everything there to discuss the issue , ” press secretary Robert Gibbs said .
Another senior aide agrees : “ If people are n’t prepared , if ideas are half - baked , he gets a little annoyed because he feels like he could be using his time better . ”
People who do n’t communicate directly and speechwriters who give him “ wishy - washy ” language also get a thumbs - down .
And what happens when he ’s displeased ?
" You can tell he 's annoyed , " Gibbs said .
But the president does n’t yell , according to Gibbs : " It 's far more convincing than yelling .
He gives you a smirk . "
Which is in keeping with his best - known dislike : drama .
“ He hates it , ” a senior aide said .
“ If you come to him with a problem , you had better tried to figure out 100 ways to solve the problem .
Even more than he dislikes drama , though , Obama “ hates being late , ” one senior aide said .
( Lately , more times than not , he arrives ahead of schedule . )
“ His biggest thing is he hates inconveniencing people , ” the aide said .
“ He wants meetings to start on time and wants to have enough time to meet with people , and so we try to build in some extra time .
He hates being rushed , and he hates shortchanging someone .
He ’s always very conscious about running on time .
That ’s a big deal to him . ”
There are , however , plenty of times when he takes seemingly annoying things in stride .
When a cell phone went off with a duck quack during an East Room event , Obama stopped mid-speech , smiled and asked , “ Whose duck back there ? ”
“ It ’s a duck , ” said Michelle Obama , standing by his side and laughing .
“ There ’s a duck quacking in there somewhere , ” Obama said .
“ Where do you guys get these ringtones by the way , I ’m just curious . ”
Moments later , he returned to his speech , seemingly not at all irritated .
But Obama might have a new pet peeve to add to his list , Axelrod quipped : “ When aides share his pet peeves with reporters . ”
Yun Hye - yong was a woman beyond the reach even of North Korean dictator Kim Jong -il .
Yun , the lead singer of Kim 's former favorite band Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble , was brutally executed after she spurned Kim 's persistent advances and fell in love with another man .
Or so claims Chang Jin-song , an author formerly affiliated with the North Korean Workers ' Party , in " Kim Jong - il 's Last Woman . "
Published in May , it is an epic poem that details Kim 's private life and inside story of his regime based on the true story of the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble .
According to the book , Kim ordered Yun Hye - yong 's songs to be used for the mass gymnastic performance " Arirang , " and attended a concert with her on his birthday .
Although many women had found the dictator 's favor before , none had ever merited a place next to him at a public event .
Kim even sent officials to Europe to buy her stage costumes and accessories .
Yet Yun loved the band 's pianist .
When Kim 's agents discovered their relationship by tapping her phone , Yun jumped from the roof of Mokran House , an official banquet hall , with her lover .
Although the man died instantly , Kim ordered his men to kill Yun after resuscitating her by any means .
She was eventually executed at the end of 2003 , while still in coma .
The Three Laughing Monks
In China , there is the legend of the three laughing monks .
They are also today sometimes referred to as the three laughing saints ( but of course in a very SBNR way ) .
The monks only ever did one thing : on entering a new village , they would stand in the market place and start laughing .
They would laugh with their whole being ( mind , body , heart , and soul ) and suddenly people would wake up to the Life and Kingdom of God that surrounded them .
A crowd would soon gather and everyone would start laughing because of these three crazy monks .
Eventually , the whole town would get involved and be alive to joy .
Then the monks would shimmy on to another town .
The three laughing monks were loved and admired very much .
For their only sermon , their only message ; was laughter .
They never taught ; they would simply create a situation .
As the years passed , the laughing monks ’ fame grew and grew .
All of China loved and respected them .
Nobody had ever preached the way they did : with laughter and nothing else .
Yet they also remained an enigma .
For they never laughed at anyone in particular , but rather as if they had understood a great cosmic joke .
The three laughing monks spread joy all over China without using a single word .
After living long lives together , one of the three laughing monks died .
When this happened , the whole village in which they were staying wondered what would happen next .
They thought that when the monk had died , the other two would surely weep .
The whole village gathered expecting to see this unusual sight .
But instead of crying , the two remaining monks stood beside the corpse of the third laughing a great belly laugh .
The villagers asked , “ How can you be laughing at a time like this ? ”
So for the very first time , the two monks spoke and said , “ We are laughing because our brother has won .
We always wondered who would die first and he has defeated us .
We are laughing at his victory and our defeat .
He lived with us for many years and we laughed together and we enjoyed each other ’s company .
There is no better way of giving him a last send off .
We can only laugh .
Nevertheless , the whole village remained sad .
But then when the dead monk ’s body was place on the funeral pyre , the whole village realized that the two monks were not the only ones who were joking , the dead monk was also laughing !
At that time , the custom was to change the clothes of the deceased and bathe the body .
But the dead monk said to his companions , “ Do n’t give me a bath because I have never been unclean .
So much laughter has been in my life that no impurity can accumulate , can come to me .
I have not gathered any dust .
Laughter is always young and fresh . ”
So just to respect his wishes , the two monks did not change their brother ’s clothes .
Then when the body was put on the fire , suddenly they became aware that he had hidden some Chinese fire - works under his clothes and had started going off .
The whole village began laughing and the other two monks said : “ You bastard , you ’re dead , but you have defeated us once again .
Your laughter is the last . ”
Optimistic women live longer and healthier lives than their pessimistic peers , a new study suggests .
Specifically , researchers found that women who see the glass as half full are at a lower risk for developing heart disease , and have a lower risk of dying from any cause , than those who see the glass as half empty .
The new research , detailed in the journal Circulation , also found that women with a high degree of cynical hostility — defined as harboring hostile thoughts toward others or having a general mistrust of people — were at a higher risk of dying in general .
" As a physician , I 'd like to see people try to reduce their negativity in general , " said Dr. Hilary A. Tindle , lead author of the study and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh .
" The majority of evidence suggests that sustained , high degrees of negativity are hazardous to health . "
The study is the largest to date to examine the health effects of optimism and cynical hostility in postmenopausal women over time .
Tindle 's team studied 97,253 postmenopausal women ( 89,259 white , 7,994 black ) ages 50 to 79 from the Women 's Health Initiative .
The women were free of cancer and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) at the start of the study .
Separating optimists from pessimists
The researchers used a test called the Life Orientation Test Revised Questionnaire to measure optimism and cynical hostility .
Scores were ranked , with high scores of 26 or more considered optimistic and scores below 22 considered pessimistic .
Optimism was defined as answering " yes " to questions like , " In unclear times , I usually expect the best . "
Pessimism was defined as answering " yes " to questions like , " If something can go wrong for me , it will . "
The results showed that optimistic women , compared to pessimistic women , had a 9 percent lower risk of developing heart disease and a 14 percent lower risk of dying from any cause after more than eight years of follow - up .
Furthermore , women with a high degree of cynical hostility , compared to those with a low degree , were 16 percent more likely to die during the eight years of follow - up .
A previous study conducted in the Netherlands also found that optimists had a lower risk of death .
What makes an optimist
The new study found links between particular characteristics and optimism .
Other studies have also found that certain factors are likely to make people more optimistic , particularly age — a 2006 study found that optimism tended to increase as people got older .
A 2009 study suggests that humans are optimistic by nature .
In the new study , race seemed to affect the relationship between optimism and death , with a stronger association seen in African - American women as compared to white women .
Researchers also found that optimists ( as compared to pessimists ) were more likely to be younger ( especially in blacks ) ; live in the Western United States ; report higher education and income ; be employed and have health insurance ; and attend religious services at least once a week .
Optimists were less likely to have diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol or depressive symptoms , smoke , be sedentary or have a high body mass index .
However , the relationship between optimism and heart disease and death persisted even after considering all of these factors .
" This study is a very reasonable stepping stone to future research in this area , both on potential mechanisms of how attitudes may affect health , and for randomized controlled trials to examine if attitudes can be changed to improve health , " Tindle said .

Here it is , boys and girls – the hilarious interview that Gene Simmons would n’t allow NPR to release as an archive like they normally do with Fresh Air , either because he could n’t figure out how to make any money off it or because it makes him sound like a complete douche .
My guess is the former .
Gene does his best to school the boring , repressed NPR listener on his fascinating philosophy of life ; apparently a subtle blend of Ayn Rand and Ron Jeremy .
Terry does her best not to get flustered while conducting a meaningful interview .
She does a pretty good job in my opinion .
Hey , she ’s Terry Gross .
So , please enjoy , and leave some comments below if you feel so inspired .
I ’m thrilled to get them .
President Obama will sign a presidential memorandum on Wednesday to extend benefits to same - sex partners of federal employees , administration officials said Tuesday evening , but he will stop short of pledging full health insurance coverage .
Mr. Obama , in an Oval Office announcement , is expected to offer details about which benefits will be provided .
It is the most significant statement he has made on gay issues , and it comes as he faces intense criticism from several gay rights leaders over what they suggest has been a failure to live up to campaign promises in the first months of his presidency .
Mr. Obama will be weighing in for the first time on one of the most delicate social and political issues of the day : whether the government must provide benefits to same - sex partners of federal employees .
While he will announce a list of benefits , officials said , they are not expected to include broad health insurance coverage , which could require legislation to achieve .
The initial reaction from some gay rights advocates was mixed .
“ Extending benefits to partners of gay federal employees is terrific , but at this point he is under enormous pressure from the gay civil rights community for having promised the moon and done nothing so far , ” Richard Socarides , an adviser to the Clinton administration on gay issues , said Tuesday evening .
“ So more important now is what he says tomorrow about the future for gay people during his presidency . ”
Nicole Cooke , the Olympic and world road race champion , is likely to spend the rest of the season racing in GB colours after the collapse of her Vision 1 team .
Cooke said the team , which she set up following her historic double , has cancelled its racing programme for the remainder of the season , owing to financial problems .
Dave Brailsford , the British Cycling performance director , said that she would be supported by the governing body in the build - up to a defence of her world title in Mendrisio , Italy at the end of September .
" We are in regular contact with Nicole , and we have a regular programme for the girls in the GB squad lined up for the end of the year , " Brailsford told Cycling Weekly .
" We are more than happy for Nicole to join the GB squad in preparation for the world championships , " he continued .
" She is the reigning Olympic and world champion and we 'll do everything we can to support her in her attempt to retain the world title . "
Despite her success last year Cooke has endured a difficult season , with her ambitious efforts to set up the new team apparently foundering from day one , principally through a failure to attract a headline sponsor .
It followed a parting of the ways , at the end of last season , with the Halfords Bikehut team , established by Brailsford and British Cycling in 2008 to support Cooke 's bid for Olympic glory .
With that mission accomplished , Cooke abruptly left , amid suggestions that her relations with British Cycling were strained .
But now it would appear that necessity will bring the two parties together again , at least until the end of the season .
Cooke , who withdrew from the recent Thüringen - Rundfahrt stage race with a virus , is expected to return to competition , in GB colours , at the Plouay World Cup on 22 August .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - France has secured the names and details of some 3,000 suspected tax evaders with Swiss bank accounts in what the budget minister described as a first in its battle against banking secrecy .
News of the deal comes after Switzerland and France signed a landmark agreement on bank information sharing this week .
“ It is the first time we have been able to get this type of information , that is so precise with the names , account numbers and amounts deposited , ” Eric Woerth told Sunday paper Le Journal du Dimanche , a copy of which was made available on Saturday .
Under pressure from the G20 , Switzerland , the world ’s biggest offshore banking center , agreed in March to relax its prized bank secrecy and agreed to share certain client data with other jurisdictions , once bilateral tax treaties were ratified .
On Thursday , Switzerland agreed to share banking information upon request from France ’s tax authorities as of January 2010 , an agreement which amends an existing tax accord from 1996 .
It was not immediately clear if the handing over these details was as a result of the agreement , which is part of Swiss efforts to be removed from an OECD “ grey list ” of tax havens .
Woerth said suspected French tax evaders would come under investigation if , by December 31 . , they had not declared their assets , estimated to total 3 billion euros ( $ 4.31 billion ) .
“ The French government had decided to speed up things .
The battle against tax havens is an essential plank of our efforts at making capitalism more moral , in which the French president is totally engaged , ” he added .
Last week , Switzerland agreed to reveal the names of about 4,450 wealthy American clients of UBS AG to U.S. authorities in a tax dispute settlement .
Riot police raid 30th barbecue because man used Facebook to invite his friends
Riot police raided a 30th birthday barbecue because they thought the organiser , who had invited his friends via Facebook , was staging a rave .
Four police cars , a riot van and a helicopter moved in on Andrew Poole 's gathering which was taking place in a field owned by a friend .
The coach driver had invited 17 guests to an ' event ' on his social networking page by private invitation and was about to light the barbecue when the gazebo suddenly started flapping wildly and the sound of chopper blades filled the air .
The gazebo under which the party guests were gathered because it had started to rain .
Then the police riot van arrived ...
Coach driver Andrew Poole said the police simply came in and stopped 15 people eating burgers
A police helicopter circled the field several times before four police cars and a riot van stormed into the field in a small village near Sowton , Devon .
Eight officers wearing camouflage trousers and body armour then jumped out and ordered the party to be shut down or everyone would be arrested .
Andrew , of Exeter , Devon , said : ' It had started to rain so we had gone in under the gazebo .
All of a sudden there was this noise in the sky - I honestly could n't believe it .
' The thing then hovered over us for about 25 minutes , watching 15 people eat .
They told us to take down the sound system and said everybody 's got to leave .
' It was 4 pm and we had n't even plugged the music in yet .
We tried to reason with them , and even offered for them to take the power lead for the sound system , but they were having none of it .
' It was on private land .
We were nowhere near anyone .
We were n't even playing any music .
What effectively the police did was come in and stop fifteen people eating burgers . '
Andrew had spent £ 800 for the hire of the generator , marquee and food .
The guests arrived at 3 pm but soon after a police helicopter generated a huge dust cloud which covered his BBQ in debris .
Andrew said : ' The police had full - on camouflage trousers on and body - armour , it was ridiculous .
There was also several plain - clothes officers as well .
' I told them it was my 30th birthday .
I said " this is a once in a lifetime event for me , please do n't ruin it " .
But they kept on insisting I had been advertising it as an all - night rave on the internet .
' But I 'd created an event , and 17 people had confirmed as guests , I did put the times on it as " overnight " in case people wanted to sleep - over .
' They were still banging on saying it was advertised on the internet .
They would n't accept it was n't a rave .
It was in a completely isolated field .
' We 'd actually faced the speakers away from the village just in case nosy - neighbour types complained .
But someone must have seen us putting up the marquee and phoned the police . '
A spokeswoman for Devon and Cornwall police said the helicopter was deployed for less that 20 minutes at a cost of around £ 200 .
She said local residents were concerned due to previous raves having reportedly taken place in the area with loud music and traffic disruption into the early hours .
She said : ' The decision to close down a rave or illegal music festival is not taken lightly .
' On this occasion , we were extremely concerned how the event had been advertised on the internet as an all - night party and it was therefore necessary to take the appropriate steps .
' Had it gone ahead , it is likely that far more of our resources would have been used to police the event and there would have been considerable disruption to neighbouring properties .
' It was fortunate that the force helicopter was able to fly over the site as they were returning from another task . '
Northern Rock was nationalised in February 2008 Losses at nationalised bank Northern Rock have grown by 24 % amid mounting losses on its mortgage loans .
Losses at the bank totalled £ 724.2 m in the first six months of 2009 , compared with £ 585.4 m in the first half of 2008 .
The Newcastle - based lender said that 3.92 % of its mortgage loans were more than three months in arrears , well above the national average of 2.39 % .
The first bank to seek emergency aid , it was nationalised in February 2008 and owes the government £ 10.9 bn .
It had to be bailed out by taxpayers in 2007 , when its model of borrowing short - term funds from wholesale markets to lend to mortgage borrowers was hit by the credit crunch .
Taxpayers are currently nursing a pretty hefty loss on their ownership of the Rock
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert Peston 's blog BBC business editor Robert Peston said that there were tentative signs that Northern Rock may be over the worst .
But he added that its mortgages were continuing to go bad at an alarming rate and at a faster rate than most of its rivals .
And he said the chances of the government being able to sell the Rock back to the private sector at a profit , ahead of next year 's General Election , were " very slim " .
The bank said the total value of all of its loans had fallen by £ 602.2 m in the first six months of the year .
Better deals Martin Weale , director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said there was a danger that things could get worse for Northern Rock 's mortgage book .
ANALYSIS Kevin Peachey , personal finance reporter , BBC News
Deep in the figures is news of how more and more customers of the nationalised bank are falling into negative equity , meaning they owe more money than their property is worth .
This figure has risen from 33 % of mortgage customers at the end of 2008 to 39 % now .
For those not intending to move , this is not a great problem .
Others who might like to move home will find they must stay as Rock customers , unable to remortgage elsewhere .
But it also shows the effect of falling house prices .
Earlier in the year , the National Audit Office calculated that half of the Rock 's mortgage loans would be in negative equity if house prices fell by 10 % .
So far , both have fallen short of that level , but if interest rates start to rise or job losses increase , repaying these loans could become more of a problem .
Rock or millstone : Are Northern Rock customers stuck ?
" House prices may well go on falling this year , and with falling house prices and rising unemployment you will have more and more people who have taken out 100 % or 125 % mortgages saying ' sorry , we can't keep up the repayments ' , " he said .
The proportion of Northern Rock customers whose properties are worth less than the amount they owe on their mortgages has risen to 39 % , from 33 % at the end of last year .
This is partly because the bank spent much of last year trying to encourage borrowers to move to other banks .
The borrowers most likely to have moved would have been those who owed a smaller proportion of the value of their property , as this would have enabled them to get a better deal elsewhere .
Additional funding Northern Rock is in the process of splitting itself into two companies , one of which will hold savers ' money and be responsible for new lending , while the other will hold many of the existing loans and be responsible for paying back loans to the government .
Once the restructuring has been completed , the Treasury will provide additional funding if the European Commission agrees to allow the plan .
Chief executive Gary Hoffman told reporters he was making " good progress " in discussions with the Commission and expected to receive clearance in the autumn .
Earlier in the year , Northern Rock announced a change to its strategy , which has meant that it has reduced the priority of repaying its loans to the government and instead has tried to increase the amount of money it is lending .
But it has warned it is unlikely to meet its target of £ 5 bn of new lending for this year and is more likely to hit a figure of £ 4bn .
' No coherency ' Mr Hoffman said that the target would be missed , because it was constrained by not yet having received state aid clearance from Europe .
But he added that there would have been demand for the extra money if it had been available and said applications for Northern Rock mortgages had doubled in the second quarter of the year , compared with the first three months of the year .
In addition to reporting statutory losses , Northern Rock also released an underlying figure , which it said gave a better reflection of the state of the business .
The underlying loss fell to £ 269.6 m for the six months to 30 June , compared with £ 443.3 m for the same period of 2008 .
The underlying figure excludes a £ 156.4 m rebate that it will receive if it gets state aid clearance from the European Commission .
It also excludes what it calls a volatility charge of £ 298.2 m on the way it accounts for the value of certain assets .
Labour MP Jim Cousins , a member of the Treasury Committee , said that ministers did not have a " coherent model " for the lender .
" There have always been two policies .
One is that it was embarrassing to have it nationalised and get rid of it as soon as possible and get the taxpayers ' money back as soon as possible , " he said .
" The other is to consider it to be an important business ... and to nurse that business back into strength in the longer run .
" But I do n't think they have ever quite been worked out . "

BAGHDAD  Iraqi officials have discovered that they may have a real air force , after all .
The Defense Ministry revealed Sunday that it had recently learned that Iraq owns 19 MIG - 21 and MIG - 23 jet fighters , which are in storage in Serbia .
Ministry officials are negotiating with the Serbs to restore and return the aircraft .
The Serbian government has tentatively promised to make two of the aircraft available “ for immediate use , ” according to a news release from the ministry .
The rest would be restored on a rush basis , the ministry said .
An Iraqi delegation went to Serbia as part of an effort by the government to locate assets stashed abroad by Saddam Hussein to evade sanctions .
Serbia had had friendly relations with Mr. Hussein ’s government .
During that visit , Serbian defense officials told the Iraqis that Mr. Hussein had sent 19 fighter jets to Serbia for repairs in the late 1980s , during the Iran - Iraq war , but was unable to bring them back after sanctions were imposed on his country .
Kristin here –
Back in July , when I was watching films at Il Cinema Ritrovato in Bologna , I managed to catch several of the films in the Frank Capra retrospective .
Two of them , Dirigible ( above and left ) and Submarine , were surprisingly spectacular , given that at the time Columbia was still a relatively minor studio .
It was n’t known for high - budget items .
How had Capra managed such lavish - looking films ?
One clue lies in the title at the beginning of Dirigible : “ Dedicated to the United States Navy without whose cooperation the production of this picture would not have been possible . ”
Clearly the film ’s second sequence ( from which both frames here were taken ) was shot at an actual air field with real planes and dirigibles .
Many shots in the scene were taken during what seems to have been a public air show .
I recalled that when I was growing up , every now and then a movie I saw had a similar acknowledgement .
Jimmy Stewart and other stalwart stars played government employees of various sorts , with pictures of impressive buildings in Washington and superimposed titles thanking this agency or that for its aid .
It also reminded me of The Lord of the Rings .
One sequence in The Return of the King , the battle before the Black Gates , was shot in an old military practice range of the New Zealand army ( right and below ) .
The country , with its lush forests and stunning mountains , is short on desolate plains .
The practice range was the only suitably Mordor - like landscape that could be found .
Not only did the army clear the field of unexploded ordnance , but it supplied soldiers to serve as extras by playing the Gondorian troops .
The supplement on the extended - version DVD , “ Cameras in Middle - earth , ” shows these troops , as well as the officers who gave them orders .
Apparently the soldiers were far more capable than regular extras of marching in straight lines and less willing to merely mime fighting during the battle .
All this got me to wondering how much free or cheap labor and mise - en - scene movies have received from the military over the years .
Coincidentally , when I got home in July , the stack of magazines awaiting me included an issue of Variety with the headline “ Tanks a Lot , Uncle Sam , ” on this very subject .
In the article author Peter Debruge explains a lot about the nuts and bolts of how the military ’s contributions work .
( As often happens , Variety opted for a more dignified title for the same article online : “ Film biz , military unite for mutual gain . ” )
The occasion was the release of Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
Lt. Col. Greg Bishop , an Iraqi vet appointed last year to handle the Army ’s interface with Hollywood , says of it , “ This is probably the largest joint - military movie ever made . ”
Indeed , Transformers enjoyed the assistance of four of the country ’s five military branches , with the Coast Guard being the only exception .
That ’s unusual , as Bishop points out .
Black Hawk Down mainly called upon the Army , Top Gun upon the Navy , and Iron Man upon the Air Force .
Debruge does n’t offer a lot of historical background , but he does mention that the Vietnam War led to a period of anti-military films .
Naturally the armed forces did n’t supply aid to films excoriating them .
In recent decades relations have become chummier .
What are the typical financial arrangements ?
According to the article ,
Hollywood has every incentive to seek the military ’s blessing .
A film like ‘ Transformers ’ gets much of the access , expertise and equipment for a fraction of what it would cost to arrange through private sources , with the production on the hook only for those expenses the government encounters as a direct consequence of supporting the film ( such as transporting all that megabucks equipment to the set from the nearest military base ) .
But the production pays no location fees for shooting on military property and no salaries to the service men and women who participate in the filming , in front of or behind the cameras .
In some cases , military exercises are arranged that can be incorporated into the filming .
Capt .
Bryon McGarry , the deputy director of the Air Force ’s PR office , is quoted concerning a day when Transformers was shooting “ at White Sands when a formation of six F - 16s popped flares over the set , simulating a low - level , air - to - ground attack .
‘ The flyover was very much the type of training the Air National Guard does every day .
Only that day , Michael Bay and his cameras had a front - row seat to the air power show , ’ he says . ”
This sort of military assistance is n’t available to films that shoot entirely overseas , such as Saving Private Ryan and HBO ’s Band of Brothers .
Hence films like Transformers and Iron Man arrange to shoot some key sequences in the American West , where deserts and mountains can convincingly double for places like the Middle East .
Even in this day of elaborate CGI special effects , many directors prefer the real thing .
For one thing , it often looks more realistic , and for another , CGI is really expensive .
Naturally the military does n’t do all this for nothing .
They want influence over the way the Armed Forces are depicted .
Spielberg ’s War of the Worlds had military assistance .
The Pentagon ’s film laiason , Phil Strub , says , “ The big battle scene at the end was going to be different .
We just wanted the case made that the Marines understood that they were not going to prevail , but they were nobly sacrificing so the civilians in that valley could escape . ”
Strub also decries “ the enduring stereotype of the loner hero who must succeed by disobeying orders , going outside the rules by being stupid . ”
As Debruge points out , “ By contrast , the ‘ Transformers ’ sequel embodies the military philosophy that teamwork is essential to success . ”
The positive depiction of the military also might attract young people to enlist — and give enemies an impression of America ’s overwhelming might .
McGarry says , “ Recruiting and deterrents are secondary goals , but they ’re certainly there . ”
The idea that Hollywood often gets in bed with the military wo n’t come as a surprise to anyone .
( For a book emphasizing this aspect of the military ’s involvement in filmmaking in the U.S. , see David L. Robb ’s Operation Hollywood : How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the Movies . )
But the extent to which even the biggest — or maybe that should be especially the biggest —
Hollywood films boost their budgets in a big way is less obvious .
From the standpoint of the business history of Hollywood , it ’s fascinating and deserves a closer look .
Authorities said Thursday that four boys ages 9 to 14 took turns raping an 8 - year - old girl behind a shed for more than 10 minutes in what Phoenix police are calling one of the most horrific cases they 've ever seen .
The outrage over the allegations intensified after police said the girl 's parents criticized her after the attack and blamed her for bringing shame on the family .
" The father told the caseworker and an officer in her presence that he did n't want her back .
He said , ' Take her , I do n't want her , ' " police Sgt. Andy Hill said .
The 14 - year - old boy was charged Wednesday as an adult with two counts of sexual assault and kidnapping , the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office said .
He appeared in court Thursday and is being held without bond .
The other boys - ages 9 , 10 , and 13 - were charged as juveniles with sexual assault .
The 10 - and 13 - year - old boys also were charged with kidnapping , the office said Thursday .
Phoenix investigators said the boys lured the girl to an empty shed July 16 under the pretense of offering her gum .
The boys held the girl down while they took turns assaulting her , police said .
" She was brutally sexually assaulted for a period of about 10 to 15 minutes , " Hill said .
Officers responding to an emergency call reporting hysterical screams found the girl partially clothed and the boys running from the scene .
" This is a deeply disturbing case that has gripped our community , " Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said Thursday .
" Our office will seek justice for the young victim in this heartrending situation . "
Hill cited the family 's background as the reason the family shunned the girl .
All five children are refugees from the West African nation of Liberia .
In some parts of Africa , women often are blamed for being raped for enticing men or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Girls who are raped are often shunned by their families .
" It 's a shame - based culture , so the crime is not as important as protecting the family name and the name of the community , " said Tony Weedor , a Liberian refugee in Littleton , Colo. , and co-founder of the CenterPoint International Foundation , which helps Liberians resettle in the U.S. " I just feel so sorry for this little girl .
Some of these people will not care about the trauma she 's going through - they 're more concerned about the shame she brought on the family . "
Ali Keita , a Liberian refugee and president of the Arizona Mandingo Association , works with refugees to ease their integration into U.S. society .
Keita said that Liberian families may question why sexual - assault victims were in a situation that left them open for attack but that the initial response likely stems from disappointment and frustration with the family 's circumstances .
" ( As a parent ) , you feel like you 've failed . . . to protect them , " Keita said .
In recent years , Liberia has made efforts to combat rape under the leadership of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , who has sought to dispel the stigma associated with sexual assault by publicly acknowledging that she was herself the victim of attempted rape during the country 's civil war .
The girl 's healing process will be particularly difficult , said Paul Penzone of Childhelp , which aids young victims of crime .
Authorities said the victim was in the care of Child Protective Services .
" These four boys used what was a ploy to entice her to a place where they could take advantage of her almost like a pack of wolves , " he said .
" And what 's so disturbing beyond the initial crime is the fact that a child needs to have somewhere to feel safe , and you would think that would be in a home with her own family , " not in state custody , Penzone said .
Republic reporter Maria Polletta contributed to this article .
A bar owned by a U.S. expat in downtown Manila , called the “ Hobbit House ” , offers employment , entertainment and hope to downtrodden dwarves from throughout the Philippines .
The Houston Chronicle has the story here :
He considers them family , but they ’re not his children .
They ’re the dwarfs and other little people the 70 - year - old Iowa native , [ Jim Turner ] , has rescued from the heartless streets of this capital city to offer them friendship and honest work .
For 35 years , the former Peace Corps volunteer has operated the Hobbit House , a bar themed on J.R.R .
Tolkien ’s fantasy novels , a realm marked by all things miniature .
Under his care , hundreds of dwarfs have adopted new cultural identities .
They ’re no longer shunned or even feared as supposed evil spirits , but have become popular characters called hobbits — merry figures who serve drinks , crack ribald jokes and even entertain onstage .
There ’s even one midget Elvis impersonator .
Naturally , Turner has had his share of disapproval from critics .
After all , is n’t casting dwarves as hobbits for a themed bar exploitive in its own right ?
While being a merry hobbit may be favorable to being considered an evil spirit , is n’t this still reinforcing fictional stereotypes which continue to marginalize little people ?
Turner scoffs at such accusations : “ We took many from the worst slums in Manila , where they were mocked and ridiculed , ” he says .
“ Now they ’re no longer carnival freaks .
They ’re respected entertainers and businesspeople . ”
Regardless of what anyone might think , there ’s no doubt as to who Turner ’s biggest supporters are : the little people themselves .
He does more than just offer them employment ; he pays their tuition and loans , defends them from ridicule and gives them public legitimacy ; perhaps most importantly , he gives them a chance to earn their own self - respect .
And he treats them as equals too .
Several years ago he handed over ownership of the ‘ Hobbit House ’ itself to the little people who work there .
All in all , the story is a good example as to how expats can have positive impacts , and in unexpected ways .
Living abroad can open up any number of creative avenues which can steer your life down adventurous , unconventional channels , and which can allow you to help others who have been less fortunate .
Most importantly , becoming an expat can make you more appreciative of your own opportunities in life .
Speaking from his own unique , eccentric cultural experience living among Filipino dwarves : “ You see the hurdles they scale , and you realize that no matter how many problems you have , if you ’re average size in this world , you ’ve got the game half - won . ”
In what exotic place will you find your own heart ?

Behold !
A comic strip !
We were able to make this thing even though Tony was busy scavenging and Wes met a reptile .
Jon Stewart went head to head with an insurance industry insider that is attempting to kill President Barack Obama ’s efforts at health care reform .
Betsy McCaughey is the former Lt. Governor of New York and is partly responsible for the downfall of President Bill Clinton ’s health care reform .
Her 1994 feature in The New Republic , “ No Exit , ” blew the first big hole in Clinton ’s health plan .
McCaughey is currently listed as a board member of the Cantel Medical Corporation .

In 2009 , McCaughey took a shot at Obama ’s health care reform in a New York Post op - ed where she claimed that the health care bill would require end - of - life consultations .
PolitiFact.com gave McCaughey ’s claim a “ pants on fire ” rating and called it “ a ridiculous falsehood . ”
Jon Stewart invited McCaughey to provide the exact passage in the bill that states end - of - life consultations would be “ mandatory . ”
McCaughey admitted that the word “ mandatory ” never appears in the legislation but insisted that doctors would be penalized for not providing consultations .
Stewart quickly corrected her .
“ That is not in in any way what this said . ”
“ You and I disagree about the reading of this bill , ” said McCaughey .
“ Because under the new Medicare pay performance system , doctors who do n’t adhere to the protocols delivered by the federal government on what is cost effective and appropriate care get dinged in their payments .
They get paid less .
There ’s actual financial pressure , ” she said .
Stewart disagreed .
“ That ’s not the interpretation of the bill .
The interpretation of the bill is to get empirical evidence complied on things that work .
It ’s following science for medicine , ” he explained .

Report : Neda 's Family Forced Out of Home
Check out today 's earlier coverage on heated protests and more violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces .
According to an un-bylined report on The Guardian 's Web site , Iranian authorities have forced the family of Neda Agha Soltan to leave their apartment in east Tehran .
Amateur video of Soltan 's apparent death at a rally on Saturday has become a YouTube sensation and galvanized the opposition movement , as The Post 's Thomas Erdbrink wrote yesterday .
According to The Guardian ,
Neighbours said that her family no longer lives in the four - floor apartment building on Meshkini Street , in eastern Tehran , having been forced to move since she was killed .
The police did not hand the body back to her family , her funeral was cancelled , she was buried without letting her family know and the government banned mourning ceremonies at mosques , the neighbors said .
" We just know that they [ the family ] were forced to leave their flat , " a neighbour said .
The Guardian was unable to contact the family directly to confirm if they had been forced to leave .
The Post has not confirmed the details of The Guardian report .
According to Erdbrink 's story , BBC Persian , a Web site run by the BBC in Farsi , quoted a man it described as Agha Soltan 's fiance as saying that her body was buried " in a small area in the Zahra Cemetery in the late afternoon " on Sunday .
The video that turned Soltan into an icon of the opposition can be seen here .
But be forewarned , the footage is unedited and very graphic .
According to The Post 's Jose Antonio Vargas 's story on how the Iranian protests have played out online , a Wikipedia page about Soltan created late Saturday night has been edited hundreds of times since it was posted .

Styles in design are described and classified in many ways .
Sometimes they are given a moniker , like “ Web 2.0 , ” other times they are referred to by their appearance : grungy , minimalist , retro , big type .
The people ( and brands ) to which modern design styles are attributed are as numerous as the styles themselves .
Many designers look to a brand such as Apple as an example of great modern design because a designer ’s sensibility is infused into everything it does .
Even though many current styles and trends can be connected to recent design pieces , they do not originate there .
So much modern design originated before computers and the Web were even a glimmer in the eye of their creators .
Looking back and drawing inspiration from very early graphic and print design is a current trend nowadays , but that is not the beginning of the story .
As you go further back , you ’ll find groundbreaking design decades , even a century , ago .
In this article we ’ll explore inspirational paintings and artists who have influenced modern design .
In reading this article , you will see some true evolution in design .
Where Art Meets Design
The term “ graphic design ” was coined in 1922 by one of the first modern designers , William Addison Dwiggins .
He described himself as , “ [ an ] individual who brings structural order and visual form to printed communications . ”
This seems to be where art meets design .
Design is for communicating and achieving a specific goal .
Today , the goal is often to market and sell products or services through design , whether by packaging a product , building a brand or creating a Web experience .
So , is design today merely art created for the express purpose of generating profit ?
One could argue that great artists in history created their own art for profit .
Michelangelo ’s Scenes from Genesis on the Sistine Chapel and Leonardo da Vinci ’s great work The Last Supper were both commissioned by the church .
Today , we regard their work as innovative and embodiments of the Renaissance , but we forget they were also created for profit .
We like to think of great artists as purely motivated individuals who are driven to express themselves or transform our perception of the world .
Colors , textures and composition are part of their process of self - discovery and reflect the aesthetics of the time .
Modern designers are no different .
Even though a particular design may be intended to communicate the message of a corporation , it still reflects the world around us , and the designer has left their mark on it .
Art History Found Today
The best art in history was unprecedented and transcended its time .
It sometimes seems as if the artists were conscious of future generations enjoying their work .
Their compositions , colors , and styles do n’t just hang on gallery walls today .
They are all around us , in everything from shoes to album covers .

A Closer Look At Six Great Artists
If asked to name a few great artists , someone might first think of Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol .
Many other great artists , though , have shown their influence on modern design .
Below are six artists who are unique , innovative and ahead of their time .
Piet Mondriaan
Piet Mondriaan ( 1872-1944 ) was a Dutch artist known for clean , grid - style paintings .
His later compositions , which may initially look simple , took him months to paint .
Each element , from the rectangles to the lines , are composed with precision , with careful attention paid to thickness and width .
Mondriaan ’s work has influenced the design of modern architecture , print layouts , linoleum and , of course , the minimalist style in modern design .
Rhythm of Black Lines , 1935 - 42
Broadway Boogie Woogie , 1942 - 43
Basquiat
Jean - Michel Basquiat ( 1960 - 1988 ) was an American artist known for graffiti- influenced and early grunge - style paintings .
He started out as a graffiti artist in New York City and later sold postcards and the like along with his artwork on the streets .
His painting career took off , and he became known for his use of text and images from popular culture , as well as painting on found objects .
Basquiat has been credited with bringing the African - American and Latino experience to the art world .
Self - Portrait , 1982
Per Capita , 1983
Yves Klein
Yves Klein ( 1928 - 1962 ) was a French artist known for his minimalist monochromatic paintings , featuring his signature deep blue .
He worked with blue extensively in his early career and , in 1958 , began to use it as a dominant element , making the color itself the art .
International Klein Blue ( IKB ) is the deep blue hue first mixed by Yves Klein .
It is outside the color gamut of computer displays , so it can not be shown accurately in digital format .
La Vague , 1957
Joan Miró
Joan Miró ( 1893 - 1983 ) was a Spanish artist known for an abstract , collage - style of painting .
He famously declared , “ I want to assassinate painting . ”
Miró wanted to upset the traditional and popular styles of art .
He was against art for the sake of propaganda or to give the wealthy a cultural identity .
Miró tried not to associate himself with any specific art styles or movements .
His bold compositions and fresh thinking have influenced many great modern designers .
Hand Catching a Bird , 1926
L’Oro dell ’ Azzurro , 1935
El Lissitzky
Lazar Markovich Lissitzky ( 1890 - 1941 ) was a Russian artist known for his geometric and early graphic - design style .
He was a versatile artist who worked in close to a dozen fields , from painting to architectural design .
He influenced the Bauhaus and De Stijl ( Mondriaan ) movements .
His artwork and production techniques heavily influence commercial art and modern design today .
Beat the White with the Red Wedge , 1919
Self - Portrait , 1914
Gustav Klimt
Gustav Klimt ( 1862-1918 ) was an Austrian artist known for his decorative paintings that make heavy use of gold and provocative symbolism .
He is one of the founders of the Vienna Art Nouveau ( Vienna Secession ) movement .
He is known for his “ Golden Phase , ” which is characterized by gold leaves and influences ranging from Byzantine to Egyptian .
His compositions have symbolic elements that represent such psychological ideas as the “ femme fatal . ”
The Kiss , 1907
The Tree of Life , 1909
Stepping Back To Move Forward
Inspiration and examples of well - executed designs fill up galleries , blogs and online sources like Flickr .
Leading industry magazines such as HOW and Communication Arts show the best of what modern design offers .
Many of us look to these sources for ideas and to find the spark for our next masterpiece .
But many designers do not bother looking to works of art from earlier in history .
By stepping back in time and walking through an art museum or reading the bio and studying the works of an artist from the past , we can find new ways to approach today ’s design challenges .

Seven Myths About Alternative Energy
“ We Need to Do Everything Possible to Promote Alternative Energy . ”
Not exactly .
It ’s certainly clear that fossil fuels are mangling the climate and that the status quo is unsustainable .
There is now a broad scientific consensus that the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than 25 percent by 2020 — and more than 80 percent by 2050 .
Even if the planet did n’t depend on it , breaking our addictions to oil and coal would also reduce global reliance on petrothugs and vulnerability to energy - price spikes .
But though the world should do everything sensible to promote alternative energy , there ’s no point trying to do everything possible .
There are financial , political , and technical pressures as well as time constraints that will force tough choices ; solutions will need to achieve the biggest emissions reductions for the least money in the shortest time .
Hydrogen cars , cold fusion , and other speculative technologies might sound cool , but they could divert valuable resources from ideas that are already achievable and cost - effective .
It ’s nice that someone managed to run his car on liposuction leftovers , but that does n’t mean he needs to be subsidized .
Reasonable people can disagree whether governments should try to pick energy winners and losers .
But why not at least agree that governments should n’t pick losers to be winners ?
Unfortunately , that ’s exactly what is happening .
The world is rushing to promote alternative fuel sources that will actually accelerate global warming , not to mention an alternative power source that could cripple efforts to stop global warming .
We can still choose a truly alternative path .
But we ’d better hurry .
“ Renewable Fuels Are the Cure for Our Addiction to Oil . ”
Unfortunately not .
“ Renewable fuels ” sound great in theory , and agricultural lobbyists have persuaded European countries and the United States to enact remarkably ambitious biofuels mandates to promote farm - grown alternatives to gasoline .
But so far in the real world , the cures — mostly ethanol derived from corn in the United States or biodiesel derived from palm oil , soybeans , and rapeseed in Europe — have been significantly worse than the disease .
Photo by Gisel Florez for FP
Researchers used to agree that farm - grown fuels would cut emissions because they all made a shockingly basic error .
They gave fuel crops credit for soaking up carbon while growing , but it never occurred to them that fuel crops might displace vegetation that soaked up even more carbon .
It was as if they assumed that biofuels would only be grown in parking lots .
Needless to say , that has n’t been the case ; Indonesia , for example , destroyed so many of its lush forests and peat lands to grow palm oil for the European biodiesel market that it ranks third rather than 21st among the world ’s top carbon emitters .
In 2007 , researchers finally began accounting for deforestation and other land - use changes created by biofuels .
One study found that it would take more than 400 years of biodiesel use to “ pay back ” the carbon emitted by directly clearing peat for palm oil .
Indirect damage can be equally devastating because on a hungry planet , food crops that get diverted to fuel usually end up getting replaced somewhere .
For example , ethanol profits are prompting U.S. soybean farmers to switch to corn , so Brazilian soybean farmers are expanding into cattle pastures to pick up the slack and Brazilian ranchers are invading the Amazon rain forest , which is why another study pegged corn ethanol ’s payback period at 167 years .
It ’s simple economics :
The mandates increase demand for grain , which boosts prices , which makes it lucrative to ravage the wilderness .
Deforestation accounts for 20 percent of global emissions , so unless the world can eliminate emissions from all other sources — cars , coal , factories , cows — it needs to back off forests .
That means limiting agriculture ’s footprint , a daunting task as the world ’s population grows — and an impossible task if vast expanses of cropland are converted to grow middling amounts of fuel .
Even if the United States switched its entire grain crop to ethanol , it would only replace one fifth of U.S. gasoline consumption .
This is not just a climate disaster .
The grain it takes to fill an SUV tank with ethanol could feed a hungry person for a year ; biofuel mandates are exerting constant upward pressure on global food prices and have contributed to food riots in dozens of poorer countries .
Still , the United States has quintupled its ethanol production in a decade and plans to quintuple its biofuel production again in the next decade .
This will mean more money for well - subsidized grain farmers , but also more malnutrition , more deforestation , and more emissions .
European leaders have paid a bit more attention to the alarming critiques of biofuels — including one by a British agency that was originally established to promote biofuels — but they have shown no more inclination to throw cold water on this $ 100 billion global industry .
“ If Today ’s Biofuels Are n’t the Answer , Tomorrow ’s Biofuels Will Be . ”
Doubtful .
The latest U.S. rules , while continuing lavish support for corn ethanol , include enormous new mandates to jump - start “ second - generation ” biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol derived from switchgrass .
In theory , they would be less destructive than corn ethanol , which relies on tractors , petroleum - based fertilizers , and distilleries that emit way too much carbon .
Even first - generation ethanol derived from sugar cane — which already provides half of Brazil ’s transportation fuel — is considerably greener than corn ethanol .
But recent studies suggest that any biofuels requiring good agricultural land would still be worse than gasoline for global warming .
Less of a disaster than corn ethanol is still a disaster .
Back in the theoretical world , biofuels derived from algae , trash , agricultural waste , or other sources could help because they require no land or at least unspecific “ degraded lands , ” but they always seem to be “ several ” years away from large - scale commercial development .
And some scientists remain hopeful that fast - growing perennial grasses such as miscanthus can convert sunlight into energy efficiently enough to overcome the land - use dilemmas — someday .
But for today , farmland happens to be very good at producing the food we need to feed us and storing the carbon we need to save us , and not so good at generating fuel .
In fact , new studies suggest that if we really want to convert biomass into energy , we ’re better off turning it into electricity .
Then what should we use in our cars and trucks ?
In the short term … gasoline .
We just need to use less of it .
Instead of counterproductive biofuel mandates and ethanol subsidies , governments need fuel - efficiency mandates to help the world ’s 1 billion drivers guzzle less gas , plus subsidies for mass transit , bike paths , rail lines , telecommuting , carpooling , and other activities to get those drivers out of their cars .
Policymakers also need to eliminate subsidies for roads to nowhere , mandates that require excess parking and limit dense development in urban areas , and other sprawl - inducing policies .
None of this is as enticing as inventing a magical new fuel , but it ’s doable , and it would cut emissions .
In the medium term , the world needs plug - in electric cars , the only plausible answer to humanity ’s oil addiction that is n’t decades away .
But electricity is already the source of even more emissions than oil .
So we ’ll need an answer to humanity ’s coal addiction , too .
“ Nuclear Power Is the Cure for Our Addiction to Coal . ”
Nope .
Atomic energy is emissions free , so a slew of politicians and even some environmentalists have embraced it as a clean alternative to coal and natural gas that can generate power when there ’s no sun or wind .
In the United States , which already gets nearly 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants , utilities are thinking about new reactors for the first time since the Three Mile Island meltdown three decades ago — despite global concerns about nuclear proliferation , local concerns about accidents or terrorist attacks , and the lack of a disposal site for the radioactive waste .
France gets nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nukes , and Russia , China , and India are now gearing up for nuclear renaissances of their own .

But nuclear power cannot fix the climate crisis .
The first reason is timing : The West needs major cuts in emissions within a decade , and the first new U.S. reactor is only scheduled for 2017 — unless it gets delayed , like every U.S. reactor before it .
Elsewhere in the developed world , most of the talk about a nuclear revival has remained just talk ; there is no Western country with more than one nuclear plant under construction , and scores of existing plants will be scheduled for decommissioning in the coming decades , so there ’s no way nuclear could make even a tiny dent in electricity emissions before 2020 .
The bigger problem is cost .
Nuke plants are supposed to be expensive to build but cheap to operate .
Unfortunately , they ’re turning out to be really , really expensive to build ; their cost estimates have quadrupled in less than a decade .
Energy guru Amory Lovins has calculated that new nukes will cost nearly three times as much as wind — and that was before their construction costs exploded for a variety of reasons , including the global credit crunch , the atrophying of the nuclear labor force , and a supplier squeeze symbolized by a Japanese company ’s worldwide monopoly on steel - forging for reactors .
A new reactor in Finland that was supposed to showcase the global renaissance is already way behind schedule and way , way over budget .
This is why plans for new plants were recently shelved in Canada and several U.S. states , why Moody ’s just warned utilities they ’ll risk ratings downgrades if they seek new reactors , and why renewables attracted $ 71 billion in worldwide private capital in 2007 — while nukes attracted zero .
It ’s also why U.S. nuclear utilities are turning to politicians to supplement their existing loan guarantees , tax breaks , direct subsidies , and other cradle - to - grave government goodies with new public largesse .
Reactors do n’t make much sense to build unless someone else is paying ; that ’s why the strongest push for nukes is coming from countries where power is publicly funded .
For all the talk of sanctions , if the world really wants to cripple the Iranian economy , maybe the mullahs should just be allowed to pursue nuclear energy .
Unlike biofuels , nukes do n’t worsen warming .
But a nuclear expansion — like the recent plan by U.S. Republicans who want 100 new plants by 2030 — would cost trillions of dollars for relatively modest gains in the relatively distant future .
Nuclear lobbyists do have one powerful argument :
If coal is too dirty and nukes are too costly , how are we going to produce our juice ?
Wind is terrific , and it ’s on the rise , adding nearly half of new U.S. power last year and expanding its global capacity by a third in 2007 .
But after increasing its worldwide wattage tenfold in a decade —
China is now the leading producer , and Europe is embracing wind as well — it still produces less than 2 percent of the world ’s electricity .
Solar and geothermal are similarly wonderful and inexhaustible technologies , but they ’re still global rounding errors .
The average U.S. household now has 26 plug - in devices , and the rest of the world is racing to catch up ; the U.S. Department of Energy expects global electricity consumption to rise 77 percent by 2030 .
How can we meet that demand without a massive nuclear revival ?
We can’t .
So we ’re going to have to prove the Department of Energy wrong .
“ There Is No Silver Bullet to the Energy Crisis . ”
Probably not .
But some bullets are a lot better than others ; we ought to give them our best shot before we commit to evidently inferior bullets .
And one renewable energy resource is the cleanest , cheapest , and most abundant of them all .
It does n’t induce deforestation or require elaborate security .
It does n’t depend on the weather .
And it wo n’t take years to build or bring to market ; it ’s already universally available .

It ’s called “ efficiency . ”
It means wasting less energy — or more precisely , using less energy to get your beer just as cold , your shower just as hot , and your factory just as productive .
It ’s not about some austerity scold harassing you to take cooler showers , turn off lights , turn down thermostats , drive less , fly less , buy less stuff , eat less meat , ditch your McMansion , and otherwise change your behavior to save energy .
Doing less with less is called conservation .
Efficiency is about doing more or the same with less ; it does n’t require much effort or sacrifice .
Yet more efficient appliances , lighting , factories , and buildings , as well as vehicles , could wipe out one fifth to one third of the world ’s energy consumption without any real deprivation .
Efficiency is n’t sexy , and the idea that we could use less energy without much trouble hangs uneasily with today ’s more - is - better culture .
But the best way to ensure new power plants do n’t bankrupt us , empower petrodictators , or imperil the planet is not to build them in the first place .
“ Negawatts ” saved by efficiency initiatives generally cost 1 to 5 cents per kilowatt - hour versus projections ranging from 12 to 30 cents per kilowatt - hour from new nukes .
That ’s because Americans in particular and human beings in general waste amazing amounts of energy .
U.S. electricity plants fritter away enough to power Japan , and American water heaters , industrial motors , and buildings are as ridiculously inefficient as American cars .
Only 4 percent of the energy used to power a typical incandescent bulb produces light ; the rest is wasted .
China is expected to build more square feet of real estate in the next 15 years than the United States has built in its entire history , and it has no green building codes or green building experience .
But we already know that efficiency mandates can work wonders because they ’ve already reduced U.S. energy consumption levels from astronomical to merely high .
For example , thanks to federal rules , modern American refrigerators use three times less energy than 1970s models , even though they ’re larger and more high - tech .
The biggest obstacles to efficiency are the perverse incentives that face most utilities ; they make more money when they sell more power and have to build new generating plants .
But in California and the Pacific Northwest , utility profits have been decoupled from electricity sales , so utilities can help customers save energy without harming shareholders .
As a result , in that part of the country , per capita power use has been flat for three decades — while skyrocketing 50 percent in the rest of the United States .
If utilities around the world could make money by helping their customers use less power , the U.S. Department of Energy would n’t be releasing such scary numbers .
“ We Need a Technological Revolution to Save the World . ”
Maybe .
In the long term , it ’s hard to imagine how ( without major advances ) we can reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050 while the global population increases and the developing world develops .
So a clean - tech Apollo program modeled on the Manhattan Project makes sense .
And we do need carbon pricing to send a message to market makers and innovators to promote low - carbon activities ;
Europe ’s cap - and - trade scheme seems to be working well after a rocky start .
The private capital already pouring into renewables might someday produce a cheap solar panel or a synthetic fuel or a superpowerful battery or a truly clean coal plant .
At some point , after we ’ve milked efficiency for all the negawatts and negabarrels we can , we might need something new .

But we already have all the technology we need to start reducing emissions by reducing consumption .
Even if we only hold electricity demand flat , we can subtract a coal - fired megawatt every time we add a wind - powered megawatt .
And with a smarter grid , green building codes , and strict efficiency standards for everything from light bulbs to plasma
TVs to server farms , we can do better than flat .
Al Gore has a reasonably plausible plan for zero-emissions power by 2020 ; he envisions an ambitious 28 percent decrease in demand through efficiency , plus some ambitious increases in supply from wind , solar , and geothermal energy .
But we do n’t even have to reduce our fossil fuel use to zero to reach our 2020 targets .
We just have to use less .
If somebody comes up with a better idea by 2020 , great !
For now , we should focus on the solutions that get the best emissions bang for the buck .
“ Ultimately , We ’ll Need to Change Our Behaviors to Save the World . ”
Probably .
These days , it ’s politically incorrect to suggest that going green will require even the slightest adjustment to our way of life , but let ’s face it : Jimmy Carter was right .
It would n’t kill you to turn down the heat and put on a sweater .
Efficiency is a miracle drug , but conservation is even better ; a Prius saves gas , but a Prius sitting in the driveway while you ride your bike uses no gas .
Even energy - efficient dryers use more power than clotheslines .
More with less will be a great start , but to get to 80 percent less emissions , the developed world might occasionally have to do less with less .
We might have to unplug a few digital picture frames , substitute teleconferencing for some business travel , and take it easy on the air conditioner .
If that ’s an inconvenient truth , well , it ’s less inconvenient than trillions of dollars ’ worth of new reactors , perpetual dependence on hostile petrostates , or a fricasseed planet .
After all , the developing world is entitled to develop .
Its people are understandably eager to eat more meat , drive more cars , and live in nicer houses .
It does n’t seem fair for the developed world to say :
Do as we say , not as we did .
But if the developing world follows the developed world ’s wasteful path to prosperity , the Earth we all share wo n’t be able to accommodate us .
So we ’re going to have to change our ways .
Then we can at least say :
Do as we ’re doing , not as we did .
If you ’ve been hurt on the job or because of someone else ’s negligence , you know all too well the feeling of being overwhelmed .

Electricity demand from British industry has fallen by an unprecedented 8 % this year as factories have shut down in droves , power station operator Drax said today .
Household demand has also declined – by 2 % – but that was due to mild weather rather than economic reasons , the company 's chief executive , Dorothy Thompson , said , as she unveiled half - year results .
Overall demand for the power station 's electricity fell by 6 % in the first six months of 2009 , compared with the same period a year earlier .
The station , in Yorkshire , is the largest coal - fired power station in Europe and supplies around 7 % of Britain 's electricity .
Thompson said it was usual for energy demand to fluctuate in line with changes in overall economic output , but this time the drop was abnormally large .
" For our sector it 's a very unusual movement ... in fact , unprecedented in my experience , " she said .
A slump in world trade volumes in the second half of last year and a collapse in demand for things like new cars meant Britain 's industry has borne the brunt of the recession .
Many car plants closed for several months around the turn of the year as they tried to run down stocks of unsold cars .
That also caused many parts suppliers to shut down temporarily , which could explain such a sharp drop in electricity demand .
Drax – the country 's biggest carbon dioxide emitter , which burns around 100 m tonnes of coal a year – said its carbon abatement projects were on track .
These include an upgrading of existing turbines to increase their efficiency , the conversion of some to also burn biomass such as wood pellets , and the building of new , biomass - only plants .
It said that on completion , the biomass co-firing facility would be the largest of its type in the world .
Along with Drax 's existing co-firing capability , it would provide a total of 500MW of renewable electricity , or the equivalent output of over 600 wind turbines , by mid-2010 .
That will be equivalent to 12.5 % of its total output .
The biomass co-firing facility will reduce Drax 's emissions of CO2 by over 2.5 m tonnes each year .
With the upgrade in efficiency of the standard turbines , the station will have cut its carbon emissions by 3.5 m tonnes , or 17.5 % , by 2011 compared with 2006 levels .
Drax posted a sharp fall in first half earnings due to lower power prices , but said profit should rise sharply in 2010 thanks to more favourable hedging contracts for its electricity .
Pretax profit fell to £ 33.8 m in the first six months of the year from £ 149.5 m in the same period last year after revenues declined 12 % to £ 706.9 m .

THIS WAS AN OLD MAN .
Not an incredibly old man ; obsolete , spavined ; not as worn as the sway - backed stone steps ascending the Pyramid of the Sun to an ancient temple ; not yet a relic .
But even so , a very old man , this old man perched on an antique shooting stick , its handles open to form a seat , its spike thrust at an angle into the soft ground and trimmed grass of the cemetery .
Gray , thin rain misted down at almost the same , angle as that at which the spike pierced the ground .
The winter - barren trees lay flat and black against an aluminum sky , unmoving in the chill wind .
An old man sitting at the foot of a grave mound whose headstone had tilted slightly when the earth had settled ; sitting in the rain and speaking to someone below .
" They tore it down , Minna .
" I tell you , they must have bought off a councilman .
" Came in with bulldozers at six o'clock in the morning , and you know that 's not legal .
There 's a Municipal Code .
Supposed to hold off till at least seven on weekdays , eight on the weekend ; but there they were at six , even before six , barely light for godsakes .
Thought they 'd sneak in and do it before the neighborhood got wind of it and call the landmarks committee .
Sneaks : they come on holidays , can you imagine !
" But I was out there waiting for them , and I told them , ' You ca n't do it , that 's Code number 91.03002 , subsection E , ' and they lied and said they had special permission , so I said to the big muckymuck in charge , ' Let 's see your waiver permit , 'and he said the Code did n't apply in this case because it was supposed to be only for grading , and since they were demolishing and not grading , they could start whenever they felt like it .
So I told him I 'd call the police , then , because it came under the heading of Disturbing the Peace , and he said . . . well , I know you hate that kind of language , old girl , so I wo n't tell you what he said , but you can imagine .
" So I called the police , and gave them my name , and of course they did n't get there till almost quarter after seven ( which is what makes me think they bought off a councilman ) , and by then those ' dozers had leveled most of it .
Does n't take long , you know that .
" And I do n't suppose it 's as great a loss as , maybe , say , the Great Library of Alexandria , but it was the last of the authentic Deco design drive-ins , and the carhops still served you on roller skates , and it was a landmark , and just about the only place left in the city where you could still get a decent grilled cheese sandwich pressed very flat on the grill by one of those weights they used to use , made with real cheese and not that rancid plastic they cut into squares and call it ' cheese food . '
" Gone , old dear , gone and mourned .
And I understand they plan to put up another one of those mini-malls on the site , just ten blocks away from one that 's already there , and you know what 's going to happen : this new one will drain off the traffic from the older one , and then that one will fall the way they all do when the next one gets built , you 'd think they 'd see some history in it ; but no , they never learn , And you should have seen the crowd by seven - thirty .
All ages , even some of those kids painted like aborigines , with torn leather clothing .
Even they came to protest .
Terrible language , but at least they were concerned .
And nothing could stop it .
They just whammed it , and down it went .
" I do so miss you today , Minna .
No more good grilled cheese . "
Said the very old man to the ground .
And now he was crying softly , and now the wind rose , and the mist rain stippled his overcoat .
Nearby , yet at a distance , Billy Kinetta stared down at another grave .
He could see the old man over there off to his left , but he took no further notice .
The wind whipped the vent of his trenchcoat .
His collar was up but rain trickled down his neck .
This was a younger man , not yet thirty - five .
Unlike the old man , Billy Kinetta neither cried nor spoke to memories of someone who had once listened .
He might have been a geomancer , so silently did he stand , eyes toward the ground .
One of these men was black ; the other was white .
Beyond the high , spiked - iron fence surrounding the cemetery two boys crouched , staring through the bars , through the rain ; at the men absorbed by grave matters , by matters of graves .
These were not really boys .
They were legally young men .
One was nineteen , the other two months beyond twenty .
Both were legally old enough to vote , to drink alcoholic beverages , to drive a car .
Neither would reach the age of Billy Kinetta .
One of them said , " Let 's take the old man . "
The other responded , " You think the guy in the trenchcoat 'll get in the way ? "
The first one smiled ; and a mean little laugh .
" I sure as shit hope so . "
He wore , on his right hand , a leather carnaby glove with the fingers cut off , small round metal studs in a pattern along the line of his knuckles .
He made a fist , flexed , did it again .
They went under the spiked fence at a point where erosion had created a shallow gully .
" Sonofabitch ! " one of them said , as he slid through on his stomach .
It was muddy .
The front of his sateen roadie jacket was filthy .
" Sonofabitch ! "
He was speaking in general of the fence , the sliding under , the muddy ground , the universe in total .
And the old man , who would now really get the crap kicked out of him for making this fine sateen roadie jacket filthy .
They sneaked up on him from the left , as far from the young guy in the trenchcoat as they could .
The first one kicked out the shooting stick with a short , sharp , downward movement he had learned in his tae kwon do class .
It was called the yup - chagi .
The old man went over backward .
Then they were on him , the one with the filthy sonofabitch sateen roadie jacket punching at the old man 's neck and the side of his face as he dragged him around by the collar of the overcoat .
The other one began ransacking the coat pockets , ripping the fabric to get his hand inside .
The old man commenced to scream .
" Protect me !
You 've got to protect me . . .it 's necessary to protect me ! "
The one pillaging pockets froze momentarily .
What the hell kind of thing is that for this old fucker to be saying ?
Who the hell does he think 'll protect him ?
Is he asking us to protect him ?
I 'll protect you , scumbag !
I 'll kick in your fuckin ' lung !
" Shut 'im up ! " he whispered urgently to his friend .
" Stick a fist in his mouth ! "
Then his hand , wedged in an inside jacket pocket , closed over something .
He tried to get his hand loose , but the jacket and coat and the old man 's body had wound around his wrist .
" C'mon loose , motherfuckah ! " he said to the very old man , who was still screaming for protection .
The other young man was making huffing sounds , as dark as mud , as he slapped at the rain - soaked hair of his victim .
" I ca n't . . . he 's all twisted ' round . . . getcher hand outta there so's I can . . . "
Screaming , the old man had doubled under , locking their hands on his person .
And then the pillager 's fist came loose , and he was clutching for an instant a gorgeous pocket watch .
What used to be called a turnip watch .
The dial face was cloisonné , exquisite beyond the telling .
The case was of silver , so bright it seemed blue .
The hands , cast as arrows of time , were gold .
They formed a shallow V at precisely eleven o'clock .
This was happening at 3:45 in the afternoon , with rain and wind .
The timepiece made no sound , no sound at all .
Then : there was space all around the watch , and in that space in the palm of the hand , there was heat .
Intense heat for just a moment , just long enough for the hand to open .
The watch glided out of the boy 's palm and levitated .
" Help me !
You must protect me ! "
Billy Kinetta heard the shrieking , but did not see the pocket watch floating in the air above the astonished young man .
It was silver , and it was end - on toward him , and the rain was silver and slanting ; and he did not see the watch hanging free in the air , even when the furious young man disentangled himself and leaped for it .
Billy did not see the watch rise just so much , out of reach of the mugger .
Billy Kinetta saw two boys , two young men of ratpack age , beating someone much older ; and he went for them .
Pow , like that !
Thrashing his legs , the old man twisted around -- over , under -- as the boy holding him by the collar tried to land a punch to put him away .
Who would have thought the old man to have had so much battle in him ?
A flapping shape , screaming something unintelligible , hit the center of the group at full speed .
The carnaby - gloved hand reaching for the watch grasped at empty air one moment , and the next was buried under its owner as the boy was struck a crackback block that threw him face first into the soggy ground .
He tried to rise , but something stomped him at the base of his spine ; something kicked him twice in the kidneys ; something rolled over him like a flash flood .
Twisting , twisting , the very old man put his thumb in the right eye of the boy clutching his collar .
The great trenchcoated maelstrom that was Billy Kinetta whirled into the boy as he let loose of the old man on the ground and , howling , slapped a palm against his stinging eye .
Billy locked his fingers and delivered a roundhouse wallop that sent the boy reeling backward to fall over Minna 's tilted headstone .
Billy 's back was to the old man .
He did not see the miraculous pocket watch smoothly descend through rain that did not touch it , to hover in front of the old man .
He did not see the old man reach up , did not see the timepiece snuggle into an arthritic hand , did not see the old man return the turnip to an inside jacket pocket .
Wind , rain and Billy Kinetta pummeled two young men of a legal age that made them accountable for their actions .
There was no thought of the knife stuck down in one boot , no chance to reach it , no moment when the wild thing let them rise .
So they crawled .
They scrabbled across the muddy ground , the slippery grass , over graves and out of his reach .
They ran ; falling , rising , falling again ; away , without looking back .
Billy Kinetta , breathing heavily , knees trembling , turned to help the old man to his feet ; and found him standing , brushing dirt from his overcoat , snorting in anger and mumbling to himself .
" Are you all right ? "
For a moment the old man 's recitation of annoyance continued , then he snapped his chin down sharply as if marking end to the situation , and looked at his cavalry to the rescue .
" That was very good , young fella .
Considerable style you 've got there . "
Billy Kinetta stared at him wide - eyed .
" Are you sure you 're okay ? "
He reached over and flicked several blades of wet grass from the shoulder of the old man 's overcoat .
" I 'm fine .
I 'm fine but I 'm wet and I 'm cranky .
Let 's go somewhere and have a nice cup of Earl Grey . "
There had been a look on Billy Kinetta 's face as he stood with lowered eyes , staring at the grave he had come to visit .
The emergency had removed that look .
Now it returned .
" No , thanks .
If you 're okay , I 've got to do some things . "
The old man felt himself all over , meticulously , as he replied , " I 'm only superficially bruised .
Now if I were an old woman , instead of a spunky old man , same age though , I 'd have lost considerable of the calcium in my bones , and those two would have done me some mischief .
Did you know that women lose a considerable part of their calcium when they reach my age ?
I read a report . "
Then he paused , and said shyly , " Come on , why do n't you and I sit and chew the fat over a nice cup of tea ? "
Billy shook his head with bemusement , smiling despite himself .
" You 're something else , Dad .
I do n't even know you . "
" I like that . "
" What : that I do n't know you ? "
" No , that you called me ' Dad ' and not ' Pop . '
I hate ' Pop . '
Always makes me think the wise - apple wants to snap off my cap with a bottle opener .
Now Dad has a ring of respect to it .
I like that right down to the ground .
Yes , I believe we should find someplace warm and quiet to sit and get to know each other .
After all , you saved my life .
And you know what that means in the Orient . "
Billy was smiling continuously now .
" In the first place , I doubt very much I saved your life .
Your wallet , maybe .
And in the second place , I do n't even know your name ; what would we have to talk about ? "
" Gaspar , " he said , extending his hand .
" That 's a first name .
Gaspar .
Know what it means ? "
Billy shook his head .
" See , already we have something to talk about . "
So Billy , still smiling , began walking Gaspar out of the cemetery .
" Where do you live ?
I 'll take you home . "
They were on the street , approaching Billy Kinetta 's 1979 Cutlass .
" Where I live is too far for now .
I 'm beginning to feel a bit peaky .
I 'd like to lie down for a minute .
We can just go on over to your place , if that does n't bother you .
For a few minutes .
A cup of tea .
Is that all right ? "
He was standing beside the Cutlass , looking at Billy with an old man 's expectant smile , waiting for him to unlock the door and hold it for him till he 'd placed his still - calcium - rich but nonetheless old bones in the passenger seat .
Billy stared at him , trying to figure out what was at risk if he unlocked that door .
Then he snorted a tiny laugh , unlocked the door , held it for Gaspar as he seated himself , slammed it and went around to unlock the other side and get in .
Gaspar reached across and thumbed up the door lock knob .
And they drove off together in the rain .
Through all of this the timepiece made no sound , no sound at all .
Like Gaspar , Billy Kinetta was alone in the world .
His three - room apartment was the vacuum in which he existed .
It was furnished , but if one stepped out into the hallway and , for all the money in all the numbered accounts in all the banks in Switzerland , one was asked to describe those furnishings , one would come away no richer than before .
The apartment was charisma poor .
It was a place to come when all other possibilities had been expended .
Nothing green , nothing alive , existed in those boxes .
No eyes looked back from the walls .
Neither warmth nor chill marked those spaces .
It was a place to wait .
Gaspar leaned his closed shooting stick , now a walking stick with handles , against the bookcase .
He studied the titles of the paperbacks stacked haphazardly on the shelves .
From the kitchenette came the sound of water running into a metal pan .
Then tin on cast iron .
Then the hiss of gas and the flaring of a match as it was struck ; and the pop of the gas being lit .
" Many years ago , " Gaspar said , taking out a copy of Moravia 's The Adolescents and thumbing it as he spoke , " I had a library of books , oh , thousands of books -- never could bear to toss one out , not even the bad ones -- and when folks would come to the house to visit they 'd look around at all the nooks and crannies stuffed with books ; and if they were the sort of folks who do n't snuggle with books , they 'd always ask the same dumb question . "
He waited a moment for a response and when none was forthcoming ( the sound of china cups on sink tile ) , he said , " Guess what the question was . "
From the kitchen , without much interest : " No idea . "
" They 'd always ask it with the kind of voice people use in the presence of large sculptures in museums .
They 'd ask me , ' Have you read all these books ? ' "
He waited again , but Billy Kinetta was not playing the game .
" Well , young fella , after a while the same dumb question gets asked a million times , you get sorta snappish about it .
And it came to annoy me more than a little bit .
Till I finally figured out the right answer .
" And you know what that answer was ?
Go ahead , take a guess . "
Billy appeared in the kitchenette doorway .
" I suppose you told them you 'd read a lot of them but not all of them . "
Gaspar waved the guess away with a flapping hand .
" Now what good would that have done ?
They would n't know they 'd asked a dumb question , but I did n't want to insult them , either .
So when they 'd ask if I 'd read all those books , I 'd say , ' Hell , no .
Who wants a library full of books you 've already read ? ' "
Billy laughed despite himself .
He scratched at his hair with idle pleasure , and shook his head at the old man 's verve .
" Gaspar , you are a wild old man .
You retired ? "
The old man walked carefully to the most comfortable chair in the room , an overstuffed Thirties - style lounger that had been reupholstered many times before Billy Kinetta had purchased it at the American Cancer Society Thrift Shop .
He sank into it with a sigh .
" No sir , I am not by any means retired .
Still very active . "
" Doing what , if I 'm not prying ? "
" Doing ombudsman . "
" You mean , like a consumer advocate ?
Like Ralph Nader ? "
" Exactly .
I watch out for things .
I listen , I pay some attention ; and if I do it right , sometimes I can even make a little difference .
Yes , like Mr. Nader .
A very fine man . "
" And you were at the cemetery to see a relative ? "
Gaspar 's face settled into an expression of loss .
" My dear old girl .
My wife , Minna .
She 's been gone , well , it was twenty years in January . "
He sat silently staring inward for a while , then : " She was everything to me .
The nice part was that I knew how important we were to each other ; we discussed , well , just everything .
I miss that the most , telling her what 's going on .
" I go to see her every other day .
" I used to go every day .
But . It . Hurt .
Too much . "
They had tea .
Gaspar sipped and said it was very nice , but had Billy ever tried Earl Grey ?
Billy said he did n't know what that was , and Gaspar said he would bring him a tin , that it was splendid .
And they chatted .
Finally , Gaspar asked , " And who were you visiting ? "
Billy pressed his lips together .
" Just a friend . "
And would say no more .
Then he sighed and said , " Well , listen , I have to go to work .
" Oh ?
What do you do ? "
The answer came slowly .
As if Billy Kinetta wanted to be able to say that he was in computers , or owned his own business , or held a position of import .
" I 'm night manager at a 7 - Eleven . "
" I 'll bet you meet some fascinating people coming in late for milk or one of those slushies , " Gaspar said gently .
He seemed to understand .
Billy smiled .
He took the kindness as it was intended .
" Yeah , the cream of high society , That is , when they 're not threatening to shoot me through the head if I do n't open the safe . "
" Let me ask you a favor , " Gaspar said .
" I 'd like a little sanctuary , if you think it 's all right .
just a little rest .
I could lie down on the sofa for a bit .
Would that be all right ?
You trust me to stay here while you 're gone , young fella ? "
Billy hesitated only a moment .
The very old man seemed okay , not a crazy , certainly not a thief .
And what was there to steal ?
Some tea that was n't even Earl Grey ?
" Sure .
That 'll be okay .
But I wo n't be coming back till two A.M.
So just close the door behind you when you go ; it 'll lock automatically . "
They shook hands ,
Billy shrugged into his still - wet trenchcoat , and he went to the door .
He paused to look back at Gaspar sitting in the lengthening shadows as evening came on .
" It was nice getting to know you , Gaspar . "
" You can make that a mutual pleasure , Billy .
You 're a nice young fella . "
And Billy went to work , alone as always .
When he came home at two , prepared to open a can of Hormel chili , he found the table set for dinner , with the scent of an elegant beef stew enriching the apartment .
There were new potatoes and stirfried carrots and zucchini that had been lightly battered to delicate crispness .
And cupcakes .
White cake with chocolate frosting .
From a bakery .
And in that way , as gently as that , Gaspar insinuated himself into Billy Kinetta 's apartment and his life .
As they sat with tea and cupcakes , Billy said , " You do n't have anyplace to go , do you ? "
The old man smiled and made one of those deprecating movements of the head .
" Well , I 'm not the sort of fella who can bear to be homeless , but at the moment I 'm what vaudevillians used to call ' at liberty . ' "
" If you want to stay on a time , that would be okay , " Billy said .
" It 's not very roomy here , but we seem to get on all right . "
" That 's strongly kind of you , Billy .
Yes , I 'd like to be your roommate for a while .
Wo n't be too long , though .
My doctor tells me I 'm not long for this world . "
He paused , looked into the teacup , and said softly , " I have to confess . . .
I 'm a little frightened .
To go .
Having someone to talk to would be a great comfort . "
And Billy said , without preparation , " I was visiting the grave of a man who was in my rifle company in Vietnam .
I go there sometimes . "
But there was such pain in his words that Gaspar did not press him for details .
So the hours passed , as they will with or without permission , and when Gaspar asked Billy if they could watch television , to catch an early newscast , and Billy tuned in the old set just in time to pick up dire reports of another aborted disarmament talk , and Billy shook his head and observed that it was n't only Gaspar who was frightened of something like death , Gaspar chuckled , patted Billy on the knee and said , with unassailable assurance , " Take my word for it , Billy . . . it is n't going to happen .
No nuclear holocaust .
Trust me , when I tell you this : it 'll never happen .
Never , never , not ever . "
Billy smiled wanly .
" And why not ?
What makes you so sure . . . got some special inside information ? "
And Gaspar pulled out the magnificent timepiece , which Billy was seeing for the first time , and he said , " It 's not going to happen because it 's only eleven o'clock . "
Billy stared at the watch , which read 11:00 precisely .
He consulted his wristwatch .
" Hate to tell you this , but your watch has stopped .
It 's almost five - thirty . "
Gaspar smiled his own certain smile .
" No , it 's eleven . "
And they made up the sofa for the very old man , who placed his pocket change and his fountain pen and the sumptuous turnip watch on the now - silent television set , and they went to sleep .
One day Billy went off while Gaspar was washing the lunch dishes , and when he came back , he had a large paper bag from Toys " R " Us .
Gaspar came out of the kitchenette rubbing a plate with a souvenir dish towel from Niagara Falls , New York .
He stared at Billy and the bag .
" What 's in the bag ? "
Billy inclined his head , and indicated the very old man should join him in the middle of the room .
Then he sat down crosslegged on the floor , and dumped the contents of the bag .
Gaspar stared with startlement , and sat down beside him .
So for two hours they played with tiny cars that turned into robots when the sections were unfolded .
Gaspar was excellent at figuring out all the permutations of the Transformers , Starriors and CoBots .
He played well .
And they went for a walk .
" I 'll treat you to a matinee , " Gaspar said .
" But no films with Karen Black , Sandy Dennis or Meryl Streep .
They 're always crying .
Their noses are always red .
I ca n't stand that . "
They started to cross the avenue .
Stopped at the light was this year 's Cadillac Brougham , vanity license plates , ten coats of acrylic lacquer and two coats of clear ( with a little retarder in the final " color coat " for a slow dry ) of a magenta hue so rich that it approximated the shade of light shining through a decanter filled with Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1945 .
The man driving the Cadillac had no neck .
His head sat thumped down hard on the shoulders .
He stared straight ahead , took one last deep pull on the cigar , and threw it out the window .
The still - smoking butt landed directly in front of Gaspar as he passed the car .
The old man stopped , stared down at this coprolitic metaphor , and then stared at the driver .
The eyes behind the wheel , the eyes of a macaquc , did not waver from the stoplight 's red circle .
just outside the window , someone was looking in , but the eyes of the rhesus were on the red circle .
A line of cars stopped behind the Brougham .
Gaspar continued to stare at the man in the Cadillac for a moment , and then , with creaking difficulty , he bent and picked up the smoldering butt of stogie .
The old man walked the two steps to the car -- as Billy watched in confusion -- thrust his face forward till it was mere inches from the driver 's profile , and said with extreme sweetness , " I think you dropped this in our living room . "
And as the glazed simian eyes turned to stare directly into the pedestrian 's face , nearly nose to nose , Gaspar casually flipped the butt with its red glowing tip , into the back seat of the Cadillac , where it began to burn a hole in the fine Corinthian leather .
Three things happened simultaneously :
The driver let out a howl , tried to see the butt in his rearview mirror , could not get the angle , tried to look over his shoulder into the back seat but without a neck could not perform that feat of agility , put the car into neutral , opened his door and stormed into the street trying to grab Gaspar .
" You fuckin ' bastid , whaddaya think you 're doin ' tuh my car you asshole bastid , I 'll kill ya . . . "
Billy 's hair stood on end as he saw what Gaspar was doing ; he rushed back the short distance in the crosswalk to grab the old man ; Gaspar would not be dragged away , stood smiling with unconcealed pleasure at the mad bull rampaging and screaming of the hysterical driver .
Billy yanked as hard as he could and Gaspar began to move away , around the front of the Cadillac , toward the far curb .
Still grinning with octogeneric charm .
The light changed .
These three things happened in the space of five seconds , abetted by the impatient honking of the cars behind the Brougham ; as the light turned green .
Screaming , dragging , honking , as the driver found he could not do three things at once : he could not go after Gaspar while the traffic was clanging at him ; could not let go of the car door to crawl into the back seat from which now came the stench of charring leather that could not be rectified by an inexpensive Tijuana tuck - 'n - roll ; could not save his back seat and at the same time stave off the hostility of a dozen drivers cursing and honking .
He trembled there , torn three ways , doing nothing .
Billy dragged Gaspar .
Out of the crosswalk .
Out of the street .
Onto the curb .
Up the side street .
Into the alley .
Through a backyard .
To the next street from the avenue .
Puffing with the exertion , Billy stopped at last , five houses up the street .
Gaspar was still grinning , chuckling softly with unconcealed pleasure at his puckish ways .
Billy turned on him with wild gesticulations and babble .
" You 're nuts ! "
" How about that ? " the old man said , giving Billy an affectionate poke in the bicep .
" Nuts !
Looney !
That guy would 've torn off your head !
What the hell 's wrong with you , old man ?
Are you out of your boots ? "
" I 'm not crazy .
I 'm responsible . "
" Responsible !?!
Responsible , fer chrissakes ?
For what ?
For all the butts every yotz throws into the street ? "
The old man nodded .
" For butts , and trash , and pollution , and toxic waste dumping in the dead of night ; for bushes , and cactus , and the baobab tree ; for pippin apples and even lima beans , which I despise .
You show me someone who 'll eat lima beans without being at gunpoint , I 'll show you a pervert ! "
Billy was screaming .
" What the hell are you talking about ? "
" I'm also responsible for dogs and cats and guppies and cockroaches and the President of the United States and Jonas Salk and your mother and the entire chorus line at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas .
Also their choreographer . "
" Who do you think you are ?
God ? "
" Do n't be sacrilegious .
I 'm too old to wash your mouth out with laundry soap .
Of course I 'm not God .
I 'm just an old man .
But I 'm responsible . "
Gaspar started to walk away , toward the corner and the avenue and a resumption of their route .
Billy stood where the old man 's words had pinned him .
" Come on , young fella , " Gaspar said , walking backward to speak to him , " we 'll miss the beginning of the movie .
I hate that . "
Billy had finished eating , and they were sitting in the dimness of the apartment , only the lamp in the corner lit .
The old man had gone to the County Art Museum and had bought inexpensive prints -- Max Ernst , Gerome , Richard Dadd , a subtle Feininger -- which he had mounted in Insta -Frames ,
They sat in silence for a time , relaxing ; then murmuring trivialities in a pleasant undertone .
Finally , Gaspar said , " I 've been thinking a lot about my dying .
I like what Woody Allen said . "
Billy slid to a more comfortable position in the lounger .
" What was that ? "
" He said : I do n't mind dying , I just do n't want to be there when it happens . "
Billy snickered .
" I feel something like that , Billy .
I 'm not afraid to go , but I do n't want to leave Minna entirely .
The times I spend with her , talking to her , well , it gives me the feeling we 're still in touch .
When I go , that 's the end of Minna .
She 'll be well and truly dead .
We never had any children , almost everyone who knew us is gone , no relatives .
And we never did anything important that anyone would put in a record book , so that 's the end of us .
For me , I do n't mind ; but I wish there was someone who knew about Minna . . . she was a remarkable person . "
So Billy said , " Tell me .
I 'll remember for you . "
Memories in no particular order .
Some as strong as ropes that could pull the ocean ashore .
Some that shimmered and swayed in the faintest breeze like spiderwebs .
The entire person , all the little movements , that dimple that appeared when she was amused at something foolish he had said .
Their youth together , their love , the procession of their days toward middle age .
The small cheers and the pain of dreams never realized .
So much about him , as he spoke of her .
His voice soft and warm and filled with a longing so deep and true that he had to stop frequently because the words broke and would not come out till he had thought away some of the passion .
He thought of her and was glad .
He had gathered her together , all her dowry of love and taking care of him , her clothes and the way she wore them , her favorite knickknacks , a few clever remarks : and he packed it all up and delivered it to a new repository .
The very old man gave Minna to Billy Kinetta for safekeeping .
Dawn had come .
The light filtering in through the blinds was saffron .
" Thank you , Dad , " Billy said .
He could not name the feeling that had taken him hours earlier .
But he said this : " I 've never had to be responsible for anything , or anyone , in my whole life .
I never belonged to anybody . . .
I do n't know why .
It did n't bother me , because I did n't know any other way to be . "
Then his position changed , there in the lounger .
He sat up in a way that Gaspar thought was important .
As if Billy were about to open the secret box buried at his center .
And Billy spoke so softly the old man had to strain to hear him .
" I did n't even know him .
" We were defending the airfield at Danang .
Did I tell you we were 1st Battalion , 9th Marines ?
Charlie was massing for a big push out of Quang Ngai province , south of us .
Looked as if they were going to try to take the provincial capital .
My rifle company was assigned to protect the perimeter .
They kept sending in patrols to bite us .
Every day we'd lose some poor bastard who scratched his head when he should n't of .
It was June , late in June , cold and a lot of rain .
The foxholes were hip - deep in water .
" Flares first .
Our howitzers started firing .
Then the sky was full of tracers , and I started to turn toward the bushes when I heard something coming , and these two main - force regulars in dark blue uniforms came toward me .
I could see them so clearly .
Long black hair .
All crouched over .
And they started firing .
And that goddam carbine seized up , would n't fire ; and I pulled out the banana clip , tried to slap in another , but they saw me and just turned a couple of AK - 47's on me . . .
God , I remember everything slowed down . . .
I looked at those things , seven - point - six - two - millimeter assault rifles they were . . .
I got crazy for a second , tried to figure out in my own mind if they were Russian - made , or Chinese , or Czech , or North Korean .
And it was so bright from the flares I could see them starting to squeeze off the rounds , and then from out of nowhere this lance corporal jumped out at them and yelled somedamnthing like , ' Hey , you VC fucks , looka here ! ' except it was n't that . . .
I never could recall what he said actually . . . and they turned to brace him . . . and they opened him up like a baggie full of blood . . . and he was all over me , and the bushes , and oh god there was pieces of him floating on the water I was standing in . . . "
Billy was heaving breath with impossible weight .
His hands moved in the air before his face without pattern or goal .
He kept looking into far corners of the dawn - lit room as if special facts might present themselves to fill out the reasons behind what he was saying .
" Aw , geezus , he was floating on the water .
. . aw , Christ , he got in my boots ! "
Then a wail of pain so loud it blotted out the sound of traffic beyond the apartment ; and he began to moan , but not cry ; and the moaning kept on ; and Gaspar came from the sofa and held him and said such words as it's all right , but they might not have been those words , or any words .
And pressed against the old man 's shoulder , Billy Kinetta ran on only half sane : " He was n't my friend , I never knew him , I 'd never talked to him , but I 'd seen him , he was just this guy , and there was n't any reason to do that , he did n't know whether I was a good guy or a shit or anything , so why did he do that ?
He did n't need to do that .
They would n't of seen him .
He was dead before I killed them .
He was gone already .
I never got to say thank you or thank you or . . . anything !
" Now he 's in that grave , so I came here to live , so I can go there , but I try and try to say thank you , and he 's dead , and he can't hear me , he can't hear anything , he 's just down there , down in the ground , and I can't say thank you . . . oh , geezus , geezus , why do n't he hear me , I just want to say thanks . . . "
Billy Kinetta wanted to assume the responsibility for saying thanks , but that was possible only on a night that would never come again ; and this was the day .
Gaspar took him to the bedroom and put him down to sleep in exactly the same way one would soothe an old , sick dog .
Then he went to his sofa , and because it was the only thing he could imagine saying , he murmured , " He 'll be all right , Minna .
Really he will . "
When Billy left for the 7 - Eleven the next evening , Gaspar was gone .
It was an alternate day , and that meant he was out at the cemetery .
Billy fretted that he should n't be there alone , but the old man had a way of taking care of himself .
Billy was not smiling as he thought of his friend , and the word friend echoed as he realized that , yes , this was his friend , truly and really his friend .
He wondered how old Gaspar was , and how soon Billy Kinetta would be once again what he had always been : alone .
When he returned to the apartment at two - thirty , Gaspar was asleep , cocooned in his blanket on the sofa .
Billy went in and tried to sleep , but hours later , when sleep would not come , when thoughts of murky water and calcium night light on dark foliage kept him staring at the bedroom ceiling , he came out of the room for a drink of water .
He wandered around the living room , not wanting to be by himself even if the only companionship in this sleepless night was breathing heavily , himself in sleep .
He stared out the window .
Clouds lay in chiffon strips across the sky .
The squealing of tires from the street .
Sighing , idle in his movement around the room , he saw the old man 's pocket watch lying on the coffee table beside the sofa .
He walked to the table .
If the watch was still stopped at eleven o'clock , perhaps he would borrow it and have it repaired .
It would be a nice thing to do for Gaspar .
He loved that beautiful timepiece .
Billy bent to pick it up .
The watch , stopped at the V of eleven precisely , levitated at an angle , floating away from him .
Billy Kinetta felt a shiver travel down his back to burrow in at the base of his spine .
He reached for the watch hanging in air before him .
It floated away just enough that his fingers massaged empty space .
He tried to catch it .
The watch eluded him , lazily turning away like an opponent who knows he is in no danger of being struck from behind .
Then Billy realized Gaspar was awake .
Turned away from the sofa , nonetheless he knew the old man was observing him .
And the blissful floating watch .
He looked at Gaspar .
They did not speak for a long time .
Then : " I 'm going back to sleep , " Billy said .
Quietly .
" I think you have some questions , " Gaspar replied .
" Questions ?
No , of course not , Dad .
Why in the world would I have questions ?
I 'm still asleep . "
But that was not the truth , because he had not been asleep that night .
" Do you know what ' Gaspar ' means ?
Do you remember the three wise men of the Bible , the Magi ? "
" I do n't want any frankincense and myrrh .
I 'm going back to bed .
I 'm going now .
You see , I 'm going right now . "
" ' Gaspar ' means master of the treasure , keeper of the secrets , paladin of the palace . "
Billy was staring at him , not walking into the bedroom ; just staring at him .
As the elegant timepiece floated to the old man , who extended his hand palm - up to receive it .
The watch nestled in his hand , unmoving , and it made no sound , no sound at all .
" You go back to bed .
But will you go out to the cemetery with me tomorrow ?
It 's important . "
" Why ? "
" Because I believe I 'll be dying tomorrow . "
It was a nice day , cool and clear .
Not at all a day for dying , but neither had been many such days in Southeast Asia , and death had not been deterred .
They stood at Minna 's gravesite , and Gaspar opened his shooting stick to form a seat , and he thrust the spike into the ground , and he settled onto it , and sighed , and said to Billy Kinetta , " I 'm growing cold as that stone . "
" Do you want my jacket ? "
" No . I 'm cold inside . "
He looked around at the sky , at the grass , at the rows of markers .
" I 've been responsible , for all of this , and more . "
" You 've said that before . "
" Young fella , are you by any chance familiar , in your reading , with an old novel by James Hilton called Lost Horizon ?
Perhaps you saw the movie .
It was a wonderful movie , actually much better than the book .
Mr. Capra 's greatest achievement .
A human testament .
Ronald Colman was superb .
Do you know the story ? "
" Yes . "
" Do you remember the High Lama , played by Sam Jaffe ?
His name was Father Perrault ? "
" Yes . "
" Do you remember how he passed on the caretakership of that magical hidden world , Shangri - La , to Ronald Colman ? "
" Yes , I remember that .
" Billy paused .
" Then he died .
He was very old , and he died . "
Gaspar smiled up at Billy .
" Very good , Billy .
I knew you were a good boy .
So now , if you remember all that , may I tell you a story ?
It 's not a very long story . "
Billy nodded , smiling at his friend .
" In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII decreed that the civilized world would no longer observe the Julian calendar .
October 4th , 1582 was followed , the next day , by October 15th .
Eleven days vanished from the world .
One hundred and seventy days later , the British Parliament followed suit , and September 2nd , 1752 was followed , the next day , by September 14th .
Why did he do that , the Pope ? "
Billy was bewildered by the conversation .
" Because he was bringing it into synch with the real world .
The solstices and equinoxes .
When to plant , when to harvest . "
Gaspar waggled a finger at him with pleasure .
" Excellent , young fella .
And you 're correct when you say Gregory abolished the Julian calendar because its error of one day in every one hundred and twenty - eight years had moved the vernal equinox to March 11th .
That 's what the history books say .
It 's what every history book says .
But what if ? "
" What if what ?
I do n't know what you 're talking about . "
" What if : Pope Gregory had the knowledge revealed to him that he must readjust time in the minds of men ?
What if : the excess time in 1582 .
was eleven days and one hour ?
What if : he accounted for those eleven days , vanished those eleven days , but that one hour slipped free , was left loose to bounce through eternity ?
A very special hour . . .an hour that must never be used . . . an hour that must never toll .
What if ? "
Billy spread his hands .
" What if , what if , what if !
It 's all just philosophy .
It does n't mean anything .
Hours are n't real , time is n't something that you can bottle up .
So what if there is an hour out there somewhere that . . . "
And he stopped .
He grew tense , and leaned down to the old man .
" The watch .
Your watch .
It does n't work .
It 's stopped . "
Gaspar nodded .
" At eleven o'clock .
My watch works ; it keeps very special time , for one very special hour . "
Billy touched Gaspar 's shoulder .
Carefully he asked , " Who are you , Dad ? "
The old man did not smile as he said , " Gaspar .
Keeper . Paladin. Guardian . "
" Father Perrault was hundreds of years old . "
Gaspar shook his head with a wistful expression on his old face .
" I 'm eighty - six years old , Billy .
You asked me if I thought I was God.
Not God , not Father Perrault , not an immortal , just an old man who will die too soon .
Are you Ronald Colman ? "
Billy nervously touched his lower lip with a finger .
He looked at Gaspar as long as he could , then turned away .
He walked off a few paces , stared at the barren trees .
It seemed suddenly much chillier here in this place of entombed remembrances .
From a distance he said , " But it 's only ... what ?
A chronological convenience .
Like daylight saving time ; Spring forward , Fall back .
We do n't actually lose an hour ; we get it back . "
Gaspar stared at Minna 's grave .
" At the end of April I lost an hour .
If I die now , I 'll die an hour short in my life .
I 'll have been cheated out of one hour I want , Billy . "
He swayed toward all he had left of Minna .
" One last hour I could have with my old girl .
That 's what I 'm afraid of , Billy .
I have that hour in my possession .
I 'm afraid I 'll use it , god help me , I want so much to use it . "
Billy came to him .
Tense , and chilled , he said " Why must that hour never toll ? "
Gaspar drew a deep breath and tore his eyes away from the grave .
His gaze locked with Billy's .
And he told him .
The years , all the days and hours , exist .
As solid and as real as mountains and oceans and men and women and the baobab tree .
Look , he said , at the lines in my face and deny that time is real .
Consider these dead weeds that were once alive and try to believe it's all just vapor or the mutual agreement of Popes and Caesars and young men like you .
" The lost hour must never come , Billy , for in that hour it all ends .
The light , the wind , the stars , this magnificent open place we call the universe .
It all ends , and in its place -- waiting , always waiting -- is eternal darkness .
No new beginnings , no world without end , just the infinite emptiness . "
And he opened his hand , which had been lying in his lap , and there , in his palm , rested the watch , making no sound at all , and stopped dead at eleven o'clock .
" Should it strike twelve , Billy , eternal night falls ; from which there is no recall . "
There he sat , this very old man , just a perfectly normal old man .
The most recent in the endless chain of keepers of the lost hour , descended in possession from Caesar and Pope Gregory XIII , down through the centuries of men and women who had served as caretakers of the excellent timepiece .
And now he was dying , and now he wanted to cling to life as every man and woman clings to life no matter how awful or painful or empty , even if it is for one more hour .
The suicide , falling from the bridge , at the final instant , tries to fly , tries to climb back up the sky .
This weary old man , who only wanted to stay one brief hour more with Minna .
Who was afraid that his love would cost the universe .
He looked at Billy , and he extended his hand with the watch waiting for its next paladin .
So softly Billy could barely hear him , knowing that he was denying himself what he most wanted at this last place in his life , he whispered , " If I die without passing it on . . . it will begin to tick . "
" Not me , " Billy said .
" Why did you pick me ?
I 'm no one special .
I 'm not someone like you .
I run an all - night service mart .
There 's nothing special about me the way there is about you !
I 'm not Ronald Colman !
I do n't want to be responsible , I 've never been responsible ! "
Gaspar smiled gently .
" You 've been responsible for me . "
Billy 's rage vanished .
He looked wounded .
" Look at us , Billy .
Look at what color you are ; and look at what color I am .
You took me in as a friend .
I think of you as worthy , Billy .
Worthy . "
They remained there that way , in silence , as the wind rose .
And finally , in a timeless time , Billy nodded .
Then the young man said , " You wo n't be losing Minna , Dad .
Now you 'll go to the place where she 's been waiting for you , just as she was when you first met her .
There 's a place where we find everything we 've ever lost through the years . "
" That 's good , Billy , that you tell me that .
I 'd like to believe it , too .
But I 'm a pragmatist .
I believe what exists . . . like rain and Minna 's grave and the hours that pass that we can't see , but they are .
I 'm afraid , Billy .
I 'm afraid this will be the last time I can speak to her .
So I ask a favor .
As payment , in return for my life spent protecting the watch .
" I ask for one minute of the hour , Billy .
One minute to call her back , so we can stand face - to - face and I can touch her and say goodbye .
You 'll be the new protector of this watch , Billy , so I ask you please , just let me steal one minute . "
Billy could not speak .
The look on Gaspar 's face was without horizon , empty as tundra , bottomless .
The child left alone in darkness ; the pain of eternal waiting .
He knew he could never deny this old man , no matter what he asked , and in the silence he heard a voice say : " No ! " And it was his own .
He had spoken without conscious volition .
Strong and determined , and without the slightest room for reversal .
If a part of his heart had been swayed by compassion , that part had been instantly overridden .
No .
A final , unshakable no .
For an instant Gaspar looked crestfallen .
His eyes clouded with tears ; and Billy felt something twist and break within himself at the sight .
He knew he had hurt the old man .
Quickly , but softly , he said urgently , " You know that would be wrong , Dad .
We must n't . . . "
Gaspar said nothing .
Then he reached out with his free hand and took Billy's .
It was an affectionate touch .
" That was the last test , young fella .
Oh , you know I 've been testing you , do n't you ?
This important item could n't go to just anyone .
" And you passed the test , my friend : my last , best friend .
When I said I could bring her back from where she 's gone , here in this place we 've both come to so often , to talk to someone lost to us , I knew you would understand that anyone could be brought back in that stolen minute .
I knew you would n't use it for yourself , no matter how much you wanted it ; but I was n't sure that as much as you like me , it might not sway you .
But you would n't even give it to me , Billy . "
He smiled up at him , his eyes now clear and steady .
" I 'm content , Billy .
You need n't have worried .
Minna and I do n't need that minute .
But if you 're to carry on for me , I think you do need it .
You 're in pain , and that 's no good for someone who carries this watch .
You 've got to heal , Billy .
" So I give you something you would never take for yourself .
I give you a going - away present . . . "
And he started the watch , whose ticking was as loud and as clear as a baby 's first sound ; and the sweep - second hand began to move away from eleven o'clock .
Then the wind rose , and the sky seemed to cloud over , and it grew colder , with a remarkable silver - blue mist that rolled across the cemetery ; and though he did not see it emerge from that grave at a distance far to the right , Billy Kinetta saw a shape move toward him .
A soldier in the uniform of a day past , and his rank was Lance Corporal .
He came toward Billy Kinetta , and Billy went to meet him as Gaspar watched .
They stood together and Billy spoke to him .
And the man whose name Billy had never known when he was alive , answered .
And then he faded , as the seconds ticked away .
Faded , and faded , and was gone .
And the silver - blue mist rolled through them , and past them , and was gone ; and the soldier was gone .
Billy stood alone .
When he turned back to look across the grounds to his friend , he saw that Gaspar had fallen from the shooting stick .
He lay on the ground .
Billy rushed to him , and fell to his knees and lifted him onto his lap .
Gaspar was still .
" Oh , god , Dad , you should have heard what he said .
Oh , geez , he let me go .
He let me go so I did n't even have to say I was sorry .
He told me he did n't even see me in that foxhole .
He never knew he 'd saved my life .
I said thank you and he said no , thank you , that he had n't died for nothing .
Oh , please , Dad , please do n't be dead yet .
I want to tell you . . . "
And , as it sometimes happens , rarely but wonderfully , sometimes they come back for a moment , for an instant before they go , the old man , the very old man , opened his eyes , just before going on his way , and he looked through the dimming light at his friend , and he said , " May I remember you to my old girl , Billy ? "
And his eyes closed again , after only a moment ; and his caretakership was at an end ; as his hand opened and the most excellent timepiece , now stopped again at one minute past eleven , floated from his palm and waited till Billy Kinetta extended his hand ; and then it floated down and lay there silently , making no sound , no sound at all .
Safe .
Protected .
There in the place where all lost things returned , the young man sat on the cold ground , rocking the body of his friend .
And he was in no hurry to leave .
There was time .
Like a wind crying endlessly through the universe , Time carries away the names and the deeds of conquerors and commoners alike .
And all that we were , all that remains , is in the memories of those who cared we came this way for a brief moment .
A blessing of the 18th Egyptian Dynasty :
God be between you and harm in
all the empty places you walk .

The other day we showed some raw footage from cameras mounted on the front and inside of the Hyundai Genesis Coupe driven by Rhys Millen during his 2WD record setting 2009 Pikes Peak Hill Climb run .
That video was amazing but really had us yearning for some overhead shots , mountainside views and more engaging camera angles .

The openSUSE Linux distribution will offer KDE as its default desktop environment in future versions .
This move echoes the SUSE community 's historical affinity for KDE and indicates that this preference still persists among contemporary users of openSUSE .
SUSE , one of the oldest commercial Linux distributions , was originally established in 1992 as a derivative of Slackware .
It evolved considerably over the years and dropped its Slackware heritage , shifting towards the RPM package manager and other aspects of the Red Hat ecosystem .
It also gained many unique features such as the YaST configuration system .
The company behind SUSE was one of the most well - known European Linux vendors and became a very active contributor to the KDE project .
Novell acquired SUSE in 2003 shortly after acquiring Ximian , one of the most prominent GNOME distributors .
Novell brought the two distros together and continued to actively contribute to the advancement of both KDE and GNOME .
Novell 's commercial SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop ( SLED ) ships with a GNOME environment , however , and much of Novell 's investment in desktop application development has been heavily focused on GNOME .
Novell 's community - driven openSUSE distro , which is used as a proving ground to stabilize the technology that is used in SLED , has largely aimed to be desktop - agnostic .
The installation DVD image includes the full set of packages for both desktop environments and requires users to manually select one during the installation process .
Installable Live CD images are also available for each desktop .
It 's all in the numbers
Despite this effort to create the perception of desktop equality in openSUSE , the community has always been more culturally and technologically aligned with KDE .
The latest openSUSE desktop survey shows that roughly 68 percent of openSUSE users favor KDE and only 27 percent use GNOME .
In light of the clear preference towards KDE , the only thing that is really surprising about the decision to make it the official default is that it did n't happen sooner .
Although debates about the distro's relative level of endorsement for KDE and GNOME have been present consistently ever since openSUSE was founded , the issue was elevated to a high - priority topic of discussion recently when a user posted a feature request at the openFATE brainstorming site encouraging the developers to adopt KDE as the official default .
The suggestion attracted a considerable amount of attention and received a lot of positive feedback from members of the openSUSE community .
According to the openFATE voting system , 449 users side with the proposal and only 121 oppose it .
Prominent KDE developers also weighed in on the issue and voiced their support , including Sebastian K�gler who posted a blog entry with some insightful arguments in favor of making KDE the default .
" The numbers are clear , KDE is the preferred desktop of the openSUSE community .
There is a formal request to reflect that in the installation process .
Novell , and those with decision - making powers in the openSUSE team now have the opportunity to prove that features .
opensuse.org is not just a lip - service , that the community does control the direction of openSUSE , " he wrote .
" Not having a preset for the desktop that is installed is hampering adoption of openSUSE . "
Over the past year , Novell has taken some important steps to give the openSUSE community greater autonomy and more control over technical decisions relating to the distribution .
For example , the project 's governance model got a boost last year when the first elected board took office .
The movement to make KDE the default desktop has been closely watched because it provided an opportunity to test Novell 's willingness to respect the community 's independence .
On Thursday , Novell 's Michael Loeffler announced on the openSUSE mailing list that the proposal to make KDE the default desktop in openSUSE will be implemented .
The decision was made by Loeffler in collaboration with the openSUSE leadership and was based on the feedback provided by the openSUSE community .
He emphasized the fact that the distro's commitment to GNOME would not be negatively impacted by the change .
" After consideration of the project discussion I discussed the feature request further with the openSUSE Board and other leaders within the openSUSE project and came to the decision to follow the request : we will default the radio button to KDE in the DVD installer , " he wrote .
" We want to make clear that both desktops are considered equal citizens within the openSUSE Project , and this will not have any impact on the quality of the GNOME desktop within openSUSE . "
Users will still be able to select other desktops instead during the installation process , but the KDE option will be preselected so that it will be installed by default for users who do not choose a different option .
Although much of the debate around the decision has focused on desktop commitment and making the installer accurately reflect the preferences of the user population , one particularly noteworthy advantage of the change is that users will no longer be forced to manually select a desktop environment during the installation process — a query that could be intimidating to new users .
The decision to make KDE the default desktop in openSUSE arrives at a significant moment in the evolution of KDE itself .
The desktop environment suffered some setbacks during the difficult transition to version 4 , but it is beginning to solidify and now delivers considerable value over the previous series .
The endorsement of a high - profile distro validates the underlying vision behind KDE 4 and serves as a reminder that KDE still has a very strong presence on the desktop .
Yesterday 's arguably biggest story was that the EU would be pursuing its antitrust browser case against Microsoft despite the software giant 's decision on Thursday to unbundle Internet Explorer 8 from Windows 7 in Europe .
In our coverage , we noted that this all started in December 2007 when Norwegian browser maker Opera pushed the EU to open an antitrust case in the first place .
One community saw our note and overstressed it just a tad .
JCXP posted a lengthy story titled " That 's enough .
Down with Opera ! " that asks its readers , and anyone else who does not agree with the EU 's decision , to boycott all Opera software :
That 's enough .
And it 's time we do something about it .
Today , we are proposing a complete boycott of all Opera software .
The trouble with this bold statement is the logic behind it is a little flawed .
Yes , Opera " started it . "
However , regardless of your opinion on the whole antitrust case , the fact is that the EU found it reasonable enough to investigate .
Furthermore , it 's equally important to note that both Mozilla and Google voiced their support of Opera 's effort to have the EU investigate Microsoft for bundling Internet Explorer in Windows .
I mean , if you 're going to be boycotting Opera because it pushed the EU to start the investigation , you 're going to have to boycott Firefox and Chrome because their parent companies support it .
That leaves you with the only other major browser on Windows : Internet Explorer .
It may be the most popular browser in terms of market share , but in the tech world it 's easily the most unpopular one .
I 'm truly indifferent to what browser you choose to use or what browser you want to boycott , but I figured people might want all the facts out on the table before they start jumping to conclusions .
Happy browsing !
How to Ease Shoulder Pain
Pain … ouch !
Every decade seems to assure most of us that there ’ll be more pain in some part of the body that we never felt before .
One of the typical places is the shoulder where many muscles , tendons , and ligaments stabilize the joint .
Years of activity as simple as reaching up for something or playing a musical instrument can lead to wear and tear on the joint and make the shoulder prone to injury .
Falls or other accidents can also lead to injury .
You can keep your joints supple and strong by doing some exercises like the illustrations .
However , if
you are already feeling pain , you want to nurse that area and make sure you do not cause further injury and pain .
Once the inflammation is down by using ice packs and perhaps over - the - counter medication , you can start exercising .
One exercise shown to the right is a deltoids stretch .
You bring your arm across your body and press gently with the opposite arm either above or below the elbow .
Hold for 30 seconds .
For more information , check http:exrx.net .
http://familydoctor.org also offers some exercises below you can do .
Having been through physical therapy myself , I know these were exercises that were recommended to me .
Exercise 1 : Range of motion .
Stand up and lean over so you ’re facing the floor .
Let your sore arm dangle straight down .
Draw circles in the air with your sore arm .
Start with small circles , and then draw bigger ones .
Repeat these exercises 5 to 10 times during the day .
If you have pain , stop .
You can try again later .
Exercise 2 : Rotator cuff strengthening .
Use a piece of rubber tubing for these exercises .
Stand next to a closed door with a doorknob .
Loop the tubing around the knob .
With your hand that is closest to the door , bend your arm at a 90° angle and grab the loop of the tubing .
Pull the band across your tummy .
At first , do 1 set of 10 exercises .
Try to increase the number of sets as your shoulder pain lessens .
These exercises should be done every day .
Exercise 3 : Upper extremity strengthening .
As your pain goes away , try adding a general upper body weight - lifting program using weight machines or free weights .
Lie on your right side with your left arm at your side .
With a weight in your left hand and your forearm across your tummy , raise your forearm .
Keep your elbow near your side .
Topical pain relievers like creams and patches might also give some relief .
They are widely used in other countries , but are less popular here .
Topical analgesics might cause skin reactions , but pills affect the gut and blood .
The one I use before I sleep is called Sunjing .
For more information , click here .
Hopefully , this discussion of exercises and pain relievers will give you some relief if you are suffering from shoulder pain .

Nationwide will only offer 85 % loans to new customers
The Nationwide Building Society has introduced a mortgage allowing borrowers to take loans worth 125 % of the value of the home they are buying .
It will only be available to existing customers in negative equity who want to move house .
Negative equity means that the value of someone 's home is less than the amount they owe on their mortgage .
Nationwide said the deal was a very " niche offer " and that not everyone in negative equity would qualify .
The Financial Services Authority is considering limiting mortgage loans to 100 % of a property 's value .
' No more risk '
The Nationwide only offers new customers mortgages worth 85 % of the value of the home they want to buy .
NEGATIVE EQUITY : QUICK GUIDE
Negative equity is when the value of someone 's home is less than the amount they owe on their mortgage The Bank of England estimates that negative equity currently affects between 700,000 and 1.1 million UK households Negative equity can make it harder to sell and move , or to borrow against the value of your home to pay off other debts , or to finance normal household spending during a period of unemployment However , if you are not looking to move , negative equity is not necessarily a problem and can be overcome by waiting for the housing market to recover , while at the same time continuing to pay off your mortgage
Struggling with your mortgage ?
Under its new arrangement , existing borrowers would take out a loan for 95 % of the value of their new house at a fixed rate of 6.73 % for three years or 7.48 % for five years .
They would have to put down a 5 % deposit from their own funds .
They would then be able to add on the negative equity from their old home , up to another 25 % of the value of the new property , at a higher fixed rate of 7.23 % for three years or 7.98 % for five years .
As well as having their incomes and outgoings assessed by Nationwide , borrowers will also have to pass a stress test .
This will ensure they can still afford the mortgage repayments if interest rates have risen to 9 % or 10 % once the fixed - rate element of the loan has expired .
No takers yet A Nationwide spokeswoman said although the deal was first made available in June , it was not being actively marketed .
So far none of its customers have taken up the offer .
It was , the spokeswoman said , aimed at helping only a few existing customers who came to the society and asked for help because they found they were in negative equity but were being forced to move house .
" Borrowers in these unique circumstances are simply able to transfer part of their existing negative equity with them when they need to move home - the actual value of the negative equity and the loan - to - value will reduce in all circumstances , " she said .
" The borrowers have to meet our own affordability criteria , " she added .
Wrong again ?
There has been much criticism of the loans above 100 % that were available at the peak of the housing boom , which immediately placed borrowers in negative equity .
The most notorious were those offered by the now nationalised Northern Rock bank .
The Nationwide 's deal was a " really consumer - friendly move " said Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol .
He added that at least two other major lenders were looking at introducing something similar for existing customers .
But financial planner Jonathan Davis , of Armstrong Davis , said the building society 's new policy was a " joke " , and that it exposed the lender to further losses if house prices continued to fall .
" You are taking people in negative equity , pushing more money down their throat to back an asset that is still going down in value , " he said .
" All the banks and building societies thought they were going to get their money back when they lent gargantuan sums in the run-up to 2007 - they were clearly wrong then and they are wrong again , " he added .

A report published in October 2008 , by Diabetes UK , stated that diabetes is one of the biggest challenges facing the NHS today .
There are currently 2.3 million people diagnosed in the UK with the condition and 500,000 who have Type 2 diabetes but are unaware of it .
Approximately 10 % of NHS spending goes on diabetes , that ’s £ 9 billion a year or £ 1 million an hour or £ 10,000 per minute treating diabetes and its complications .
Shockingly , 300 people are diagnosed with diabetes every day .
That ’s one every 5 minutes .
Diabetes is a hormone related disease which can cause thinning hair or hair loss .
There may be other reasons behind hair loss so it is important to get an accurate diagnosis from a doctor or hair specialist .
If you are losing hair and have not been diagnosed with diabetes , you may want to check for other symptoms of diabetes such as feeling very thirsty , producing excessive amounts of urine , tiredness , weight loss and muscle wasting .
Both Type 1 and Type 2 are serious and can lead to heart disease , strokes , amputations , kidney failure and blindness .
Type 2 can remain undetected for 10 years or more .
With an aging population and more people becoming overweight and obese , numbers of Type 2 diabetes will increase sharply .
It is estimated that by 2025 there will be more than 4 million with diabetes in the UK equivalent to a 46 % increase .
Douglas Smallwood , Chief Executive of Diabetes UK , said : “ These new figures are shocking and confirm that diabetes is one of the main health challenges facing the UK today .
Awareness and prevention are crucial if we want to see the number of people with Type 2 diabetes fall ” .
But could the current recession be making the problem worse ?
In these hard economic times , the sweet business is seeing growth .
It may be because of recession that more people are staying in and turning to treats to comfort them .
Earlier this month the Daily Mail reported that Cadbury ’s has seen a 12 % increase in UK sales of chocolates and confectionary over the first half of 2009 .
More sweets means more people putting on weight , unless action is taken action to prevent this – ie .
exercise .
However as there are also reports that state we are working longer hours as the recession kicks in , one wonders where we will find the time to work off those extra Mars Bars .
While diabetes is not caused by eating too many sweets , eating a diet high in unhealthy fats and sugar can cause you to become overweight , which increases your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes .
80 % of people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes are overweight at the time of diagnosis .
If you are suffering hair loss as a result of diabetes you may be able to manage it with FDA - approved hair loss treatments .
To find out whether these treatments could be of benefit to you , please book a consultation with one of our qualified advisors by calling 020 7730 6666 or message the clinic .
Alternatively , you can complete the online diagnostic form for a consultation via the website .

Though the price of coal has plummeted in the downturn and it is expected to remain weak in the near - term , coal markets “ are ultimately likely to rebound with a roar , ” Rick Navarre , the president of Peabody Energy , one of the world ’s largest coal companies , was quoted by Reuters as saying last week .
His optimism may be well founded .
Coal use tends to decline in a recession along with weaker demand for electricity and steel , which are industries that rely on the fossil fuel .
But a number of reports this week suggest that the industry is already girding for a future boom .
According to a report by Bloomberg this week , Macarthur Coal , an Australian company that is the world ’s biggest exporter of pulverized coal , plans to double production over the next five years .
The report also suggested that Australia ’s Dalrymple Bay port , the world ’s third - largest coal export terminal , may increase its cargo - handling capacity as producers of the fuel boost output .
Macarthur is a big user of the Dalrymple terminal .
Meanwhile , demand is also set to soar in California , according to a new study released Tuesday by the advocacy group Environment California and reported by The Los Angeles Times .
Mr. Navarre said Peabody Energy , which operates mines in the United States and Australia and exports much of its coal to Asia , was expecting China and India to account for half of the growth in global coal demand over the next five years , according to the report .
In a separate Bloomberg report this week , Kaamil Fareed , a senior trading manager at the Coal and Oil Group , which supplies coal in India and Pakistan , said coal imports in India would probably more than double to 100 million tons by 2012 .
And Coal India , the world ’s biggest coal producer , is also seeking to speed up mining approvals , the reports said , to help it boost production to meet shortfalls in supply .

A large group of civilian machine gun owners have some fun with some remote control airplanes .
When SICKO was released in 2007 , it resulted in an all - out smear campaign by the health care industry , so much did they fear it .
According to Wendell Potter , the former Cigna exec who was interviewed recently by Bill Moyers in a program entitled " Profits Before Patients , " they were afraid because they knew that what SICKO documented was true , and if the American public found out about what they were doing , their industry would be toast .
( If you have n't seen the Moyers / Potter interview already , make sure to watch it too , and send it to your friends and family , and even more importantly , your legislators .
Let 's make it go viral ! )
So the health care industry spent untold dollars insisting that Moore 's claims in SICKO were false , and trying to suppress the film , but as intrepid Kossack jamess noted in his excellent recent diary , Moore fought back , and even took on CNN's Sanjay Gupta when he tried to discredit SICKO .
So , if you missed it before , or want to watch it again , here 's your chance to see SICKO .
Showtime will be airing it several times this month on it's cable channels TMC ( The Movie Channel ) and TMC Xtra .
Make sure to click on " More Air Times , " or , for your convenience , check out the info below :

If you get any grief from those who would continue with the smear of SICKO , you could refer to Michael Moore 's Factcheck page , where all the false claims are debunked with reliable data .
You could also check out thewiki on Sicko .
And why not ask your legislators to watch it too ?
Finally , I hope you 'll take a moment to thank Showtime ( it appears that Showtime owns TMC and is in turn a part of the CBS network ) for airing SICKO .
You can contact Showtime here , but unfortunately it looks like they require a registration and login to comment and I also found this contact info , although I 'm not certain if it 's good :
You can contact Showtime Entertainment by calling 1-800-646-0608 or sending an email to dave@eshowtime2000.com ..
Probably better is to contact CBS directly , here or call at 212-975-4321 .
Please do this , because you 've gotta know that once the opponents of health care reform get wind of the airing of SICKO , both CBS and Showtime are sure to be bombarded with anti-SICKO emails .
They have the money , but we have the passion .
Medicare for All !
UPDATE : For those who do n't have cable , there apparently is a site where you canview SICKO online .
Hat tip to reflections v 37 for finding the site .
He / she says that the quality is uncertain , but even if it 's not so hot , it 's worth watching .
UPDATE 2 : Another hat tip , this one to TrueBlueMajority who has found another link to SICKO for online viewing .
It 'shere .
According to TrueBlueMajority ,
... the first link ( reflections v37's ) is a . swf ( shockwave flash format ) file , and some computers find that easier to play .
while the second one
is an .avi file ( audio visual interleave - - a kind of RIFF file ) and [ some computers have ] an easier time with them ( you have to have Windows Media Player 9 or higher )
Of course , if you do n't have one of the cable stations in question , you could always bribe a friend that does have the station with a bottle of wine or other enticement . ;)

By Federico Fuentes , Caracas
August 8 , 2009 -- On August 1 , United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) members across the country participated in 1556 local assemblies to discuss the reorganisation of the party ’s base into local ``patrols ' ' .
This push to strengthen revolutionary organising comes at a time when attacks on Venezuela ’s revolutionary process revolution “ from outside and within have intensified ” , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , also president of the PSUV , said on August 4 .
“ Each time that the revolution advances and accelerates its march , the attacks intensify .
I will continue to put my foot down on the accelerator of the Bolivarian revolution .
That is my role , that is my task and there is no time to lose .
Today , in Venezuela , we are creating a true socialist democracy . ”
After his re-election in the December 2006 presidential elections , Chavez issued a call to build a “ new party … from the base ” and at the service “ of the people and the revolution , at the service of socialism ” .
As an expression of a deeply felt need for greater revolutionary unity , almost 6 million people enrolled as aspiring PSUV members between April and June , 2007 .
Organised into 300 - strong local battalions , several hundred thousand aspiring members embarked on the task of building the PSUV , which held its founding congress in early 2008 .
However , a national leadership handout distributed at the assemblies said the process of forming battalions had generated “ a number of logistical difficulties [ that meant ] grassroots participation in the battalion meetings profoundly diminished , and in doing so debilitated [ their ] functioning and political performance ” .
Drawing on the lessons of previously successful election campaign structures , the leadership announced a re-organisation of the bases , where activists who know each other and live in the same street , block or local community were to unite into patrols comprising 20 to 30 members .
The smaller size and self - selecting nature of the process aims to facilitate greater organisational capacity and cohesion .
It is expected between 100,000 to 200,000 patrols will be formed in the lead up to the PSUV ’s second national congress , scheduled to begin on October 10 .
Despite announcements by Jorge Rodriguez , head of the PSUV ’s national organisation commission , that patrols would only be organised on a territorial basis , representatives of the PSUV ’s Socialist Workers Front told Green Left Weekly that Chavez proposed they move ahead with forming factory - and workplace - based patrols .
PSUV
Youth members have also said they plan to form university and high school patrols .
Despite more than 60 % of the 1.5 million new members who signed up this year being below the age of 29 , youth participation in the assemblies was extremely low .
On the political front , activism in local communities and ideological formation was emphasised .
The PSUV leadership document ( see below ) , circulated for discussion at the assemblies , said this was crucial for “ accelerating the transition to socialism ” .
The document said this transition involved “ the transformation of the bourgeois state into a revolutionary and democratic state ... the creation of socialist property relations over the means of production ... [ and ] the creation of revolutionary consciousness in working people [ through ] a profound ideological and cultural revolution ” .
[ This article first appeared in Green Left Weekly issue # 806 , August 9 , 2009 . ]
Analysis of the political situation for discussion at the assembly of future PSUV patrullas ( patrols )
International situation
The most important international issue for our country at this moment is the announcement made by President Hugo Chavez to freeze relations with Colombia .
This is due to a set of provocations and acts of confrontation by the government of [ Colombian President Alvaro ]
Uribe in the last few days .
Among those it is worth highlighting the decision to establish five US military bases in Colombia and the reiterated accusations , which are totally unfounded , that link the Venezuelan government to the FARC [ the left - wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ] .
In regards to the military bases , we are dealing with an open act of aggression , although the Colombian government wants to try and cover it up with the euphemism that they are Colombian bases that will count with the support of US military personnel .
In reality , the US policy of economic expansion and political confrontation in the hemisphere seeks to establish a military foothold .
In this sense , the hostility of the US government in relation to our revolution has been more than proven .
The government of Uribe has transformed Colombia into a military base and seeks to defeat the popular movement and insurgent forces in Colombia .
At the same time , these military bases aim to contain the advance of the revolutionary forces in the continent .
Colombia has opted for subordination to the US , expressed in its insistence on signing a Free Trade Agreement with the US , and now with the establishment of military bases , something that is incompatible with maintaining stable and friendly relations with our countries .
The revision of economic relations on our side signifies , among other things , a notable decrease in trade .
Colombia will lose its second - largest market , an important destination for exported manufactured and agricultural goods .
These can be imported to our country from other countries or substituted by national production .
It will be much more difficult for Colombia to find alternative markets within the framework of the world crisis .
This will represent a drop in employment , production and income in an economy like Colombia ’s that has already been seriously affected by the world crisis of capitalism .
In general terms , we believe that this situation will lead to an intensification of the Colombian economic crisis and the strengthening of anti-imperialist positions in this country .
Another important issue is the coup in Honduras .
As we have already said in other opportunities , we are dealing with a coup against Honduran democracy , against the advance of the popular movement in that country , but also against Latin American and Caribbean democracy , as well as , and especially , ALBA .
Having converted itself into a counterweight to imperialist hegemony , it is being punished with this blow .
Despite the ambiguities of the US government , there is no doubt that imperialism participated in the military coup .
The lessons of the coup in Honduras have [ proven ] to us , among other things , that imperialism is the principal enemy of the revolutionary process ; that every revolution or process of democratisation has to be capable of defending itself , for which it must count on a united revolutionary party with deep popular roots ; and , lastly , that we have to be prepared in the face of any escalation of aggressions against our revolution , consolidating the continental and global unity of anti-imperialist and progressive forces .

Take a tip from the experts : Connoisseurs prize the twittering of Iowa Sen .
Charles Grassley , who has quickly become iconic for communicating his world of political hackery and deception in an ambience of crack - brained incoherence .
-- Senate Finance Committee ranking minority member
Chuck Grassley , speaking of his bipartisan bosom
buddy , committee chairman Max Baucus
DWT
To Sen. Charles Ernest Grassley --
for taking twittering into bold new horizons of imbecility and incoherence ( and , oh yes , dishonesty and cynical political opportunism -- but heck , these 'll always be with us , regardless of what media we use )
but just this one
I know you can't be expected to worry about our scheduling problems , but the " Comedy Tonight " Dept. has just issued an Emergency Overflow Alert for tonight 's edition , which as usual goes up at midnight ET / 9 pm PT .
As a result , what was to have been an Honorable Mention citation to the yukmeister of the corn belt , Iowa Sen .
Chuck " I'm Just a Twitterin ' Fool " Grassley , has been bumped forward into the regular post rotation .
Connoisseurs of political comedy are already enamored of our Chuck 's Amazin '
Tweets , which are known for providing a seamless blend of incoherence with supersize helpings of dishonesty and cynical political opportunism .
( Jason Rosenbaum 's got a nice post at HCAN's Health Care for America Now blog .)
We 're hearing reports that the diehard ChuckTweet aficionados are having their ability to perform normal work seriously impaired as they keep watch on the Chuckster 's feed and swap notes with fellow enthusiasts to make sure they have n't missed any gems .
As if the economy were n't already seriously enough impaired !
The Chuckster is of course the regular dance partner of bipartisan bosom buddy ( BBB ) " Slappy Maxie " Baucus , and in their carefully orchestrated Abbott and Costello way they 've been teaming up to make sure that this here health care nonsense does n't get out of control .
At " Comedy Tonight , " our Chuck was in line for this honor :

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks as if the United States is the only country refusing to relinquish sovereignty by joining the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
However , out of 192 UN - member countries , roughly half ( 109 ) have agreed to join the ICC .
As Michael Struet states in " Why Do States Join the International Criminal Court ? " :
... in a number of states , transitional regimes charged with ending a cycle of recent internal conflict have found it prudent to join the ICC , precisely because it offers an international bulwark against a return to routine political violence .
The most important conclusion we draw from this analysis is that deep structural factors heavily determine whether or not states will ratify a constitutional treaty .
The United States did not refuse to join the ICC because of party politics or ideology .
The LA Times notes , " President Clinton was never fully satisfied with the result , waiting until the closing days of his administration to sign the treaty and declining to send it to the Senate for ratification . "
As Struet concluded , the reasons are structural and deeply embedded in our cultural history .
The American Revolution may have not taken place or succeeded had Great Britain not passed a mandate requiring all criminals against the King ( or his soldiers ) to be transported to England to receive a " fair " trial .
As depicted by David McCullough , this was the deciding factor for John Adams to join the revolution .
It is listed as an inexcusable act in the Declaration of Independence .
U.S. proponents of the ICC typically place full blame on President Bush ( 43 ) , while arguing that the ICC will only have jurisdiction when U.S. courts are either unable or unwilling to prosecute .
However , they fail to grasp the magnitude of this statute .
Gary T. Dempsey commented on the matter :
The ICC will also become an unavoidable participant in the national legal process .
Indeed , because it will set precedents regarding what it considers " effective " and " ineffective " domestic criminal trials , the ICC will indirectly force states to adopt those precedents or risk having cases called up before the international court .
That constitutes an unprecedented change in the sources of national lawmaking , one that diminishes the traditional notion of state sovereignty .
The issue is not whether other forms of trial are legitimate ; Americans are and should be subject to the criminal justice systems of whatever nation in which they are accused of crimes .
The issue is whether the United States as a matter of policy should adopt , for the first time , one of those systems as party to an extra-national authority with power over anyone in the world .
Our role should be to guarantee jury rights for the accused , not to give up and say that this protection is no longer fundamental because it 's inconvenient in this new context .
The very existence of the ICC signifies that those member countries that did not join out of their self - interest to prevent political violence within their borders actually believe the people of every country hold the same values regarding laws and liberties .
The previously cited LA Times articles concludes :
As of November 1 , 1959 , mild mannered C.C. Baxter has been working at Consolidated Life , an insurance company , for close to four years , and is one of close to thirty - two thousand employees located in their Manhattan head office .
To distinguish himself from all the other lowly cogs in the company in the hopes of moving up the corporate ladder , he often works late , but only because he can't get into his apartment , located off of Central Park West , since he has provided it to a handful of company executives - Mssrs.
Dobisch , Kirkeby , Vanderhoff and Eichelberger - on a rotating basis for their extramarital liaisons in return for a good word to the personnel director , Jeff D. Sheldrake .
When Baxter is called into Sheldrake 's office for the first time , he learns that it is n't just to be promoted as he expects , but also to add married Sheldrake to the list to who he will lend his apartment .
Dobisch , Kirkeby , Vanderhoff and Eichelberger are now feeling neglected as Baxter no longer needs ...

Multiple times throughout the series , the doctors claim that a particular patient is unable to have an MRI because he / she has titanium screws , rods or plates in their bodies .
Titanium is non-magnetic and patients with titanium implants can be safely examined using an MRI .
Issues would only arise if the titanium were installed using fasteners with magnetic properties .

Apple today unveiled 3 new get a Mac ads , one of which directly takes on Microsoft ’s recent ad campaign where it touts the wide variety of choices PC users have in picking out a computer .
Overall , the ads are pretty solid .
The last trio of “ Get a Mac ” ads seemed a bit tired , and almost played out , but these ones definitely spruce things up .
The following ad is called “ Elimination ” , and is a direct response to Microsoft ’s “ I ’m a PC ” campaign .
The next ad is called “ Customer Care ” and points out the difficulties PC users have in receiving customer care compared to the “ Genius ” customer experience Apple offers its customers .
I think this is a great commercial because 1 ) it gives Hodgman an opportunity to be more animated and 2 ) it really captures the frustration involved with trying to get anything resolved with a phone call to a tech company ( I ’m looking at you AT&T ! )
The last ad is called “ PC Choice Chat ” and involves the PC running a radio show where he helps callers find the right PC for them .
This ad is also pretty good , if only for the cliche and comical sound effects .

If you 're watching it , it 's for you .
I know you were n't talking to me , but I have something to tell you
It 's not hard to see why Twilight is popular among teen girls .
The plot is a simple one -- teen girl falls in love with her teen classmate who is actually a 100 year old vampire named Edward Cullen , can they be together ?
It captures the thrill of first time love , when every little gesture or word always had a magnificent subtext .
A caress of the face more stimulating than any orgasm .
Etc. The actress who plays the ambivalent Bella really nails the dazed , depressive vulnerability of this demo of teen girl , jerky head movements conveying emotional confusion , lips permanently parted trying to form words for feelings she can't sort out : and she has it right down to the borderline sleeve : Personal aside : in my life , the borderline sleeve meant two things : the girl would like me , and I would regret it .
II .
Thing is , the movie might be for teen girls , but it was watched by a lot of other people .
Opening weekend , half the audience was women over 25 .
Perhaps it reminded these older (? ) jaded women of a more honest love , where a man was willing to devote himself entirely to the woman .
All of his history and all of his development are just prelude tolove , to this relationship .
And he 's willing to be a , he 's going to be the strong one , he 's going demand full devotion back , he 's going to be jealous but never lay a hand on you ; he 's going to respect you , care for you , he 's going to pay for all of the dinner and yes , he 's going to , dammit .
Men are wusses .
Got it .
But let this movie serve also as a warning to the women who felt it touch them : if you actually meet an Edward Cullen in real life , quickly contaminate yourself with the AIDS virus -- because it is already too late to run .
III .
Here 's the basic problem with the movie vis a vis the longing women in the audience : vampires do n't exist .
Duh , you say , I do n't want a vampire , I want an Edward Cullen .
Actually , you do n't , here 's why .
Take the movie and delete any scenes -- and there are n't that many anyway -- in which Edward shows supernatural powers .
You will think this an odd directoral maneuver , but I promise you it 's quite revealing .
Doing this changes the movie to the story of a boy whohe 's something , but the objective audience never gets to see any evidence for it .
Hethis lonely , awkward , identity - less girl that he is a vampire , and he does this not with proof but by force of personality .
They then act out the rest of the same movie .
Now what 's the movie about ?
It 's about a guy manipulating a vulnerable girl .
The movie then becomes exactly what it really is already , though confused by the distraction of vampirism .
She 's looking for a boy to be a man for her , in the absence of a father for that role .
But it 's 2009 -- there are n't any such men , because the existing young men were n't raised to be men , they were n't raised to track accepted roles .
Because the fathers checked out on them , too , emotionally if not physically .
So the best any boy can come up with -- lacking any model for identity -- IV .
Edward seems always ambivalent : on the one hand he 's a vampire , on the other hand he loves her .
" You do n't know how much I want to kill you . "
That 's touching .
He spends the first third of the movie enraged / disgusted / infatuated with her .
The explanation in the movie is that he 's a vampire and she 's an innocent .
The explanation in real life is that she 's searching for something that gives her meaning , and he 'sit .
He never hated her , he was never disgusted by her .
You get distracted by the vampire photo on the cover , that part is irrelevant .
Here 's an example .
In the early part of the movie , brooding / dangerous Edward tells Bella , " I do n't think it 's a good idea for us to be friends . "
This is supposed to show his ambivalence towards her , which some also take as a sign of his disrespect of her .
Except that when he says this , at this point in the movie , they are n't actually friends .
In fact , she was n't even talking to him -- he literally ran across the parking lot , came up behind her , and opened up with that statement .
Anyone other than me ever been 15 ?
You only do that when you want tobeing friends .
It 's aHe has no ambivalence at all .
Here 's another example : he ( again ) sneaks up behind her -- after eavesdropping , mind you -- and says all broody , " what 's in Jacksonville ? " and she says , " How did you find out about that ? "
To which he responds , even more broody , " you did n't answer my question .
" Most people 's response to him would be to stab him in the eye , who does this jerk think he is ?
And hence I can see why some audience might see him as a disrespectful misogynist .
However , I 'm not sure girls are aware of this , but if there are any honest men reading this blog they 'll know -- it 's also a move .
He does n't actually want to know what 's in Jacksonville , -- he just wants to talk to her .
He 's not annoyed she did n't answer his question ; what he wants is to convey theof a deep , brooding intellect who does n't have time for " games . "
( Not having time for games is itself a game . )
She does n't stab him in the eye because he knows she wo n't stab him in the eye .
He acts like that and says that because he knows she 'll respond like that .
He 's performingdialogue , he 's trying to get her to say her part that A few scenes later -- yup , sneaks up behind her again , ladies , if a guy comes up behind you and says , well , anything , then he wants to bone you -- he says some brooding / dark things and then says , " ... it just means if you were smart , you 'd stay away from me . "
Oooooh .
That statement is factually correct , as it stands .
But what he meant is , " I 'm very mysterious , even though I 'm not .
Can I touch your boobs now ? " " Your mood swings are giving me whiplash . "
Ah , so you 've been paying attention to me .
V.Vampires do n't exist , so there 's little danger in 15 yo girls falling in love with them .
The real danger is a 15 yo boy tries to emulate Edward .
You take a semi- lost 15 yo boy , he looks around and perhaps he 's written off the cheerleaders or the prom queen because he figures they 're out of his league .
He has an instinctive pull towards someone like Bella , pretty but attainable , attainableshe's semi-lost herself .
And the boy says to himself , if I want to get a Bella , I guess I have to be an Edward .
In the movie Bella says to Edward , " I can see what you 're trying to put off , it 's to keep people away from you , it 's a mask . "
Adolescents love to talk about masks and fronts , " that 's not the real you . "
Because if the mask is n't the real you , then therea real you after all .
Looked at this way , the real mask -- i.e. the fake identity -- is the one the boy is consciously putting off for her to discover , the brooding artist only she can see .
All of this is typical of adolescence and therefore normal .
But to you > 25 year old women who liked the movie , the guy you met who seems a little Edward Culleny is a fraud , and a dangerous one .
Bella says to Edward : " this stuff does n't exist , it is n't real . "
He responds : " It does in my world . "
Yeah .
That 's the problem .
VI .
Here 's a part of the movie no one else seemed to have any problem with : her acceptance into Edward 's family .
Edward 's family is " perfect " -- rich , loving artists who play baseball in the rain .
Edward brings
Bella home to meet them , and they welcome her warmly with no reservations .
( Only one daughter objects . )
Edward 's father says , " she 's one of us now . "
Well , of course , she 's not , right ?
On some level Bella must know she 's not one of them , she 's someone else , right ?
For example , she already has a family , remember them ?
and she 's not a vampire .
But if her identity is n't tied to these real things -- Bella is the main character of the story , but I 'll bet you do n't know her last name -- then it's not a big leap for her to become one of them .
It 's not hard to see how a girl like this gets lost -- her parents either do n't exist or are near perfect narcissists .
Her mom has decided to roam the country with her baseball player boyfriend .
On a phone call , the mom asks Bella if she has a boy in her life , and Bella says yes .
Here are the next three questions , word for word , that the mother -- 2000 miles away but still parenting !-- asks Bella to best characterize the relationship : " is he a jock ?
Indie ?...
Are you being safe ? " I almost expected her to ask if he voted for Obama .
Are these really the most illuminating questions you ask a 17yo with her first boyfriend ?
If she said he was a jock , does that give the mom any real understanding into what that boy might be like , what he mightto her ?
Of course not , but the boy 's not real to the mother , so she can't imagine him as a person with his own existence .
She can't really comprehend her own daughter 's existence outside of her own .
Meanwhile , Dad is physically present in the way a quark is physically present , it 's there , I guess , it does something but God only knows what .
So when a young girl 's family is this hazy , it is natural that a teen might fantasize about hooking up with a morefamily -- even if it 's made of vampires .
For you middle aged folks , the analogy is 80s sitcoms .
There was always a friend coming over the house , and that friend was almost an extension of the family .
Skippy could walk in without knocking , and mom was always happy to cook him breakfast .
She counseled him , hugged him ; he'd open the refrigerator like it was his house and no one shot him .
I used to think , wow , does n't Skippy 's real mom mind he 's never at home ?
But I was n't mature enough to understand that the fact that Skippy could be away all the time meant precisely that she did n't care .
The friend 's real family was loose and uninvolved .
So he found a new one .
In the final act , bad vampires are trying to kill Bella , so Edward brings her to his family for protection .
Edward 's father says , " I 'll defend her like family . "
That sounds awesome , but here 's a bit of reality : any father who so readily admits a stranger to the family at the risk of death to the other actual family members is whacked .
But that 's not how a young girl might see things , because she 's not just hiding out in her BF 's house , she 'spart of his family .
I sympathize with this kind of magical thinking in a teen with no strong family bonds of her own , I really do , I have no beef with your fantasies .
My beef is with the boy who thinks nothing of puttingat risk in order to save his girlfriend .
And even that 's not as romantic as it sounds -- any guy who would do this is doing it for himself , not for the girl .
He 's not doing it because he does n't want her to die ; he 's doing it because he does n't want to live without her .
The movie -- and the boy -- are already showing that established family bonds can be quickly restructured to suit the passions of the boy .
He 's willing to alter reality and family for what he wants .
What if his passions change ?
What if she gets fat ?
What chance does this kind of a relationship have long term ?
Zero .
Here 's my point : we are raising those exact kids right now .
VII .
No one hands kids identities anymore , no one says , " this is who you are , now start acting like it . "
You 're a man , here 's what men do ; your last name is X , that 's who you are .
Etc. What we 're teaching kids is to make it up as they go along .
So they do .
Or , they just morph into someone else 's life .
The patterns will stay : she 'll go on to have those kind of relationships , because that 's the method she 's learned to get that kind of passion .
And he 'll go on to pretend he 's somebody / something -- different each time , perhaps , but each time with conviction -- because that 's how he 's learned you score a chick .
And why would he learn anything different ?
His parents are n't any kind of role model in this regard .
TV is death .
No one reads books -- except , apparently .
Even porn is infested with MILF nonsense , obviously directed towards middle aged adults .
Those narcissists are so focused on their own world that they only have the imagination to fantasize about people who are already exactly like their wives ; but they are too disgustedto penetrate them .
Easier to fantasize that someone else is doing it .
Tell me , please , how can any teen boy respect or learn from an adult who not onlyporn , but bookmarks MILF porn ?
Twilight is an accurate depiction of the moves and sensations of first time love .
By second time love , by age 30 , there should be some maturity .
This is what it looks like when you do n't .

A 17 - year - old US mariner piloted his battered sailboat into a Southern California harbour to complete a gruelling 13 - month voyage and become the youngest person to sail around the world alone .
Sandy - haired teenager Zac Sunderland arrived in Marina Del Rey aboard his 11 - metre sloop Intrepid on Thursday ( local time ) .
He becomes the first person under 18 to circumnavigate the globe by sea alone , and the youngest to date .
The previous record - holder was Australian David Dicks , who completed his voyage in November 1996 at age 18 .
During his 52,000 - kilometre journey Mr Sunderland braved storms , equipment failures , close calls with freighters and a run-in with suspected pirates .
" It 's been a crazy 13 months and ... yeah , it 's awesome to finally get back here , " Mr Sunderland , of Thousand Oaks , California , said after he was welcomed home by a flotilla of well - wishers .
Fewer than 250 people have sailed solo around the globe , with three times that many scaling the top of Mount Everest , according to the American Sailing Association , which certified Mr Sunderland 's feat .
He left Marina Del Rey , just south of Los Angeles , on June 14 , 2008 , and celebrated his 17th birthday at sea while off Africa 's Cape of Good Hope .
His return was delayed near the end of his voyage when his single - masted boat sustained a broken bulkhead in rough seas off Mexico , forcing him to stop at Puerto Vallarta long enough for his father , Laurence , a British - born sailor and shipwright , to fly in to make repairs .
' Load your gun up '
An earlier storm in the Indian Ocean kept Mr Sunderland up for four days and nights , struggling to keep his vessel on course in gale - force winds that heavily damaged the boat 's rigging .
Another frightening moment occurred in the Indian Ocean off Indonesia when Intrepid was stalked by a suspected pirate boat as Mr Sunderland repeatedly took evasive action .
The intruders fled after he climbed onto the deck of his vessel with a loaded pistol and a flare gun to ward them off .
Laurence Sunderland said he gave his son precise instructions in a tense discussion between the two by satellite telephone .
" I said load your flare gun up , load your gun up .
... and when the boat gets close enough , fire two warning shots over the top of the boat with the flare gun , and if it keeps on coming , get ready to go with your real gun , " the father recounted .
" And I said , ' You shoot to kill , stay out of the line of fire and be very purposeful in what you do . ' "
The teen sailor never had to fire a shot and later dumped the gun before entering Mexican waters , where it is illegal to carry private firearms .
The oldest of seven children , Mr Sunderland , who plans to write a book about his adventure , was home - schooled and partly raised on a boat .
Mr Sunderland 's record as the youngest is likely to be broken later this year by Mike Perham , 17 , a British sailor who is a couple of months younger and began his round - the - globe voyage in a larger , more modern boat on November 15 , 2008 .
Mr Perham is on track to finish is voyage in less than a year , Nobles said .

Maggie Gallagher :
What 's in a name ?
by Jeremy Hooper
Those who oppose marriage equality for gay couples love to cite majority opinion to justify their resistance .
In most every one of their public appearances , you 'll find these " marriage protectors " quoting whatever polling data they can to supposedly " prove " that the American people are on their side in terms of nuptial convictions .
The public knows best , they tell us .
So that being the case , one would probably expect them to also agree with polls like this one :
About 70 % of Americans agree , either somewhat or strongly , that it 's beneficial for women to take her husband 's last name when they marry , while 29 % say it 's better for women to keep their own names , finds a study being presented today at the American Sociological Association 's annual meeting in San Francisco .
70 % say brides should take husband 's name [ USA Today ]
After all , if majority opinion is the be all , end all of accurate marital assessment , would n't we expect the " traditional marriage " set to see this name - taking business as being in hands of " the people " ?
Well , you might want to ask that very question of the National Organization For Marriage 's Maggie Gallagher .
Or should we say : Maggie Srivastav ( the married name that you will never hear her use in public ) .
Because while she may desperately watch the polls to ensure that there is a 50%+1 majority who oppose marriage equality for gays and lesbians , she apparently sees no need to watch polls that tell her to waste a day on line waiting to change her passport .
Now , most of us on the pro-equality side obviously have no problem with Maggie using her maiden name .
In fact , many of us are likely to prefer that choice .
But we can't help but notice the irony of someone who claims to be so " for traditional marriage " making a marital choice that is apparently out of step with 70 % of Americans .
And if Maggie does n't want to use her married name ( which again , we 100 % support ) , then perhaps she needs to admit that maybe , just maybe , every Americans life should not be guided by majority opinion !!

Majority opinion has not necessarily been a good indicator for the truth of anything , whether we are talking about fact - based matters or issues affecting the quality of human lives .
After all , majorities once believed that : Women should not have the right to vote .
It was correct to ban interracial marriage .
Women should be considered property of their husbands .
Marriages should be arranged by parents .
Slavery was acceptable .
Women should not speak in church .
Disease and storms were caused by evil spirits .
The earth was flat .
The sun revolved around the earth .
Marriage should be banned between two people of the same sex .
Oh , wait , I got ahead of myself .
The list could go on and on .
And of course , in some cultures , majorities still do believe some of these things .
So when Maggie cites majority opinion , she is standing on quicksand .

Oh yea , that 's def . her F'book , Matt .
She goes by her married name privately , just not , bizarrely , in her marriage advocacy .

I 'm just wondering what she might be hiding with that name .
I 'm not one for conspiracies , Occam 's Razor and all that , but with NOM still hiding their financials , one has to wonder .
Posted by : Matt Algren | Aug 26 , 2009 3:15:30 PM
She probably knows that the people she preaches to on a daily basis are a little too apathetic to try and pronounce " Srivastav , " so she goes by Gallagher , which everyone knows to be a famous comedian who looks like David Crosby .

" I 'm just wondering what she might be hiding with that name . "
I 'm with you Matt !
Earlier today I emailed Fred Karger , and until then , he was not aware that her married name was different than her Gaggie - name .
I do n't know that it will matter , since the IRS did n't have ANY filings from NOM .

Much of the cargo is still intact Underwater archaeologists in Italy have discovered the wrecks of five ancient Roman ships in the Mediterranean , with their cargo still largely intact .
The ships are lying in up to 150 metres ( 500 feet ) of water off the tiny island of Ventotene , between Rome and Naples .
They are between 1,600 and 1,900 years old , and were laden with - among other things - jars for carrying wine , olive oil and fish sauce .
One expert said : " It is like an underwater museum . "
Also on board were kitchen tools , and certain metal and glass objects which have not yet been identified .
The discovery of wrecked ships is not unusual - there are said to be thousands dotted around the Mediterranean .
But Annalisa Zarattini , from the Italian Culture Ministry , said the latest to be found are much better preserved than usual because they sank in deeper water , which protected them from destructive currents .
The ships also sank without capsizing , she said , allowing examination of the cargo in almost the form it had been loaded .
Officials say the latest finds are the result of a new drive by archaeologists to scan deeper waters , organised by the culture ministry and the Aurora Trust , a maritime research group .
The plan was prompted in part by a desire to prevent the looting of treasures .
Because of improving technology , looters are now able to dive to greater depths than in the past .
Italian authorities are trying to stay ahead of looters " It 's important that we arrive there first , " said Ms Zarattini .
The team of archaeologists and deep sea divers used sonar technology and miniature robotic submarines in their latest operation .
The biggest of the ships discovered is about 20 metres long ( 60 feet ) .
The area they were found in was on a major route for trade between Rome and its North African territories .
Some of the objects are being put on display on Ventotene .

The former US vice - president Dick Cheney ordered the CIA to conceal a highly secret counter - terrorist programme from Congress for eight years , possibly in breach of longstanding oversight laws .
Democratic leaders in Congress are planning hearings to establish how and why information about the programme was withheld .
The details have been revealed to members of intelligence committees but not been made public .
The revelation in the US press on Sunday that Cheney played a primary role in keeping the programme secret suggests that it would have been highly contentious .
Attention has focused on reports earlier this year that he oversaw an assassination programme .
One member of an intelligence committee who was briefed on the secret operation last week said that Congress would have been unlikely to have approved it .
According to US intelligence officials quoted in the US media the CIA director , Leon Panetta , told congressional intelligence committees that information about the programme was withheld on Cheney 's orders .
Panetta told the committees that as soon as he learned of the programme 's existence last month he shut it down .
The law requires the president to keep Congress " fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities " , although it does allow information to be withheld about " exceptionally sensitive matters " .
However , it has been the accepted practice that the existence of even the most secret category of covert programmes is revealed to the " gang of eight " Democratic and Republican leaders of the two houses of Congress and their intelligence committees .
That was not done on this occasion , apparently on Cheney 's orders .
The nature of the programme has not been made public , although it does not involve the CIA 's controversial use of waterboarding and other forms of torture .
Nor is it about domestic intelligence .
In March , the respected investigative reporter Seymour Hersh revealed that he had uncovered evidence during research for an as - yet unpublished book that Cheney oversaw an " executive assassination ring " for years .
" It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office .
...
Congress has no oversight of it , " he said at the time .
" It 's an executive assassination ring essentially , and it 's been going on and on and on .
Under President Bush 's authority , they 've been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving .
That 's been going on , in the name of all of us . "
Whether or not the secret programme involved assassination , an insight in to how radical it might have been was offered by Peter Hoekstra , a leading Republican on the House of Representatives intelligence committee .
He told the New York Times that he believed Congress would have approved it in the days immediately after the 9/11 attacks but would have backed away after that .
Dianne Feinstein , chair of the Senate intelligence committee , said today that there was no justification for withholding information about the secret operation and suggested that laws were broken .
" This is a big problem because the law is very clear .
I understand the need of the day which was when America was in shock , when we had been hit in a way we never contemplated , where we had massive loss of life , where there was a major effort to be able to respond .
But I think you weaken the case when you go outside of the law ...
That 's something that should never ever happen again , " she said .
The chair of the House intelligence committee , Silvestre Reyes , said its members were " affirmatively lied to " about the operation .
Republican members of Congress have suggested that the programme never got beyond the planning stages and therefore there was no need to inform the intelligence committees .
However , there is scepticism that the operation could have been in preparation for eight years and yet never put into effect .
In recent weeks Cheney has launched a vigorous public defence of his actions over revelations about the extent of waterboarding and other torture against suspected terrorists .
Last week , a report by a group of inspector generals underscored Cheney 's central role in " unprecedented " extensive covert wiretapping of Americans .
The report questioned the programme 's legal rationale and the excessive secrecy around it .
The CIA , meanwhile , could face further scrutiny after it emerged that the attorney general , Eric Holder , is considering appointing a special prosecutor to investigate allegations that the agency illegally tortured terrorism suspects .
Scott Coker mentioned in the TapouT radio show yesterday that there will be a press conference in Japan regarding a new alliance with DREAM that could potentially bring a large amount of overseas fighters into the mix with Strikeforce 's roster of talent .
This has been a bit overlooked in all the Strikeforce discussions , but it matters due to the potential for booking the crossover battles between Japanese and North American fighters that many fans have craved for quite some time .
Not only are there bouts that can happen that are relevant within today 's ranks , but even matches of MMA legends that could potentially be made between the two promotions .
Think about some of these bouts : Frank Shamrock vs. Kazushi Sakuraba , Nick Diaz vs. Marius Zaromskis , Josh Thomson vs. Joachim Hansen / Shinya Aoki/ Ribeiro / Kikuno ... the list goes on .
The potential is endless , and while these fights may not be the most unbelievable battles to hit your television , the prospect of such an alliance only helps the sport build better fights for the fans .
So , how do the pools of fighters look ?
DREAM
Lightweight : Andre Dida , Katsunori Kikuno , Vitor Ribeiro , Shinya Aoki , Joachim Hansen , Gesias Calvancante , Tatsuya Kawajiri , Daisuke Nakamura
Welterweight : Marius Zaromskis , Hayato Sakurai , Jason High , Andre Galvao , Tarec Saffiedine
Middleweight : Paulo Filho , Melvin Manhoef .
Jesse Taylor , Dong Sik Yoon , Jason " Mayhem " Miller , Ronaldo Souza , Murilo Rua , Riki Fukuda , Zelg Galesic , Andrews Nakahara , Kazushi Sakuraba
Light Heavyweight : Rameau Soukodjou
Heavyweight : Sergei Kharitonov
Strikeforce
Lightweight : Josh Thomson , Gilbert Melendez , Mitsuhiro Ishida , Rodrigo Damm , Yves Edwards , Jorge Gurgel , Conor Heun , Billy Evangelista , Fabricio Camoes , Lyle Beerbohm , Malapeit , Mike Aina
Welterweight : Jake Shields , Nick Diaz , Andre Galvao , Joe Riggs , Duane Ludwig , Dennis Hallman , Phil Baroni , Tyron Woodley , Ross Ebanez , Luke Stewart
Middleweight : Robbie Lawler , Scott Smith , Cung Le , Jake Shields ( MW or WW ) , Jorge Santiago , Nick Diaz ( MW or WW ) , Frank Shamrock , Benji Radach , Joey Villasenor , Cyborg Santos , Terry Martin , Tim Kennedy , Luke Rockhold
Light Heavyweight : Renato " Babalu " Sobral , Gegard Mousasi , Rafael " Feijao " Cavalcante , Kevin Randleman , Mike Whitehead , Ralek Gracie , Bobby Southworth , Mike Kyle , Jarred Hamman , Paoi Suganuma , Aaron Rosa , Jaime Fletcher , Wayne Cole
Heavyweight : Shane Del Rosario , Alistair Overeem , Fabricio Werdum , Brett Rogers , Roger Gracie , Levar Johnson eventually , Abongo Humphrey , Daniel Puder , Jon Murphy , Carl Seumanutafa
Some of these fighters were on loan to DREAM from Strikeforce , so they have current Strikeforce deals .
I 'm also probably forgetting some of the smaller - time fighters that are fighting in ShoMMA as well , but obviously they may not reap the benefits of such a deal .
You can see the amount of top - notch fights that could come from such a deal though .
Zaromskis vs. Diaz could be a truly epic battle , and having guys like Ribeiro , Aoki , Hansen , Calvancante , Kawajiri , Nakamura , and Kikuno in the mix to actually fight some North American lightweights like Melendez or Thomson is a refreshing prospect .
The Middleweight prospects are also very solid , and it'll cure the entire problem of having a guy like Lawler battle catchweight match - ups instead of legitimate middleweights .
DREAM is a bit short on heavier competition , but there is always the possibility of M - 1 filling that void in this entire process .
They have some solid candidates within the mold of their M - 1 Challenge promotion , and do n't forget that Shane Del Rosario , a very highly - touted heavyweight prospect , is on loan from Strikeforce to M - 1 .
I know a lot of fans are going to be skeptical about this alliance and probably be pessimistic about the possibilities , but as a hardcore fan , I can't help but be a bit excited about some of the match - ups that could happen .
I 'm hoping Coker and M - 1 can smoothly negotiate these cards with DREAM when they happen so the fans can be entertained .
I am also finding Vista search problems .
I have just finished a doc file , closed it , and then went to open it again .
But its not showing in recent docs .
Did a search not there .
OH no !!
what have I done .
Manually search with explorer and there it is .
The document is entitled ' Invoice 0178 ' search for 0178 in documents > result nothing .
Expand search to look in non-indexed , hidden , and system files .
And it is found straight away .
Search for 0177 ( the previous invoice ) no need to expand the search !!!
Not for the first time I have thought that important files have bben lost .
What is the point of a search , that cannot find everything , in front of its face .
I hated going from 98 to XP , but oh my Vista .
What a load of ....

It 's been 10 years since their last album and Method man & Redman have n't skipped a beat .
Their latest album entitled Blackout !
2 was just released a few weeks ago .
It 's getting really good reviews .
We will be doing a full review on the album a bit later but I will say that the album is definitely up to par with their first album .
The album may have a few " simple " songs or songs you 'd hear in the club but it does n't take away from the value of the album as a whole .
One of the better tracks was made for all my smokers out there .
Its called " Dis Iz 4 All My Smokers " .

Method Man & RedMan - Dis Iz 4 All My Smokers
Dirt is a study of soil erosion and its effects on human history , pitched at a general audience .
A geomorphologist himself , Montgomery begins with a brief introduction to basic soil science , going back to Darwin 's work on earthworms and explaining the O , A , B , and C soil horizons and the processes of soil formation .
The bulk of Dirt , however , is a history of agriculture with a focus on soils .
This starts with the origin of agriculture ( at least in the Middle East ) , the civilizations based on fertile river valleys in Egypt and Mesopotamia , and the rise and fall of Greece , Rome , and the Maya and Pueblo .
" A common lesson of the ancient empires of the Old and New Worlds is that even innovative adaptations cannot make up for a lack of fertile soil to sustain increased productivity . "
Montgomery proceeds to agriculture in medieval and early modern Europe ( mostly Britain and France ) , also covering the history of European deforestation , the importance of colonies in providing food imports and exports of labour , and the political economy of agriculture .
Turning to the Americas , the focus is on the 18th and 19th century United States , with glancing references to modern Amazonia : the westward movement of settlers seeking new soils is linked to crop types and political institutions .
" the rapid soil erosion and soil exhaustion produced by slave - based agriculture condemned the institution of slavery to continuous expansion or collapse " .
He goes on to describe the dust bowls in the United States , desertification in the Sahel , and the effects of ploughs and mechanisation more generally .
The increasing use of fertilisers , from guano to the Haber - Bosch process and the Green Revolution , is reaching its limits ; Montgomery argues for increased use of no -till methods and other organic farming approaches that reduce dependence on fertilisers and improve soil quality .
As in so many domains , islands offer informative case studies : soil erosion played a role in that archetype of environmental disaster , Easter Island , different soils and social systems on Mangaia and Tikopia contributed to different histories , Iceland experienced extreme deforestation and erosion , and in Cuba the state compelled a shift to permaculture after the loss of Soviet support .
In his conclusion Montgomery suggests there are no easy answers to the agricultural problems facing humanity , but reiterates the importance of soils .
" There are three great regions that could sustain intensive mechanized agriculture — the wide expanses of the world 's loess belts in the American plains , Europe , and northern China , where thick blankets of easily farmed silt can sustain intensive farming even once the original soil disappears .
In the thin soils over rock that characterize most of the rest of the planet , the bottom line is that we have to adapt to the capacity of the soil rather than vice versa .
We have to work with the soil as an ecological rather than an industrial system ...
The future of humanity depends as much on this philosophical realignment as on technical advances in agrotechnology and genetic engineering . "
Scattered through Dirt is information about soil scientists and others who studied erosion and lobbied for agricultural reforms : Marcus Cato , George Perkins Marsh , James Hutton , Walter Lowdermilk , and others .
Quite a bit of space is also given to political economy , but there is relatively little on technology and economics .
Montgomery does n't claim soil erosion is responsible for everything , but his enthusiasm leads him to make some rather broad claims which in a few places are simply wrong , as when he asserts that " to this day , the amount of surplus food available to nonfarmers sets the level to which other segments of society can develop " .
More convincingly , he suggests that many of the historical events attributed to climate change were actually driven by soil erosion .
Some striking halftones provide illustrations , but there are no tables or graphs in Dirt and few maps .
In places these might have helped synthesize and integrate scattered details .
Going the other way , some micro-geographic studies of individual farms or specific locations might have given a better feel for what actually happens " on the ground " .
These are minor quibbles , however .
Dirt is an accessible overview of an important topic and deserves a wide readership .

Introduction
If you want to see the fastest processors compared , then go check out our performance charts , which were recently updated to include the three available Intel Core i7 processors ( and are in the process of being updated to include Phenom II ) .
Today , I do n’t really care how fast our test beds encode H.264 video , nor do I care about power consumption or overclocking .
In fact , today ’s shoot - out wo n’t even see us comparing different processors to competing models .
Rather , you ’ll only see one CPU in this shoot - out : AMD ’s Opteron .
It just so happens that the gentlemen in AMD ’s Austin , Texas office have a sense of humor , a proclivity for plinking , and two trays of what are referred to as mechanical samples — stillborn CPUs that look like the real deal ; they just wo n’t boot …
… at least I hope not .
After all , it ’d be a shame to do what I ’m about to do to these things if they were functional processors .
Guess we ’ll never know , though , because today ’s shoot - out sees an arsenal of firepower tested using the destruction of Opteron processors as our sole benchmark .
How do heat spreaders , PCBs , and silicon die hold up to handguns , shotguns , rifles , and light machine guns ?
There ’s only one way to find out …
A Word About Safety
Before we let loose on the firing line , I would n’t be doing due diligence here if I did n’t mention proper firearm handling .
Our reference here is the NRA ’s list of Gun Safety Rules .
It ’s also worth mentioning that everything you see in the following pages was conducted at a sportsman ’s club using California - legal equipment .
Unfortunately , this means we were not able to toss a CPU with a trebuchet and fire an anti-tank gun at it , a la Jeremy Clarkson and his Ford Scorpio .
But that also means we did n’t have to totally fake any of these chips getting shot , either — yes , that video was totally fake .
Enough with the political correctness , though .
If you ’re morally opposed to target practice , here ’s your last shot to return home before we start rolling out the hardware .
9 mm Handgun : Beretta 92FS
Let ’s start off small .
Beretta ’s 92FS is the civilian version of the M9 pistol used by the United States military .
It ’s a semi-automatic , double action / single action pistol that fires a 9 x 19 mm Parabellum ( 9 mm NATO ) cartridge .
The factory magazine holds 15 staggered rounds ; however , California ’s gun laws restrict magazines to 10 rounds , so that ’s what you see here .
Not that we ’ll even need 10 rounds .
The Stig was already booked on the day of our shoot - out .
However , we were still able to track down a crack shot who wears no helmet , but never shows his face , to do his worst using our collection of hardware .
9 mm Hollow Points From 10y
From roughly 10 yards out , our mystery shooter takes aim at an unscathed Opteron processor taped to the club ’s target board .
This test would have been more scientific had the ambitious shooter standardized on jacketed ammunition , but a strange fascination of all things hollow - point sacrifices the penetration of our pistol tests in favor of more dramatic ballistics .
Let ’s take a look at how the 9 mm performed …
That ’s Going To Leave A Mark
The 9 mm hollow point bullet is powerful enough to ruin a perfectly good non-functional processor , but it does n't have the velocity to penetrate AMD 's heat spreader .
Our shooters words : " Wow , heatspreaders would make great armor on the inside of Humvees . "
Stepping It Up To .45
Next up is the Springfield Armory XD .45 ACP , a semi-automatic , double - action pistol that fires an 11.43 x 23 mm Automatic Colt Pistol cartridge .
This particular model is a compact with a four - inch barrel , suiting it well as a concealed carry .
Naturally , there ’s a lot of controversy surrounding concealed weapons .
But for the law enforcement officers and private citizens licensed to carry them , the internal struggle is over which caliber to carry .
When size matters most , the consensus in most law enforcements forums is that a .380 is the minimum .
But when it comes to stopping power ( or heatspreader - destroying power ) , a .45 is the way to go .
.45 ACP Hollow Points From 10y
The way we ’re going to be firing it here is in the configuration that ’d be used to ward off an attacker — with hollow - point bullets , optimized for expansion rather than penetration .
Let ’s see how that affects the target .
Pure Pwnage
The carnage is n't as pronounced as it was with the 9 mm - - likely because the .45 ACP travels at about 1,000 feet per second to the 9 mm 's 1,200 - 1,300 feet per second .
However , the .45 still hits incredibly hard .
In the image above , you can see the impact pattern on the heatspreader itself .
And if you were to look on the other side , you 'd see the imprint left by the missing transistors on AMD's PCB .
Are We Bird Hunting Now ?
Enough with the side arms .
Let ’s move on to something able to bruise your shoulder .
OK , so a 20 - gauge probably wo n’t tenderize your arm right away , but put a hundred rounds through it on opening day and you ’ll still be feeling it the morning after .
Our model here is a Ruger Red Label over and under shotgun .
For the uninitiated , an over and under employs a break - action .
With the action open , you ’re able to insert a pair of shot shells .
The gauge is representative of caliber .
The 20 - gauge here is 15.6 mm .
From Point Blank
Shotguns are most effective from close range , where the shot pattern is tightest and moving at the highest velocity .
The top barrel on the Ruger is outfitted with an Improved Cylinder choke , for a wider pattern and less range , while the bottom barrel employs a modified choke , tightening the pattern and extending range — convenient for hunting , when the target is further away by the time you fire your second shot .
Unfortunately for our Opteron targets , they ’re completely immobile , so we took our shot from as close to point blank as possible .
Amazingly , the damage was minimal ( given we were only using size 7 birdshot ) .
Let ’s step up to something a little more … aggressive , shall we ?
Home Defense , Winchester Model 1300 - Style
While the Ruger is a purpose - built hunting / skeet gun , Winchester ’s Model 1300 Defender is meant to discourage home invasion through a few different means .
To begin , it ’s a 12 - gauge ( 18.5 mm ) , chambering a larger round .
This particular model is all - black with a barely - legal 18 ” barrel and Improved Cylinder choke — clearly intended to put out a wide pattern at close range .
The Defender ’s tubular magazine holds seven shells , plus one in the chamber if you ’re carrying it around loaded .
But perhaps its most intimidating spec is its pump-action .
They say that if a robber were to break in during the middle of the night , the sound of a pump- action shotgun chambering a round is enough to turn him right around in search of new underwear .
Here ’s hoping we never have to find out .
Worried about having to install Windows 7 on more than one computer ?
Sometimes copy protected programs can be awfully expensive , but thankfully Microsoft has announced its plans for a Windows 7 Family Pack , which can be installed on up to three PCs .
Microsoft revealed the new Win7 option late Tuesday afternoon , and the announcement has been generating plenty of buzz ever since .
Unfortunately , prices for the Family Pack remain just speculation .
What we do know is that the Family Pack will consists of the Windows 7 Home Premium version .
( Source : cnet.com )
Family Pack Tops Consumer Wish List
The Redmond - based company , which plans to release the highly - anticipated operating system on October 22 , had hinted at the possibility for something akin to the Family Pack when a test version of Windows 7 leaked onto the web a while back .
A Family Pack deal has been on consumer wish lists for a long time .
Apple offers its own with the Mac OS X operating system , and has done so since 2002 .
However , Microsoft 's last Family Pack deal , the one that came alongside Windows Vista , was only a short promotion that included three copies of Home Premium at a reduced price .
It was not the solidified multi-pack option that the Windows 7 Family Pack appears to be .
RTM Code Arriving Soon
In other Win7 news , it 's strongly rumored that Microsoft will be announce August 6 as its Release - to - Manufacturing ( RTM ) date .
The RTM , which is the OS ' final , completed version , will first be released to developers and other software insiders that day .
It 's expected that those with Software Assurance licenses will receive their Windows 7 RTM code on August 7 . ( Source : channelregister.co.uk )

First , I 'm going to Rwanda this weekend , on vacation .
I 'm looking forward to it immensely , especially since I discovered that the Bare - Faced Go - Away Bird , which topped my list of Best Bird Names Ever nearly five years ago , lives there .
( And did you know that the name ' Watusi ' comes from the Tutsi ? I did n't . )
If anyone has any great suggestions for things I might not think to do , etc. , please let me know .
Second , I 'm taking this opportunity to retire from blogging .
I 'll be here through Friday , but after that , I wo n't .
( I 'll still hang out in comments , though , after I get back . )
I 'm not sure it would be possible for me to stop if I were n't going off to central Africa without my computer , but since I am , I will .
The main reason I started blogging , besides the fact that I thought it would be fun , was that starting sometime in 2002 , I thought that my country had gone insane .
It was n't just the insane policies , although that was part of it .
It was the sheer level of invective : the way that people who held what seemed to me to be perfectly reasonable views , e.g. that invading Iraq might not be such a smart move , were routinely being described as al Qaeda sympathizers who hated America and all it stood for and wanted us all to die .
I thought : we 've gone mad .
And I have to do something -- not because I thought that I personally could have any appreciable effect on this , but because it felt like what Katherine called an all hands on deck moment .
I had heard about times like this in the past -- the McCarthy era , for instance -- though I had never expected to live through one .
Nonetheless , I was .
And I had to try to do something , however insignificant .
But what ?
I had no idea .
And I kept on having no idea for a while .
I worked my heart out for Wes Clark , since I thought that he would be our strongest candidate in 2004 .
I talked to random people .
It obviously was n't enough , but it was all I could think of .
Then , in 2004 , I was asked to join Obsidian Wings .
It was an honor : at the time , ObWi was , for my money , the best blog that really tried to create a dialogue between liberals and conservatives .
And that was what I really wanted to do : to listen to people I disagreed with , to engage with them , and to try to show that it was possible to care deeply about politics without hating your opponents .
Being civil does n't mean you 're lukewarm , and being committed to your principles does n't mean you have to be hateful .
Being asked to write for the Washington Monthly was a further honor , and one that I never expected .
That said , it seems to me that the madness is over .
There are lots of people I disagree with , and lots of things I really care about , and even some people who seem to me to have misplaced their sanity , but the country as a whole does not seem to me to be crazy any more .
Also , it has been nearly five years since I started .
And so it seems to me that it 's time for me to turn back into a pumpkin and twelve white mice .
It has been wonderful , though .
I 've had the best co-bloggers I can imagine , both at ObWi and at the Monthly , and I 've learned an enormous amount from all the commenters .
This is one of the things I love most about blogging : I put something up , and suddenly all these wonderful , smart , and articulate people whom I 've never met pop up and start saying interesting things about it .
It 's a gift for which I will always be grateful .
Thanks to everyone .
( And , as I said , I will be here through Friday . )
Jim Bunning , the current Senator from Kentucky has decided not to run for reelection in 2010 , leaving an open field in both the Democratic and Republican primaries .
Rand Paul , the son of Congressman Ron Paul has decided to run for Senator Bunning ’s seat .
Rand Paul is not just a son of a Congressman following in his father ’s footsteps .
He has been very involved in Kentucky politics for the last 15 years .
He founded a group called Kentucky Taxpayers United in 1994 and has run the organization ever since .
Under Rand Paul ’s leadership , this organization has become very influential in influencing State legislators to push for lower taxes .
Rand Paul is a strong supporter of Austrian Economics as well .
Rand Paul is also a successful doctor , and understands the health care issue very , very well :
Dr. Paul ’s supporters are holding a moneybomb for his campaign tomorrow .
The recent moneybomb for Peter Schiff was successful –he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single day .
Tomorrow , Dr. Paul ’s supporters are hoping that his moneybomb can raise over $ 1 million –becoming the first Senate campaign to raise $ 1 million in a single day .
We can make this happen , but only if those who favor free markets are willing to invest a little money .
A small donation–even $ 10 will help Dr. Paul win what is sure to be an expensive primary battle .
For more information–or to donate , please visit either the official site of the moneybomb , or Dr. Paul ’s official campaign page .
The moneybomb page has plenty more YouTube clips of Dr. Paul speaking .

It appears that Microsoft is inching closer to completing its much - anticipated operating system ( OS ) , Windows 7 .
According to reports , the new OS should be headed to manufacturing in one week , on July 13th , just in time for the Worldwide Partner Conference ( WPC09 ) in New Orleans .
Tech blog Geeksmack has confirmed that Windows 7 will indeed be " Released to Manufacture , " otherwise known as RTM , a week from today .
However , the Redmond - based company plans to test the new operating system right up until the end , in an attempt to work out all of the kinks prior to July 13th .
MS Seeks Redemption over Vista Criticism
Microsoft has assured insiders that the version of Windows 7 headed to manufacture ( and retail by October 22 , 2009 ) will be smoother , quicker , and less bug - ridden than its predecessor , Windows Vista . ( Source : geeksmack.net )
As most of us are aware , this is a big step for Microsoft in its crusade to regain consumer confidence in the software market .
Opinions of the company spiraled downward after the 2007 release of Vista , which many felt was too slow , experienced too many compatibility issues with a slew of third - party products .
In short : Vista felt like a step backward from Windows XP , which many businesses and home users decided was a better fit for their uses .
In fact , many consumers to this day have chosen to use XP and wait for Windows 7 , which many hope will rectify the problems experienced since Vista 's launch two and a half years ago .
Several websites will be running their own tests of the Windows 7 RTM build when it 's shipped to manufacturing next week .
Reports suggest TechNet , MSDN , and several other yet unnamed sites will have their own copies of the OS on July 13th .
Win7 Ahead of Schedule
One of the most surprising parts of the RTM announcement is the date .
Previously , Microsoft had promised such a build by the end of July , meaning the RTM is at least a week or so ahead of schedule .
Many are floored by Microsoft 's energy on this one , given the company 's history of delays .
It just goes to show that Windows 7 is an exceptionally important product for the ubiquitous software firm , which should be stinging from the Vista criticism for a good long time .

A series of still images from a captured video sequence of a gigantic jet observed near Duke University .
The thunderstorm that produced this jet was about 200 miles away and is below the visible horizon .
Strokes of lightning flashing down towards the ground are a familiar sight during summer thunderstorms , but scientists have capture an image of a rare lightning bolt shooting out upwards from a cloud , almost to the edge of the Earth 's atmosphere .
These bolts of upwards lightning , one type among a variety of electrical discharges now known to occur above thunderstaorms , are called gigantic jets , and were only first discovered in 2001 .
Since then , only about 10 gigantic jets have been observed , said Steven Cummer , who was part of the team that photographed this most recent jet .
Gigantic jets are essentially the same as cloud - to - ground lightning , only they go the opposite way .
" Gigantic jets are literally lightning that comes out of the thunderclouds , but instead of going down , like most lightning strokes do , these apparently find their way out the tops of thunderclouds , and then keep going and keep going and keep going until they run into something that stops them , " Cummer explained .
The something that stops them is the ionosphere , the topmost layer of the Earth 's atmosphere ( right at the edge of space ) , which is made up of electrically charged atoms , or ions .
The observations , detailed Sunday in the online issue of the journal Nature Geoscience , confirm that gigantic jets transfer charge from clouds to the highest layers of the Earth 's atmosphere , just as their downwards cousins transfer it to the ground .
Lucky observation
Cummer and his colleagues observed the gigantic jet almost by accident .
They were set up to observe sprites and other unusual types of above - cloud lightning associated with Tropical Storm Cristobal on July 21 , 2008 .
Instead , they saw the whopper gigantic jet .
" We knew that there was a slim , slim chance that we would see something interesting , like a gigantic jet , but for sure we got lucky to be able to see that .
So we were pretty thrilled , " Cummer told LiveScience .
Also lucky where the simultaneous radio observations the team was making , which confirmed that gigantic jets are a conduit to move electric charge from the cloud .
" That 's what was telling us that at least in this gigantic jet , and probably in most , there actually is a lot of thundercloud charge that has moved from the thundercloud up to the top of the gigantic jet , " Cummer said .
Just as with cloud - to - ground lightning , the conduit travels away from the cloud first , and looks fairly faint .
When the stroke hits the conducting surface , whether ground or ionosphere , more charge can flow from the cloud and the lightning explodes with light .
Cloud escape
How exactly gigantic jets form and what kinds of storm conditions are necessary to produce them is still unknown .
Electric charge is of course built up in clouds by the motions of water and ice particles .
Lightning moves these charges around .
But why some lightning goes up and other bolts go down is n't known .
One theory is that high winds at the top of a cloud could nullify a charge layer that would otherwise stop the lightning , thereby allowing it to escape from the top of the cloud .
Because nothing else in the atmosphere can stop it until it hits the ionosphere , the lightning can travel about five to 10 times farther than cloud - to - ground lightning , reaching up to about 50 miles ( 80 km ) above Earth 's surface .
The thinness of the upper atmosphere also allows gigantic jets to travel much faster than cloud - to - ground lightning .
With every gigantic jet observation made , Cummer and others who study these powerful lightning bolts are hoping to learn more about the conditions that create them and what storms they should be looking for them in .
Researchers in Taiwan have seen gigantic jets sprouting from typhoons ( the name for tropical storms in the western Pacific ) , so these tropical cyclones seem to be good places to look for upwards lightning .
Scientific instruments are n't necessary to see gigantic jets .
If you 're far away enough from a storm so that your view is n't blocked by clouds , they can be seen ricocheting up through the atmosphere .
" They 're definitely bright enough and long - enough lasting to see , " Cummer said .
But this pioneering research also triggers unease about the limits of science and the inevitable fears about “ playing god , ” as well as raising the spectre that this technology could one day be abused to create a new generation of bioweapons .
When the nation won marriage equality last year , most pundits predicted that there would be pushback .
With a hotly debated social issue making such immense progress in such a short amount of time , it was bound to rattle the cages of the most extreme of opponents .
In a short time , we saw the rise of so - called “ religious - freedom ” bills , designed to exempt bigoted individuals and organizations from following the law of the land , and other legislative efforts designed to slow the inevitable .
This week , however , we thankfully witnessed some sharp resistance to that wave .
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday overturned an Alabama Supreme Court decision that effectively invalidated adoption by same - sex partners in that state .
The top court unanimously shot down the state court ’s finding , without even permitting a hearing on the merits of the case — a strong and resonating rebuke .
The basic right of a parent to be a parent should n’t be an issue that progressed to the highest court in the nation ; however , that it did illuminates the lengths opponents are eager to go to chip away at basic human rights .
However , that SCOTUS cleared the way , summarily and forcibly , for same - sex adoption illustrates that the pushback is not without its own opposition .
Likewise , LGBTs and allies are hailing the work of a coalition of Democratic state senators in Missouri who spent 39 hours filibustering a “ religious - freedom ” bill .
For nearly two days , the handful of senators waxed philosophical on the measure and even spiraled off on tangents about everything from fashion to cinema to run down the clock .
Unfortunately , Republicans ultimately forced a vote on the measure , which was approved 21 - 11 .
But the efforts of the long - talking lawmakers were praised state - and nationwide , with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon calling them “ heroic ” and LGBT and ally organizations across the country heralding their efforts .
Even though the bill passed that first hurdle , the lawmakers who took a stand against it exhibited the resilience that is needed to resist anti-LGBT pushback .
Discriminatory bills and court rulings will doubtlessly persist — but , if the foresight of the Supreme Court and the fortitude of the Missouri Democrats showed us anything , it ’s that there are people at the ready to push right back .
A great beer commercial from Australia .
Would you expect anything less from the Aussies ?
Beer is n’t just a beverage in Australia .
It ’s a golden elixir .
The lifeblood of the nation .
The liquid that makes life worth living .
So you ’d expect the Aussies to make great beer commercials .
This one is vaguely reminiscent of the Bud Light ’s True Men of Genius campaign , but much bigger , much wackier , much funnier .
That being said , we do n’t understand some of the Aussie slang in the commercial , but guessing makes it even funnier .
Perhaps some of our Aussie readers could explain the meaning of “ The Azzas , ” “ Blokes Punching above their weight ” ( we think that one might mean , “ Guys with women they do n’t deserve ” ) , “ Meat Tray Winners ” and “ Cashed Up Bogans . ”
Enjoy .

Scala has been receiving much attention lately as a possible candidate to replace Java in the future .
James Strachan creator of Groovy advocates in favor of Scala as James Gosling , creator of Java and Charles Nutter JRuby Core Developer , have done in the past .
James first explains the things he does n’t like about Java :
Java is a surprisingly complex language ( the spec is 600 pages and does anyone really grok generics in Java ? ) , with its autoboxing ( and lovely NPE 's hiding in there ) , primitive types , icky arrays which are not collections & general lack of polymorphism across strings / text / buffers / collections / arrays along with extremely verbose syntax for working with any kind of data structure & bean properties and still no closures ( even in JDK7 ) which leads to tons of icky try / catch / finally crapola unless you use frameworks with new custom APIs & yet more complexity .
Java even has type inference , it just refuses to use it to let us save any typing / reading .
This issue becomes even more pressing with there being no Java7 ( which is even more relevant after Snorcle - I wonder if javac is gonna be replaced with jdkc ? :) .
So I guess javac has kinda reached its pinacle ; closures look unlikely as does any kind of simplification or progression .
He seems impressed by Scala to the point of saying that he would n’t have created Groovy in the first place , if Scala was available back then :
I can honestly say if someone had shown me the Programming in Scala book by by Martin Odersky , Lex Spoon & Bill Venners back in 2003 I 'd probably have never created Groovy .
There are of course parts of Scala that he ’s “ not keen on ” :
With any language there 's gonna be bits you love and bits you 're not so keen on .
Early impressions of Scala do seem like there 's a bit of an attempt to use a few too many symbols :-; but you do n't have to use them all - you can stick to the Java-ish OO side of the fence if you like .
But then I guess longer term its probably better to use symbols for the ' special stuff ' to avoid clashing with identifiers etc .
I 'm not a massive fan of the nested import statement , using _root_.java.util .
List to differentiate a ' global ' import from a relative import .
I 'd have preferred a child prefix .
e.g. if you have imported com.acme.cheese.model .
Foo then to import model.impl .
FooImpl i'd prefer an explicit relative prefix , say : import _.impl .
FooImpl which would simplify things a little and more in keeping with Scala 's attempt at simplifying things and removing cruft ( being polymorphic to import java.util ._ ) .
In any case , James overall opinion about Scala is far better than Java’s :
However compared to all the massive hairy warts in Java , these downsides of Scala are tiny compared to the beauty , simplicity and power of Scala .
As Adam Bien has reported in his blog , even the father of Java , James Gosling seems favorable towards Scala :
During a meeting in the Community Corner ( java.net booth ) with James Gosling , a participant asked an interesting question : " Which Programming Language would you use * now * on top of JVM , except Java ? " .
The answer was surprisingly fast and very clear : - Scala .
Charles Nutter , JRuby Core Developer thinks that Scala is most likely candidate to replace Java , compared to Groovy and JRuby :
Scala , it must be stated , is the current heir apparent to the Java throne .
No other language on the JVM seems as capable of being a " replacement for Java " as Scala , and the momentum behind Scala is now unquestionable .
While Scala is not a dynamic language , it has many of the characteristics of popular dynamic languages , through its rich and flexible type system , its sparse and clean syntax , and its marriage of functional and object paradigms .
The supposed weakness of Scala as being " too complicated " or " too rich " can be countered by developing coding standards , creating more robust editors and tools , and by better educating polyglots on how best to use Scala .
Scala represents the rebirth of static - typed languages on the JVM , and like JRuby it has also begun to stretch the capabilities of the platform in ways Java never could .
Scala was one of the main themes in this year ’s JavaOne , with several related sessions and even an open space conference which followed the last day of the main conference .
What do you think , is Scala the most suitable contender to take Java ’s place in the near future or is Java the Last Big Language ( LBL ) ?
Erik Naggum was the first person I killfiled in GNUS .
His style was sometimes shockingly blunt and aggressive .
After a while , though , I realized I was missing out , and I came to treasure the information and insight in his messages .
I learned yesterday that Erik died .
I 'm sorry to hear it ; I occasionally contacted him to clarify or expand on some technical matter he wrote about in the past , and he was always helpful .
I thought I would just be able to do that whenever I wanted , but now it 's too late .
His death has , not surprisingly , led some people to go through the same initial experience I had , seeing some blunt and shocking language and wondering why anyone would care about its author .
Here are some links that I hope show a small part of Erik 's contributions to knowledge .

I ’ve been making my own cheese and butter over here in Germany .
( Yes , I know that sounds horribly perverted ) .
But really , it ’s interesting and a lot of fun .
So , here ’s how to do them both ; cook and enjoy at your own risk .
This is the first in a few how - to’s .
Check out the latest on how to make homemade soda ! or Eggnog !
Simple Farmers Cheese :
Get some whole milk ( about a liter … or a quart if you ’re from the US ) .
Boil it in a pot until little bubbles appear on the side .
Add vinegar or lemon juice to the milk ( about 4 tablespoons ) .
The milk should turn into curds and whey .
This should happen fairly quickly ; if it does n’t wait a minute and add a little more lemon juice or vinegar until it turns into curds and whey .
( Wondering what to do with the whey ?
Click here .
It ’s an article from 1910 from the New York Times .
Saying that the whey is a most refreshing drink served chilled and with a bit of nutmeg .
Personally I think it tastes like a horses ass , but one must try for themselves ) .
Take a strainer and line it with a cheese cloth if you have one , and if not a crap load of paper towels works just fine .
Wrap up the curds in and squeeze them a bit , and then tie it to a stick or a large cooking spoon .
Let this dangle over a pot for about a half an hour or an hour or so .
By the end you should just have the cheese .
Add a bit of salt ( it really helps the flavor ) any herbs or spices you want .
I did a garlic one that tasted really well ( a bit of olive oil mixed with pure garlic ) .
You can eat it right away or wait a day or two for it to age .
It should last a week or so and when it ’s not good anymore it should be pretty obvious .
There ’s some photos below of the process .
How to make butter is below the pictures .
EAT !
For an even simpler cheese you could just put some yogurt in a cheese cloth or some towels and strain that .
It ’ll give you a really light yogurt cheese .
If you get really into it you can make some more elaborate cheeses like cheddar , Parmesan , or mozzarella .
You ’ll need to by some enzymes though ( renet is the enzyme you ’re looking for ) .
You can get these at a specialty shop or order them online .
For some cheese recipes go here or here .
How to make butter .
This man down here does a better job at explaining the whole process than I ever well .
Enjoy watching .
He ’s crazy .
Obama ’s Ramadan message to the Muslim world is a kind of Hallmark card in video :
Once again , Obama demonstrates how to communicate your way out of a “ clash of civilizations . ”
Attention to how your words will translate : phrases like “ mutual interest ” and “ mutual respect ” are single words with enhanced meaning in Arabic .
Cultural awareness : not only do your words translate , but also do your ideas .
Common ground : agreement instead of apocalyptic threats .
The emphasis on ending Iraq , isolating extremists , and the two - state solution is not accidental .
Neither is the repetition of the “ listening ” meme at the end .
Obama ’s message is a brief bit of propaganda for peacemaking — not as big as his Cairo speech , but a necessary part of the process .
The Obama administration is working with Congress to mandate that all Medicare payments be tied to " quality metrics . "
But an analysis of this drive for better health care reveals a fundamental flaw in how quality is defined and metrics applied .
In too many cases , the quality measures have been hastily adopted , only to be proven wrong and even potentially dangerous to patients .
Health - policy planners define quality as clinical practice that conforms to consensus guidelines written by experts .
The guidelines present specific ...
Best known as Arrested Development ’s Buster Bluth , Tony Hale currently stars in CTRL , a web series that follows a guy named Stuart , an introverted office drone who one day spills tea on his keyboard and discovers that it has supernatural powers .
The ten - episode series , which concludes today , is based on Rob Kirbyson ’s short film CTRL Z , which also starred Hale and screened at Sundance in 2008 .
Vulture spoke to Hale about the series , his role in next month ’s The Informant ! , and the Arrested Development movie .
What drew you to the CTRL project ?
It was a very simple idea of a guy who was kind of a loner in an office , and it ’s just an everyday experience , and then this very supernatural thing of a magical keyboard comes into it .
And it did n’t have a lot of bells and whistles .
When you think of sci - fi , you think of Battlestar Galactica or really sci- fi things .
This was just a simple thing and this magical thing was brought into it .
I just kind of liked that .
Have you ever worked in an office ?
Yeah .
I lived in New York for nine years and when I first moved there , I temped .
I temped and cater - waitered and I ’d do both and I ’d have to go to a new office each day and , oh , man .
You ’re always the guy that ’s brought in if somebody ’s sick and if you do n’t know anybody you just sort of sit there and everybody ’s kind of looking at you like , “ Who ’s the new kid ? ” and all you really care about is if they have a good cafeteria and if you get a discount .
What ’s the appeal of doing something web - based ?
What was the greatest challenge ?
I was telling somebody just the other day , there ’s technically such a hierarchy in this business .
You have film , that ’s the ideal ; then you have TV , and things like web series do not claim as much cred , but the fact is , if the material is solid and I believe and trust in the team that ’s involved , I do n’t care what format it is .
I always admire people who do commercials because they have to put together a beginning , a middle , and an end in 30 seconds .
It was definitely shot like any other single - camera show , but we really had to get a lot of story in a very little amount of time .
So I think that was probably the biggest challenge .
You ’re in Steven Soderbergh ’s The Informant !
next month .
What can you tell us about your role ?
I play Matt Damon ’s lawyer in the second half of the movie .
It ’s just a crazy story of this guy who pulled one over on both the FBI and the company he was working for , Mark Whitacre .
And to work with Steven Soderbergh was just a dream .
And the story is so crazy that he hired a lot of actors who typically do comedy , not for us to make it funnier but just for us to add our quirky essence .
There was one time when were all sitting around a table with Matt Damon , and all these comic actors were there and we were all silent , and Matt made a comment like “ Are n’t you guys comic actors ?
No one ’s talking .
Why is that ? ”
And Paul F. Tompkins is across the table from him and he goes , “ ’ Cause we ’re not supposed to be here . ”
And everybody just goes , “ Yeah , ” like , “ We do n’t know why we ’re here . ”
Can you give us an update on the Arrested Development movie ?
I talked to Mitch [ Hurwitz ] about a week and a half ago , and he ’s in the middle of writing it .
Everybody ’s onboard and I think right now it ’s just a matter of getting everybody ’s schedule on the same page .
And then just finishing the script .
Well , we ca n’t wait .
It ’ll be interesting to see what type of prosthesis you ’ll be given .
What did you do to prepare for having a hook ?
You know , that ’s what ’s exciting about that show .
Every single week you would get the script and you ’d be like , “ Oh , your hand ’s coming off and it ’s gonna be eaten by a seal , ” or “ Oh , Liza Minelli ’s gonna be your love interest . ”
Everything was such a surprise that there really was n’t a lot time for preparation .
You were just kind of thrown in , like , “ Here ’s your hook , and sometimes you might have a mannequin hand . ”
Did you ever hurt yourself with it ?
No , but I had to be careful .
I think it started out really sharp and I was like , “ You might want to dull up this hook because God knows who I ’m gonna stab . ”
And I remember it had this little pulley system in it where I ’d pull and the hook would grab things .
And since you mentioned it , how was it having Liza as a love interest ?
Fantastic .
She is such a gracious person .
One time she took my wife and me out to lunch and told us stories about her life and her mom , who she adored .
We got to see her in concert when she came out to L.A. once and she was just amazing .
We bet …
And I got to kiss her , which was exciting .
How was that ?
Great !
Please — that ’s a once - in - a - lifetime experience .
It was awesome .
I have often been called out on this site for not being a partisan Democrat , and it is true , I am an anarchist , who often finds himself in sympathy with many leftist views , such as universal health care , but who is utterly disguisted with the emerging consensus supporting the ongoing escalation of the American wars in Central Asia .
At a certain distance from the American political discourse , the supposedly opposing positions of the two parties often appear indistinguishable , especially in foreign policy .
Everybody wants to bomb something , but the target list is different .
Bill Clinton bombed Serbia and Iraq , George W. Bush bombed Afghanistan and Iraq , McCain wants to bomb Iran and Samantha Powers wants to bomb Sudan , but bombs are bombs and tear human flesh apart the same way .
Nation building occupations have now been accepted by both sides as practicable and positively good .
The Obama Pentagon is just as repugnant to me as the Bush Pentagon , in part because the same exact people , from Robert Gates to David Petreaus to Cheney 's assassination ring commander Stanley McChrystal , have been put in charge by Obama and the same policies have been maintained .
In fact , in Afghanistan , Obama appears to be going beyond the Bush administration , doubling the number of troops , increasing airstrikes in Pakistani territory , launching new bloody offensives , and there is no end in sight .
In fact , further escalation at this point seems inevitable , and the Democratic Senate has just voted 93 - 1 to increase the size of the US Army by another 30,000 troops , who will be sent into the Afghan meat grinder as soon as they are out of basic training .
This increase is unfunded , so Obama will have to get an emergency spending bill to pay for it , a Bush era approach that Obama had previously condemned but has continued .
Predictably , opposition to the return to misleading permanent emergency funding of the current wars drew opposition only from Antiwar.com and some left wing bloggers ( not the staunchly loyalist DailyKos ) .
Of course , all the accounting gimmicks cannot obfuscate the fact that despite some cosmetic cutbacks ( 7 less F - 22s will be built ) , the Pentagon budget has increased under Obama , and will continue to do so as the Afghan war becomes increasingly massive and expensive .
If you thought supplying 150,000 troops in Iraq through the Persian Gulf and Turkey was expensive , you can double that for keeping a force of that size in Afghanistan supplied via overland routes stretching thousands of miles through Pakistan and Russia .
Speaking of Russia , Biden is over in Georgia now , reassuring the Georgian dictator , who exists solely on American support and aid , that the US stands behind Georgia on its continued course of confrontation with Russia .
Recent American military maneuvers in Georgia and hints regarding American willingness to sell heavy weaponry to Georgia underscore the point .
On a previous stop in the Ukraine , Biden stated explicitly that the US would not any zone of influence for Russia in its immediate neighborhood .
Such zones of influence must remain one of America ’s unique prerogatives as the world ’s hyperpower , but as always , Joe puts it best : " We recognize no sphere of influence , or no ability of any other nation to veto the choices an independent nation makes as to with whom and under what conditions they will associate . "
( Emphasis mine ) .
I guess this is why the US keeps arresting Iranian diplomats in Iraq , because this principle only applies to " other " nations .
America ’s real policy toward Russia was humorously encapsulated in a recent gaffe .
Hillary Clinton presented Russian President with a button mechanism marked " Reset " in English and its equivalent in Russian .
Apart from the fact that only to the Americans would such a juvenile gimmick seem appropriate and that all the Russians were visibly wincing , the translation into Russian had been botched .
Instead of reading " reset , " the button read " overload . "
But she did n’t hand out cowboy hats and boots , and this seems to be the main distinction between Bush and Obama ’s policy toward Russia .
And yet , there is no opposition to the escalation in Afghanistan or the continuation of other American bellicose policies .
A 93 - 1 vote seems pretty conclusive to me , the Democrats are behind Obama and Republicans love spending money on war , so who 's complaining ( the solitary dissenter was Russ Feingold , who wants more cutbacks in Iraq ) .
Furthermore , observing the diary activity on the DailyKos , it is clear that the vast majority is prepared to continue supporting Obama 's militaristic policies .
After all , he told us during the campaign that he was going to escalate Afghanistan , so what 's the problem ?
So where does that leave the marginals who continue to desire peace above all ?
Looking around the political spectrum , we begin to realize that the only other group that will stand with us in opposing the wars are the libertarians and various paranoid right wingers afraid of growing government and international entanglements ( affectionately referred to as Paultards here ) .
This thinking informs the American Conservative article , which attacks long time Obama ally Samantha Powers for being a war hawk , although her reasons are humanitarian and not neocon / geopolitical in nature .
She wants US intervention for human rights , she hails the brutal bombing of the Serbian people in the 1990s and wants to see the same tactics deployed against the Sudan , and other human rights violators .
Doubtless , the article was published mainly because it attacked an Obama Administration official , but the person who wrote it is closer to me than any Democrat who would support any American assault on countries posing no threat to the US .
This expose of American imperialist hubris contained in the article could have easily come from the pen of Noam Chomsky , or even from some of the last leftist antiwar figures who are still palatable to the mainstream pro war Democratic majority , such as Glenn Greenwald .
Already , people on the DailyKos are turning on Greenwald because of his increasingly strident outrage regarding the Obama Administration ’s continuation of Bush ear torture and detention policies , which the consensus here defends as alternatively necessary or accidental .
If Greenwald keeps going down this path , how long until he is relegated to the ranks of " anti American " fringe cooks like Noam Chomsky , and deleted from the leftist blogroll .
So what is to be done when the Democrats and the Republicans present a united pro war front , and seek to marginalize those of us who continue to point out the insanity of America 's ongoing wars and the war crimes being committed in the process ?
As right wing opposition gradually grows stronger as more and more right wingers take on the anti war position as a way to criticize Obama and the Democrats , will the marginalized left wing anti war forces stand by and let the movement be redefined as a conservative opposition movement in the vein of conservative opposition to FDR 's bringing the US into the Second World War ?
Or can an apolitical ant war movement transcend the fairly arbitrary American political dualism ( for the life of me I can't tell the centrists apart - though the bomb throwers on both sides do come off different even if they both throw their bombs in the service of the same regime and the bombs seem to always land on brown people in the Third World who happen to be sitting on some natural resources ) .
The same dynamic , incidentally , is in play also in the domestic counterpart to America ’s militarism abroad , the internal police state .
There are those on both the left and the right who stand against the increasingly militarized police forces , in their zero tolerance rampage , packing our prisons with millions of our countrymen .
Those on the right oppose it because they think it ’s the prelude to a coming totalitarian regime , and those on the left oppose it because of civil rights considerations and the obvious racism and classism of the police state .
Those on the left think the right wing opponents are paranoid militia wackos , and those on the right think the left wing opponents are bleeding hearts or reverse racists or some such thing .
As a result , both sides of the opposition remain marginalized , as the center continues to expand the police forces , pass more draconian sentencing laws , and build more prisons .
I know that for the people here , the political divisions are very significant , and an alliance with libertarian forces is out of the question , in contradiction to Barack Obama ’s own favored approach of seeking out such areas of agreement in order to come together as a nation .
Bipartisanship is acceptable on war funding bills , but not on war opposition , it appears .
But at what point do our duty to humanity and the absolute moral imperative to oppose butchers as they systematically cleave their way across the globe transcend American domestic politics and link all of the people opposed to war together , regardless of their other political positions ?
Is the construct of the American two party system so strong as to override such moral concerns ?
Are the psychological barriers created within us by systematic indoctrination dividing the people into warring camps too great to overcome , even while the actual disagreements between the camps largely come down to symbolic issues and 93 - 1 votes to expand the wars ?
Because if they are , the anti war movement in American will remain impotent and marginal , as the militarists intend it to be , and the world will continue to tremble under the boot of the American " liberators . "

An important struggle is brewing on the Isle of Wight : we all need to take note , both of what has happened so far ( and the lessons we can learn from it ) ; and the possibilities in the coming weeks .
A factory , the only remaining manufacturer of wind - farm turbines in the UK , is due to be closed by its owners , Vestas , who are making all 500 workers redundant .
The company , like so many of those making redundancies at the moment , is using the recession as cover for cuts which are motivated by nothing other than ordinary cost cutting .
Jobs are being moved to the USA .
But this is not only about jobs .
News of the planned closure has also ignited outrage in the movement against climate change .
When we should be converting to an economy based on renewable , low - carbon energy , the closure of the Vestas factory is just what does n’t need to happen .
So Vestas is not just a class fight – though it is that .
It is a class fight which raises issues of climate change , and the tension between capitalist production , and social production .
Workers are now discussing occupying one of the two sites on the Isle of Wight , and need the support of workers and climate change campaigners everywhere .
The green shoots of militancy
Despite dictatorial management and unsafe working conditions , Vestas workers have never been organised in a union .
But when Workers Climate Action activists heard of the planned closure it was mid June , and the spectre of the Visteon occupations still loomed large .
Would it be possible to encourage Vestas workers to draw lessons from the struggles at Visteon ?
Would it be possible to encourage these workers to take similarly militant action ?
Workers Climate Action members made contacts on the island through union networks and using the internet .
They travelled to the island , and begun to talk to workers outside factory gates , finding bitterness , but resignation .
Slowly , they began to agitate and gather contacts , built a meeting in conjunction with the trades council , and are living on the island , cooperating with groups of workers who are now considering an occupation .
Read a report here .
It is worth stopping briefly to emphasise how exceptional this is – at least in the current environment .
Revolutionaries generally assume that it is the ‘ job ’ of the unions to directly organise and inspire workers , and their job to ‘ intervene ’ through propaganda when ( inevitably , almost ) , the union vacillates , or directly turns against workers .
But – though nothing at all is certain – it is clear already that progress has been made beyond what most would have dared hope .
The member of Workers Climate Action and AWL who has been most closely involved in organising on the island also drew other lessons .
“ This has really been a lesson in the importance of left unity .
It ’s been really useful to have support from Jonathan Neale , a member of the SWP who had been involved in hospital occupations during the ‘ 70s , and members of the SWP and Socialist Party who have begun to make contact with workers at the Vestas warehouse in Southampton where turbine blades are stored . ”
What the movement needs to do
So far , what has been done is impressive .
Nothing is now certain , everything is possible .
Send a message of solidarity to the Vestas workers : savevestas@googlemail.com
Activists with workplace organising experience , particularly with experience at occupations , are particularly and urgently needed over the next week or two .
It is less than three hours from London to the Isle of Wight ( though you are advised to book the ferry in advance ) , and basic accommodation is available there .
Get in touch with Ed on the Isle of Wight 07775 763750 if you think you may be able to help .
If you would be prepared to join an occupation , be prepared for alerts at short notice .
Write to us at uncaptiveminds@gmail.com with your mobile number and stating if you ’d be up for joining an occupation or helping in any other way .
If you are near Southampton , get in touch with Ed ( number above ) if you would be able to help organising there .
Vestas also lists ‘ sales ’ sites in Warrington on its website .
Please get in touch if you may be able to visit the Warrington site to talk to workers there .
Solidarity with workers at Vestas !
Liverpool striker Fernando Torres has signed a new contract which could see him stay at Anfield until 2014 .
Spain star could stay with Reds until 2014
Liverpool 's Fernando Torres has signed a contract extension which could see the striker stay at Anfield until 2014 .
The Spain star agreed the improved deal in May , but he has now put pen - to - paper ahead of the Reds ' Premier League season opener at Tottenham on Sunday .
Torres was already under contract on Merseyside for six years after signing from Atletico Madrid in a record - breaking move in 2007 .
The new deal includes an option for a further year 's extension which could see the 25 - year - old stay with the Reds until 2014 .
Manager Rafa Benitez said : " Fernando is one of the best strikers in the game and , at his age , can only get better .
" Every major side would want him in their team , but he has shown how much he wants to achieve success at Liverpool by committing his future to the club .
" He 's a special talent , but still has the hunger to improve his game . "
Torres struggled with injuries last season , but in his maiden campaign in England he became the first Liverpool player since Robbie Fowler in 1995 / 96 to score more than 20 league goals .
Former corporate whiz kid Robert McNamara was the controversial Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations , during the height of the Vietnam War .
This Academy Award - winning documentary , augmented by archival footage , gives the conflicted McNamara a platform on which he attempts to confront his and the U.S. government 's actions in Southeast Asia in light of the horrors of modern warfare , the end of ideology and the punitive judgment of history .

If you 've used bash for a while you probably know that the commands you enter are saved in the file ~/. bash_history when you log out .
Next time you log in , bash automatically loads these history commands from the saved file and you can then use the up and down arrow keys to browse your command history and find the command you want rather than re-entering it .
However , there are more effective ways to use bash 's history : you can use Ctrl+R ( Control key held down at the same time as the R key ) .
This will display the following in your shell :
( reverse - i- search ) ` ' :
If you know type some substring found in the command you 're searching for , for example " ls " , bash will search for matching commands .
For example , it might show :
( reverse - i- search ) `ls ' : lsof -nP -p 3930
What it actually shows is going to be dependent on the commands you 've previously entered .
When you do this , bash looks for the last command that you entered that contains the substring " ls " , in my case that was " lsof ... " .
If the command that bash finds is what you 're looking for , just hit Enter to execute it .
You can also edit the command to suit your current needs before executing it ( use the left and right arrow keys to move through it ) .
If you 're looking for a different command , hit Ctrl+R again to find a matching command further back in the command history .
You can also continue to type a longer substring to refine the search , since searching is incremental .
Note that the substring you enter is searched for throughout the command , not just at the beginning of the command .
A new Open Source BitTorrent tracker set to be released in September promises to boost download speeds by up to 150 % and decrease the load BitTorrent users put on ISP networks by 20 to 50 percent .
Based on the widely used OpenTracker software , the new BitTorrent tracker aims to overcome many of BitTorrent 's current limitations .
Since it was first released by Bram Cohen back in 2001 , very few changes have been made to the way BitTorrent works .
It was a revolutionary invention and to date it is by far the most effective way to transfer large files online .
However , BitTorrent does have its limitations .
On the one hand users sometimes complain about slow download speeds , but most of all , Internet providers are not always happy with the heavy load BitTorrent transfers put on their networks .
The Swedish based company Peerialism hopes to tackle these problems and make BitTorrent future proof .
Aside from their issues with GGF , they are currently working on the release of a new Open Source BitTorrent tracker based on the OpenTracker software currently in use at most of the larger public BitTorrent trackers .
Andreas Dahlström , the CTO and founder of the company explained to TorrentFreak that the key to solving BitTorrent ’s main problems is to make the tracker location aware , so that peers first try to share files with other peers that are closer to them .
“ In standard BitTorrent the tracker chooses a totally random number of peers for you .
There are some good reasons for this since random actually gives some nice and robust network properties but in many cases this will force you to download for peers far away from you , ” Dahlström said .
“ This has two effects : slower download speed and unnecessary network traffic for the ISPs .
And since BitTorrent traffic causes so much problems for ISPs many use traffic shaping , causing even slower download speeds , ” he explained .
The solution to this problem according to Dahlström is to make the tracker select peers more intelligently , based on their geographical location .
The initial tests of this new methodology are very promising , as they result in faster download speeds for BitTorrent users , and less traffic going outside the ISPs network .
“ We have built p2 p algorithms which actually map the entire Internet .
We can use this to let a BitTorrent Tracker assign you to the peers closest to you .
The effect for the downloader is 30 - 150 % faster downloads and 20 - 50 % less traffic for the ISPs , ” Dahlström told TorrentFreak .
Peerialism localizes local peers
This sounds like a classic win-win situation .
If it ’s implemented by most of the leading BitTorrent trackers , ISPs will have less trouble handling BitTorrent traffic and thus less incentive to slow it down .
On the other hand , BitTorrent users will see a boost in their download speeds .
There is a minor drawback to the plan though .
The new trackers will use more CPU and memory , which means that more power is required than with the current setup .
This means that the people who run the trackers will have to invest in new hardware .
“ We work hard to together with Ergeist [ the creator of the original OpenTracker software ] to minimize the extra load , ” Dahlström said .
“ We do believe the extra resources are well spent compared to the improved download speeds and less ISP traffic . ”
If Peerialism can deliver what they are promising , their new tracker will be one of the most significant advancements to BitTorrent in years .
Although they are not the first to come up with the idea of location based peer allocation , some might remember P4P , the solution they offer is superior since it requires no changes to the existing BitTorrent clients .
In addition , Peerialism is already working together with the developer behind the most widely used BitTorrent tracker software currently in use by The Pirate Bay , OpenBitTorrent and PublicBitTorrent trackers .
Thus , they are as close to the fire as they can be .
The Open Source tracker , currently codenamed OpenTracker 2.0 , is set to be released in September .
If some of the larger trackers decide to use it we might see a huge drop in Global Internet traffic instantly , along with faster download speeds for most BitTorrent users .

… if you drive a BMW or a Mercedes Benz , or wear Armani jeans or Patagonia shirts , you could be consuming hemp .
Its fiber turns up in car door panels , insulation and clothing .
Its seeds make tasty granola and frozen desserts , its oil expensive cosmetics and ecologically friendly soap .
If you use these products , you wo n’t be jailed for possession .
But would - be hemp farmers ’ fear of arrest is what keeps the U.S. importing the stuff instead of growing its own .
[ Bloomberg ]
Remind me why hemp is illegal to grow in the U.S. : I do n't write about hemp often , mainly because it 's not actually a drug , but it bears repeating that the only reason hemp cultivation is illegal is because a bunch of paranoid drug warriors are utterly terrified of it .
As stupid as the arguments against legalizing marijuana are , the case against hemp is even more mindless and pathetic .
Just pause for a moment and think about the fact that the DEA banned a substance used to make door panels for luxury cars , simply because it 's related to marijuana .
That level of marijuana hysteria probably would n’t be possible in the current political climate , but we 're stuck with it until Congress admits this is ridiculous .
And I guarantee you that if Congress attempts to legalize hemp cultivation in the U.S. , there will actually be people who freak out about it and try to argue that hemp somehow endangers America 's youth .

Are dogs man ’s best friend ?
Dogs see man as their leader , as their partner , and as their teacher , and because dogs place so much trust in man , he cannot help but love them as if they were his best friend .

So it remains to this day , that man needs dogs and they need man .

If you want to imbue a discussion with an air of gravitas , you start by identifying the main character by his full name : George Herman Ruth .
Dwight David Eisenhower .
Homer Jay Simpson .
So consider the case of one William Joseph Buckner , who almost two decades ago ( the precise anniversary is Wednesday , Oct. 25 ) bent over to field a grounder hit by Mookie Wilson .
We all know what happened after that -- you 've seen the video a few jillion times , you 've read about the scapegoating , and the subsequent reaction to the scapegoating .
After 20 years of scrutiny under the electron microscope of modern media , the Buckner play has been dissected so thoroughly that you pretty well know everything about it .
Well , almost everything .
It 's not often that a new chapter can be added to a story that 's been told so many times , especially two decades down the road .
But that 's what Uni Watch has for you today -- a bona fide addition to the historical record of the most infamous error in World Series history , courtesy of a sharp - eyed photo editor and a 12 - year - old kid , both of whom spotted what a generation of baseball historians had missed .
And this new find goes a long way toward explaining what happened on the field that night at Shea Stadium .
The tale begins with ESPN.com photo czar Sean Hintz , who was recently cropping and sizing a photo for an article about the Buckner play 's 20th anniversary .
The best - known photos of the incident are probably this one and this one , but Hintz chose to use the following Associated Press photo , which ran with this story :
As you can see , it shows Billy Buck walking off the field after his historic miscue , and he has removed his first baseman 's mitt from his right hand .
" I 'd worked with that photo maybe half a dozen times in the past , " Hintz says .
" It 's definitely one of my go - to shots for that play . "
This time , though , for whatever reason , Hintz noticed that Buckner was wearing a batting glove under his mitt .
Nothing unusual about that -- lots of first basemen do it .
But Hintz , perhaps influenced by having worked on too many Uni Watch columns , was curious about what was printed on the glove .
So he zoomed in on it .
Then he zoomed some more .
Take a look at what he found :
That 's right : What Hintz spotted -- and what Uni Watch and countless other researchers had missed over the years -- was that Bill Buckner was wearing a Chicago Cubs batting glove under his first baseman 's mitt .
( And no , that 's not a Photoshop job -- it 's the real deal . )
The poor Red Sox .
It 's bad enough they were saddled with one curse ; they did n't know they were actually fighting two of them .
No wonder Buckner missed that ball .
He never had a chance .
And it gets better .
An examination of Buckner 's at - bats from that game shows that he was wearing dark Franklin gloves while hitting .
So apparently he went out of his way to wear the white Cubs - branded glove in the field .
Sharp - memoried fans will recall that Buckner had previously played for the Cubs , but he had been traded to the Red Sox in May 1984 .
Why would he still be wearing Cubs gear more than two years later ?
More importantly , why would he tempt fate by commingling baseball 's two most famously star - crossed franchises ?
It 's like being inside a house made of kerosene - soaked newspaper and then saying , " Hmmm , it 's a little dark in here .
Lemme just light this match "
Whatever the explanation , it 's not going to come from Buckner , who is understandably weary of discussing the play .
When approached by a Uni Watch intermediary , he declined to comment , saying , " I 'm all ' 86ed out . "
But wait , Bill , we do n't want to rehash every gory detail -- we just want to know about the batting glove !
To which one William Joseph Buckner replied : " I did n't even realize I was wearing it . "
End of discussion .
Buckner , by all accounts , is a class act who deserves better than the role in which history has cast him .
So it pains Uni Watch to say this , but his disavowal does n't ring true .
After a bit of additional photo research , Sean Hintz turned up this photo , which shows Buckner 's Cubs - clad hand in 1985 game -- more than a year prior to the Mookie Wilson grounder :
Look how beat - up the glove looks , and then compare that to the World Series shot above .
Looks like the same well - worn , loved - to - death gauntlet , no ?
Face it , you do n't hold on to a glove like that over the course of two seasons unless it means something to you -- something special .
Do n't buy it ?
Then ask yourself this : Would Buckner really have gone out of his way to find more than one Cubs glove to wear while playing for the Sox ?
The obvious conclusion : This was Bill Buckner 's lucky glove .
Not .
Whatever the glove 's double - whammy properties , the most amazing thing about it is that it went unnoticed for 20 years .
Uni Watch has approached a slew of researchers and historians over the past week , none of whom was aware of Buckner 's double - cursed right hand .
Uni Watch then queried the membership of the Society for American Baseball Research -- again , a big whiff .
The enormity of the scoop was confirmed when Uni Watch consulted uniform designer Todd Radom , a passionate BoSox fan whose knowledge of historical logo - related arcana dwarfs Uni Watch 's own .
" I remember where I was when this happened ( of course ) but have never noted the Cubs detail , " he responded .
" Partners in misery indeed ! "
Even Rusty Kennedy , the Associated Press photographer who took the photo , was unaware of what he had documented .
" It 's funny , the photo has been published so often , but I never noticed the batting glove , " says Kennedy , who still works for the AP .
" If it were shot today , it would be digital and you could blow it up and study it all different ways , but in those days it was pretty superficial , because you just looked at the print .
I 'll bet I would have noticed it given another 20 years , though . "
As it turns out , the only other person who did notice the glove -- or at least the only one whose observation is part of the public record -- was 12 - year - old Kevin Mahon , the son of Philadelphia Daily News sports reporter Tom Mahon .
The evidence , turned up via a LexisNexis search , is in a very small item that the elder Mahon wrote in October 2003 , the key passage of which reads as follows :
" While leafing through the book Greatest Moments in Sports History , published by Sports Illustrated , Kevin Mahon ( son of yours truly ) noticed a picture showing Buckner -- a former Cub -- walking off the field after that fateful error during the 1986 World Series .
On his right hand he is wearing a batting glove .
And while the photo is not crystal clear , there appears to be a red - white - and - blue logo on the glove with four letters : C - U - B - S . "
But Mahon 's story was tiny and understated ( a charge that will never be leveled at Uni Watch 's treatment of the topic ) , had no accompanying photo , and was buried at the bottom of a hurriedly assembled column , so it was the journalistic equivalent of a tree falling in the forest with nobody around to hear it .
" We got no response from it -- none , " says Tom Mahon .
" Anyway , Kevin 's the one who put two and two together in terms of the double curse .
I would n't even have thought of that . "
Kevin Mahon , now 15 , had n't even been born when Mookie Wilson stepped into the batter 's box back in 1986 .
But he was familiar with the Buckner play and understood its place in baseball history .
" I remember seeing a TV show about it , " he says .
" And I thought , ' Wow , how could he miss that ? ' "
He answered his own question when he found that Greatest Moments in Sports History book at a flea market in October of 2003 .
The Boston and Chicago curses were both fresh in his mind , because Aaron Boone and Steve Bartman had just become household names .
So when he saw the Cubs logo on Buckner 's glove , everything clicked into place .
He showed it to his dad , and that 's how it ran , however sotto voce , in the Philly Daily News .
And just how did a 12 - year - old manage to spot what everyone else had overlooked ?
" I do n't know , " says Kevin .
" I get interested in things sometimes . "
Spoken like a true uni watcher .
Kevin Patrick Mahon -- welcome to the club .
Follow - Up Roundup
Turns out that last column 's NHL season preview had a few omissions , so Uni Watch offers the following addenda :
• The Devils are wearing a 25th - anniversary patch ( here 's a closer look ) .
• The Panthers ' nameplate typography , which had been vertically arched in years past , is now straight .
( Uni Watch had mistakenly assumed that this change was just a preseason thing , but it has endured into the regular season . )
• All refs and linesmen must now wear black helmets , which means no more bare - headed action for Mick McGeough or Kerry Fraser .
• And here 's a spectacularly esoteric tidbit , courtesy of Society for International Hockey Research member R. J. Pratt : " Guillaume Latendresse of the Canadiens is wearing No. 84 .
Big deal ?
Well , it 's the first time in NHL history that it 's happened during the regular season .
( I 'm sure it had been worn in exhibitions before by minors - bound players . )
It was also the last number that had never been worn in NHL history .
Everything else -- including 0 and 00 -- had been worn before .
Jonathan Ferland of the Canadiens wore No. 86 last year , leaving only 84 as yet to be worn .
Latendresse can now claim to be the greatest No. 84 in NHL history . "
In other follow - up news , Uni Watch suggested last time around that the Sabres ' instantly infamous Buffaslug logo appeared to owe an aesthetic debt to the Kent State Golden Flashes .
But Patrick Ford points out that the real inspiration may have been the Lipscomb University Bisons .
And Uni Watch 's mention of the rarity of players whose uni numbers were fractions prompted responses from Jennifer Muller and Keith Kreindler , both of whom pointed out that Robert Merrill often wore No. 1 1/2 when singing the National Anthem at Yankee Stadium .
Back next week with a special Uni Watch World Series edition .

Lobby says
White House demands over settlements should be viewed as anti-semitic and a danger to security
Hardline pro-Israel groups in the US have been confronting President Barack Obama 's demands for a halt to settlement expansion by accusing him of promoting the ethnic cleansing of Jews and jeopardising Israel 's security .
Members of Congress allied with Israel and powerful lobby groups in Washington are also trying to shift the focus of administration policy from the Jewish settlements , arguing they are not an obstacle to peace , to demands for Arab governments to recognise Israel .
The strategy , intertwined with a similar campaign by Israeli politicians and officials , has taken on added urgency because of Obama 's demands , first laid down during a testy meeting in May with the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , that Israel freeze all settlement construction in the West Bank .
Netanyahu arrives in London tomorrow for a series of key meetings , including four hours of discussions on Wednesday with the White House 's special envoy , George Mitchell .
He is also due to see Gordon Brown on Tuesday .
The visit comes amid signs that an agreement will eventually be reached for a settlement freeze for up to a year .
But both sides regard that as merely a first step in a wider struggle over the future of the settlements , as well as other issues including the pace of negotiations toward the establishment of a Palestinian state and the shape of final borders .
The strategy to play down the significance of the settlements is laid out in a document drawn up for an influential pro-Israel lobby group by a prominent Republican pollster , Frank Luntz , on how to influence American public opinion .
The Israel Project , with an advisory board that includes 20 members of Congress from both parties , issued the confidential document to its supporters at about the time Obama came to power in January .
The report , marked as " not for distribution or publication " but since widely disseminated outside of the organisation , says that those who back the removal of the settlements should be told they are supporting ethnic cleansing and antisemitism .
The guide offers what it describes as " the best settlement argument " .
" The idea that anywhere that you have Palestinians there can't be Jews , that some areas have to be Jew - free , is a racist idea .
We do n't say that we have to cleanse out Arabs from Israel .
They are citizens of Israel .
They enjoy equal rights .
We cannot see why it is that peace requires that any Palestinian area would require a kind of ethnic cleansing to remove all Jews , " the guide says .
The accusation of ethnic cleansing is particularly ironic for many Palestinians , as the past 41 years of occupation have been marked by a continual forced removal of Arabs to make way for Jews .
The Israel Project document advises its supporters to argue that " settlements are necessary for the security of Israel " while also urging them to mislead Americans over the important role of religion in land seizures .
" You must avoid using Israel 's religious claims to land as a reason why Israel should not give up land .
Such claims only make Israel look extremist to people who are not religious Christians or Jews , " it says .
These views are shared by some influential members of Congress .
Last week , the chairman of the US House of Representatives foreign affairs committee , Howard Berman , a Democrat , told a closed meeting of Jewish leaders in Los Angeles that Obama was wrong to put pressure on Israel over the settlements .
Berman said the administration 's position had benefitted the Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas , who was " waiting for the US to present him Israel on a platter " .
The Israel Project report concedes that justifying the settlements to ordinary Americans is a tough sell .
" Nothing is tougher to articulate effectively to neutral Americans than a message in favour of the settlements .
Let me be clear about this conclusion .
Plenty of Israeli and American Jewish leaders have tried , but American and European audiences rejected almost everything we tested .
There is no magic language to unify public support , " it says .
Israel 's supporters have recognised that by attempting to shift the focus to another issue .
The Anti-Defamation League published a full - page advert in the New York Times denouncing Obama 's pressure on Israel .
" The problem is n't settlements , it 's Arab rejection , " it said .
" The obstacle to peace is not Israel .
The settlements are not the impediment … Mr President , it 's time to stop pressuring our vital friend and ally .
It 's now time to direct your attention to the rejectionists who refuse to recognise Israel and negotiate an end to the conflict . "
The Zionist Organisation of America has taken a similar position .
Another group , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , has thrown its backing behind a letter to Obama from a majority of members of the US Senate praising Netanyahu for taking " concrete measures " to advance peace , such as easing some restrictions on the movement of Palestinians , and asking the president what he is doing to get Arab governments to recognise Israel .
Seventy - one of 100 senators have signed the letter .
But the pressure has drawn criticism from other Jewish groups in the US in an unusual public split over Israel policy .
One organisation that presses for greater concessions by the Israeli government , J Street , has publicly condemned the ADL advert .
One of the most easily analyzed quotes from Dana White and Zuffa has long been the statement that the UFC will never be involved in a co-promotion .
Most fans believe this is due to the fact that the UFC is the biggest and most profitable MMA promotion in the world , and those fans would be right .
The UFC has nothing to gain from a co-promotion with another promotion , and the co-promoting organization would have everything to gain from the UFC 's name .
During today 's media conference call , Dana
White said that a co-promotion was " impossible " .
One of the quotes actually stated that the Fertittas have a gaming license , and it implied that this was one of the reason as to why the UFC would ultimately never co-promote along with the obvious fact that they are making loads of money without the help of any other promotion .
What did Dana White mean by this ?
After thinking about this for awhile , it really stems from something that happened quite awhile ago involving the PRIDE buyout and the following lawsuit between Pride FC Worldwide Holdings LLC , a Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta - owned venture , and Dream Stage Entertainment , Nobuyuki Sakakibara , Ubon , and Dream Stage Holdings along with some other unknown defendants .
The most notable part of the lawsuit did , in fact , involve the Fertitta 's gaming licenses :
The complaint states that because of the Fertittas ' involvement in the Nevada gaming industry , specifically their possession of privileged gaming licenses as owners and operators of Station Casinos , it was " essential " for the selling parties " to undertake certain post - closing actions . "
Section 5.3 of the asset purchase agreement expressly required that the defendants , particularly Sakakibara , " submit to and pass any reasonable background checks . "
However , according to the complaint , the selling parties " have repeatedly and consistently failed to submit basic information to and have materially obstructed the Investigator in the conduct of its background checks and due diligence investigation of , among others , Sakakibara and Ubon . "
Pride Worldwide alleges that " the Selling Parties never intended to comply with this material term , thereby defrauding the Purchasing Parties into entering into the AP Agreement , the Consulting Agreement , the Non-Compete Agreement and the other related transactional documents and into paying the Selling Parties millions upon millions of dollars . "
Notice of breach was first provided on Aug. 22 , 2007 .
How did these gaming licenses have anything to do with this entire buyout ?
Any dealings that Fertittas are involved in are subject to due diligence of the company that is being acquired or bought .
The Fertittas cannot be involved in anything that has any type of organized crime connection or corruption connection because of their involvement in the Nevada Gaming industry .
If a co-promotion had actually been set - up between the UFC and M - 1 Global , M - 1 Global would most likely have to undergo some sort of due diligence process in the same manner due to having a contract involvement with Zuffa .
Since Zuffa's CEO is Lorenzo Fertitta , this could become a problem .
More importantly , it could become a huge problem for the Fertittas if by some chance M - 1 Global is involved in some sort of illegal activity .
The last thing Lorenzo Fertitta would want is a lengthy investigation by the Nevada Gaming Commission .
There are definitely a number of reasons why Zuffa would n't want to enter a co-promotion agreement with another organization .
Not only does it not help their own organization , but it could end up causing a huge hassle down the road much like the Dream Stage Entertainment deal to acquire PRIDE .
Wenn Redaktionen Journalisten nicht vernünftig bezahlen , tun es andere .
Die Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( INSM ) , eine von Arbeitgeberverbänden finanzierte Organisation , die Stimmung für neoliberale Ideen und Konzepte macht , hat drei Jounalisten angeheuert , um kritischen Journalismus zu simulieren .
Unter dem Namen „ Deutschland 24/30 “ sollen sie einen Monat lang durchs Land fahren , wichtige Menschen wie Anne Will , die Bundeskanzlerin und „ Bild “ - Chefredakteur Kai Diekmann treffen und Sachverhalte „ durchaus auch kritisch “ hinterfragen .
Rekrutiert wurden offenbar gezielt Journalisten , die „ der sozialen Marktwirtschaft gegenüber positiv eingestellt und einem unternehmernahen Auftraggeber gegenüber aufgeschlossen sind “ .
Die drei zu Propagandisten mutierten Kollegen haben durchaus namhafte Medien im Lebenslauf .
Nach Informationen des Vereins „ LobbyControl “ sollen diverse Medien über die Protagonisten und die Aktion berichten ; aus den einzelnen Reiseberichten solle schließlich eine Fernseh - Reportage produziert werden .
Der Berufsverband freier Journalisten , „ Freischreiber “ , berichtet , dass das Honorar für jeden der drei Journalisten zwischen 6000 und 7000 Euro betragen soll .
Es ist eine Win-Win - Win-Situation : Die freien Journalisten kriegen ein schönes
Thema und werden endlich mal ordentlich bezahlt .
Die INSM kriegen schöne Berichte , die ihre Ideologie transportieren .
Und die Medien kriegen günstige Inhalte , um ihre Seiten und Sendeminuten zu füllen .
Ein echtes Zukunftsmodell .

Gegenüber dem „ Spiegel “ hat die INSM eingeräumt , Fehler gemacht zu haben .
Dass „ Anne Will “ oder die „ Zeit “ über die Aktion berichten würden und Personen wie Angela Merkel als Gesprächspartner zur Verfügung stünden , wie es in einem Arbeitspapier hieß , mit dem die Journalisten angeworben wurden , seien nur „ erste Vorüberlegungen “ gewesen , „ wen man ansprechen könnte “ .
In Wahrheit hätten diese Prominenten abgesagt .
Einer der beteiligten Journalisten sagte , er habe gegenüber der INSM auf journalistischer Freiheit bestanden .
Die merkwürdigen PR - Praktiken der Lobbyorganisation seien ihm nicht bekannt gewesen .
The Bartleby.com edition of Gray ’s Anatomy of the Human Body features 1,247 vibrant engravings — many in color — from the classic 1918 publication , as well as a subject index with 13,000 entries ranging from the Antrum of Highmore to the Zonule of Zinn .
Unemployment unexpectedly rose last week for newly laid - off workers , while continuing claims fell .
The increase in new claims may have risen , but it is below the 600,000 peak level the country has experienced for some months .
There are 558,000 new jobless claims , which has increased from last weeks 554,000 the Labor Department Reported .
Experts expected that the new claims would have dropped to 545,000 instead of rising .
The number of people receiving benefits fell to 6.2 million from 6.34 million the previous week .
However , it 's not that impressive when you really think about it .
Instead of these people finding work , most have used all their unemployment benefits and are no longer eligible , which means even though they may be unemployed , they are not counted as being unemployed .
So the unemployment rate is actually higher than these statistics may lead individuals to believe .
The economy is still in trouble .
Typically economists rate an economy 's health by the unemployment numbers .
If the new unemployment numbers are below 325,000 then the economy is healthy .
However , if the numbers are above then the economy 's in trouble .
The new unemployment claims have not been under 300,000 since 2007 .
The government has stepped up efforts by trying to stimulate and improve the economy , but it does n't seem to be working .
Many American's are starting to wonder what is around the bend .
They can't tell the economy is going to get slightly better or a lot worse over time .
Hopefully the economy will improve , but currently consumers are n't ready to start spending their money .

Stockton will Give Back to Fans on Nickleback Night
June 15 , 2009 - California League ( CalL ) - Stockton Ports News Release
STOCKTON , Calif . -
As part of the nationwide effort to make the most out of every penny , the Stockton Ports are doing their part to educate fans on how to save their money by not buying illogical music at their game on Tuesday , June 16 .
The Ports will host " Nickelback Night " on June 16 as they take on the Modesto Nuts at 7:05 p.m. Music from Canadian rock band , Nickelback , will be played throughout the game and fans can participate in on - field games like Name That Awful Tune , a contest for who can grunt ( or " sing , " as the band likes to call it ) a Nickelback song the best , and an air guitar contest .
The band got its name from member Mike Kroeger , who would frequently say " Here 's your nickel back , " in his job at Starbucks .
In that spirit , the Ports will give each fan a nickel as they exit the game on June 16 , as a " Thank You " and an apology for listening to the band 's music all evening .
Nickelback has somehow sold 27 million albums worldwide , and has had 13 singles climb the Billboard charts since their 2001 hit " How You Remind Me " despite writing songs with lyrics that make no sense .
The band 's fifth album , which was released in 2005 , " All The Right Reasons , " won the American Music Award for Favorite Pop / Rock Album .
The band has received five Grammy Award nominations , but has yet to win a Grammy award .
The band was also inducted in Canada 's Walk of Fame in 2007 , and won the American Music Award in 2007 for Favorite Pop / Rock Band .
" Hopefully , people will realize that they have been spending their money on music that not only sounds bad , but that also has lyrics that make absolutely no sense , " said Ports Director of Marketing Justin Gray .
" If we do our job correctly , fans will leave the game with the knowledge of how to save money by not spending it on incoherent grunting , thus creating more expendable income , and possibly saving the nation 's economy . "

Even though incredibly basic , Gmail Tasks has provided a simple way for Gmail users to create to - do lists while processing email .
Today ,
Tasks is graduating from Labs to become a default email feature accessible under the " Contacts " link .
Tasks graduation from the feature testing playground is the first ever for the Labs program , and demonstrates the overall value and success of adding experimental features into Google products .
Now that proof of concept has been established , Google is announcing that , starting today , Labs will take up residence in Google Calendar too .
We love Labs , and we 're excited to see them extended to one of our favorite web - based calendar apps .
Here 's how it works : in the Settings section of your Google Calendar , you 'll now see a new tab labelled " Labs . "
There , just as in Gmail , you 'll find experimental functionality just for your calendar , and you can enable or disable any of the options .
Google Calendar Labs is launching with six new features , and though they have n't been turned on for us just yet , the Google Apps Blog post introduces a few of them by saying , " Try out Next Meeting , which shows you how much time you have to procrastinate .
Free or Busy allows you to see which of your friends or coworkers are currently in meetings .
And World Clock lets you keep track of different timezones when you schedule meetings . "
Plus , should you want to build your own Calendar features , you can do so with the newly released experimental API .
We hope to see this API inspire a number of third - party calendar gadgets that we can use to better plan , manage , track , and share our busy schedules .
Oh , and if you need a refresher on the Lab 's first graduate — Tasks — here 's a quick video of how they could fit into your workflow :

Researchers at JPL simulated the conditions faced by the rover Spirit on Mars , where it is stuck in loose soil , to find the best way to help free it ( Image : NASA / JPL - Caltech )
After a month of spinning their wheels in a sandbox , NASA engineers have settled on a strategy to free the rover Spirit from a sand trap on Mars : just wing it .
The geriatric rover slid into soft terrain in early May , burying its wheels halfway into the flour - like soil .
To test strategies for getting out without risking a catastrophic misstep , engineers rolled a duplicate rover into a sandbox at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena , California , that mimics the Martian morass .
After testing dozens of individual moves , from simply rolling forwards and backwards to “ crab - walking ” sideways , engineers decided to throw the kitchen sink at the problem .
Advertisement
“ Each manoeuvre shows progress up to a point , and then by changing the manoeuvre we can continue the progress , ” says project manager John Callas .
“ That right now looks like the emerging strategy – changing the manoeuvres each time to continue to make progress . ”
The team will hash out the final choreography in a meeting on Thursday , and will begin moving the rover on Monday , Callas says .
Extra challenges
Spirit ’s twin , Opportunity , had a similar dilemma in 2005 , when its wheels sunk into a sand dune scientists later named “ Purgatory ” .
It finally escaped by slowly backing out until its wheels found traction again .
But Spirit faces extra challenges .
Its right - front wheel stopped working three years ago , and since then scientists have been driving backwards using the five remaining wheels , dragging the crippled wheel along behind it .
It has also been plagued by rocks .
A rock that is poking the rover in the belly might keep the wheels from getting traction if the rock is bearing any of the rover ’s weight , though a similarly placed rock has not been an issue for the test rover in the JPL sandbox .
“ It ’s a complication , but not a serious complication , ” Callas told New Scientist .
The rock seems to be just grazing the rover ’s undercarriage , not holding it up .
The rock also appears to be “ floating ” on the planet ’s surface , so it would sink into the sand if Spirit put any pressure on it , says Callas .
Scientists also worried that Spirit ’s left - centre wheel had a rock stuck in it because early on the wheel had trouble spinning .
But the wheel rotated fully in later tests .
“ We do n’t know if whatever caused the stall is something that could recur , ” Callas says .
“ It ’s possible .
The first movement out of the gate could be a stall . ”
‘ Thin ice ’
To make matters worse , Spirit is also on a steeper slope than Opportunity was , and an even deeper sandpit lies directly downhill .
“ It took us almost a month to get out of Purgatory dune , and that was with a six - wheeled rover that did n’t have the sloping problems , ” Callas says .
“ This is a highly complex problem with a compromised rover . ”
The type of soil Spirit is in also presents a problem .
The region is covered with a “ camouflaging crust . ”
Spirit drove safely over the crust for an unknown amount of time before breaking through and embedding its wheels in the fine , loose soil underneath .
Scientists do n’t know how far the crust extends in any direction , including the direction from which Spirit came .
“ The region we were safely over before could be a challenge now , ” Callas says .
“ It ’s like skating on thin ice . ”
Time delay
So instead of backing up , scientists plan to tell Spirit to push forward .
The first move will probably be straightening the wheels , and then a small step straight ahead .
After that , the plan is murky .
If all goes well , mission managers may order the rover to take another step ; if not , they ’ll turn all four corner wheels to the right and crab - step uphill , with the wheels pointed 20° to the right .
Other options include hard turns with the wheels angled 60° degrees to the right and backwards drives if necessary .
The rover will hopefully tiptoe forward , stopping after each step to assess its progress .
One reason for the slow progress is that the amount of time it takes for messages to get between Earth and Mars limits engineers to one driving command per day .
If Spirit attempted too complicated a manoeuvre and got buried even deeper , it would n’t get a chance to fix the problem until the next day .
The safest move is therefore baby steps .
“ We ’ll take small steps to begin with , and we ’re expecting small results , ” Callas says .
“ Our expectation is to move forward , but we ’re doing it cautiously . ”
Different worlds
Despite all the tests , engineers can’t plan a more specific series of moves .
This is partially thanks to the inherent differences between Earth and Mars .
Martian gravity is only three - eighths of Earth ’s , and it has a thin atmosphere with no moisture .
Earth - bound tests are “ only an approximation , ” Callas says .
“ No one can tell you how the rover ’s going to respond on Mars until we start moving . ”
“ The public has been offering lots of suggestions to us , but they ’re all based on Earth analogues , people getting stuck in the mud or the snow , ” he adds .
“ Those are not applicable – there ’s no mud and there ’s no snow on Mars .
They ’re two different worlds . ”
The benefit of the sandbox tests was to build up an arsenal of movements that could help extricate the rover , Callas says .
And he ’s guardedly optimistic .
“ It ’s going to take us a long time to get out , ” he told New Scientist .
“ But it ’s encouraging that the rover in the sandbox is climbing ; it has enough capability to fight Earth gravity to get altitude .
We ’re expecting that on Mars , where there ’s only three - eighths gravity , that the rover may actually do better . ”
VERACRUZ , Mexico ( CNN ) --
The dead always tell a story .
And in Mexico that story is the fight for the right to meet U.S. demand for illegal drugs -- a war becoming more violent and ruthless , mostly because of one group .
Suspected members of Los Zetas drug cartel are presented to reporters in Mexico City in April .
Its name is Los Zetas .
Imagine a band of U.S. Green Berets going rogue and offering their services and firepower to drug cartels .
That 's what happened in Mexico in the 1990s .
Commandos from the Mexican army deserted and set up a cartel , known as Los Zetas .
The U.S. government says Los Zetas is " the most technologically advanced , sophisticated and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico . "
Los Zetas are blamed for last week 's brutal killings of the police chief in the southern Mexican city of Veracruz , his wife and four children .
The way in which the killers carried out their crime sent a message .
At 5 a.m. on July 29 , two cars pulled up in front of the police chief 's house , and eight or nine gunmen got out , armed with assault rifles and 40 mm grenade launchers .
They blasted their way into the house , and it took them less than five minutes to execute Jesus Antonio Romero , his wife , also a police officer , and their son .
The gunmen then set the house on fire , killing the remaining three children , all girls .
Watch scenes of the escalating drug war in Veracruz »
With their fierce weaponry and military expertise , Los Zetas are considered the most formidable enemy in the drug war .
AC360 : The war next door
This week on " Anderson Cooper 360 , " Michael Ware reports from Mexico on the gruesome tactics used by drug cartels .
Thursday : Ware tracks " El Chapo , " one of Forbes ' wealthiest people in the world and also the most wanted man in North America .
Thursday , 10 p.m. ET see full schedule »
" The Zetas have obviously assumed the role of being the No. 1 organization responsible for the majority of the homicides , the narcotic - related homicides , the beheadings , the kidnappings , the extortions that take place in Mexico , " said Ralph Reyes , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency 's chief for Mexico and Central America .
The fight against Los Zetas will take years , Reyes said .
" They continue to train new recruits through several campaigns .
One of them is the very open and public narco banners that they post around the country of Mexico , specifically tailored to the military and [ saying ] that they will offer better pay and better benefits if they join the ranks of the Zetas , " Reyes said from his Washington office , where he directs the U.S. battle against Los Zetas .
With its mastery of combat , Reyes said , the organized crime network operates more like a U.S. infantry company patrolling the streets of Falluja , Iraq , than a street gang .
Newspapers in Veracruz have headlines almost every day about drug cartels ' bloody violence , more often than not linked to Los Zetas .
The DEA said that although the group originally was based on military lines , the cartel has been built into a business structure , with quarterly meetings , business ledgers , even votes on key assassinations .
And now Los Zetas are taxing businesses beyond their drug reach -- from human trafficking across the U.S. border to , as one recent scandal showed , imposing a kind of tax on the Mexican government .
The state oil company has been bleeding billions to corrupt officials linked to Los Zetas .
And , as a DEA agent recently said , the American border makes no difference to Los Zetas .
It does n't matter if violence is perpetrated on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border .
Inside the United States , one of the instruments of assassination Los Zetas unleashed was teenager Rosalio Reta .
Given six months of military training in Mexico , he was sent across the border to target rival drug gangs .
He was 13 years old when he committed his first killing .
" I loved doing it , " Reta says in a police interrogation tape .
" Killing that first person , I loved it .
I thought I was Superman . "
U.S. officials have said there are many more like him .

Sitting ducks :
How a mother bird made her lazy brood of ducklings walk the plank
A mother duck was captured tipping her brood into the water after her five chicks attempted to take a rest on a floating plank of wood .
The adorable ducklings delighted onlookers at Tymon Park in Dublin last week when one cheekily hopped onto the driftwood , prompting his siblings to follow suit .
But their mother was less than impressed at their antics , and on spotting them aboard their makeshift raft , used her beak to flip it over , tipping the fluffy youngsters into the water .
Cheeky duckling :
The plucky youngster hops onto a floating plank of wood for a rest
Local wildlife photographer Paul Hughes , 38 , had visited the park pond to see what he could spot , getting more than he bargained for .
' I 've photographed a lot of bird - life in the area and I 've never seen ducklings as lazy as these before . '
The mother of the ducks - Divers - had been keeping a close watch on her five chicks wary of predators looking for an easy lunch .
Ducks out of water :
The brave chick is quickly joined by his siblings on the makeshift raft
Walking the plank :

The mother bird has her ducklings back in the pond where they belong
We believe that the good model description practice proposed here , together with a number of other recent initiatives on data- , model- , and software - sharing , may lead to a deeper and more fruitful exchange of ideas among computational neuroscientists in years to come .
We further hope that work on standardized ways of describing — and thinking about — complex neuronal networks will lead the scientific community to a clearer understanding of high - level concepts in network dynamics , and will thus lead to deeper insights into the function of the brain .
We analyze here 14 research papers proposing neuronal network models of different complexity and find widely varying approaches to model descriptions , with regard to both the means of description and the ordering and placement of material .
We further observe great variation in the graphical representation of networks and the notation used in equations .
Based on our observations , we propose a good model description practice , composed of guidelines for the organization of publications , a checklist for model descriptions , templates for tables presenting model structure , and guidelines for diagrams of networks .
The main purpose of this good practice is to trigger a debate about the communication of neuronal network models in a manner comprehensible to humans , as opposed to machine - readable model description languages .
Progress in science depends on the effective exchange of ideas among scientists .
New ideas can be assessed and criticized in a meaningful manner only if they are formulated precisely .
This applies to simulation studies as well as to experiments and theories .
But after more than 50 years of neuronal network simulations , we still lack a clear and common understanding of the role of computational models in neuroscience as well as established practices for describing network models in publications .
This hinders the critical evaluation of network models as well as their re-use .
Scientists make precise , testable statements about their observations and models of nature .
Other scientists can then evaluate these statements and attempt to reproduce or extend them .
Results that cannot be reproduced will be duly criticized to arrive at better interpretations of experimental results or better models .
Over time , this discourse develops our joint scientific knowledge .
A crucial condition for this process is that scientists can describe their own models in a manner that is precise and comprehensible to others .
We analyze in this paper how well models of neuronal networks are described in the scientific literature and conclude that the wide variety of manners in which network models are described makes it difficult to communicate models successfully .
We propose a good model description practice to improve the communication of neuronal network models .

While mathematical model descriptions can be treated with formal methods , their computer implementations generally cannot .
This means that if we want to validate the claims about a model , we must start from the description in the scientific publication .
If we start from the model implementation of the authors , we can never refute that the model may be faulty or doing something entirely different than what was claimed in the publication .
Taking a given implementation of a model or hypothesis and simply executing it again does not constitute independent testing , nor does it fulfill the criterion of falsifiability : the same program run twice should yield identical results .
It is also worth mentioning that the translation of a mathematical model into a computer program is lossy and irreversible .
The translation is lossy due to the finite precisions of computers .
For example , most real numbers cannot be represented on a computer .
This is obviously problematic in the analysis of chaotic systems where small errors have a big influence on the state trajectories of the system .
The translation is generally not reversible , because the commonly used programming languages are not accessible to formal analysis .
It is generally not even possible to prove that a function , implemented in a common language such as C++ , is correct .
In some cases , one may even have to add equations to models in the computer implementation to preserve stability and obtain results in agreement with experimental observation [ 42 ] , [ 52 ] .
It is tempting to consider implementations of neuronal network models in a specific simulator software as a sufficient model description , as it is explicit , specific and describes structure and dynamics .
We believe this to be a fallacy .
Implementations come most often in the form of scripts or computer programs , which tend to be difficult to reverse engineer :
It is simply not possible to infer the overall network structure from the bits and pieces of a large script .
Secondly , most simulation scripts rely on properties hidden in a simulator , which may even change as a simulator evolves over time .
Translating a given implementation first to a mental model and then to a second simulator software for independent testing , opens for errors in both translation steps .
We believe that while scientific productivity benefits from sharing simulation code through repositories such as ModelDB [ 50 ] and standard languages such as NeuroML [ 51 ] , implementations do not fill the need for precise human - readable model descriptions in the scientific literature .
Based on experiences in systems biology , Wimalaratne et al . [ 36 ] stress that it is crucial to identify biophysical concepts as logical abstractions in order to create meaningful and re-usable model implementations .
Scientific progress depends critically on the ability of neuroscientists to communicate models , i.e. , hypotheses , among each other :
When Anna presents her model to Bob and Charlie — will both build the same mental model in their minds as Anna ?
Or will some nuances be lost , some aspects interpreted differently , some parts misunderstood ?
Only a precise , unambiguous notation for models will allow Anna , Bob and Charlie to discuss their individual understandings of the model and thus to truly share models .
Efficient communication dictates that scientists should use a common notation to describe their models , as it is demanding to thoroughly acquaint ourselves with any advanced notation .
“ We make for ourselves internal images or symbols of the external objects , and we make them in such a way that the consequences of the images that are necessary in thought are always images of the consequences of the depicted objects that are necessary in nature
Once we have succeeded in deriving from accumulated previous experience images with the required property , we can quickly develop from them , as if from models , the consequences that in the external world will occur only over an extended period or as a result of our own intervention . ” ( cited from [ 40 ] ) .
The model is first of all a mental model formed in the brain of a researcher .
It is her hypothesis about the function of a part of the brain .
Heinrich Hertz expressed this idea first in his textbook “ Prinzipien der Mechanik ” in 1894 :
We shall not attempt to provide a general analysis of models and simulations in computational neuroscience here .
Our aim is more practical : to promote standards for the description of neuronal network models in the literature , to further sharing of knowledge and facilitate critique .
Thus , our focus is narrower yet than that of Eliasmith and Anderson [ 49 ] , Ch. 1.5 , who proposed a “ Methodology ” of neural engineering .
For our purposes , we adopt a quite restricted working definition of a model :
Philosophers of science have yet to develop a robust definition and interpretation of models and simulations [ 39 ] – [ 42 ] .
Most of that debate focuses on models in physics , but Peck [ 31 ] gives an interesting review of models and simulations in ecology , while Aumann [ 32 ] thoroughly discusses requirements of successful modeling of ecological systems ; Wooley and Lin [ 43 ] give an overview of modeling and simulation in biology .
The only comparable assessment of the role of models and simulations in computational neuroscience is part of a book chapter by Clark and Eliasmith [ 44 ] .
A recent appraisal of the role of models in neuroscience [ 45 ] – [ 47 ] , based on a general reappraisal of the role of computational models by Humphreys [ 48 ] , has mostly focused on connectionist models .
Computational neuroscientists are only now beginning to pay increasing attention to the role of models and simulations , as well as preconditions for the successful exchange of models , as witnessed by recent workshops [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , collaborative reviews of simulation software [ 27 ] , and the development of software providing common interfaces [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and run-time interaction of simulations on different simulators [ 30 ] .
Most of these discussions have been rather technical , though , and little attention has been paid to the intellectual gain as part of the modeling process or to the issue of how to convey models and simulations best in scientific publications .
Researchers in ecology , systems biology and physiome modeling appear to be significantly ahead in these issues [ 31 ] – [ 37 ] .
Indeed , De Schutter [ 38 ] recently suggested that computational neuroscience has much to learn from systems biology .
Sejnowski et al. [ 24 ] gave a fine account of the role of modeling in neuroscience 20 years ago , when computational neuroscience as a field just “ took off ” .
They characterized models as “ provisional framework [s ] for organizing possible ways of thinking about the nervous system . ”
Since then , modeling activity has multiplied , but reflection about the modeling process has hardly kept up .
A central motivation for our work is that sharing of materials , methods , and data in the life sciences has received increased attention in recent years , to a large part driven by developments in molecular biology .
The UPSIDE ( uniform principle for sharing integral data and materials expeditiously ) doctrine proposed by the Committee on Responsibilities of Authorship in the Biological Sciences of the National Academies of Science ( USA ) defines the most comprehensive set of rules for data sharing [ 17 ] and has been adopted by several leading journals [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
Sharing of experimental data has received increasing attention in the neurosciences recently [ 20 ] – [ 23 ] .
Computational neuroscience lags behind mathematics and other fields of science in standardization , expressiveness and power of notation .
We assess here the current scientific practice of describing computational models of the brain .
We focus on network models built from large numbers of rather simple neurons with an aim to test hypotheses on aspects of brain function .
Specifically , we study 14 papers chosen mainly from visual neuroscience [ 3 ] – [ 16 ] ; see Table 1 for a brief summary of the models .
Our selection of papers is by no means comprehensive , although we have attempted to cover past as well as current work , and to include a range of different approaches to the description of neuronal network models .
Note that even though the notion and notation of vectors and matrices is more abstract and , thus , more compact than the original formulation of Eq. 1 , it does not lose any detail .
The variables , , and from the original system Eq. 1 are still present , not as separate entities , but as components of the vector .
The specific combinations of additions and multiplications are embedded in the multiplication rule for vectors .
To arrive at the concise notation of Eq. 2 we must introduce the new mathematical concept of vector spaces .
This example illustrates how scientific notation progresses together with scientific concepts .
From the study of one - dimensional differential equations , we know that ( 4 ) has the solution ( 5 ) Comparing the shape of Eq. 4 to Eq. 3 immediately suggests the following solution to Eq. 3 ( 6 ) with the formal definition ( 7 ) This formal solution can be made rigorous , and underlies the exact integration method [ 2 ] .
It is hard to see how the inspiration to write down a solution such as Eq. 3 might have arisen from the original form of the differential equations in Eq. 1 .
Matrix notation provides an illustrative example of the power of notation .
Consider a system of three differential equations ( 1 ) Defining , , and , , etc. , we can write this more compactly as ( 2 ) Introducing matrix notation simplifies this further to ( 3 ) with multiple advantages : the equation is much more compact , since the summing operation is hidden , as well as the system size ; most importantly , the equation is essentially reduced to a simple multiplication .
This invites further exploration .
Scientific disciplines have over time developed a range of abstract notations , specific terminologies and common practices for describing methods and results .
These have lifted scientific discourse from handwaving arguments about sloppily ascertained observations to precise and falsifiable reasoning about facts established at a well - defined level of certainty .
Well chosen notation and systematization , from Linné 's classification of flora and fauna , via the periodic system of the elements to Feynman diagrams have widened the minds of scientists and continue to induce new discoveries .
Science advances human knowledge through learned discourse based on mutual criticism of ideas and observations .
This discourse depends on the unambiguous specification of hypotheses and experimental procedures — otherwise any criticism could be diverted easily .
Moreover , communication among scientists will be effective only if a publication evokes in a reader the same ideas as the author had in mind upon writing [ 1 ] .
The placement of model descriptions within a scientific publication depends on the focus of the paper and the journal it is published in .
Traditionally , model descriptions were either given in the body text of a paper , or in an appendix .
It has now become common to give only brief model overviews in the paper itself , and to relegate detailed model descriptions to supplementary material published online , or even to place simulation code online in community repositories such as ModelDB .
Pseudocode is often used to present algorithms in concise , human readable form , without resorting to a specific programming language .
It will be an efficient means of communication only if the pseudocode notation is sufficiently well established to be unambiguous .
Tables are a useful means of organizing data , especially model parameters .
Data presented in table form is far more accessible than data dispersed throughout a text , facilitating , e.g. , comparisons of parameter choices between different papers and proof - reading of simulation scripts against papers .
Figures communicate the architecture and connectivity of network models well , since vision is the dominating sense in most humans .
Most readers will first scan the figures in a paper to get an overview of what the paper is about , using figure captions as a guide , and read the full text of the paper only later .
Thus , figures and captions will shape the initial idea a reader forms about a neuronal network model , and the ideas thus established may be difficult to correct through textual description .
Specifying complex networks precisely in figures can be difficult , and disciplines depending strongly on exact diagrams , such as mechanical and electrical engineering , have developed precise standards for such diagrams ( see , e.g. , [ 55 ] ) .
Systems biologists have yet to arrive at a definite standard for depicting their models , but they at least have an open debate about graphical representations [ 56 ] – [ 59 ] .
Mathematical notation ( equations ) is compact and unambiguous .
Suitably chosen notation compresses complex relationships in concise expressions , which allow for further manipulation in our mind , as illustrated by the matrix exponentiation in the Introduction .
The now common mathematical notation emerged alongside the great scientific achievements of Newton , Leibniz and others between the 17 th and 19 th century [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] .
Unfortunately , not all mathematical notation is understood easily , and variations in notation , as is common in computational neuroscience ( cf. Table 2 ) , can present serious obstacles to effective communication .
Prose is a powerful means of communicating ideas , intentions and reasons .
It is flexible and , if used carefully , precise .
Unfortunately , prose can easily — often unintentionally — become ambiguous .
Previous knowledge and ideas in the mind of the reader will shape the reader 's understanding of a textual description of a model and may lead to misunderstandings .
Prose that strives to be strictly unambiguous and provide all required detail , on the other hand , will often be difficult to read .
Neuronal network models are usually described by a combination of five means : prose ( text ) , equations , figures , tables and pseudocode .
We shall discuss these in turn .
A complete model description must cover at least the following three components : ( i ) The network architecture , i.e. , the composition of the network from areas , layers , or neuronal sub-populations .
( ii )
The network connectivity , describing how neurons are connected among each other in the network .
In most cases , connectivity will be given as a set of rules for generating the connections .
( iii )
The neuron and synapse models used in the network model , usually given by differential equations for the membrane potential and synaptic currents or conductances , rules for spike generation and post - spike reset .
Model descriptions should also contain information about ( iv ) the input ( stimuli ) applied to the model and ( v ) the data recorded from the model , just as papers in experimental neuroscience do , since a reproduction of the simulations would otherwise become impossible .
We shall now sketch key aspects of neuronal network model descriptions : what is described where and by what means in the computational neuroscience literature ?
This will introduce the conceptual framework for the subsequent analysis of the papers given in Table 1 .
Results
We will now analyze model descriptions in the 14 papers listed in Table 1 .
We study the placement of model descriptions in publications first , followed by a general discussion of the means of description used .
We will then investigate in more detail how specific aspects of models are described .
Finally , we propose a good model description practice .
Placement of description Figure 1 summarizes the placement of the description of architecture , connectivity and neuron and synapse models , respectively , across all papers ; for details , see Tables S1 , S2 and S3 in the Supporting files .
All papers present at least an overview of the model they investigate in the main body of the paper .
Details are frequently provided in supplementary material available online , especially in more recent papers ; appendices are used to a lesser degree .
Model descriptions in some papers are incomplete in the sense that the authors refer to other publications for details of neuronal dynamics in particular .

Within the body text of the paper , model descriptions were placed in the “ Methods ” sections in 10 of the 14 papers surveyed , even though the neuronal network model is in itself a product of significant scientific analysis and synthesis [ 32 ] .
As such , it would rather belong in the “ Results ” section of a paper .
Whether the placement of the model description in the “ Methods ” section genuinely reflects the way in which authors perceive their models , or rather is a consequence of editorial policies shaped by “ wet ” neuroscience , is not clear at present .
It is interesting to note in this context that papers in theoretical physics generally do not follow the strict “ methods - results - discussion ” pattern .
We would like to point out two interesting aspects of the placement of model descriptions .
First , the text of a paper manuscript , including the appendix , undergoes thorough peer review and copy editing , ensuring high standards in content and presentation .
It is not , at present , clear whether all material published as supplementary material receives the same scrutiny in the review process ; it is often not copy - edited to the same standards as the paper proper .
Second , source code published in community repositories represents an implementation of a model , not the model itself [ 52 ] .
It can thus serve only as a service to the community to facilitate code - reuse , but not to communicate the content of the model proper .
Incidentally , none of the 14 papers surveyed here describes re-use of neuronal models available in repositories , such as ModelDB [ 50 ] .
Nor does any paper mention that the source code for the model implemented in the paper was made available to the community , even though models from several papers are at present available from ModelDB [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 15 ] .
In recent years , though , there appears to be a slowly growing trend to explicitly reference and re-use existing models from ModelDB ; see http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/prm.asp for an up - to - date list ( Michael Hines , personal communication ) .
Means of model descriptions Figure 2 shows that equations are mostly used to describe the dynamics of model neurons , while connections are most often presented in a combination of prose and figures , occasionally in form of pseudocode .
We will review the quality of these descriptions in detail below .
Table 3 shows how parameters are presented in papers .
It regrettably indicates that too few authors make parameters easily accessible in tables .

Network model descriptions in the literature show no consistent order of description .
Among the papers surveyed here , six begin with a description of the neuron models and then proceed to network architecture , seven papers use the opposite order , while one paper mixes the description of neurons and network .
We find the latter option least useful to the reader .
Authors differ greatly in their efforts to anchor their models in empirical data .
Destexhe et al . [ 4 ] go to great lengths to justify the design of their neuron and synapse models with respect to the neurophysiological literature .
They thus provide the synthesis document proposed by Aumann [ 32 ] as the basis of any modeling effort .
Unfortunately for those readers who want to investigate the resulting model , though , model description and justification are tightly intertwined in the terse methods section , making it quite demanding to extract the model description as such .
Among all papers surveyed here , only Destexhe et al . [ 4 ] and Izhikevich and Edelman [ 8 ] show responses of individual synaptic conductances and individual neurons to test stimuli , while all other authors only show responses of the entire network .
This means that researchers who attempt to re-implement a model and find themselves unable to reproduce the results from a paper , will not be able to find out whether problems arise from neuron model implementations or from a wrong network setup .
We will now analyze in detail which difficulties arise in describing a network model , considering in turn network architecture , connectivity , and neuron models , and point out examples of good descriptions .
Network architecture Descriptions of network architecture become challenging as network complexity increases .
Networks with a small number of populations , random connectivity and no spatial structure are easily described in a few lines of prose , as in Brunel 's paper [ 3 ] .
A combination of prose and simple figures is usually sufficient to describe architecture of networks composed from a small number of one - or two - dimensional layers of individual neurons ; examples are Destexhe et al . [ 4 ] and Kirkland and Gerstein [ 9 ] .
Complex models spanning several brain areas with detailed spatial , layered , and functional substructure , such as Lumer et al . [ 10 ] and Izhikevich and Edelman [ 8 ] , are more challenging to describe .
Authors generally adopt a top - down approach , giving first an overview of the brain areas involved , before detailing the structure of the individual areas .
In models of systems with clearly defined signal flow , areas are often visited in the predominant order of signal flow [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 14 ] , while others present the more complex cortical structures before descending to subcortical structures [ 8 ] , [ 10 ] .
The most detailed explicit model studied here is the thalamocortical model presented by Lumer et al . [ 10 ] .
The description of the cortical areas in this model ( Vp and Vs ) , while complete , lacks in our opinion the clarity desirable of a good model description , and may thus help to identify rules for ideal model descriptions .
For one , discussions on model design and properties are embedded in the model description , e.g. , the reduction of a total of 32 “ combinations of response selectivities ” to just two included in the model , and a comparison of the number of neurons in the model to that found in animals .
We believe that design decisions and model review should be kept separate from the model description proper for the sake of clarity , since they are independent intellectual endeavours [ 32 ] .
Second , Lumer et al. mix different views of their layer architecture without providing sufficient guidance to the reader .
They begin by describing the Vp layer as a grid of 8×8 macro-units , with two “ selectivities within a macro - unit ” , each containing “ a collection of 5× 5 topographic elements , each of which corresponded to a contiguous location in retinal space ” , before proceeding to state that “ [ t ] opographic elements in Vp were organized in maps of 40×40 elements for each of the two modeled orientation selectivities . ”
We find it difficult to interpret this description unambiguously .
We are in particular in doubt about the localization of macro-units and topographic elements in retinal space .
In our view , the most parsimonious interpretation is as follows : 5×5 topographic elements placed in each of 8×8 macro-units result in a grid of 40×40 topographic elements . ”
This interpretation is sketched in Fig. 3 . PPT PowerPoint slide

larger image TIFF original image Download : Figure 3 . Interpretation of Lumer Interpretation of Lumer [ 10 ] model architecture .
The most parsimonious interpretation of the description of the primary visual cortical area
Vp given by Lumer et al , is as two layers of 40×40 topographic elements , representing horizontal and vertical orientations , respectively .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000456.g003
Another interesting aspect is that model composition is often described from a perspective orthogonal to the description of connections .
Lumer et al. [ 10 ] , e.g. , present the primary thalamus and cortex as grids of 40×40 topographical units , each containing an excitatory and an inhibitory neuron ( thalamus ) and a microcolumn composed of 10 neurons organized in three laminae ( cortex ) .
Connections are then described by looking at this architecture from an orthogonal perspective : Thalamus is described as two layers , one of excitatory and one of inhibitory neurons , while cortex is split into six layers , one of excitatory and one of inhibitory neurons for each of the three laminae in the model .
We believe that it may be more sensible to base the model description on the perspective used in defining connections , as connectivity is the central aspect of a network model .
Izhikevich and Edelman [ 8 ] present a significantly more complex model , covering the entire human cortex and thalamus .
Concerning the spatial placement , they only state that “ [ n] euronal bodies are allocated randomly on the cortical surface , whose coordinates were obtained from anatomical MRI . ”
No further information is given on how MRI measurements were converted to neuron densities in space .
Thus , even if one had access to MRI data of the human brain , it would be difficult to reproduce the neuron distribution investigated by Izhikevich and Edelman .
In such cases it would be advantageous to either use datasets available from community databases or to make data available to others .
Figures of network architecture vary widely between papers .
We will discuss them in the following section together with connections .
Connections
Describing the connections well is the most challenging task in presenting a neuronal network model .
For networks with random connections and no spatial structure , connectivity is easily described in a few sentences [ 3 ] .
Haeusler and Maass [ 5 ] additionally represent connection strengths and probabilities in a figure ; this works well for their six - population model .
If yet more populations were involved , such a figure would soon become cluttered , and it becomes more useful to present connection parameters in tables , cf. supplementary material in ref . [ 8 ] .
Even in these simple networks , care must be taken to specify details :
May neurons connect to themselves ?
May there be multiple connections between any pair of neurons ?
Are connection targets chosen at random for a fixed sender neuron ( divergent connection ) , senders chosen at random for fixed target ( convergent connection ) , or are sender and receiver chosen at random for each connection ?
Few authors are explicit on all these points , although these choices may have significant consequences for network dynamics ( Tom Tetzlaff , personal communication ; see also Kriener et al . [ 60 ] ) .
Models incorporating spatial structure have more complex connection patterns , which we will call topographic connections , since they usually describe the spatial distribution of connection targets relative to the spatial location of the sending neuron , i.e. , connections are typically described as divergent connections .
In most cases , connections have a random component : they are created with a certain probability .
In simple cases , such as Kirkland and Gerstein [ 9 ] , connections are made to neurons in a rectangular mask with equal probability .
In more complex models , connection probability depends on the relative locations of the neurons that are candidates for a connection , e.g. , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
Unfortunately , few authors provide the equations for these probability functions ; Mariño et al. [ 11 ] is a laudable exception .
It is somewhat paradoxical if papers present long tables of parameters for these connection probability functions , but do not provide the equation into which these parameters enter .
Mariño et al. [ 11 ] are the only authors who explicitly discuss self - connections ( in their supplementary material ) , and as far as we can see , no authors have discussed whether multiple connections between any two neurons may be created .
Another neglected issue is precisely how probabilistic connections are created .
The following approach seems to be implied :
For each pair of neurons from the sender and target population , a connection is created if a random number is smaller than the connection probability for the pair .
But one might equally well determine the total number of connections to be made first , and then distribute the connections according to the spatial probability profile [ 61 ] .
Such schemes offer significant performance gains [ 62 ] .
A complete specification of the connection algorithm should thus be given .
Among the papers surveyed , Izhikevich and Edelman [ 8 ] has by far the most complex connectivity and the authors go to great lengths to present gray - matter connectivity in figures , tables , and prose .
Alas , some information appears to be missing :
It is not clear from the text exactly how connections are distributed within the axonal spans , and how they are distributed across dendritic compartments of neurons with more than one compartment in a cortical layer .
We have also been unable to find specific information on how synaptic weights and delays were assigned to connections .
Finally , no details are provided about the white - matter ( long - range ) connections , which were based on diffusion - tensor imaging ( DTI ) data .
Without access to the DTI data it is thus impossible to re-implement the model presented .
Paper authors draw network diagrams in quite different ways , both in the overall style of their diagrams and in use of symbols .
Figure 4 shows network diagrams of a model loosely based on Einevoll and Plesser [ 63 ] , Fig. 3 , drawn in the style of three of the papers surveyed here .
The diagram in the style of Hayot and Tranchina [ 6 ] ( Fig. 4A ) gives a reduced but clear overview of the overall architecture of the model ; it provides no details .
The style of Haeusler and Maass [ 5 ] ( Fig. 4B ) carries most information , with weights and probabilities shown next to connection lines , and line widths proportional to the product of weight and probability .
Figure 4C , which imitates the style of Lumer et al. [ 10 ] , is rather illustrative : it provides no quantitative information and the structure of the connectivity is less prominent than in the other two figures ; on the other hand , it is the only figure hinting at the spatial structure of the network .
Interestingly , all three diagram styles use different ways of marking excitatory and inhibitory connections : bars vs circles , black vs red , and arrows vs bars .
Indeed , bars at the end of connection lines mark excitatory connections in Hayot and Tranchina 's style , but inhibitory connections in the style of Lumer et al , nicely illustrating the lack of standards in the field .

[ 10 ] , Fig. 1 . Numbers on arrows in B mark connection weight and probability of connection , while line width represents the product of the two .
In C , open circles show excitatory , filled circles inhibitory neurons .
The model depicted is loosely based on Einevoll and Plesser [ 63 , Fig. 3 ] , but the differentiation into two cortical layers , each with excitatory and inhibitory subpopulations , in B and C , as well as the connection weights and probabilities , have been added here for the purpose of illustration .

Izhikevich and Edelman [ 8 ] have illustrated their brain model using diagrams presenting significantly more detail than in the diagrams shown in our Fig .
4 . Unfortunately , we cannot reproduce Figures 2 and 8 from the supplementary material of the paper by Izhikevich and Edelman here due to copyright issues ; the figures are available on the internet at http://www.pnas.org/content/105/9/3593.figures-only and http://www.pnas.org/content/105/9/3593/suppl/DC1, respectively .
Their diagrams , though , provide so much detail of interest to the re-implementer , that the reader will have difficulty to form a clear conceptual model from the diagram .
This is in many ways the curse of complex models as the following analogy may illustrate : when a physicist or electrical engineer sees a diagram of an RLC circuit , she will intuitively “ see ” the circuit oscillate .
When presented with the complete wiring diagram for a modern analog radio receiver , though , it is hardly likely she will “ hear the music ” .
The figure in the style of Haeusler and Maass [ 5 ] takes a middle ground .
Since the individual populations are homogeneous , they can be represented by one circle each , with annotated lines providing information about connection structure and parameters .
By marking connection strength through line width and differentiating excitation and inhibition by line color , the figure appeals quite directly to our intuition .
It is clear , though , that any further populations would increase the complexity of the diagram to the point of illegibility .
There is no established standard for the order in which connections within a network are described .
Some authors proceed from local connectivity ( e.g. , intracortical intralaminar ) towards global connectivity [ 10 ] .
Others rather follow the signal flow through the network , from retina via LGN to cortex , e.g. , Kirkland and Gerstein [ 9 ] , Hayot and Tranchina [ 6 ] , and Troyer et al . [ 14 ] .
Predominantly women have moved into non-manual jobs , the study says
More women than men in the UK now work in high status professions , research by the University of Cambridge has shown .
But men are still paid far more than women , the report into employment and pay in 10 European countries reveals .
The changing nature of women 's work and better education had led to a " quiet revolution in the workplace " , the study of 300 occupations found .
UK women are only just pulling ahead in professions such as medicine and law , the researchers noted .
Gender pay gap
The other nations studied were Sweden , Germany , Russia , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Romania , Slovakia , Slovenia and Switzerland .
The report author , Dr Robert Blackburn , analysed data on several million European workers using official censuses and labour force surveys .
Dr Blackburn said : " Formerly women were more likely than men to be in manual occupations , but as manual work has declined , it is predominantly women who have moved into non-manual jobs .
" Initially ... women tended to be employed in low - level non-manual occupations , especially clerical work .
More recently , they have contributed to the expansion of professional employment . "
He said jobs defined as higher status like nursing and teaching did not always pay better than the dirty and dangerous manual work , usually carried out by men .
Men also tended to be better paid than women because within each occupation , men were generally more senior .
Dr Blackburn used a recognised independent scale to measure the attractiveness and status of the occupations in his study .
Hi
OpenCV is by far my favorite CV / Image processing library .
When I found an OpenCV port to the iPhone , and even someone tried to get it to do face detection , I just had to try it for myself .
In this post I 'll try to run through the steps I took in order to get OpenCV running on the iPhone , and then how to get OpenCV 's face detection play nice with iPhoneOS 's image buffers and video feed ( not yet OS 3.0 ! ) .
Then i'll talk a little about optimization
Update : Apple officially supports camera video pixel buffers in iOS 4.x using AVFoundation , here 's sample code from Apple developer .
Update : I do not have the xcodeproj file for this project , please do n't ask for it .
Please see here for compiling OpenCV for the iPhone SDK 4.3 .
Let 's begin
Cross compiling OpenCV on iPhoneOS
The good people @ computer - vision - software.com have posted a guideline on how to compile OpenCV on iPhone and link them as static libraries , and I followed it .
I did have to recompile it with one change - OpenCV needed zlib linkage , and the OpenCV configure script was n't able to config the makefiles to compile zlib as well .
So I downloaded zlib from the net , and just added all the files to the XCode project to compile and link .
If you 're trying to recreate this , remember to configure / build zlib before adding the files to XCode so you get a zconf.h file .
Now OpenCV linked perfectly .
All in all it was really not a big deal to compile OpenCV to the iPhoneOS .
I imagined it will be much harder ...
OK moving on to
Plain vanilla face detection
So the first step is to just get OpenCV to detect a single face on a single image .
But let 's make it harder and use UIImage .
So first , I took OCV 's facedetect .c example , and added it to the project as is .
Then I add 2 peripheral functions to setup and tear down the structs and allocated static memory ( things that are done in the main function ) .
void init_detection ( char* cascade_location ) { cascade = ( CvHaarClassifierCascade *) cvLoad ( cascade_location , 0 , 0 , 0 ) ; storage = cvCreateMemStorage (0 ) ; } static IplImage * gray = 0 , * small_img = 0 ; void release_detection ( ) { if ( storage ) { cvReleaseMemStorage ( &storage ) ; } if ( cascade ) { cvReleaseHaarClassifierCascade ( &cascade ) ; } cvReleaseImage ( &gray ) ; cvReleaseImage ( & small_img ) ; }
The detect_and_draw function remains exactly the same at this point .
I just take the XML files of the haarcascades , and add them to the projects resources .
Now I initialize the detection structs from my UIView or UIViewController that will do the detection .
The main NSBundle will find the path to the XML file :
NSString * my Image = [ [ NSBundle mainBundle ] pathForResource:@" haarcascade_frontalface_alt " of Type :@ " xml " ] ; char* chars = ( char* ) malloc ( 512 ) ; [ myImage getCString : chars maxLength :512 encoding : NSUTF8StringEncoding ] ; init_detection ( chars ) ;
Awesome , now let 's face - detect already !
For that all we need is to attach a picture of someone to the projects resources , load it , convert it to IplImage * and hand it over to detect_and_draw - simple .
I used a couple of helper function from the informative post I mentioned earlier :
- ( void ) manipulateOpenCVImagePixelDataWithCGImage:( CGImageRef)inImage openCVimage :( IplImage *) openCVimage ; - ( CGContextRef)createARGBBitmapContext:( CGImageRef ) inImage ; - ( IplImage *)getCVImageFromCGImage :( CGImageRef) cgImage ; -( CGImageRef)getCGImageFromCVImage:( IplImage *) cvImage ;
Now it 's only putting it together :
IplImage * im = [ self getCVImageFromCGImage :[ UIImage imageNamed :" a_picture.jpg " ] . CGImage ] ; detect_and_draw ( im ) ; UIImage * result = [ UIImage imageWithCGImage :[ self getCGImageFromCVImage : im ] ] ; UIImageView * imv = [ [ UIImageView alloc ] initWithImage : result ] ; [ self addSubview : imv ] ; [ imv release ] ;
Just remember those externs , if you do n't use a header file :
extern " C " void detect_and_draw ( IplImage * img , CvRect * found_face ) ; extern " C " void init_detection ( char* cascade_location ) ; extern " C " void release_detection ( ) ;
Sweet .
But detecting a face on a single photo is not so difficult - we want video and real - time face detection !
So let 's do that ..
Tying it up with video feed from the iPhone camera ( no OS 3.0 yet )
This step was so amazingly simple , it was borderline funny .
I used my well - known camera frame grabbing code from Norio Numora .
Of course to align it with OS 3.0 you must plug it in to the API Apple provide , and not this wily hack , but it 's really a plug - and - play situation .
I use it in many of my projects that use the iPhone camera , untill video on the OS 3.0 will be finalized .
So all I needed was to set everything up , make a timer to fire every so - and - so millisec , and send the frame to detection :
- ( id)initWithNibName :( NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle :( NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil { if ( self = [ super initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil bundle:nibBundleOrNil ] ) { // Initialization code ctad = [ [ CameraTestAppDelegate alloc ] init ] ; [ ctad doInit ] ; NSString * my Image = [ [ NSBundle mainBundle ] pathForResource:@" haarcascade_frontalface_alt " of Type :@ " xml " ] ; char* chars = ( char* ) malloc ( 512 ) ; [ myImage getCString : chars maxLength:512 encoding : NSUTF8StringEncoding ] ; init_detection ( chars ) ; [ self.view addSubview : [ ctad getPreviewView ] ] ; [ self.view sendSubviewToBack : [ ctad getPreviewView ] ] ; repeatingTimer = [ NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.0909 target:self selector:@selector(doDetection :) userInfo:nil repeats : YES ] ; } -( void ) doDetection :( NSTimer * ) timer { if ( [ ctad getPixelData ] ) { if ( !im ) { im = cvCreateImageHeader( cvSize ( [ ctad getVideoSize ].width , [ctad getVideoSize ].height ) , 8 , 4 ) ; } cvSetData ( im , [ ctad getPixelData ] , [ ctad getBytesPerRow ] ) ; CvRect r ; detect_and_draw ( im , &r ) ; if ( r.width > 0 && r.height >
0 ) { NSLog( @ " Face : %.0 f , %.0 f , %.0 f , %.0f " , r.x , r.y , r.width.r.height ) ; } } }
See that for optimization sake , I only create the IplImage header once ( the if goes in only in the first time ) , and every frame after that I only set the IplImage data by taking the buffer I got from the camera .
This way the IplImage is sharing buffers , so there is also a little memory optimization there .
From that point on you can take it anywhere you like .
Add stuff to faces , mark the face in the image , etc .
But ... there 's the issue of performance .
This method will get you very very bad timings .
In the area of 5 - 15 seconds ( !! ) for a single frame - which is horrendous .
And I promised near real time performance .
So without further ado ,
Optimizing the hell out of the detection algorithm
Well the guys at computer - vision - software.com have done some work in the field of optimizing OpenCV 's haar - based detection , but never released code .
Their method was based on the fact that the iPhone 's CPU can handle integers far better than floating - points , so they set out to change the algorithm to use integers .
I also did that , and found that it only shaves off a few millisec of the total time .
The far more influencing factor is the window size of the features scan , the scaling factor of the window size , and the derived number of passes .
Let me explain a little bit how the detection works in OpenCV .
First you set the minimal size of the window .
Then you specify a scale factor .
OpenCV uses this scale factor to do multiple passes over the image to scan for feature - hits .
It take the window size , say 30x30 , and the factor , say 1.1 , and starts multiplying the window size by the factor until it reaches the size of the image .
So for a 256x256 image you get : 30x30 scan , 33x33 , 36x36 , 39x39 , 43x43 ... 244x244 - a total of 23 passes , for one frame !
This is way too much ...
This is done to get better and finer results , and it may be good for resource abundant systems , but this is not our case .
So first thing I did was slash down on those scans .
There is , as expected a very strong impact on the quality of the results , but the times are getting close to acceptable .
After all my optimizations I got the timing down to even ~ 120 ms .
I optimized a few things :
The size of the input image , originally ~300x400 , was cut down by 1.5
The scale factor for cvHaarDetectObjects : I played with values ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 , with pleasing timings
The ROI ( region of interest ) in the IplImage to scan was set every frame to have the previous frame 's detection , the location of the face , plus some buffer on the sides to allow movement of the face frame - to - frame .
This decreases the scanned area from the whole image to just a small portion that contains the known face .
Of course if a face was not found the ROI is reset .
I change the internal works of the cvHaarDetectObjects algorithm to do a lot less floats multiplications and turned them into integer multiplications .
I dawned upon me just the other day that I can also optimize the size of the search window , and not keep it constant from frame to frame ( 30x30 ) .
If the last frame had found a 36x36 face , the next detection should also try for a 36x36 object .
I have n't tried it yet .
Memory optimization : do n't alloc buffers every frame , share buffers , etc .
So first the most influential change , is in the detection phase :
void detect_and_draw ( IplImage * img , CvRect * found_face ) { static CvRect prev ; if (! gray ) { gray = cvCreateImage ( cvSize ( img -> width , img -> height ) , 8 , 1 ) ; small_img = cvCreateImage ( cvSize ( cvRound ( img - > width / scale ) , cvRound ( img - > height / scale ) ) , 8 , 1 ) ; } if ( prev.width > 0 && prev.height >
0 ) { cvSetImageROI ( small_img , prev ) ; CvRect tPrev = cvRect ( prev.x * scale , prev.y * scale , prev.width * scale , prev.height * scale ) ; cvSetImageROI ( img , tPrev ) ; cvSetImageROI ( gray , tPrev ) ; } else { cvResetImageROI ( img ) ; cvResetImageROI ( small_img ) ; cvResetImageROI ( gray ) ; } cvCvtColor ( img , gray , CV_BGR2GRAY ) ; cvResize ( gray , small_img , CV_INTER_LINEAR ) ; cvEqualizeHist ( small_img , small_img ) ; cvClearMemStorage ( storage ) ; CvSeq * faces = mycvHaarDetectObjects ( small_img , cascade , storage , 1.2 , 0 , 0 |CV_HAAR_FIND_BIGGEST_OBJECT

As you can see I keep the previous face in prev , and use it to set the ROI of the images for the next frame .
Note that the small_img is a scaled - down version of the input image , so the detection results must be scaled - up to match the real size of the input .
Now , I can bore you with the details of how I changed the cvHaarDetectObjects to use more integers , but I wo n't .
Anyway it 's all in the code , that is freely available , so you can diff it against cvHarr.cpp of OpenCV and see the changes .
In short what I did was :
Mark out image scaling and canny pruning .
in the cvSetImagesForHaarClassifierCascade , which fires many times for each frame and is governed on scaling / shifting / rotating the Haar classifiers to get better detection , I changed the weights and sizes to be integers rather than floats .
in cvRunHaarClassifierCascade , which calculates the score for a single Haar feature - hit , I changed the results calculation to integers instead of floats .
I played around with integer oriented calculations of the sqrt function , that the cvRunHaarClassifierCascade func uses ( fires many many times each frame ) , but that actually caused a slow - down on the device .
Turns out the standard library ( math.h ) implementation is the best
Well guys , that 's pretty much all my discovery in the field .
Please keep working on it .
I 'm anxious to see a true real - time face detection on the iPhone .
Time for a video proof ?

Here 's proof that all I wrote here is not total BS

It 's a staple of the all - American breakfast that has somehow found it 's way into ice cream , cocktail drinks and another American favorite -- pie .
Now the evolution of breakfast continues with a San Mateo , Calif. , couple 's creation aptly named the Bacone .
That 's a cone of bacon .
If a plate is too much of a hassle for your eggs , cheese , hash browns , biscuits and gravy , why not wrap it up and turn it into finger food ?
That 's what Christian Williams and Melissa Tillman did -- and it 's a hit .
" This is just a low - brow breakfast , " Williams told the San Francisco Examiner .
No matter how basic the idea , the self - described techie 's concoction is getting some high - brow attention from gourmet eyes .
His Bacone is a winning recipe that 's taking him places .
The delicious but messy - looking handheld meal won the judges ' choice award at BaconCamp , a gathering for lovers of the porky snack .
( Yes , there 's a whole organization devoted to people who just can't get enough of the strips in their traditional form and it's called BaconCamp .
Hopefully they do n't picnic too close to the kids at fat camp . )
“ People are crazy about bacon , ” said Scott Kveton , a judge at BaconCamp .
“ There ’s an obvious market for it . ”
Williams and Tillman tried many times to perfect the Bacone .
Finally , they figured out how to make all the ingredients mingle in a deep fried dream .
Gourmet magazine wrote about the Bacone in a feature story titled the Gross Food Movement .
Simply put , the Bacone is " Kind of like a breakfast ice cream cone without the sugar high , " the article states .
We assume , however , that there is a cholesterol high .
Kveton is convinced the Bacone will be mass produced in no time .
" I know somebody is going to start making these in a street cart or something .
It 's friggin ' genius . "
Kveton raved .
" I think McDonald 's should be selling these suckers ! "
Now Williams is on his way to the Food Network with his Bacone , alongside Brian Boitano and his Bacontini , in an appearance for a series starting on the network in August .
So , the next time you 're looking for a way to beef up your breakfast , try it Bacone style .
Forget about the calories , grab a handful of napkins and remember -- this crispy side item will never be boring .

Ted Kennedy in 1971 :
Ted Kennedy in 2008 :
Health care reform was Ted 's issue for forty years .
The time is now .
As related on MSNBC earlier today :
The debate about providing health care coverage to all Americans is descending into an ugly turf war .
Some Republicans , such as Senator Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) , only care about bringing down Obama .
DeMint said recently , during a conference call on health care reform , " If we 're able to stop Obama on this , it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him . "
Some say small businesses will suffer if they have to provide health coverage to their employees or that the country can’t afford to provide a " government plan "
The simple truth is the country cannot afford to keep the status quo .
Initial costs for implementation of national health care plan may be expensive but the benefits will far outstrip the negative .
Imagine if all employees were healthy and could count on health care for them and their families when they need it .
Healthy workers , with healthy families , would be more productive workers , more reliable workers and happier workers , knowing that a catastrophic illness in their family would not bankrupt them and they would be able to get needed medical care .
How much is that worth ?
It is clear that most folks do n’t want to see their taxes go up any at all , even if it means helping the 45 million who have no health coverage .
The proposed taxes would be small increases on incomes above $ 250,000 per year , the same folks who got eight years of tax cuts under the previous administration .
Another criticism of the health care proposals is that people will lose their insurance and be forced into a one size fits all government run plan .
That is not what the President has proposed .
Here is the text of an email sent from his office ;
" If you already have health insurance : reform will provide you with more security and stability .
It will limit your own out of pocket costs and prevent your insurance company from dropping your coverage if you get too sick .
You 'll also have affordable insurance options if you lose or change your job .
And it will cover preventive care like check - ups and mammograms that save lives and money .
If you do n't have health insurance : you will finally have guaranteed access to quality , affordable health care , and you can choose the plan that best suits your family 's needs .
And no insurance company will be allowed to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing medical condition . "
At the moment the opposition is focusing on knocking down straw men .
Rick Scott heads Conservatives for Patients ' Rights ( CPR ) and appears in many of their ads .
However CPR has been running deceptive and misleading ads attacking reform as a plan to impose Canadian or British style health care systems which is patently false .
Scott is the former CEO of Columbia / HCA Healthcare .
Scott 's former company was the subject of a seven year investigation which charged Columbia / HCA with fraud and led to a $ 1.7 billion fine .
It is clear that some Republicans have a vested interest in torpedoing health care and that their fundamental drive is to bring down Obama at all costs .
Hopefully the American people can see through their ploy and help get this important objective accomplished .

Howard Dean will be doing vacation duty for Keith Olbermann on Countdown this week .
I hope he does as good of a job filling in for Keith as he did during this interview with CNBC's Maria Bartiromo on Morning Joe .
From Think Progress :
This morning , Dean sparred with CNBC ’s business anchor Maria Bartiromo , who tried to defend the job that private sector has done on health care .
Dean stood his ground , arguing , “ The insurance companies do a terrible job . ”
He added :
If you do a survey of Medicare , most people are happy with Medicare .
There are no bureaucrats interfering between doctors and patients in Medicare .
But there are a lot of bureaucrats interfering between private health insurance companies and patients and doctors . …
It ’s time that the special interests in Congress stopped influencing folks to make their choices for them , and let the American people choose .
He also stopped her in her tracks whe she tried to conflate the pharmaceutical industry with the health insurance industry , and reminded her that they are not the same thing .
You'd think she would have known better since her full time job is supposed to be reporting on the earnings of these same companies .
It 's official .
You wo n't be playing StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty this year , as Blizzard has moved the release date of the real - time strategy game to the " first half of 2010 . "
No , they never dated it ; but they have now .

Activision Blizzard 's reason for the delay of StarCraft II is reportedly tied to the relaunch of its upgraded Battle .
net service , which handles multiplayer for all things Blizzard .
In a statement to the Blizzard community , the developer writes " Over the past couple of weeks , it has become clear that it will take longer than expected to prepare the new Battle .
net for the launch of the game . "
Blizzard calls the new Battle . net an " integral part of the StarCraft II experience and will be an essential part of all of our games moving forward . "
Activision CEO Bobby Kotick said during an investor call today that the new iteration of Battle .
net will likely be ready " early next year . "

While disappointing , it 's not surprising .
Blizzard staffers have indicated a need for a four to six month beta period for StarCraft II , one that has yet to kick off , eight months into 2009 .
Blizzard had previously planned for one " frontline " release this year , largely presumed to be the first entry in the StarCraft II trilogy , a goal that it does n't appear it will be meeting .
Your best bet for going hands - on with StarCraft II in 2009 is either a trip to BlizzCon or ( possibly ) during Gamescom in Cologne .

Passing by these amazing 3D paintings will make you almost believe that there are real people standing by the wall .
The paintings are made in such a way that you would probably try to touch the girl that ’s leaning on the wall or maybe the old lady that ’s resting , because they seem so realistic .
The most surprising thing is that the artist is only using his bare hands and painting to make such tremendous art happen .
You will never think that these human bodies and faces are n’t real , amazing realistic and shocking sculptures .
While NASA 's central mission is the same as it always was -- to send astronauts up , up , and away !-- the details of how it will send bold explorers into the space frontier are suddenly , well , up in the air .
After months of signaling displeasure with NASA 's operations , the Obama administration has ordered a 90 - day review of the human space flight program .
In a letter to NASA Acting Administrator Christopher Scolese , the president 's science adviser , John Holdren , wrote that " it would be only prudent " to review NASA 's human space flight program given the magnitude of its ambitions and " the significant investment of both funds and scientific capital " [ Washington Post ] .
The crux of the matter is the Constellation program , which aims to replace the aging space shuttles with the newly designed Ares rockets and Orion crew capsule .
But during the
past several months , watchdog agencies have questioned whether NASA can deliver the Constellation program on time and within budget .
Its estimated costs through 2015 have risen from $ 28 billion in 2006 to more than $ 40 billion today , and engineers still are wrestling with design flaws that would cause Ares I to shake violently during ascent and also possibly drift into its launch tower [ Orlando Sentinel ] .
Back in December , Obama 's transition team reportedly asked NASA officials if military rockets used to launch satellites could be reconfigured to boost astronauts to the International Space Station and on to the moon .
The announcement of the review coincided with the announcement of the proposed NASA budget .
All told , Obama is requesting roughly $ 18.7 billion for NASA for 2010 , a 5 percent increase that includes a roughly $ 150 million budget hike for the Exploration Mission Directorate - the part of NASA in charge of building the Ares I rocket and Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle [ SPACE.com ] .
NASA officials say that work will continue on these projects while the 90 - day review takes place .
The proposed budget also increased funding for studies of the earth 's changing climate , and
backtracks from an earlier decision by the Obama administration to end all shuttle flights in 2010 .
After heavy lobbying from Florida lawmakers , the White House agreed to complete the nine launches left on the schedule — even if a few slip into 2011 [ Orlando Sentinel ] .

Statement by Chad Stone , Chief Economist , on Today ’s Economic Growth Repor
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- I 'm amazed : Grousing about Goldman Sachs , and fury at the financial sector , is actually reaching the point where something might happen -- maybe even answers to questions we 've been asking for a while .
As Jim Bianco of Bianco Research just noted in his News Clips / Daily Commentary service : " The amount of bad news that [ Goldman Sachs Group GS , +1.82 % ] is generating with its record earnings is incredible .
We cannot remember a company that has received so much scorn for making money . "
Bianco linked to critical stories in the Economist and the New York Times , and a scathing op - ed column ( " The Joy of Sachs " ) by Paul Krugman .
And that 's only the beginning .
Last week , Arianna Huffington in her liberal Huffington Post Webzine actually issued bipartisan praise of two Wall Street Journal pieces critical of Goldman and the bailout .
( Her article is here ; the WSJ pieces here and here . )
It 's many years since Arianna and I were on the same politically incorrect side of one of William F. Buckley 's Firing Line debates .
She has since adroitly changed sides , and if she now thinks it 's time to attack Goldman Sachs -- a major Democratic donor -- the firm is in trouble .
The most spectacular attack on Goldman Sachs : Matthew Taibbi's Rolling Stone article " The Great American Bubble Machine , " posted in Rolling Stone magazine July 13 .
This is a follow - up to Taibbi 's earlier attack on the bailout , which he portrayed all too convincingly as a sort of Wall Street coup d'état .
( See March 30 column . )
Taibbi describes the extraordinary personnel interlock between Goldman Sachs and Washington , apparently regardless of the party in power .
He thinks that a key development was the emergence of Robert Rubin , who became Goldman 's co-chairman and then Bill Clinton 's Treasury secretary .
Taibbi writes : " If America is circling the drain , Goldman Sachs has found a way to be that drain .
...
The bank 's unprecedented reach and power have enabled it to turn all of America into a giant pump - and - dump scam , manipulating whole economic sectors for years at a time , moving the dice game as this or that market collapses , and all the time gorging itself on the unseen costs that are breaking families everywhere . "
Of the bailout , he writes : " The numbers show that Goldman essentially borrowed a $ 5 billion salary payout for its executives in the middle of the global economic crisis it helped cause , using half - baked accounting to reel in investors , just months after receiving billions in a taxpayer bailout . "
Sounds wild , but Taibbi makes a case .
As a Rolling Stone reader says in the article 's comment thread : " The last time I read anything this scary was the New Yorker article about Burmese pythons taking over Florida . "
I 've been reporting for years that key investment letters had come to the conclusion that the financial markets have been manipulated .
( See Sept. 9 , 2005 , column . )
Now this suspicion is all over the mainstream media .
Hmmm .
The scale that would be involved is so spectacular that it dwarfs another issue the letters have been asking about for years : whether the gold price has been systematically suppressed .
( See April 20 column . )
Manipulating gold is an afterthought compared to what was allegedly going on .
I continue to think that a key part of this story is the mysterious 1998 Rubin - orchestrated rescue of Long Term Capital .
( See Sept. 29 , 2008 , column . )
And I 'm increasingly confident all this will end with the appointment of another Pujo Committee , paralleling the one which investigated the so - called " Money Trust " in the wake of the Panic of 1907 .
The consequences will be monumental .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Chemicals in cannabis have been found to stop prostate cancer cells from growing in the laboratory , suggesting that cannabis - based medicines could one day help fight the disease , scientists said Wednesday .
A marijuana plant is shown at Oaksterdam University , a trade school for the cannabis industry , in Oakland , California July 23 , 2009 .

After working initially with human cancer cell lines , Ines Diaz - Laviada and colleagues from the University of Alcala in Madrid also tested one compound on mice and discovered it produced a significant reduction in tumor growth .
Their research , published in the British Journal of Cancer , underlines the growing interest in the medical use of active chemicals called cannabinoids , which are found in marijuana .
Experts , however , stressed that the research was still exploratory and many more years of testing would be needed to work out how to apply the findings to the treatment of cancer in humans .
“ This is interesting research which opens a new avenue to explore potential drug targets but it is at a very early stage , ” said Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , which owns the journal .
“ It absolutely is n’t the case that men might be able to fight prostate cancer by smoking cannabis , ” she added
The cannabinoids tested by the Spanish team are thought to work against prostate cancer because they block a receptor , or molecular doorway , on the surface of tumour cells .
This stops them from dividing .
In effect , the cancer cell receptors can recognize and “ talk to ” chemicals found in cannabis , said Diaz - Laviada .
“ These chemicals can stop the division and growth of prostate cancer cells and could become a target for new research into potential drugs to treat prostate cancer , ” she said .
Her team ’s work with two cannabinoids -- called methanandamide and JWH - 015 -- is the first demonstration that such cannabis chemicals prevent cancer cells from multiplying .
Some drug companies are already exploring the possibilities of cannabinoids in cancer , including British - based cannabis medicine specialist GW Pharmaceuticals .
It is collaborating with Japan ’s Otsuka on early - stage research into using cannabis extracts to tackle prostate cancer -- the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men -- as well as breast and brain cancer .
GW has already developed an under - the - tongue spray called Sativex for the relief of some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis , which it plans to market in Europe with Bayer and Almirall .
Other attempts to exploit the cannibinoid system have met with mixed success .
Sanofi-Aventis was forced to withdraw its weight - loss drug Acomplia from the market last year because of links to mental disorders .
ICC World Twenty20 Group B , Lord's :
Netherlands 163-6 beat England 162 - 5 by four wickets
Match scorecard By Oliver Brett
BBC Sport at Lord's
England crashed to one of their most ignominious cricketing defeats of all time , as the Netherlands won the ICC World Twenty20 curtain - raiser at Lord 's by scoring two runs off the final ball amid scenes of scarcely believable drama .
Chasing a target of 163 , which would have been much higher had England batted with any conviction in the second half of their innings , the Dutch stayed up with the required run-rate throughout .
Tom de Grooth 's 30 - ball innings of 49 was the chief catalyst to a famous victory , and the sheer adventure shown by the Dutch was best exemplified by the four sixes they hit .
England had failed to hit a single one .
All the same , Stuart Broad could have stolen a win for England right at the end .
The last ball was bowled at the Netherlands ' number eight , Edgar Schiferli , who barely managed to get a bat on it .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Broad , as he had with most of the balls in the over , picked up in his follow - through , but turned and missed with the attempted run-out , and the Dutch grabbed an extra run with the overthrow .
Had the bowler chosen to keep the ball , and allow the single , the game would have been decided by a one - over eliminator .
Bowling an unusual round - the - wicket angle , Broad bowled a series of yorkers at Schiferli and Ryan ten Doeschate .
But somehow the two right - handers scampered singles off each of the first five balls and incredibly , there could have been a wicket from four of them .
Broad spurned two run-out opportunities and James Foster one , while Broad also dropped a chance when Ten Doeschate drove a drive back above his head .
While the recriminations will continue long after the dust has settled on this landmark result - England 's only previous loss to an associate nation was against Zimbabwe in the 1992 World Cup , but they did not need to win that match - and , in truth , the night was as much about a brilliant team performance from the Dutch as the desperately lacklustre cricket England produced .
Luke Wright and Ravi Bopara put on 100 off 66 balls
After persistent rain during the day had caused a 20 - minute delay , and severely curtailed the opening ceremony , England were put in to bat and raced to 100 - 0 from 11 overs thanks to Luke Wright ( 71 ) and Ravi Bopara ( 46 ) .
The Netherlands ' trump card was Dirk Nannes , who has Indian Premier League experience , allied to spells with Victoria and Middlesex .
But the left - arm paceman opened up with a nervous , low full toss , and the in - form Bopara stretched across to bounce it over point 's head for four .
Wright also hit his first ball for four , Schiferli drifting into the right - hander 's pads to be guided past the short fine - leg .
Bopara was by far the most composed of the two batsmen , effortlessly square - driving Ten Doeschate in his Essex team - mate 's first over .
Wright , who failed to time the ball as sweetly , nevertheless continued to add to the barrage of runs .
But eventually , Bopara skied Ten Doeschate to wide long - on , and England , who brought in Rob Key for the injured Kevin Pietersen , barely did anything right for the rest of the match .
Owais Shah drilled Schiferli to deep square - leg , then Eoin Morgan reverse - swept Borren to backward point .
TMS : BLOG Swann has been one of England 's best bowlers this year - how did he lose his place in the side to Adil Rashid ?
BBC Sport 's Oliver Brett Embarrassingly , the last two overs yielded just 13 runs after Wright and captain Paul Collingwood had perished to catches in the deep , leaving Foster and Key to scramble singles in some desperation .
Of the five Dutch bowlers used , only Nannes failed to take a wicket , while none got the punishment they might have feared .
Though the Netherlands ' run chase began poorly , Alexei Kervezee chipping James Anderson to mid-on in an over costing just two , it soon got some much - needed rocket fuel with a couple of sixes from the beefy Darron Reekers .
First , he pulled Ryan Sidebottom for a majestic maximum before using effortless timing to send Anderson over the ropes at square leg .
England must have thought they could breathe more easily when Broad had him caught at mid-wicket .
But by now , the Dutch were up with the required rate and a splendid innings from De Grooth reduced the hosts to quivering wrecks .
The 30 - year - old right - hander produced the innings of his life .
He followed up a straight six off Broad with a reverse sweep for four in Adil Rashid 's first over .
Wright and Collingwood were also calmly despatched for De Grooth boundaries , all of which made Foster 's stumping of Bas Zuiderent slightly irrelevant .
De Grooth hit two massive sixes during his innings
The excitable tension that was sweeping through the 1,000 or so Dutch fans in the Mound Stand was converted into belief that something remarkable might happen when Peter Borren hit Collingwood into the top tier of the Grandstand .
Finally , from the last ball of the 13th over , De Grooth 's drive off Collingwood caught a leading edge and looped invitingly to extra cover .
But with 47 needed from the last 42 balls , the Dutch were favourites , especially with the accomplished Ten Doeschate at the crease .
England dug deep .
Their ground - fielding remained nervous , as run-out chances were squandered , but for the time being their catching did not .
However , with little more than singles needed , the Dutch continued to go for glorious boundaries , and that gave England a chance .
Borren skied a pull shot , Daan van Bunge speared a catch to deep point and with 16 wanted from the last 10 balls England were back in it .
At that precise moment , Ten Doeschate launched a Sidebottom full toss into the off - side , and Morgan , diving at full length in front of the Dutch fans , dropped a tough chance and parried the ball over the ropes for four .
Though Broad then had his chances to save England 's blushes at the death , by then the Dutch would not have deserved to lose .
By some margin , this was their most significant cricketing victory .
And boy did they look like they wanted to celebrate it as they sprinted towards their fans at the end .

To go truly organic these days , you might want to stop by the cosmetics aisle after picking out your fruit and vegetables .
With the great care , and money , needed to earn USDA certification , a small but growing number of companies are hoping that having their products certified will yield a bountiful cash crop .
Think of it as tilling the soil and filling the register till .
" It 's the strictest , hardest and most authentic one you can get , " says author and designer Danny Seo , whose recently launched line of Whole Earth lotions and body washes bear the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Organic Seal like a little green badge of honor .
Organic makeup , lotions and body washes - which the industry calls personal care products - are not new .
What is new is the determination of some companies to use the most prestigious emblem available : the government 's ultra - strict food - grade standard .
Currently , the Food and Drug Administration regulates personal care products but not the term organic , which is solely the USDA 's jurisdiction .
Demand for organic
Recent data show personal care products that used the term organic have increased sales 19 percent since 2007 , to $ 443 million last year , according to the Organic Trade Association .
And in the four years since a lawsuit was brought by the Organic Consumers Association and Dr. Bronner 's - an activist Southern California soap company that pressured the federal National Organic Program to include USDA organic certification for personal care products - only a fraction of the market has been able to meet the government 's 95 percent standard ( see " The legal battle over organic " ) .
That 's because the certification requires that not only the ingredients in the product , but also everyone involved in the manufacturing process , from the grower to the handler to the processor , be certified organic .
Satisfying the organic requirements greatly increases an item 's price point , however , making it a harder sell , not only to the consumer , but also for the company .
Toss in an organic product 's inherently shorter shelf life - USDA standards prohibit chemical preservatives - and it's a wonder anyone would go through the hassle when Ivory makes " 99.44 % pure formula " bar soap for less than a buck apiece .
But organic proponents see it differently .
" It 's worth it to us , " says Karen Behnke , founder of celebrity darling Juice Beauty , a San Francisco skin care line that uses organic juice as its product base .
She says pursuing USDA organic certification ups her costs by at least 50 percent but justifies the expense : " We 're mission driven and committed to our No. 1 value : authentic organic . "
That kind of commitment is what consumers deserve , even if they have n't realized it yet , says Honor Schauland , Web editor of the Organic Consumers Association in Minnesota .
" If you 're gonna go the extra mile to eat organic , it makes sense with putting stuff on your skin , " she says .
A host of private groups offer certification , including OASIS , NSF International and Quality Assurance International in the United States , and Ecocert and the Soil Association in Europe , but none are government approved .
The only exceptions are the National Organic Program 's recent recognition of Canadian organic practices and state legislation in California and Utah .
Yet even if those private standards could obtain government recognition , it would be meaningless from a consumer perspective , says Michelle Barry , senior vice president of the Hartmann Group , a Seattle consumer research firm .
" Those are a waste of time , " says Barry , who wrote her dissertation on the organic and sustainability movement .
" The USDA symbol is the only one that mainstream consumers can recognize .
It 's the most recognizable and credible symbol that would inspire consumers to try a new product in the organic non -food space .
The other ones , they 're just noise . "
And it appears that consumers may not have to worry , with the National Organic Standards Board - the organic program 's advisory panel - poised to issue its opinion on organic personal care product standards in September .
A recommendation to maintain the USDA standard would be the agency 's first step on the road to regulation and enforcement .
Hype in a bottle ?
These moves , coupled with Dr. Bronner 's latest lawsuit - claims of false advertising against seven corporations and two certifiers filed in July in San Francisco Superior Court - could bring stability to the organic sphere .
Regulation and lawsuits aside , there 's also debate over whether organic skin care products are better than cheaper drugstore variety .
Studies of organic food , including an English study released earlier this week , have not found much if any differences .
" It 's all marketing hype , if you think about it , " says Dr. Richard Glogau , a UCSF clinical professor of dermatology , who has been in private practice for 30 years .
Just because your moisturizer is made with organic grapes does n't mean it works any better than something that has synthetic or chemical ingredients , he says .
If you want truly 100 percent certified organic , save $ 20 and smear grape jelly on your face , he jokes .
According to Glogau , those synthetic ingredients safely improve a product 's efficacy , making it sudsier or a more powerful cleaning agent , for example .
Forsaking them in the name of organic labeling just is n't practical , he says .
There are some within the industry who support the creation of a government - regulated organic standard specifically designed for personal care products , not food .
Donya Fahmy , owner of Dropwise Essentials , an aromatherapy and body care company in San Francisco , says that USDA certification was too costly for her small business .
" It certainly gives some layer of consumer assurance , but it 's somewhat misleading because it 's very strict with what you can put in it .
...
In personal care products , there are certain preservatives and other ingredients that are used for stability and shelf life , " she says .
Safety first
In the end , all agree that what matters is consumer safety .
" If it 's not safe to put in your mouth , it 's probably not safe to put on your skin , " Fahmy says .
" But does that mean it has to be organic certified ?
No .
But I would like to see some kind of standardization . "
The legal battle over organic In July , Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps , a family owned soap manufacturer in Escondido ( San Diego County ) , again filed suit in San Francisco Superior Court , accusing seven corporations and two certifiers - including Hain Celestial 's Jason , Avalon , Kiss My Face , YSL Beaute Inc. , and the certification companies Ecocert and OASIS - of false advertising under the 1946 Lanham Trademark Act .
In the complaint , Dr. Bronner 's alleges that these companies and certifiers allow the use of " non-organic pesticide - intensive agricultural and / or petrochemical material to make the main cleansing and moisturizing ingredients " in their organic - labeled products and are not in compliance with National Organic Program standards .
Though the company supports the NOP and its advisory panel , the National Organic Standards Board , and participated in the board 's May meeting - a precursor to September 's highly anticipated recommendation on personal care product standards - it will pursue its litigation because the regulation process simply takes too long , says President David Bronner .
" We want to keep the lawsuit going as insurance , " he says .
" The personal care industry is devaluing the meaning behind the organic brand , " the fifth - generation soapmaker says .
" And those in the industry are worried about a backlash in organic foods . "

Stewart Cink won the 138th Open Championship at Turnberry in dramatic circumstances .
After four days play , Americans Tom Watson and Stewart Cink could n't be separated and took each other on in a 4 - hole playoff .
Cink is 23 years his junior and it showed as Watson struggled to keep his game together and eventually lost by six shots .
" Playing against Tom Watson , this just does n't happen this stuff .
I grew up hoping i could one day follow in his footsteps " said champion Cink .
" I just feel so happy to be a part of it ,
" It 'll be the most crucial putt that I 've ever struck in my life
It 's just such a sweet feeling - it 's almost indescribable . "
The news all week had been if 59 - year old Tom Watson could win an incredible sixth Claret Jug and join Harry Vardon as the most successful links player of all time .
Watson could have put the championship to bed if he had made par on the 18th but he took a 5 despite a relatively easy eight - footer to finish .
The eight - time major winner had looked undaunted by the additional pressure until the final hole .
36 - year old Cink 's previous best performance was sixth at The Open in 2007 and this is his first major and 13th win as a professional .
He joins the list of unlikely winners of the Claret Jug including names like Lawrie , Hamilton and Curtis .
Cink was an unpopular winner , not for any fault of his own but simply because of the fairytale a Watson victory promised .
Expectations were high after Greg Norman 's heroics in last year 's Open - he was a mere youngster at 53 .
" It 's not the first time I 've been the under - the - radar guy . "
Cink added .
Playoff as it happened
5th : Cink makes par with an excellent bunker recovery .
Watson can't take advantage of a better position and takes 5 .
Watson looks nervous , the mental flow is all with the younger of the two right now .
Cink one up .
6th : Cink safely on the green with his tee shot , Watson pulls it right into the spectator area but recovers well for an excellent up and down 3 .
No nerves shown there .
Cink matches his three .
Cink one up .
17th : Cink plays a good drive , Watson in the heavy and hairy stuff .
Hate to say it but he 's showing his age here .
Takes two to get out and it 's basically lights out .
Cink makes birdie , Watson double - bogey .
Cink four up .
18th : Watson 's game has fallen to pieces and Cink has been faultless .
He hits it into the crowd and eventually recovers for a bogey , Cink birdies .
Cink wins by 6 .
Other finishers
Further down the leaderboard were two Englishmen - Lee Westwood and Chris Wood both finished a shot further back on one - under for the championship .
It was paticularly galling for Westwood - still chasing his first major - having three - putted on 18 and effectively played himself out of a share of the lead .
Wood carded a hugely impressive 67 to storm up the leaderboard , just running out of steam at the end .
" I thought I 'd made an eagle at 17 , thought I 'd made a putt at 16 and thought I 'd hit a good shot at 15 but just went into that trap . "
Westwood told BBC Sport .
" I am feeling fairly low now having three - putted the last but 18 is not an easy hole .
You can make bogey there but if you hit the fairway you can make birdie .
I figured I would need to make birdie to tie Tom .
It is fantastic to be in the thick of it and it is right where you want to be . "
In a three - way tie for fifth was Luke Donald of England , South African Retief Goosen and unheralded Australian Matt Goggin .
Donald finished with a hugely impressive 67 whilst Goggin started leading but carded a disappointing 73 .
Somewhat more disappointing was the performance of much - fanced Englishman Ross Fisher .
Fisher took an 8 on the fifth which he could never recover from .
He finished on 2 over for the championship , in a tie for 13th place .
Italian Matteo Manassero won the silver medal for leading amateur and finished in a brilliant 13th place .
Big things must surely be expected of the 16 - year old phenom .
" It was fun watching you all week Tom " said Cink .
And that 's the truth .

At a press event hosted by the New York Public Library , Sony put their recently announced Reader hardware on display and provided an overview of its recent announcements .
But the event was more than simply a recap of past announcements .
The library location provided context for a program , run through Sony 's e-book store , which will allow users to identify their local public library borrow books through its site .
There is also new hardware : by the holidays , Sony plans on having a 3G - enabled Reader with a tall seven - inch screen .
The upcoming hardware is called the Reader Daily Edition , which implies partnerships with news outlets .
However , aside from the price and 3G capabilities , almost nothing was mentioned about the device .
The Sony executive that ran his company 's portion of the program ( Steve Haber , president of its Digital Reading Business Division ) did little more than wave the hardware in front of the audience ; it was n't even clear if it could actually be turned on .
Still , it 's clear that Sony is gearing up for a long - term battle with not only the Kindle , but the upcoming device ( devices ? ) from Plastic Logic .
For now , however , Sony is attempting to leverage content as its competitive edge .
The company had already announced that it was adopting the EPUB format , which is an XML - based standard for storing text that can be reflowed for different screen formats .
As a result of that decision , the Sony library management software would be able to handle books from other resellers ;
Sony announced that over 200 members of the American Bookseller 's Association would be selling compatible books that use Adobe 's DRM service .
Sony is already offering access to public domain works from Google Books as well , and we talked briefly with Trip Adler from Scribd , who said his company 's self - published works could easily be put on the reader via either PDF or EPUB .
So it 's clear that Sony is taking the opposite approach from Amazon , focusing on selling hardware that can display content from just about anywhere .
That " anywhere " will apparently include libraries .
According to Sony's Haber , the new version of its online book store will allow users to enter their ZIP code and determine whether the local library offers electronic versions of its books .
These books can be downloaded , at which point they 'll have a 21 - day expiration date — no late fees , as Haber was happy to point out .
The New York Public Library 's representative announced that his organization would be taking part in the service .
That 's a rather significant announcement , given that he said that the NYPL 's website was the second - most visited online library , behind only the Library of Congress .
The new library software will have both Mac and PC versions , opening up the software to a wider audience .
It 's supposed to be available immediately , but neither of the software updates — the updated e-book store with library finder or the 3.0 version of the desktop library management software — were available as we prepared this story .
Functional hardware
Sony was showing off the Reader hardware ( Pocket and Touch ) editions that will be going on sale before the summer is over , and we had a chance to test some of it out .
The Pocket Edition is way too large to fit in a typical pocket , but it is the smallest hardware we 've seen yet .
It 's not touchscreen , but it does have nicely laid out controls that provide easier access to menu and list items than Amazon 's offering .
In some ways , the hardware controls are superior to the touchscreen — there 's no ambiguity about a button press , so if the display is unresponsive ( a common event with eInk screens ) , you know that it 's probably just a matter of waiting .
That was n't clear when using some features on the Touch Edition .
Some people using the Touch were attempting to add notes to it , and it was difficult to interpret their failures , as it was n't clear whether the touches were n't registering , they were performing the wrong action , or the hardware was just being unresponsive .
Sony 's also changed the software slightly from its previous touchscreen version , which bewildered some experienced users .
Nevertheless , for the most part , the software was well laid out , and it was easy to navigate on screen .
The keyboard was arranged in a standard , offset - QWERTY format , which I found far easier to use than Amazon 's vertical arrangement .
The screen registered keystrokes with a small click when depressed , providing tactile feedback ; the largest problem seemed to be that the touches sometimes registered at a slightly different position than the keys appeared on screen , a consequence of the depth difference between the touch and display hardware .
Notes can be exported back to the desktop software with an image of the text they were associated with , so even if the underlying library book expires , the effort is n't lost ; maybe Sony did n't want to be targeted with a class action lawsuit , such as the one that Amazon was hit with .
Sony also announced that it would have the Readers on display at 8500 retail locations , giving potential users a chance to try before buying .
In contrast to a lot of areas , where the company seems to be flailing , it 's obvious that Sony has a clear strategy here : offer a variety of hardware with different features and price points , and give its owners the option of obtaining material from a wide variety of sources , including their own documents .
Making that a profitable strategy is going to be challenging , however , as the Readers will be competing with Amazon 's Kindle , new arrivals on the market , and ( perhaps most significantly ) smartphones and netbooks that can easily handle reading material .
Tempted to smoke ?
( Image : Roger - Viollet / Rex Features )
Oscar Wilde was speaking for all of us when he said : “ I can resist everything except temptation . ”
Loran Nordgren at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Chicago and colleagues confirmed this while looking at the importance of “ restraint bias ” – the way people miscalculate how much temptation they can handle .
They found that the people who were least confident at their ability to resist fared best – because they kept temptation well out of their way .
In one experiment , 53 smokers were invited to undergo a battery of diagnostic tests .
The first test was bogus and used only to sort them randomly into two groups .
Members of one group were then told they had a “ high capacity for impulse control ” , while the others were labelled “ low ” .

The subjects were then asked to watch a 30 - minute clip of the film “ Coffee and Cigarettes ” and told that they would win money if they managed not to smoke for the duration of the film .
They were given a cigarette and had to decide where to leave it : in another room , on a desk , in their hand or in their mouth .
The closer to their mouth they left the cigarette , the more money they stood to gain if they resisted temptation .
I can hack it …
People in the group that had been led to believe they had poor impulse control were more likely to leave the cigarette on the desk or in the other room .
Those who had been told they had good impulse control risked holding it or even putting it in their mouths .
But the closer to their mouth someone left the cigarette , the more likely they were to light up .
“ People with the most confidence were the most likely to fail , ” says Nordgren .
Other experiments supported this conclusion .
In a field study , former smokers who had quit for three weeks were asked how confident they were about their self - control and what temptations they were actively avoiding .
Four months later , 60 per cent of the most confident , who were the least careful about avoiding triggers , had resumed smoking , whereas only 40 per cent of the more vigilant folks had .
“ We do n’t appreciate how powerful temptation can be , ” says Nordgren , and our brains may prime us for addiction .
Avoiding the temptation altogether is the only way to stay out of trouble , he says .

In another interview during the same promotional tour , he added : " All the people in Britain wish for at the moment is Tony Blair 's head .
Nothing else matters .
Le fabricant d'électronique japonais
Sony a confirmé mercredi 5 août la sortie prochaine aux Etats - Unis de deux nouveaux modèles de livre électronique .
L'objectif est de concurrencer le Kindle d'Amazon , qui domine actuellement le marché .
Un modèle " de poche " à 199 dollars ( 138 euros ) , le prix le plus modeste du marché , sera proposé en plusieurs couleurs et doté d'un écran de 12,5 centimètres de diagonale .
Un autre à 299 dollars ( 208 euros ) sera doté d'un écran tactile de 15 cm .
Enfin ,
Sony ramène le prix moyen de l'ouvrage téléchargé de 11,99 à 9,99 dollars ( 8,34 à 6,95 euros ) , ce qui le met au niveau des livres vendus en téléchargement par Amazon et par la chaîne de librairies Barnes & Noble , qui commercialise également des titres électroniques .
Les utilisateurs de la tablette de lecture Sony auront également un accès simplifié à la bibliothèque numérique Google de plus d'un million de livres tombés dans le domaine public .
Les nouveaux modèles
Sony seront vendus à partir d'août aux Etats - Unis dans des chaînes de grande distribution , comme BestBuy et Wal - Mart , alors que le Kindle est exclusivement vendu en ligne .
Les Etats - Unis sont le plus gros marché pour les livres électroniques de Sony , a indiqué une porte - parole du groupe , bien qu'ils soient également distribués au Canada , en France , en Allemagne , en Autriche et en Suisse .
Aucune date de lancement n'a été annoncée pour les nouveaux modèles hors des Etats - Unis .
Les deux nouveaux modèles
Sony exigeront toujours le branchement sur un ordinateur pour le téléchargement d'ouvrages , à la différence de l'appareil d'Amazon , qui a conclu un accord avec l'opérateur téléphonique Sprint pour permettre un téléchargement sans fil aux Etats - Unis .
Grand concurrent du " Reader " de Sony , le Kindle , qui n'a pas d'écran tactile , est également vendu à 299 dollars depuis quelques semaines dans sa version classique , après une baisse de prix .
Amazon commercialise également un modèle de taille plus grande , à 459 dollars ( 319 euros ) , particulièrement adapté à la lecture de livres universitaires et de journaux .
Le Monde avec AFP
The clouded leopard cubs born at the Smithsonian National Zoo ’s Conservation and Research Center ( CRC ) are both male as confirmed by the veterinary team .
The cubs , born on March 24 , are a healthy 1 pound 3 - 5 oz .
each and have opened their eyes .
They are now eating every four hours , down from their original schedule of a feeding every three hours .
A little while back , I spent a few hours playing Gearbox Software ’s upcoming , toon - styled , free - roaming FPS - RPG .
I was horribly , desperately hungover at the time , and was almost sick on Randy Pitchford while he was cheerily explaining the thinking behind Borderlands to me .
I am the most professional of all the games journalists .
But that does n’t matter .
Only the game matters .
Here ’s how it is .
( Click on the pics for bigguns , by the way ) .
It was mutiny .
Gearbox head Randy Pitchford did n’t want it – he just wanted to finish and ship the damned game .
His artists , though , were bored and frustrated .
Mutiny .
In secret , they returned to work .
They created an art style that totally reinvigorated Borderlands , one so impressive that Pitchford immediately abandoned his plans to shut down this little troupe of breakaways .
He also claims that it was enough of shock to also dramatically shake - up Gearbox ’s whole approach to development .
( I ’ll be bunging up an interview with him on such matters in the next couple of days , incidentally ) .
Here and now though , what matters is n’t so much whether the happy accident of the comicbook character outlines and semi-cell - shading should or should n’t have happened , but whether it suits the game .
Or , whether the game suits it .
The answer to that is an even more important question : how does Borderlands play ?
We ’ve heard about the thousands of weapon combinations , that there ’ll be free - roaming of a sort , a post - apocalyptic wasteland and Mad Maxian vehicles , but what we do n’t know is , well , what happens when you sit in front of your PC and fire up this game .
It ’s like Fallout 3 .
No , wait , it ’s like Hellgate .
No , wait , it ’s like Doom .
Well … it has some of the core values of all of those , but a very different implementation .
It ’s an RPG - FPS , fundamentally .
But unlike Fallout 3 and Mass Effect and Hellgate , this is n’t an FPS - like targeting reticule built awkwardly on top of dice - rolls and statistics .
It ’s statistics and dice - rolls built on top of a first - person shooter .
That simple inversion is key to why Borderlands works – this is an action game first and foremost .
You wo n’t find yourself lost eight phrases deep in a dialogue tree .
You wo n’t find a precisely - targeted headshot failing to hit because of some invisible maths , and you wo n’t find that aiming somewhere within a 20 - foot radius of someone automagically punches a bullet through their chest .
You will find that hiding behind a rock or running away stops you from getting shot .
As does shooting first , and accurately .
The RPG stuff comes as a result of playing the FPS stuff well – you take out the various homicidal men , mutants and mutant - men efficiently , you earn yer XP and your loot drops .
It sounds phenomenally simple , and it is .
It ’s just that no - one ’s done it right before .
Well , there ’s Deus Ex and System Shock 2 , but this is scarcely attempting to be those .
No moral deliberation , philosophical pondering or literary references here .
This is about the joy of meatheadery .
It ’s very fast and very silly – more TimeSplitters than Half - Life .
You battle Mutant Midget Psychos and are guided around by blind drunkards and crying robots .
You wield triple rocket launchers and quad - barrelled shotguns .
You respawn instantly into a New - U clone body upon death .
You score critical hits on rad - addled dog - things by shooting them in the open mouth .
It ’s openly ridiculous , and the hyper - stylised look only boosts the glee of that .
Pitchford describes it as “ the polar opposite of Brothers in Arms ” , and he ’s not wrong .
This is a game geared utterly towards instant , out of the box fun .
There are 30 core story missions and 120 side - missions ; after a spot of being shepherded through some introductory stuff , you ’re free to go fairly off - piste .
Alternatively , you can go straight to the co-op mode .
Procedural weapon generation based on combining a raft of randomly - selected elements – e.g. x base gun template + x barrels +
x type of ammunition + x barrel - length – means there are more guns in the game than Gearbox can count .
It ’s somewhere in the hundreds of thousands , they think .
If you pick up something incredible ( the now traditional white , green , blue , purple loot colour system denotes something ’s degree of awesomeness ) , you ’d better watch your back .
When you die [ yikes – my useless memory managed to conflate dying with a system crash that did cost me all my stuff ] sell or discard a gun , that massive , massive degree of randomness means you ’ll probably never see the same one ever again .
If you find something spectacular , you can consider it nigh - on unique .
Sadly the vehicles were n’t on show at this demo , which also meant I did n’t get a clear sense of how freely you can roam , but if it ’s based upon similarly unbound , randomatic principles , I ’m expecting only good things .
It ’s the thrill of high - speed violence paired with the compulsion of loot collection .
That ’s a dangerous combination , and in the wrong hands an incredibly cynical one .
Given that Pitchford repeatedly trots out variants of “ fuck it , let ’s just have fun ” , it ’s pretty clear that cynicism does n’t play much part in Borderland ’s DNA .
It is n’t a tactical shooter , and it is n’t a talky RPG .
It steps back to the base level of both genres and then piles style and energy on top .
It ’s the opposite of feature creep – returning to why people wanted to shoot monsters in the face and collect shiny things in the first place .
From what I played , it would n’t be wrong to call it shallow .
It would be wrong to call that shallowness a bad thing .
Pitchford again : “ we ’re dancing around innovation more than we ’ve ever done before . ”
In the land of the endless cover systems , unbound carnage is king .
That said , I ’m a little worried about the intense - yet - aimless nature of the co-op mode .
I ’ll need to play it for much longer to get a real sense of it , I suspect , but in the half hour or so I had there was n’t much teamwork beyond panicked heals ( a one - button task ) of fallen comrades and occasionally all shooting the same monster .
It was fun , and intuitive , and fast enough to scratch a testosteronal itch almost instantly , but it felt perhaps a bit too vague and messy to yield the sense of satisfaction you get from , say , finishing a Left 4 Dead co-op campaign .
Then again , I was playing a slim , out - of - context slice .
I certainly got a bit more of a kick out of the roaming , questing and levelling up of the singleplayer , though .
What else ?
XP unlocks new abilities , but your own FPS prowess is absolutely vital .
Pitchford talks about a level 4 player taking down level 10 mobs , simply due to his expert way with a targeting reticule .
Oh , and there ’s a bunch of different classes to play as – a straight - up Soldier , the sniper prowess and vicious winged pet of the Hunter , the mystical steathing of the Siren and , my personal favourite , the meaty melee of the Berserker .
Hand - to - hand combat for everyone else is largely just a panicked stab at an enemy who ’s got too close , but the Berserker can enter a frenzy mode ( expandable by spending level - earned skill points – eventually , I was gaining health every time I killed someone in rage mode ) that maps a barrel - sized fist to each mouse - button .
THUMP THUMP THUMP .
Yeah , he ’s kinda like the Heavy .
The Heavy , though , does n’t get to punch 20 - foot - tall mutant insects to death .
I ’m definitely playing Berserker .
So does Borderlands live up to its art - style ?
Totally .
Of course , the real proof of this death - pudding is in whether it can remain this spectacular and compulsive for a couple of dozen sustained hours .
We ’ll find that out for sure this October .

One hundred years ago , the US convened the International Opium Conference .
This meeting of 13 nations in Shanghai was the beginning of global drug prohibition .
Prohibition slowly became one of the most universally applied policies in the world .
But a century on , international support for this blanket drug policy is slowly but inexorably unravelling .
In January , Barack Obama became the third US president in a row to admit to consumption of cannabis .
Bill Clinton had admitted using cannabis but denied ever inhaling it .
George Bush was taped saying in private he would never admit in public to having used cannabis .
When Obama was asked whether he had inhaled cannabis , he said : '' Of course .
That was the whole point . ''
Obama has candidly discussed his drug use .
'' Pot had helped , and booze ; maybe a little blow [ cocaine ] when you could afford it . ''
He has also admitted the ' ' war on drugs is an utter failure ' ' and called for more focus on a public health approach .
In February , a Latin American drug policy commission similarly concluded that the ' ' drug war is a failure ' ' .
It recommended breaking the ' ' taboo on open debate including about cannabis decriminalisation ' ' .
The same month , an American diplomat said the US supported needle - exchange programs to help reduce the transmission of HIV and other blood - borne diseases , and supported using medication to treat those addicted to opiates .
In an effort to expand its Linux offerings , Dell is researching new netbook - type devices and will soon offer netbook Linux OS upgrades , a company official said on Wednesday .
The company is researching the possibility of offering new Linux - based mobile devices called smartbooks , said Todd Finch , senior product marketing manager for Linux clients , at the OpenSourceWorld conference in San Francisco .
The company will also upgrade its Ubuntu Linux OS for netbooks to the latest version in the next few weeks , he said .
Smartbooks are netbook - type devices that are powered by chips designed by Arm .
The devices mostly support the Linux OS and are designed for those who rely on the Web for most of their computing .
Dell could n't say whether it would ultimately offer a smartbook .
Smartbooks have similar characteristics to netbooks , including cramped keyboards and small screens .
No major PC vendor has yet announced an interest in smartbooks , though small vendors are pushing them as an alternative to netbooks , which are mostly based on Intel 's Atom chips and come with Microsoft 's Windows OS .
Many vendors , including Qualcomm and Freescale , are providing Arm chips for smartbooks that could hit shelves by the end of this year .
Smartbooks with Arm chips have inherent advantages over x86 chips like Atom , such as lower power consumption and longer battery life , Finch said .
The chips are also becoming more powerful , as indicated by the growing number of applications on smartphones , he said .
" I think it 's natural and reasonable for us to begin looking at them as they begin scaling their processors up , " Finch said .
Putting an Arm chip -- mainly found in smartphones -- inside a lightweight PC could provide an early entry point for Dell into the smartphone space , said Jay Chou , research analyst at IDC .
Dell has hinted at entering the smartphone area many times , but no product has materialized yet .
While netbooks are the craze , smartbooks are hard to ignore , Chou said .
Interest in the device will grow over time because it enables lightweight and low - priced computing devices , which could interest PC makers .
Pricing is also a major criteria for buyers , and Linux netbooks are cheaper than their Windows counterparts .
But smartbooks could struggle as Windows remains the dominant OS for netbook - type devices , with a strong software ecosystem around it , Chou said .
Smartbooks may have a hard time gaining traction , and much of their future success will depend on the software ecosystem .
The target market for smartbooks will be no different from Linux - based netbooks as they both have the same usage scenario , Dell 's Finch said .
Like smartbooks , Linux - based netbooks are targeted at those looking for quick access to Web - based applications .
" The more [ Web - based ] applications there are , the better it is for Linux , " Finch said .
The growing interest in Linux is partly driven by Dell 's success with Linux on its netbooks .
Close to a third of all netbooks
Dell ships during certain quarters are preloaded with Linux , he said .
Dell is currently the fifth - largest netbook vendor worldwide , according to IDC's Chou .
Linux - based netbooks made up about 5 percent of overall worldwide shipments during the last quarter .
However , a bulk of Dell 's netbooks today ship with Windows XP , which remains the OS of choice for consumers , Finch said .
The popularity of Windows wo n't change overnight , he said .
" There are still a large percentage of people that prefer Windows , even on a netbook , " Finch said .
Many are familiar with the look and feel of Windows , and are unwilling to trade in for the longer battery life offered by Linux .
He could n't comment about the possible adoption rates of Windows 7 , which is due for release on Oct. 22 .
Dell currently offers Ubuntu Linux version 8.04 with the Mini 10 v netbook , which is being upgraded to the latest 9.04 version -- code - named Jaunty Jackalope -- in the next few weeks .
Dell will be pre-loading the Web- centric Ubuntu Netbook Remix , which is designed for small screen sizes , on future netbooks .
Its Web - centric design provides quick access to online applications , and the OS builds in support for a larger number of drivers .
The company is also researching Google 's Chrome for use in netbooks .
The OS is a thin version of a Linux - based operating system that also will provide quick access to the Web and online applications .
LAS VEGAS -- Drew Johnson and his wife , Tina had the life many Americans only dream of : A big house in a swanky suburb , a backyard hot tub , and a $ 100,000 deposit on a new condo with views of the Las Vegas Strip and 24 - hour concierge service .
They did it all on the salaries of a construction - equipment salesman and a cocktail waitress who brought in $ 1,000 a week in tips alone .
But the recession has slashed their incomes by nearly half , and financing for the condo might not come through .
" It 's Vegas , " says Mr. Johnson , who fears he could lose most of his deposit .
" We gambled . "
During the boom years , Las Vegas was n't just a place where gamblers could hit the jackpot , but where hard - working hotel maids and cocktail waitresses could , too .
The city offered something almost no other place in America did : upward mobility for the working class .
Now , that is evaporating .
The recession has jolted Las Vegas in a fundamental way .
Like other job - creating cities in the Sunbelt , Las Vegas saw its population , income levels and housing prices surge over the past decade .
And like those cities -- including Phoenix , Orlando and San Diego -- it 's been battered in the bust .
But by many measures , Las Vegas 's rise and fall has been more dramatic than most .
Last year , Clark County 's population declined for the first time in more than two decades .
More than 10,000 people left Las Vegas between July 2007 and July 2008 , according to Keith Schwer , director for the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada Las Vegas .
The unemployment rate in the metropolitan area tripled from 4 % in May 2007 to just over 12.3 % in June 2009 , higher than the national rate of 9.5 % .
And after the median price of existing homes rose by 122 % in sales between 2000 and 2006 -- more than double the national rise of 49 % -- sale prices fell by 30 % between last year and this year .
The big bet that fueled Las Vegas 's growth for so long is the same one that 's now going bad : tourism .
Vegas expanded into the lucrative market for business meetings and conventions , building massive exhibition halls and new hotels and casinos .
Construction jobs multiplied and the housing market bubbled over .
Now that tourism and business travel have collapsed , Vegas has little else to cushion the blow .
Even some long - time Vegas stalwarts now believe the era of astounding growth is over .
" I do n't see any opportunities for any development in Las Vegas , " said Las Vegas Sands chief executive Sheldon Adelson in an interview .
Mr. Adelson , who in 1999 opened the Venetian , a Vegas - style replica of Venice complete with indoor canals , rattled off a list of U.S. states he has his eye on now : Massachusetts , Florida , Kentucky , Ohio , Texas .
All along the Las Vegas Strip , massive , half - finished edifices may never see a grand opening .
Last month , the $ 3.5 billion Fontainebleau Las Vegas hotel and casino declared bankruptcy , and 3,500 construction workers lost their jobs .
Other projects , such as the $ 5 billion Echelon resort , a hotel tower at Caesar 's Palace and a luxury condo tower at the Palazzo , also halted construction .
" There wo n't be another [ casino ] property built in Las Vegas for a decade , " says Jim Murren , chief executive of MGM Mirage , Nevada 's largest employer .
Mr. Murren 's company plans to move forward with the opening of City Center , the $ 8.4 billion resort and residential project that the Johnsons bought into .
When it 's completed later this year , City Center is expected to employ 12,000 workers , a bright spot for Las Vegas employment .
But many casino operators are worried the nearly 5,000 new hotel rooms will flood the market with new supply while demand is down .
That could further depress prices at a time when visitors are already spending less on food , gambling and spa services , say casino executives .
Much in the way jobs on Detroit 's assembly lines allowed poor Southern blacks a route out of poverty two generations ago , Las Vegas provided a shot at the middle class for workers fleeing dying industrial centers , or for immigrants arriving from Latin America and Asia .
While average wages stagnated throughout much of the country over the past decade , pay in Nevada skyrocketed .
Wages in the state grew at nearly double the national rate between 2000 and 2008 , according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute , a Washington think tank .
Union workers -- who account for the bulk of employment along the Las Vegas Strip -- saw their pay grow by 12.6 % between 2000 and 2008 , while union workers nationwide saw an increase of 2.9 % , according to the Economic Policy Institute .
Nevada 's non-union pay increased by 5.4 % in the same period , while wages for all workers in the U.S. increased by 1.6 % .
The union made upward mobility part of the Vegas allure .
In Vegas , the union - negotiated salary for a hotel maid is still $ 14.25 an hour .
In contrast , the median wage for the same worker in Orlando is $ 8.84 an hour ; in Phoenix , it 's $ 9.25 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
While the union sent casino workers ' salaries and benefits up , tips were often what helped push ordinary workers into the world of posh condos and sports cars .
Tips could triple the base pay of casino workers who dealt directly with guests .
Gamblers who hit it big on the tables ; young visitors who spent thousands for bottle service at night clubs ; and businessmen treating clients to lavish dinners , were all free and easy with gratuities , say current and former casino workers .
Valet attendants could take home an average of $ 500 a week in tips , while room - service waiters at swankier properties could earn $ 600 a week in tips , often outstripping their weekly base salaries .
Such excess turned Las Vegas into one of America 's biggest boomtowns .
From 2000 through 2006 , Clark County -- home to the Strip and three quarters of the state 's population -- was the fastest - growing county in the U.S .
The number of people employed by the casinos crammed along the four - mile Strip shot to 109,000 in 2007 from 40,000 in 1985 .
Retirees , drawn by low taxes and affordable housing , poured into the area , too .
Many of those who found steady work in casinos or on construction sites were able to harness another engine of prosperity : the area 's bubbling housing market .
Fashionable new suburbs sprang up .
The flurry of new housing starts created even more jobs .
Meanwhile , the casino companies listed on Wall Street had acquired other properties until the Strip was dominated by just a few major players : Harrah 's Entertainment , Inc. , MGM Mirage , Las Vegas Sands Corp. , and Wynn Resorts Ltd .
They began competing with each other and took on billions in debt to build ever - more - lavish gambling palaces .
During the mid-2000s , hotel occupancy on the Strip was typically above 95 % ; room rates soared .
Then , early in 2008 , as the mortgage crisis swept the country , the number of visits began to slow .
The number of visitors continued to drop every month on record this year , just as casino companies were preparing to unleash thousands of new luxury hotel rooms onto the market .
The share prices of the casino companies tumbled , and many sought emergency financing .
Even some of the titans , such as MGM Mirage , had begun to sell assets in order to meet debt obligations .
Mr. Schwer , of UNLV , says when he charts the region 's economic history , the lines rise then decline so severely , " we call these cliff - diving charts . "
During good times , the pull of Las Vegas was so strong that it sometimes drew entire communities .
The Bias family -- about 150 aunts , uncles , cousins , brothers and sisters -- moved to Las Vegas from Tallulah , La. , over three decades as economic conditions in the mill town deteriorated .
More than 43 % of Tallulah 's 9,000 residents live below the poverty line , according to the latest census .
In Las Vegas , the Bias family found steady , well - paying jobs .
The men went to work as cooks in the casinos and the women worked in housekeeping .
Sometimes , it seemed that all of Tallulah had relocated to Las Vegas , says Josh Bias , 31 .
" It got to the point where I 'd meet someone here from Louisiana and I 'd say , ' Do n't tell me , you 're from Tallulah , ' " Mr. Bias says .
Mr. Bias , the eldest of 10 siblings , was able to go to college .
To help pay for school , he found work as a cook , alongside his father and uncles .
He took to the profession , and landed a job as a fry cook at a casino .
He says he made $ 17.35 an hour , received full medical benefits , a 401 ( k ) plan , and free training through a union and casino - backed program to upgrade his skills .
His wife was able to stay home and raise their two young children .
There was a Chevy Malibu , a spacious apartment , and new clothes and toys .
His eight - year - old daughter talked about " going into the family business " and becoming a pastry chef .
But in 2008 , business on the Las Vegas Strip was stalling .
In early December , Mr. Bias was laid off from his job .
His family moved into a cheaper apartment in a sketchier part of town .
He negotiated with his car lender to put off payments for a few months .
Mr. Bias recently landed a new job at the M Resort , where he works from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. as a cook .
Even though it 's a non-union job and pays less , he 's grateful he got it .
" I was told I beat 10,000 other people who applied for this position , " he says .
Mr. Bias said the family is helping each other , with working relatives taking in laid - off ones .
Las Vegas has experienced ups and downs before .
Business dropped off in the 1970s , during years of stagflation .
And casinos were hurting for business in the months after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The city emerged from these downturns when Americans felt confident and wealthy enough to travel as the larger economy grew .
But analysts and observers say now , unlike then , Vegas has billions in debt that will make a recovery much harder .
Harvey Perkins , a gambling consultant with Spectrum Gaming , believes the industry can no longer depend on regular Americans to behave like high rollers .
" I think people have fundamentally changed in their spending patterns . "
The casino business model , he says , will have to be " re-engineered . "
Vegas , Mr. Perkins and others believe , will have to return to the days of being a bargain destination .
That 's already starting to happen , with hotels throwing in coupons for spa services , and high - end restaurants offering cheaper options .
Others predict that the current downturn will prove to be a momentary hiccup , and that the good times , along with social mobility , will again return to Las Vegas , just as they have in the past .
" I think we 'll be like a phoenix , " says D. Taylor , the secretary - treasurer for Culinary Union Local 226 , which represents 55,000 hotel and casino workers .
The union recently agreed to delay a negotiated 34 - cent - an - hour pay increase for one year .
But Mr. Taylor still expects a turnaround .
" People like to kick us around , but we 'll come back bigger and stronger and more exciting and vibrant . "
That 's Raymond Wadsworth 's hope , too .
For a time , Mr. Wadsworth thought he might be condemned to the underclass .
With a high - school education , he bounced from one menial to job to another in Los Angeles .
Then he landed in prison on a drug conviction .
In 2003 , he moved to Las Vegas on the advice of a relative , and his luck changed .
He got a union job in a casino kitchen that paid nearly $ 17 an hour , and included full medical benefits .
He bought a used Toyota Camry , and later , a $ 191,000 four - bedroom house with his girlfriend .
Then , late last year , the casino cut his hours and eventually laid him off .
He has n't worked since New Year 's Eve , and his unemployment benefits are nearly drained .
For now , his girlfriend 's salary is keeping them afloat .
" I know times are tough everywhere , " says Mr. Wadsworth , who has applied for jobs all over the area , including at the airport and City Center .
" I guess we just are n't used to this in Vegas . "

At a time when it was popular among environmentalists to talk about capping pollutants , John Holdren was writing about placing “ caps ” on the U.S. economy itself -- and working toward “ zero economic growth . ”
Holdren , who is now President Obama ’s top adviser on science and technology policy , wrote in the 1970s that it would be “ entirely logical ” to cap the Gross National Product -- the total productivity of the American economy .
“ It is by now abundantly clear that the GNP cannot grow forever .
Why should it ? ” Holdren asked in a 1977 college science textbook he co-wrote with Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich , titled “ Ecoscience : Population , Resources , Environment . ”
“ Why should we not strive for zero economic growth ( ZEG ) as well as zero population growth ? ”
The pertinent chapter , “ Changing American Institutions , ” discusses what the authors perceived as problems in America ’s social mores , government , and economic system , which they say makes it “ the leader in humanity ’s reckless exploitation of Earth . ”
The United States , they argued , should focus on limiting the amount of physical product produced and in circulation .
Again , it would be “ entirely logical , ” Holdren and the Ehrlichs wrote , “ to set limits on the amount of product a nation needs and then strive to reduce the amount of work required to produce such a product ( and , we might add , to see that the product is much more equitably distributed that it is today ) . ”
Elsewhere in the chapter , Holdren and the Ehrlichs instead highlight economies less focused on economic growth , what they call “ growthmania , ” where product could be better distributed .
“ That economists have clung to their ‘ growthmania ’ is not surprising , ” they wrote .
“ After all , natural scientists often cling to outmoded ideas that have produced far less palpable benefits than the growing mixed economies of the Western world in the twentieth century . ”
“ The question of whether a different economic system might have produced a more equitable distribution of benefits is not one that Western economists like to dwell on . ”
Consistent with many of the other arguments laid out in “ Ecoscience , ” Holdren and the Ehrlichs believe making the change to a zero growth global economy also requires curtailing Earth ’s population .
“ How do we get from here to there ?
Population control , of course , is absolutely essential , with an eventual target of a smaller population than today’s . ”
The authors admit that making such a change to the U.S. economy would be difficult because of ingrained cultural opposition , with two chief road blocks to zero growth and broad redistribution of resources .
The first problem , they say , is that it would be “ a threat to some of the most dearly held beliefs of this society ” and would “ attack the Protestant work ethic . ”
That work ethic , they write , insists that one must be kept busy on the job for forty hours a week ” and work overtime or moonlight , “ so that the money can be earned to buy all those wonderful automobiles , detergents , appliances , and assorted gimcracks that must be bought if the economy is to continue to grow . ”
Holdren and the Ehrlichs , however , call that tradition “ outmoded , ” and say American attitudes must change to reflect their environmental situation .
The larger problem , the radical enviromentalists wrote , is that forcing the economy to be less productive would face opposition from those with money and political influence .
“ The critical question , of course , is how to get around the extraordinary power interests that would be unalterably opposed to maximum income limits and ( if possible ) even more opposed to direct taxation of wealth , ” they say on page 850 .
“ Greed and the desire for power are extraordinarily strong forces against any serious attempts to curb income and wealth , ” and , “ ( t ) he real sticky wicket would be direct taxation of wealth , since that would threaten the entrenched power of the Rockefellers , Carnegies , Fords , Kennedys , and countless other beneficiaries of enterprising and acquisitive ancestors . ”
“ But once some system of further redistribution were established in the United States , it would then be justifiable to implement a transition to a ( less productive ) economy as quickly as possible . ”
Before joining the Obama administration , Holdren was a professor at Harvard and the director of the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth , Mass .
He holds a Ph.D. from Stanford University and an M.S. from MIT , where he also received his undergraduate degree .
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy did not comment on questions from CNSNews.com about Holdren ’s stance on zero economic growth or whether it has changed since the 1970s .

Question :
Do our brains play tricks on us ?
Dennett :
Our brains are cunningly evolved , cunningly designed to make life easier for us .
And many ways that it makes life easier for us but one of them is that it gives us over simplified versions of what we ’re doing .
This is a set of tricks which has been sort of reinvented by software engineers .
Your desktop is a very good case of it , we have this you know , little yellow files that can be move around with click and drag and things get put here and there and this is called the user illusion and it is illusory to some degree but of course it ’s a very benign illusion , it ’s really , really it ’s the helpful way of organizing a lot of complexity .
We do n’t need to know all those details .
We just need to know how to achieve certain effects and basically our brain does the same thing and has been doing it for you know , millennia and it ’s got , it ’s evolve some sort of internal sign posts that are good short hand for things that we can do .
Everywhere we look , there ’s things we can do we do n’t know how we do them .
Where completely cut off from the process if I say you know , give me the first line of limerick make up the first line of limerick well you know , give me a few seconds you ’ll come up with 2 or 3 .
How did you do that ?
You do n’t know .
The words just come sort of bubbling up and you do n’t have any insight into the sort of subterranean unconscious process that generates that particular thing .
You may have a little insight but not much .
And it ’s there is a very sharp limit to the depth that we as conscious agents can probe our own activities and this , this sort of superficial access that we have to what ’s going on , that ’s what consciousness is .
Now , when I say who is this “ we ” whose got this access that ’s itself part of the illusion because there is n’t a sort of vast part of the brain that ’s sitting there with this limited access that itself is part of the illusion what it is , there ’s a bunch of different subsystems which have varying access to varying things and that conspire in a sort of competitive way to execute whatever project it is that their , in their sort of mindless way executing .

When a tip comes in touting video of another so - called YouTube " musical genius " it 's hard to fight through the blasé glaze in which we find ourselves entombed .
Still , one indifferent mouse - click later and we 're treated to Moldover 's Awesome Edition CD .
Thepart is the custom - designed circuit board that accompanies the CD and lists the tracks while doubling as a theremin instrument with headphone jack -- all in a standard - size jewel case .
Hit the on button and start making ' music ' by waving your hand in front of the light sensors .
Sure it sounds a bit like you 're squeezing air through a pinched balloon and it costs $ 50 ( $ 10 for CD - only or $ 25 for a Pocket Edition ) , but hey , give this guy some credit for innovation .

I ’ve spent a lot of time studying things that do n’t interest me .
I ’m not sadistic ( or maybe I am ; 3 ) , but I reason that even though the things themselves do n’t interest me , I ’m interested by the fact that these things interest others .
So , I want to figure out what it is about these things that interests others ( but somehow escapes me ) .
I ’m not quite sure if I ’ve gotten the true believing Mormon mindset down or not …
But at this point , I ’m beginning to see that I ’m not even so much interested in knowing the difference between the true blue believer and my nonbelief .
But that ’s not the only kind of belief .
Now , I feel like I have to look more carefully at those who believe with an allegorical or mythological framework .
These people note that their sacred texts may not be historical or literal at all , that their institutions may be objectively false , but still hold them sacred and divine .
This interests me .
Not because I ’m interested in actually believing in God or in following a religion with such a framework ( nope , that still does n’t interest me .
I just do n’t have that in me ) , but because I ’m interested in understanding how this framework works for others .
I have n’t read books like Joseph Campbell ’s “ The Hero with a Thousand Faces , ” which I ’ve heard are good works on this kind of stuff , but I guess I ’ll still have it somewhere on my book list ( that list is getting a bit backed up : 3 [ feel free to add to the list ] . )
Today ’s post is partially contemplation from my series about John Dehlin ’s “ How to stay LDS … ” ( what drives him to persist ..? ) , but more directly , it ’s a response to Seth Payne ’s ( I ’ve written about another article of his earlier … )
“ Why I ’m a non-Believer , But Still a Mormon . ”
This essay seemed to be the one of the first to begin making sense out of allegorical or mythological approaches to religion .
But I ’m still not personally persuaded …
I think I can begin to understand people like Seth .
( Or maybe I ’ve got it all wrong . )
Individual has strong impression of God , divinity within some part the church ( through spiritual experience . )
Crisis occurs ( whether historical , theological , or whatever ) .
Individual feels faith is irreparably lost because of literal , historical , and theological “ breaking points , ” but …
individual also remembers strong impression of God and divinity within the church .
So it seems to me that those who are able to “ stay LDS , ” so to speak , anchor things by the strong impression of God , no matter what else .
So , all other things may fall away ( the literal , historical , theological “ breaking points ” that led to crisis ) because the individual simply sidesteps them with allegorical , metaphorical , and subjective interpretations .
For a quote from Seth :
I suppose the bottom line is : I believe in Jesus .
Jesus has been part of many of my spiritual experiences and whether or not Jesus was actually divine , born of a virgin , and was resurrected , He is part of my spiritual connection to God and I have on many occasions felt my burdens lifted through his sacrifice .
In other words , whether or not Jesus * actually * was any of those things I mentioned above – He is still real to me and provides comfort when I struggle and lifts me up when I am down .
In my new found faith , meaning does not necessarily require an association with the actual occurrence of a particular event .
To put it more dramatically – even if Jesus were a completely fictional character who never existed in reality ( a position which I certainly * do not* hold ) –
He still has significant meaning in my spiritual life .
and
Armed then , with the realization that God can speak and move through ideas and myth – and not simply through actual occurrence , I began to take a second look at Mormonism .
With such an understanding , all of the doctrinal and historical “ problems ” of Mormonism disappear – as all these problems deal with issues of actual occurrence and history … does it really matter if Joseph Smith had the first vision or merely reported having a vision ?
No !
The real value of the first vision is in how God can speak to me through this narrative of the first vision and what I can learn from it .
The same holds true for the Book of Mormon .
So …the Book of Mormon , Bible , etc. , instead of being accounts that stand or fall based on how well they actually align with the facts , become tools and models which stand or fall based on how well they train or attune one to commune with the spirit .
( This pragmatic “ instrumentalism , ” coincidentally , is addressed in other posts from Seth . )
And this last part makes me sweat a bit …
I like pragmatism ; I have no problem with the differences of subjective experience and reaction .
But I feel ill - at - ease to give this chain of logic my stamp of approval ( even though I approve its composing parts ) .
It seems to me too that there are a few problems :
1 ) One size does n’t fit all .
The “ trainer ” or “ instrument ” that helps one find “ divinity ” wo n’t work for all .
2 ) It seems to be mixing terms .
Divinity , in my opinion , demands objective existence ( retreating to it as wholly subjective seems like a copout in the debate ) .
Payn denies that Smith ’s possible “ borrowing ” from his immediate surroundings for the BoM would invalidate the divinity of the book , because Joseph has expanded upon these things to create a beautiful work , and this reasoning troubles me .
Smith may have created something that Payne perceives as beautiful or divine , but this does n’t mean the Book of Mormon is divine or that divinity exists objectively .
( Does beauty objectively exist as its own entity somewhere , in some form , just because we perceive things as beautiful ? )
This is tricky , because I ’m guessing that Payne , Dehlin and others are n’t saying that they subjectively perceive something they just happen to label as God .
Rather , I ’m guessing that these individuals believe or hope that God is a being that — somewhere , in some form — objectively and * truly * exists , even if it ’s just a radio station that they are tuning into with ( admittedly ) imperfect radio instruments .
If this is so , then critics ’ claims that the church or the Book of Mormon or whatever else simply is not what it says it is is irrelevant … because with the instrumentalist view of these things , realism does n’t matter as long as the instruments properly do their jobs .
I wo n’t add much to the frustration with US media coverage of Hillary Clinton ’s seven- nation African tour , except to link to a few sources .
With few exceptions ( NPR ) , US media have either played stenographer , reduced her actions to a Desperate Housewives episode ( like this NBC report above ) that ’s more about US domestic politics or avoided it altogether to do PR for the Republican Party campaign to derail health care reform .
“ What ’s More Important : Rape In Congo Or Hillary ’s Bad Hair Day ? ” [ Jezebel ]
“ Hillary Clinton in Congo : Tempers , Human Rights , and Media Cliché ” [ Huffington Post ]
“ Perhaps I have been too cynical ” [ Texas in Africa ]
But more than protecting women and lecturing African leaders about democracy , there ’s another reason for Clinton ’s trip to Africa :
By 2025 the US government expects to import at least 25 % of its oil suppliers from African sources–Clinton is visiting three suppliers on this trip : Angola , Nigeria , and Cape Verde .
Obama visited a fourth , Ghana ( they discovered oil in 2007 ) , a month ago .
Right now Nigeria is the 5th largest , and Angola the 6th largest exporters of oil to the United States .
Oh , and the US is facing competition from China ( who operate by a different , easier , set of rules for foreign investment ) for African oil and other resources .

With sales of hybrid vehicles sinking , a green - advertising battle is erupting between Toyota Motor 's new Prius and Honda Motor 's new Insight .
Beginning today , Toyota , the world 's largest auto maker , is rolling out a major U.S. ad push for its 2010 Prius , the third generation of the world 's top - selling hybrid vehicle .

The Federal Reserve ’s main weapon for curbing inflation is simple ; Banks will be paid risk - free interest not to lend , and instead keep their money at the Fed .
So our current shovels of cash to banks are supposedly to encourage lending .
When it ’s time to hit the brakes , they will get paid not to lend .
Mr. Bernanke outlined the plan in his recent WSJ editorial :
Congress granted us authority last fall to pay interest on balances held by banks at the Fed .
Currently , we pay banks an interest rate of 0.25 % .
When the time comes to tighten policy , we can raise the rate paid on reserve balances as we increase our target for the federal funds rate .
Banks generally will not lend funds in the money market at an interest rate lower than the rate they can earn risk - free at the Federal Reserve .
Yes , that should dampen inflationary pressures .
But it ’s a true perversion of justice that banks will once again profit from the mess they created .
If asked why banks should reap even more gains from their mess and rescue , Big Ben would probably voice his distaste for this “ necessary evil ” , adding that he is “ as unhappy about it as anyone , but we have no choice . ”
Currently , lawmakers and The Fed are trying desperately to increase lending , providing banks with cheap cash and threatening them with legislation if they do n’t .
So when the time comes to tighten , the plan is essentially to bribe lenders with risk - free interest as a reward for tightening their belts .
Starting to see a pattern emerge ?
No matter the economic environment , banks get rewarded .
Alternative Inflation Curbs ?
Could n’t the Fed get the same result by increasing banks ’ reserve requirements ?
Why not force banks to hold bigger cash “ cushions ” in the form of more vault cash and higher TCE ratios ?
The result should be be the same as paying banks not to lend – tighter money , less lending , and lower inflation .
The difference is that it would n’t be profitable for banks .
The same ones who essentially own the Fed .
After all , if we ’ve learned one thing from this little collapse , it ’s that bank profits are the most important step towards recovery .
That seems to be the attitude of Larry Summers and Tim Geithner , anyway .

Since this is my 10,000th post here on GAF , I decided I wanted to do something ... different .
Something special .
This topic is dedicated to all the GAF members & lurkers out there that actuallythe games the rest of us play , praise , deride , and discuss .
My hat is off to all of you .
This is a long topic , but please read it .
Consider it your gift to me , for achieving 10 K posts ~~~~~~~~~~~~About a year ago I was conversing with someone when the topic of my work came up .
I mentioned I work in the video game business , for a company that publishes websites focused on games .
They asked if I was a big fan of video games in general and I said yes , absolutely .
But then they asked me something that caught me off guard :
" Why do you like games so much ?
What is it about them that is so attractive to you ?
" I did n't have a good answer for them , at the time .
In the following months I 've continued to turn this question over in my mind , and Ido n't have a very good answer , to be honest .
But that is n't going to stop me from trying , here in this topic .
Actually ... that is n't 100 % true .
Things DO happen in the real world to spark the imagination .
It 's just that , in the end , that spark will end up being extinguished , rather than nurtured and encouraged .
A perfect example : The other day during a typical Wikipedia crawl , I landed on a piece on the Great Lakes : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes .
I read that Lake Superior is over 1300 feet deep .
1300 !" Jesus , that 's amazing ! " I thought to myself .
" There could be ANYTHING down there , at the bottom !
" But the truth is ... there 's nothing down there .
Because that 's how the real world operates .
But in a game , a mysterious , deep lake isworth exploring .
There willbe something there , waiting to be discovered .
It might be a dangerous eel in need of a teeth cleaning :
Or an entire underwater dungeon might be waiting to be explored :
Or there might just be no further reward than some treasure : I think a lot of people " grow out " of games when they reach adulthood because they do n't need video games anymore to feel powerful or in control of the world around them .
When you 're a kid , saving the world , being NFL champ , defeating the Nazis ... it 's pretty obvious why games are attractive .
But when you 're older and have kids of your own , have real responsibility at work and are just better able to shape the world around you ... there 's less drive to drop into the world of Albion and wander around , rescuing strangers .
My theory is that those of us thatgrow out of games into adulthood ( ie those of you here on GAF and working in the industry ) ... we 're the ones that did n't lose that spark of imagination .
When we hear about some incredibly deep lake , or deep - space discovery , or recorded ocean sounds of unknown origin , our brains light up and we think " wow ! "
But ... the real world lets us down in that regard , in ways that games almost never do .
I know oftentimes on GAF we can be cynical .
Yes the Eely Mouth bossfight in Mario Sunshine had wonky camera issues .
Yes raiding that underwater dungeon in WoW can be a pain because travel time takes so long .
Yes treasure hunting in Wind Waker can be pointless .
But I think deep down we all derive a certain amount of thrill from these and other set - ups ... because in games , you really , truly do n't know what is going to be inside that lake or around that next corner .
In some ways , that explanation is a little bit of a cop out .
Several of my favorite games of all - time feature no exploratory elements of any kind .
In those cases , instead of having robust game worlds to explore , they all have robust gameto explore .
It really is n't that different .
Experimenting with a level in Monkey Ball or Advance Wars ... ferreting out the perfect way to exploit the stage layout and game systems to achieve my goals ... that type of game exploration is n't too far removed from crossing an overworld in Zelda or an RPG .
It 's always a little sad when you finally do wrap your head around all of a deep game 's systems ... a subtle shift happens .
It ceases being about possibility ( " this game is so deep ! " ) and becomes more about exposing all the game systems ' bare parts and how they fit together , and exploiting them to accomplish your goals as quickly and easily as possible .
It 's no surprise , then , that the most acclaimed and beloved games of all time ( and the bulk of my top 10 ) are games that allow the player to explore game worlds AND game systems ... both intertwined in a beautiful mix of genius design :
It 's a cliche , but I do n't know a better way to put it : when you pop in a game cart ( or disk ) , you 're transported to another world .
I have a tiny stack of misc .
DS games on my desk , and I marveled the other day at how this little 2 - inch stack contained untold - number of challenges , mysteries , stages , battles , characters ... entire worlds .
My time spent in dracula 's castle , in Midgar , in Ironforge , Brinstar , Hyrule , on Halo rings , tropical islands ... this has not been time wasted .
These experiences have enriched my life , not detracted from it .
So to all of you that create these worlds and these game systems in the pursuit of putting a little bit of adventure back into people 's lives ... in the pursuit of ensuring that spark of imagination is n't extinguished by the boring and unsurprising " real world " but is instead rewarded ... my hat is off to you .
You have all accomplished something monumental .
Something important .
Those of you still reading this topic , I encourage you to say " thanks " to the men & women behind your favorite games , as well .
GAF is a popular place ... the odds are at least one of them is reading
On numerous occasions people have commented that the way I write about Nokia makes me sound bitter about being fired .
If I have given off that impression , then I must apologize because that is not what I ’ve intended .
The frustration I feel with regards to Nokia is like that of a parent who knows that their child is capable of so much , yet repeatedly watches them make mistakes and squander their potential .
Nokia , like any large corporation , has the ability to impact a vast number of people simply due to their scale .
With that amount of power , comes an even greater sense of responsibility .
No one else in the mobile space is trying to sell devices to a market of people who make less in a year than what you or I do in a single day .
No one else in the mobile space invests in a distribution chain that enables people living in villages located in remote mountain regions to purchase their first mobile phone .
No one in the mobile space is developing mobile applications and services that help farmers in third world countries yield a better harvest so that they can increase their standard of living .
Nokia has a rich history that spans over 140 years .
From a paper factory built by Fredrik Idestam in 1865 in the city of Tampere , to a producer of rubber boots beginning in 1898 , to a manufacture of cables starting in 1912 , to a telecommunications pioneer in the 1970s and 1980s with Europe ’s first fully digital telephone exchange and finally , what we recognize Nokia as today , a mobile phone power house thanks to a decision in 1992 by former CEO Jorma Ollila to focus solely on mobile telecommunications .
It is time to start writing the next chapter in Nokia ’s history , and I believe that it should be radically different than the course the Finnish company has currently set for itself .
Ovi is Nokia ’s second attempt to get into the mobile services space ; Club Nokia was the first .
During Nokia ’s Q2 2009 earnings call , Chief Financial Officer Rick Simonson alluded to how the company will modify the way they report their numbers starting in Q3 2009 .
By bundling Ovi services into Nokia devices , creating what Nokia refers to as a “ solution , ” profit made per device shipped will hopefully increase .
It is a clone of Microsoft ’s strategy to take over the browser market with Internet Explorer , by that I mean it does n’t matter if a competitor ’s product is better , most people will simply use what is already on the device they purchase .
This is a very dangerous strategy since the world we live in today does not operate like the world once did when Microsoft attempted , and succeeded , at beating Netscape .
Back then , there were only two browsers .
Today Microsoft competes with Opera , Chrome , Firefox and Safari in the browser space .
The same analogy can be extended for discussion around Ovi , which today competes with iTunes , Facebook , GMail , Flickr , Yahoo , Dropbox , YouTube , and the list goes on .
Why do you think Google is pushing for developers to build web applications ?
They want a world where you can purchase any device you want , running any operating system , and the first action that you as a user complete is to launch the browser and type in the names of your favorite sites and services .
In a hyper connected age , it is n’t going to take long for those people living in the mountains to find out that Ovi Mail is terrible and that GMail is better .
It is n’t going to take long for people in first world countries to figure out that Google Maps has a better points of interest database and search engine when compared to Nokia Maps .
It is n’t going to take long for people to figure out that Facebook is a better way of managing your contacts than Contacts on Ovi .
All the more reason to stop investing in Ovi all together , call it a failure , and pour more resources into making a better mobile user experience .
Nokia ’s core strength is size .
When deciding what devices will make up their 2011 portfolio , Nokia can go to any manufacture and make an order for a component , such as a screen , that can be in the range of over 100 million units .
As it stands today , Nokia makes 4 out of every 10 mobile phones sold .
Nokia should sell this manufacturing unit and make it an independent company that produces mobile phones for everyone .
This new company will operate similar to how Foxconn functions today .
They ’ll have the expertise , they ’ll have the factories and they ’ll even increase the pace of innovation since larger orders can be placed from component suppliers , therefore accelerating price erosion which gives more people the ability to purchase high end devices .
Nokia ’s core strength is also the company ’s core problem .
When you ’re burdened with ordering such a large number of units of a certain component , you wait until sufficient inventory is in the channel to get a better price and insure dependable availability .
Why do you think Nokia is late at producing an 8 megapixel camera phone ?
Why do you think Nokia is late at producing a device with a capacitive touch screen ?
Why do you think Nokia is late at producing a device with the latest processor from ARM ?
Those features are enabled by components that today are not shipping in large quantities , and Nokia does not want to touch them since they need to maintain a high operating margin to appease stockholders .
If Nokia spun off the hardware unit , that separate company could purchase every single available Cortex A8 processor , 8 megapixel camera sensor , and WVGA capacitive screen available in the channel and then negotiate prices with every handset maker .
The ability to manufacture is one thing , getting your devices into shops is another .
No one comes close to competing with Nokia at achieving such a massive retail presence .
Nokia mobile phones are sold in shops all around the world , from cosmopolitan megacities , to villages with less than 1000 people .
Combine those retail partnerships with a large investment in banking infrastructure , and Nokia could potentially become the largest bank in the world .
When FeliCa , the company that provides the NFC chip inside Japanese mobile phones which enables wireless payments , was launched , NTT DoCoMo coughed up € 40 million to help pay for the point of sale units in shops all across the country .
They solved the chicken or the egg problem by giving everyone one piece of the puzzle , and then waiting for consumers to pick up the other piece .
Nokia should take several hundred million euros and invest in creating a wireless payment infrastructure across western and northern Europe and then spread through the rest of the world gradually .
Apple can keep their 30 % profit on applications , and whatever they make off music .
Nokia could pocket .01 % every time someone purchases a beer at a pub , or a meal at a restaurant , or a ticket to see a movie .
Since the infrastructure will be installed by Nokia , they can take a cut of every transaction , regardless if the device used for that transaction was produced by Nokia , Apple , HTC , etc .
Nokia can chose to compete in the space they ’ve helped develop and mature since the early 90s , where competition grows more and more fierce each day , or they change the rules to their advantage .
With Nokia being the 5th most popular brand today , thanks to their wide portfolio of mobile phones that fit every budget , they already have a head start at gaining people ’s trust at becoming a viable financial institution .
I admit that some of the ideas I ’ve outlined above are not my own .
My final role at Nokia was in a strategic foresighting team that was responsible for telling the company where the world is going to be in five years .
We held multiple workshops , and the one thing that always came up was banking .
Now I do n’t know what the people at the top of Nokia ’s corporate ladder have in mind for what the company will look like in 2015 , but there are certainly a great many number of people below , people much smarter than me who I look up to , who see Nokia becoming a bank as an inevitability .
There is even one guy fairly high up who I ’ve had the pleasure of meeting with several times trying to get this idea through .
I wish him the best of luck .
I ’m not bitter that I got fired from Nokia .
I ’m bitter because I got to see , as an insider , with my own eyes , what bright talented people are capable of , yet were denied the ability to achieve , due to higher management .
There are so many talented people at Nokia , and they ’re hungry to make a difference .
Let them .

Yemeni authorities said the plane conformed to international standards
Details have emerged about the rescue of the only person known to have survived the crash of a Yemeni- operated plane off the Comoros islands .
A French rescuer said he had spotted the 14 - year - old - girl in choppy waters amid bodies and wreckage .
He said she was shaking as he pulled her up .
The girl was taken to a hospital in capital of the Comoros , Moroni .
Five bodies have also been recovered .
The plane came down in bad weather with about 153 people on board on Tuesday .
The rescuer told France 's Europe 1 radio of finding the girl .
" We tried to throw a life buoy .
She could not grab it .
I had to jump in the water to get her , " he said .
" She was shaking , shaking .
We put four sheets on her .
We gave her hot , sugary water .
We simply asked her name , village . "
Dr Ada Mansour , who treated the child in hospital , told AFP she was conscious and talking , but added : " We are trying to warm her up because she was freezing . "
It is believed the girl lives in Marseille and was travelling with her mother to the Comoros .
There were 66 French nationals on board , and the French military were involved in the search .
Most of the plane 's passengers had flown on a different Yemenia aircraft from Paris or Marseille before boarding flight IY626 in Sanaa , the capital of Yemen .
The French transport ministry had earlier said the Airbus 310 plane had been banned from France because of " irregularities " .
The crash was the second involving an Airbus aircraft in recent weeks .
On 1 June an Air France Airbus 330 travelling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris plunged into the Atlantic , killing all 228 people on board .
An airline spokesman said poor weather was more likely to have been a factor in the crash than the condition of the plane .
Yemeni Transport Minister Khaled Ibrahim al - Wazeer also told Reuters news agency that the plane had recently undergone a thorough inspection overseen by Airbus and conformed to international standards .
Gen Bruno de Bourdoncle de Saint - Salvy , French naval commander in the Indian Ocean , said the plane had come down about 15 km ( eight nautical miles ) north of the Comoran coast .
Activists , 1 . Rent - a- cops & Anti Camping Law , 0 .
While some of Portland 's so - called homeless advocates are busy joining the Portland Business Alliance , Patrick Nolen 's new Soapbox Under The Bridge project is camping out on the sidewalk tonight to draw attention to the arbitrary nature of the city 's anti-camping laws .
It 's illegal to camp out overnight in Portland , even though more than 1500 people do so every night because they either can't get into shelters , or they 're scared of the conditions inside .
Right now there 's a class action lawsuit against the city of Portland over the law because our city commissioners are reluctant to get rid of it even with the waiting list for housing a mile long , but in the mean time , there 's a loophole in the law relating to parades , and guess who 's all over it ?
LOOPHOLE EXPERTS : ACTIVISTS BARRY JOE STULL ( RIGHT ) AND DALE HARDWAY ( LEFT ) ..
Stull showed me the city code by torchlight in his folder .
Here :
14A.55.010 Access to Public Property for Parade Event .
- Printable Version A.
It is unlawful to paint , tape , or otherwise mark public property or place objects in the right - of - way for the purpose of reserving space for a parade event .
B.City of Portland may remove unauthorized materials left on public property or the right - of - way .
C.Camping overnight , to reserve a space in the public right - of - way along side the parade route , may be allowed as set forth in administrative rule .
Overnight camping under this section is a limited exception to Portland City Code 14A.50.020 and 14A.50.030 .
NOLEN : HAD TO FEND OFF ADVANCES FROM RENT-A-COPS WHILE FELLOW ACTIVIST RICHARD WALDEN TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS ...
In other words , the city is only interested in criminalizing homelessness .
Not camping , per se .
To draw attention to the double standard last week , Nolen and his pals gave out fake citations to folks camping out on the route for the Rose Parade .
This week , they decided they fancied camping out for tomorrow 's Pride Parade , which happens to pass past the North side of Pioneer Square .
Uh - oh ...
When I arrived at 9:45 , Nolen and his pals were being asked to move on and also to show their identification by three rent - a - cops from firm Pacific Patrol Services , inc , which does security for Pioneer Square .
" The park closes at midnight , and it's curb to curb , " said rent - a - cop supervisor Jonathan J Kapiniak .
" You can't camp here . "
" I do n't have to show you my identification , " said Hardway .
" We 're waiting for a parade , " said Nolen .
Stull showed the rent - a- cops his Portland Bureau of Transportation documents which show an 18ft border around Pioneer Square as the public right of way .
" We 're allowed to camp here , " he said .
" Because we 're waiting for a parade . "
" We 're celebrating the fact that the anti-camping ordinance has a loophole , " said Stull .
" If camping is so dangerous , why allow it on a few nights each year ? "
" That 's part of the problem , " said Walden , discussing the situation with another rent - a - cop .
" Part of the law refers to this as a public park while others say it 's private property , but the bureau of transportation says we can pass here in the public right of way .
Do n't tell me it is n't private when you 're asking me to leave .
You are private police .
I live downtown , I work downtown , and I shop downtown .
My money pays your check . "
Burrrrrn .
Eventually the rent - a - cops left the activists be .
" We 're going to allow you to camp here for the night , " they said .
" But we 're going to check with our supervisors about this law . "
High - fives all round .
" These folks were tiptoeing past saying we 've got to get through , and I said ' my friends , we 'll have these officers out of the way for you in just a minute ' , " said Stull , breaking into infectious laughter .
They all huddled round .
" We 're won , " said Nolen , " but we need to be careful to be good winners .
Let 's be careful to be polite and respectful to the officers and try not to block the sidewalk . "
They 'll be out there at the Pride Parade when it swings past at 11 tomorrow morning .
It 's been a while since I felt good about homeless activism in Portland — I hear so many arguments about " priorities " and " fighting the real battle " from all sides that it's hard not to feel bitter , angry , let down and frustrated sometimes .
But not tonight .
The city 's homeless and parks commissioner is former civil rights attorney Nick Fish , so he 's responsible for the reaction of the rent - a - cops ( " park closes at midnight , " " show us your identification ... " ) and the city 's ongoing enforcement of the anti-camping law .
City Commissioner Amanda Fritz is also conducting outreach on the sit / lie and anti-camping laws along with Fish so I 've sent them both an email requesting comment and will post their responses as soon as we get them .

Boys get better grades at single - sex schools than when they 're in mixed - gender schools , where girls consistently outperform them , a recent New Zealand study shows .
The study , based on the long - term Christchurch Health and Development Study at the University of Otago , compared the educational achievements of over 900 boys and girls who attended single - sex and coeducational secondary schools in New Zealand .
For students attending single - sex secondary schools , there was a slight tendency for males to outperform females .
For students attending co-educational schools , however , there was a clear tendency for girls to outperform boys , a pattern that continued when students were followed up to the age of 25 . '

The Truth About … via flickrForget letting your fingers do the walking : A study released today shows that homebuyers are letting their wallets do the walking , paying more for homes in neighborhoods where you can get around without wheels .
Conducted by CEOs for Cities , the analysis looked at 94,000 real - estate transaction in 15 markets across the U.S. , from Fresno , Calif. , to Arlington , Va . Researchers found that in 13 of the markets , housing values were higher in more walkable neighborhoods .
( What about the other two markets ?
In Bakersfield , Calif. , no correlation was found ; in the other , which starts with Las Vegas and rhymes with Armageddon , housing values were lower in walkable neighborhoods . )
Using data from Walk Score , the study found that houses in hoods with above average walkability commanded $ 4,000 to $ 34,000 more than those in hoods with average walkability .
Characterized as the first to put a dollar value on walkability , the study could be big news for municipal leaders and mere mortals alike , said CEOs for Cities head Carol Coletta : “ These findings … tell us that if urban leaders are intentional about developing and redeveloping their cities to make them more walkable , it will not only enhance the local tax base but will also contribute to individual wealth by increasing the value of what is , for most people , their biggest asset . ”
But wait , you ’re saying ( as one staffer did at our news meeting this morning ) :
Could n’t this connection just be due to the fact that walkable areas tend to be metro areas , and that makes them more expensive in general ?
The smarties behind the study are all over that :
Using an economic technique called hedonic regression , we estimate how much market value homebuyers implicitly attach to houses with higher Walk Scores …
Our statistical approach controlled for key characteristics of individual housing units ( their size , number of bedrooms and bathrooms , age and other factors ) , as well as for the neighborhoods in which they were located ( including the neighborhood ’s income level , proximity to the urban center and relative accessibility to employment opportunities ) .
After controlling for all of these other factors that are known to influence housing value , our study showed a positive correlation between walkability and housing prices in 13 of the 15 housing markets we studied . ”
They had me at hedonic regression .
For me , the question is :
Should we have to pay more for the privilege of being able to walk to a grocery store or school or post office or local pub ?
Walking — which the study terms a “ largely unmeasured and grossly under appreciated component of the urban transportation system ” — is good for our health and good for the planet , not to mention good for things like car - insurance premiums .
Should such a set - up be available only to those who can afford it ?
Our old friend Clark Williams - Derry over at Sightline offers this take :
What the CEOs for Cities study shows is that there is a real and measurable pent up demand for homes in walkable neighborhoods .
For decades , sprawl apologists have argued that low - density suburban development was somehow “ natural , ” because it ’s what homebuyers “ prefer . ”
By now , though , it ’s clear that many homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for walkability .
The real problem is that the demand for walkable homes exceeds the supply — which pushes up the price .
To me , that argues for policies that are designed to increase the supply of homes in walkable neighborhoods .
That ’s good for affordability , good for reducing transportation costs , and a great way to help more people add walking to their daily routines .
Saints Top Pick Jenkins Unlikely To Sign By Start of Camp ; Morstead , Vaughn Agree To Terms by Keith Null
In a welcome change of pace it ’s the Saints defense that highlights the first day of camp , not it ’s league leading offense .
The talk of the town is how Gregg Williams has his new defense playing with a long absent swagger .
He has motivated his unit to play at a feverish pace , clawing at the ball , forcing turnovers and interceptions .
Interestingly enough though controversial cornerback Jason David garnered the highest praise from Williams when he broke on a few routes during the teams seven - on - seven drills , forcing an interception .
Returning starter Tracy Porter also looked good in coverage batting down a pass intended for Marques Colston and the defense forced a few turnovers by stripping tightend Jeremy Shockey — not to his liking .
All in all not a bad first day of practice
The offense was n’t completely overwhelmed though as they held their own by turning in a few big plays .
For complete details follow this link to the Saints website .
Pro-bowl quarterback Drew Brees is impressed with the defense ’ improvement and he could n’t be happier about going up against them every day , firmly believing it will take the offense to new heights .
“ That ’s just forming good habits , ” Brees said .
“ Even if it ’s just an incompletion , any ball that ’s on the ground , they ’re picking it up and running with it just to get used to that mentality .
In a game , you see a ball on the ground and you snatch it up and run with it .
I think that ’s a very opportunistic type of mentality . ”
“ Absolutely .
Turnovers create so much momentum for us as an offense and also for the team , ” he said .
“ You get that short field and you just know you ’re going to score .
That momentum swing is huge throughout the course of a game , especially when you feel like you ’re very evenly matched with a team .
That is a stat that typically makes the difference , the turnover ratio .
As an offense , the better we can take care of the ball and the more the defense can present us with those opportunities , the better off we ’re going to be
We ’ll keep you posted on any news out of Metairie , but in the meantime it looks like Gregg Williams is making his presence felt .

Mr Tissainayagam was arrested in March last year
The high court in Sri Lanka has sentenced a prominent Tamil journalist to 20 years in prison after convicting him under anti-terrorism laws .
JS Tissainayagam was found guilty of " causing communal disharmony " .
Mr Tissainayagam was arrested in 2008 and charged with inciting violence in articles in his magazine , the North Eastern Monthly , which is now closed .
He was also accused of receiving funds from the Tamil Tigers rebels .
He denied supporting violence .
Mr Tissainayagam 's lawyer says he will appeal and that his client never sought to arouse hatred .
The world 's largest organisation of journalists , the International Federation of Journalists ( IFJ ) , has condemned the judgement - which also sentences Mr Tissainayagam to hard labour while in prison - and described it as " disproportionate , brutal and inhumane " .
' Widespread attention '
Mr Tissainayagam was found guilty of causing " racial hatred " and " supporting terrorism " , a court official said .
This man has been victimised for no more than holding the government to account
Aidan White
IFJ
The court found that he had received money from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) to fund his website , the official said .
One of the articles accused the government of shelling a coastal town and trying to drive out its population in the war which was going on at the time , says the BBC's Charles Haviland , in Colombo .
The Tamil journalist has already been in detention for a year - and - a - half and was one of a handful of journalists mentioned in May by US President Barack Obama , who called them " emblematic examples " of reporters jailed for their work .
The Sri Lankan government said Mr Obama had been misinformed .
' Victimised '
The case of JS Tissainayagam has received widespread attention in Sri Lanka , and international rights group have been campaigning for his release - they say Sri Lanka is using anti-terror laws to silence peaceful critics .
The general secretary of the IFJ , Aidan White , said the sentence was a " chilling reminder of how dangerous Sri Lanka has become for independent journalists " .
" This man has been victimised for no more than holding the government to account and giving voice to legitimate , if critical opinion , " he said , calling for the journalist 's immediate release .
Since the government 's military victory over the Tamil Tigers in May , it has regularly denounced its critics .
Last week it described an exiled group , Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka , as a " front " for the Tigers after it circulated a video which it said showed army soldiers killing unarmed Tamils .
The authorities said the video was fabricated .

WASHINGTON  Military researchers have dressed live pigs in body armor and strapped them into Humvee simulators that were then blown up with explosives to study the link between roadside bomb blasts and brain injury .
For an 11 - month period that ended in December , researchers subjected pigs and rats to about 200 blasts , according to Pentagon documents and interviews .
The explosions have ranged in intensity , wounding some of the pigs and killing others .
Roadside bombs are the top killer of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
MILITARY : Studies shed light on brain injuries from blasts
The research on pigs has determined that body armor does not worsen brain injury , said Jan Walker , a spokeswoman for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , or DARPA , which conducted the study .
The military feared body armor would deflect the force of blasts toward the head and increase the risk of brain injury .
The research also shows that body armor protects troops ' lungs and is critical to surviving blasts .
" If use of animal subjects in testing results in our ability to save lives or prevent injury to our troops , we 're confident this is the right thing to do , " Walker said .
Pigs without body armor died from blasts within 24 to 48 hours , while those with armor survived " significantly higher blasts , " she said .
Blasting pigs raises " red flags , " said Martin Stephens , vice president for animal research issues at the Humane Society of the United States .
" This is a worthy goal , trying to prevent soldiers from being injured by roadside bombs , " Stephens said .
" I think the relevance of this is highly questionable .
People are not pigs . "
Col. Geoffrey Ling , who led the study , said pigs are good subjects because their brains are more similar to human brains than those of rats .
Pig hearts and lungs are also similar to humans ' .
The Pentagon complied with policies that ensure that a minimal number of animals were used in the testing and that they were treated humanely at all times , Walker said .
Scientists discovered details that will help protect troops , said Michael Leggieri , director of the Pentagon 's Blast Injury Research Program .
" The bottom line to everything we do in this program is to protect the soldier , " he said .
DARPA declined to say where the tests had taken place .
The next round of the testing is scheduled for later this year .
Stephens called on the Pentagon to end testing on pigs .
" Is this the best they can do after several years of losing soldiers to roadside bombs ? " he said .
U.S. car companies used live animals , including pigs , for crash tests until the early 1990s .
They stopped after protests from animal rights groups , such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals .

Today 's thanks goes out to my managers Mark and Josh who really came through for me especially recently .
Josh for some career stuff I can't announce yet , and Mark for setting up the awesome show at Comicon .
So far the momentum on SMBC Theater has been excellent , and that show is at least in part the reason .
Speaking of which , it 's been a total blast so far .
We 've got over 700 subscribers to our youtube account , and I think we 'll get plenty more when you guys see the next video .
It 's got special effects !
In a letter addresed to the FTC , AT&T put all rumors to rest when it bluntly denied having anything to do with the removal of Google Voice apps from the iTunes App Store .
Jim Cicconi , AT&T ’s senior executive vice president for legislative affairs , wrote :
AT&T was not asked about the matter by Apple at any time , nor did it offer any view one way or the other .
More broadly , AT&T does not own , operate or control the Apple App Store and is not typically consulted regarding the approval or rejection of applications for the App Store or informed when an application is approved or rejected .
And Apple also commented for the first time on the matter , writing that Google Voice apps were removed because they “ alter the iPhone ’s distinctive user experience by replacing the iPhone ’s core mobile telephone functionality and Apple user interface with its own user interface for telephone calls , text messaging and voicemail . ”
So there you have it – the removal of Google Voice rests solely on Apple ’s shoulders .

Tom Clark , a meteorologist for television station WNEP in Moosic , Penn. , captured video of a tornado moving across south Minneapolis with his iPhone on August 19 , 2009 .
Clark was visiting his daughter in Minneapolis .
The storm toppled trees , damaged buildings and flooded Twin Cities highways Wednesday , though no injuries were reported .
I thought this would be a great opportunity to see if Judy has done any research on health care since her tele townhall .
I 'd like to know just what she 's going to base her vote on .
Does she have any actual facts yet ?
Is she just using Republican talking points ?
Is she still just using third hand anecdotes for her whole argument against reform ?
So , the meeting is supposed to be held in a condo community 's clubhouse in Hinsdale , IL .
We drove along the beautiful eight foot tall wrought iron fence until we came to a staffed guard house .
Nobody came out of the guard house , so we just drove on in .
We followed the roadway around the complex until we went past the back entrance , which was a " self service " locked door which swings open when you slide your ID card , and the clubhouse was nearby .
The drive was nice and the landscaping and flowers were very pretty .
We parked and went to the clubhouse .
I wish I could tell you what Judy Biggert said at her " public " town hall meeting tonight .
But , nobody could get in unless they showed ID and proved that they lived inside the fence .
Nobody else could get through the door .
Local newspaper and a TV camera were there , and they could not get in , either .
After Judy had been speaking inside for about half an hour , one of her people came out and pretended that he was just so upset we could n't meet with Judy tonight .
He suggested that " our group " could call and ask to see Judy sometime , and she may be able to find time in her schedule .
But , I 'm not part of any organized group .
People asked if she planned to hold a public meeting , and her talking head only repeated the same statement .
There will be no public meeting scheduled by Judy .
We asked when there might be open times in her schedule , and we 'd just pick one of her available times .
It seemed most efficient .
He completely ignored that request and instead insisted that we call and maybe she could bother .
Now , just so you do n't think Judy is being completely unreasonable , he DID offer that Judy has had meetings with various groups on this issue .
Why earlier , she met with AARP !
I was n't invited to that one .
On Wednesday , she 'll meet with the Naperville Chamber of Commerce , but you 'll have to be a member to get in .
So , I wo n't get in to that meeting on health care .
I do n't belong to any of those lobbyist groups .
See a trend here ?
Judy Biggert is meeting with pre-selected people ala George Bush .
Or , she 's meeting with insurance industry and business groups .
But , no meetings for constituients .
No meetings with voters .
If you are n't in some lobbyist group , this republican wo n't bother to arrange a gathering for you .
There were about a 18 - 20 people who were not connected and could not get in tonight .
We talked with the reporters a while , and then we left .
Some of the people set up outside the manned gate and pulled out some signs .
But , I 'll bet Judy snuck out the back gate and avoided even looking at anyone but her selected group .
UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE !!!!
Judy Biggert and Mark Kirk will be hosted by the Naperville Chamber of COmmerce tomorrow , August 12 , from 11 am to 1 pm for a townhall meeting on Health Care at the Arista Hotel Ballroom , 2139 City Gate Lane , Naperville IL

It ’s the ace of diamonds .
If Val could n’t name the card knowing only its value , then it must be an ace , a queen , a 5 , or a 4 , as these are the only values that appear more than once .
If Colin knew that Val could n’t name it , it must be red , as all the red cards have values ( A , Q , 5 , 4 ) that appear more than once .
When Val understands that the card must be red , she can exclude from her list of possibilities the queen , the 5 , and the 4 , as each of those cards appears in a black suit .
That leaves only the ace of diamonds .
Adapted from Julian Havil ’s Impossible ? , 2008 .
UPDATE : Wait , this is cooked .
Havil gives the problem but not the solution , and my solution above is n’t valid .
Thanks ,
Ben and Andrew , for pointing it out .
If anyone can find a valid solution , let me know and I ’ll post it here .
I do n’t think one is possible .
FWIW , this is based on a more famous “ impossible puzzle , ” which is soluble but spectacularly hard .
UPDATE 2 : In Canada or England , does the word “ colour ” mean “ suit ” ?
If so , the problem is soluble .
It seems to have appeared originally on page 14 of a paper [ PDF ] by University of Victoria philosopher Audrey Yap .
The first two steps above are right —
Val can deduce that the card is red and must be A , Q , 5 , or 4 .
The fact that she ’s able to say “ I know the card now ” at this point means it ca n’t be an ace ( because that value appears in both red suits ) .
And the fact that Colin can then say “ I know it too ” means that it must be the five of diamonds .
So , from the top :
Val says , “ I do n’t know what the card is . ”
( She knows it ’s a 5 , but there are two 5s . )
Colin says , “ I knew that you did n’t know . ”
( He knows it ’s a diamond , and thus an A or 5 ; but as each of these values appears more than once in the deck , he knows that Val wo n’t have enough information yet to identify the suit . )
Val says , “ I know the card now . ”
( Colin ’s remark has just told her that the card is red , because all the red cards in this deck have values that appear in multiple suits .
And the only red 5 is 5 ♦ . )
Colin says , “ I know it too . ”
( He knows that Val was looking for an A or a 5 , and that learning the card ’s color was helpful .
Thus she can’t have been looking for an A , as both aces are red .
That leaves 5 ♦ . )
So , if “ colour ” means “ suit , ” the answer is 5 ♦ .
If “ colour ” means “ color , ” then I still think it ’s insoluble .
Thanks to the many smart people who wrote in about this , especially Helge .

Since that tragic loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII , the Oakland Raiders have been a franchise in free fall .
In the six seasons since Chucky exacted his revenge on Al Davis , the Raiders have won just 24 games while losing 72 contests along the way .
Here are the 10 worst moments of those last six years .
10 . Drafting Michael Huff
– While the jury is still out on JaMarcus Russell , Darren McFadden and now Darrius Heyward - Bey , it would appear that the ruling on Michael Huff is a unanimous choice to give his Raider career the death penalty .
Huff Daddy was the 7th pick in the 2006 draft , a draft that might go down as the biggest collection of busts this side of Dolly Parton and a pre-op Soliel Moon Frye .
After being benched halfway through his third year in the NFL , the Raiders drafted a virtual unknown safety by the name of Michael Mitchell to replace him .
Huff has recorded just one interception , one sack and one safety in 39 career starts .
9. Joe Flacco ’s Demolition of Oakland –
In week 8 of the 2008 season , the Baltimore Ravens took apart the Raiders to the tune of 29 - 10 .
That afternoon , the Raider defense made rookie Joe Flacco look like Joe Montana .
Flacco threw a 70 - yard TD in the first quarter , ran for a TD from 12 yards out in the fourth quarter and to add insult to injury , Flacco burned linebacker Ricky Brown for a 43 - yard reception as well .
8 . The 2008 Raider Free Agency Class – Few franchises have shown such poor personnel decisions in a decade as the Raiders did in just one summer .
Last year , Al Davis committed $ 70 million to DeAngelo Hall , $ 55 million to Javon Walker , $ 39 million to Gibril Wilson and $ 16 million to Kwame Harris .
Hall played opposite Nnamdi Asomugha and got undressed more often than Vida Guerra .
The Raiders severed ties with MeAngelo just 8 games into a 7 - year deal .
Wilson and Harris were both let go just one year after signing multiyear contracts .
Meanwhile , Walker caught a grand total of 15 passes in ’08 then needed season ending ankle surgery and is now attempting to comeback from a secret knee surgery he had during the offseason .
7. Sebastian Janikowski’s Fake Field Goal –
If you met Sebastian Janikowski on the street , you most likely would think he ’s either a construction worker or a bouncer for a Ukrainian night club .
As Tom Cable learned the hard way , it just wo n’t end well when you try to give the ball to a 260 pound kicker who runs a 7.5 second 40 - yard dash .
A winnable game against the Kansas City Chiefs became a 20 - 13 loss thanks in large part to Cable ’s gutsy yet misguided effort to fool everyone in the stadium including his own team .
6. Tyler Brayton knees Jeremy Stevens in the “ man region ” – Losing 16 - 0 on Monday Night Football and allowing 9 sacks is embarrassing .
Losing your cool and kneeing an opponent in the package – even if that opponent is as dirty as Borat ’s bed sheets – is reason to stop watching football all together .
It still amazes me that the Raiders won two games in 2006 .
That ’06 team will forever be remembered as the worst offense in NFL history and for Tyler Brayton giving Seahawk tight end Jeremy Stevens a friendly reminder of where the Raider stereotypes come from .
5. Opening Night Losses on National Television –
The start of each season brings the hope of a new day .
If you ’re a Raider fan , the start of each of the last six seasons has been a reminder of just how much liquor you ’ll need to make it to the New Year .
Twice in the last three years the Raiders have opened the season in primetime on Monday Night and they ’ve lost those two games by a combined score of 68 - 14 .
The Chargers rolled the Raiders in a Monday Night sack fest in 2006 to the tune of 27- 0 .
Then Jay Cutler , rookie Eddie Royal and every player in a Bronco jersey picked on DeAngelo Hall in route to a 41 - 14 loss on the ’08 Monday Night debacle .
History is against us , but the Raiders and Chargers will again be on Monday Night to open the 2009 season .
Let ’s hope that Tom Cable plants a few land mines on the Charger sideline for that night .
4. Rehiring Art Shell – Al Davis had an Uncle Rico moment in 2006 when he tried to relive his football past .
Davis turned back the clock to 1990 and rehired Art Shell .
Shell ’s stoic sideline glare became the face of ineptitude .
As if the Art Shell move was n’t bad enough , the Raiders topped themselves by resurrecting the career of offensive coordinator Tom Walsh .
Walsh was out of pro football for more than a decade and had been running a bed and breakfast in Idaho .
Walsh ’s dubious contribution to the NFL record books was to place Randy Moss in the annals as having played for not only the highest scoring offenses in football history but also as a member of one of the worst ever .
Walsh ’s offense tallied just 168 points in 2006 , an average of 10.5 per game .
If history holds to form , expect to see a Mike White rehiring in 2011 .
3. Trading Randy Moss to the Patriots – The Randy Moss era in Oakland will go down as one of the worst marriages in pro sports since Mike Ditka took the plunge with Ricky Williams .
By the time the Raiders were ready to move Moss , his value had fallen so far that the Patriots were the only team willing to give up anything higher than a 5th round pick .
The Raiders got a fourth round pick and the Pats got a nearly perfect season out of the deal .
While the arrogance of the Hoddie was squashed by an epic failure in the Super Bowl loss to the Giants , the Raiders cannot be excused from getting nothing out of the most dangerous weapon in the modern game .
Moss has played for the highest scoring offenses in NFL history yet was only good for 6 wins in two years in the East Bay .
2. Brett Favre ’s Defining Moment – Brett Favre will be remembered for many things .
Among the Favre memories are his myopic attempts to stay in the spotlight and his destruction of the Oakland Raiders only one day after the passing of his father .
Favre gave John Madden a Viagra free night on the evening of December 22nd , 2003 , by torching the Raiders with 4 first half TD passes in route to a 41 - 7 spanking on Monday Night .
For the rest of the world it was heart warming and inspiring .
For Raider Nation , it was sickening and painful .
1. The Painful End to Rich Gannon ’s Career – Gannon was the last great offensive player to wear Silver and Black .
He was a dedicated leader with a tireless work ethic and a hunger for perfection .
The journeymen QB would lead the Raiders to three consecutive AFC West titles , a birth in the Super Bowl and was named the NFL ’s most valuable player in 2002 .
As fate would have it , the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Jon Gruden were responsible for the decline of the Raider franchise in more ways than one .
Gruden ’s squad gave Gannon the two worst moments of his career in both the Super Bowl loss and the injury that would end his career .
A helmet - to - helmet hit with Derrick Brooks left Gannon with a broken vertebra in his neck .
With Gannon ’s inevitable retirement , the Raiders have spun out of control and are now mired in the worst six year stretch in NFL history .
Tomorrow , we ’ll take a look at the 10 best moments of the last six years .
Yes , there are actually 10 of them .

Mining is a key business in Australia
The Australian parliament has rejected government plans to introduce an ambitious carbon trading scheme to tackle global warming .
The measure was the centrepiece of the government 's environment plans , and would have cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5 % over the next 10 years .
But opposition senators who control the upper house feared the legislation would harm the country 's mining sector .
The government can re-introduce the legislation after three months .
Climate Change Minister Penny Wong confirmed after the Senate defeat by 42 votes to 30 that the government would seek to do this .
However , if the government is defeated again it could trigger a general election .
Business groups said the scheme would delay economic recovery and lead to job losses .
The environmental lobby , meanwhile , believed that the targets set by the legislation were not tough enough .
Australia has the highest per capita emissions in the developed world and coal is its biggest export .
Under the plan , due to be introduced in July 2011 , a one - year fixed price period would be introduced for the first year , with carbon permits costing A$ 10 ( $ 7 , £ 5 ) per tonne , followed by a floating price until July 2013 .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had earlier said that the range of the emissions reduction target could be increased up to 25 % of 2000 levels if other nations agreed similar targets .
The previous target was to reduce emissions by between 5 % and 15 % of 2000 levels by 2020 .

Nonsense ! ,
" The war is over , "
Perhaps , "
" at each of these periods there were possibilities of great change or disaster , and the vague feeling of uncertainty may have led to the dim vision in sleep . "
" Perhaps .
" About 10 days ago , " the president told them , " I retired very late .
I had been up waiting for important dispatches from the front .
I could not have been long in bed when I fell into a slumber , for I was weary .
I soon began to dream .
There seemed to be a deathlike stillness about me .
Then I heard subdued sobs , as if a number of people were weeping .
I thought I left my bed and wandered downstairs .
There the silence was broken by the same pitiful sobbing , but the mourners were invisible .
I went from room to room ; no living person was in sight , but the same mournful sounds of distress met me as I passed along .
I saw light in all the rooms ; every object was familiar to me ; but where were all the people who were grieving as if their hearts would break ?
I was puzzled and alarmed .
What could be the meaning of all this ?
Determined to find the cause of a state of things so mysterious and so shocking , I kept on until I arrived at the East Room , which I entered .
There I met with a sickening surprise .
Before me was a catafalque , on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments .
Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as guards ; and there was a throng of people , gazing mournfully upon the corpse , whose face was covered , others weeping pitifully .
" ' Who is dead in the White House ? '
I demanded of one of the soldiers .
" ' The president , ' was his answer , 'he was killed by an assassin . '
Then came a loud burst of grief from the crowd , which woke me from my dream .
I slept no more that night ; and although it was only a dream , I have been strangely annoyed by it ever since . "
" I 'm going to kill the president . "
" Yeah - ha - ha .
" Right . "
" Delivery , "
" Medication . "
" Do n't wish to disturb you .
Are you at home ?

NOTE :
Tribe to lose $ 16 million this season according to owner Paul Dolan
In an interview with AP sports writer Tom Withers , Indians owner Paul Dolan revealed that the club will lose $ 16 million this season .
Dolan also admitted that the recent trades of Cy Young winner Cliff Lee and popular catcher Victor Martinez were necessary long - term moves in order to move the franchise in a new direction .
“ Every four or five years , if we can have a shot at the World Series and compete for the playoffs like we did in ’05 , that ’s as good as it gets , ” Dolan said .
In a candid interview Thursday , Dolan projected that the Indians , currently in fourth place in the AL Central , will lose $ 16 million this season despite revenue - sharing from major league baseball .
The Indians will need to borrow money over the next few years , Dolan said , but the club has no plans to ask the league for the loans .
“ After we traded Cliff , we had made a commitment toward a new direction for the franchise , ” he said .
“ At that point , you do n’t go halfway .
We needed to make moves that put us in the best position to compete as soon as possible .
The sense was in our organization that Vic ( Martinez ) was at his highest value and what we got back in return put us in a better position than we would have been had we kept them . ”
I ’m sure Tribe fans will be excited to know that their favorite team is essentially trying to compete for the World Series and playoffs “ every four or five years ” when the Red Sox are competing for a World Series every year .
Then again , not everybody can spend like the Red Sox and of course to a more extreme extent , the Yankees .
It ’s easy to see what the Indians are trying to do in re-stocking their farm in hopes that they can compete down the road , but it must be a deflating feeling to be a Tribe fan right now , knowing that your team just gave up on immediate success .
After all , this team was on the brink of a World Series appearance just two seasons ago ( 2007 ) .
Correcting Robert Kaplan
Over at the Atlantic , journalist Robert Kaplan has a thoughtful piece on why the United States is losing patience with Israel and says that my work with John Mearsheimer on the Israel lobby marked a watershed in this process .
I might take issue with his claim that the book " has several flaws " ( he does n’t say what he thinks they are ) , but I appreciate his giving us credit for shifting the discourse on this important subject .
Nonetheless , he makes two observations that I would like to correct , or at least clarify .
First , Kaplan says that " the book alleges that it was Israel ’s supporters in America who played a pivotal role in influencing the Bush administration to go to war in Iraq in 2003 . "
To be precise , we do not claim that it was " Israel ’s supporters " who played this pivotal role , because we were well aware that there are many supporters of Israel who also opposed the war .
Rather , we argued that " the driving force behind the Iraq war was a small band of neoconservatives " ( who are a subset of those Americans who are also strongly supportive of Israel ) , and we also documented how some ( but not all ) of the other individuals and organizations in the broader Israel lobby also helped sell the war here in the United States .
We emphasized that the neoconservatives and other backers of the war did not cause it by themselves and that the broader international context and the 9/11 attacks were critical factors that helped convince President Bush and Vice President Cheney that ousting Saddam was a good idea .
In short , the phrase " Israel ’s supporters " is too broad , and mischaracterizes our argument .
Second , Kaplan writes that the fact that we " felt confident enough to go so far out on a limb on this sensitive issue is telling , " and then says that " nobody takes such a risk without outside encouragement . "
For the record , nobody encouraged us to write on this topic ( apart from the Atlantic editor who originally asked us to do an article on the lobby ) .
We were aware of the risks , and John and I debated whether to do it for several weeks before deciding to go ahead .
Indeed , no one knew we were working on the project until we had finished our subsequent draft for the London Review of Books and began sending it to various experts for comments and suggestions .
Kaplan is correct to say that we got a lot of positive feedback after we published it ( most of it in private correspondence ) , but there was no " outside encouragement " beforehand .

A judge has awarded the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) $ 675,000 in the Sony v. Tenenbaum filing sharing case , in which 25 - year old Joel Tenenbaum was convicted of downloading MP3s from the file - sharing site Kazaa while in college .
While the substantial reward could discourage a few future file - sharers from downloading music illegally , we think it 's unlikely it will encourage the RIAA to bring more suits -- given comments made by the lobbying group in Aug.
2008 , when it told Congress it would not pursue any new cases .
While some reports claimed it had brought new cases to court as recently as April , 2009 , we contacted the RIAA this morning and it said that these cases were continuations of old " John Doe " cases in which the identity of the actual person downloading the files could not be determined , and that no new cases had been made since the fall of 2008 or would be made in the future .
The award could have been as high as $ 4.5 million , far higher than a previous judgement of $ 1.92 million against file - swapper Jammie Thomas - Rasset of Minnesota made last month .
Tenenbaum was not saddled with such a heavy judgement , but the $ 675,000 penalty does amount to $ 22,500 per song .
Of course , given that he is only 25 , chances are the RIAA will have a very hard time collecting .
Here is the RIAA 's statement about the verdict :
" We are grateful for the jury 's service and their recognition of the impact of illegal downloading on the music community .
We appreciate that Mr. Tenenbaum finally acknowledged that artists and music companies deserve to be paid for their work .
From the beginning , that 's what this case has been about .
We only wish he had done so sooner rather than lie about his illegal behavior . "

Dear Republicans ,
Over the past week , we have seen your passionate protests and heard your concerns about Democratic proposals for health care reform .
We have considered your insightful and well reasoned arguments , and on behalf of progressives everywhere , I am here to say : OK !
We give up !
We are willing to compromise on the proposals that concern you .
You 've won !
Yay !
In accordance with your cogent and potent criticisms , these are the terms of our concession :
We will not euthanize your grandmother .
This is the big one , and I really hope you guys appreciate how much of a concession this is on behalf of the progressive movement .
Since the days of the Bull Moose Party , progressives have wanted nothing more than to slaughter old people by the millions .
That much is obvious .
After all , if we wanted senior citizens to have long and healthy lives , why would we have created Social Security and Medicare ?
Think about it .
Death to grannies has long been the core of progressive policy , so it 's not without some consternation that we give it up .
So there : no euthanizing old people .
You 've got it .
Rahm Emanuel 's brother will not kill Sarah Palin 's baby .
While this will require us to gut HR 3200 " America 's Health Choices and Murder Sarah Palin 's Baby Act of 2009 , " we 're currently working with Henry Waxman to remove the extensive Sarah Palin 's baby - killing provisions from the final bill .
While this will probably cost us Andrew Sullivan 's support , we recognize that this is a necessary sacrifice for securing broad bipartisan support of health care reform .
The government will not nationalize hospitals and other health service providers .
This is another big one .
Though the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has correctly pointed out that current Democratic proposals involve adopting the British health care system , we now recognize that this is not politically viable .
The final bill , accordingly , will not involve the nationalization of hospitals and other health service providers .
This will be a major setback to Obama 's well known communist agenda , but again , we progressives agree with the Blue Dogs that we need to reach a broad national consensus by responding to Republican concerns .
We will make the health care reform bill available for all Americans to read as soon as possible .
I know that conservatives and pundits have been eagerly anticipating an opportunity to read the final health care reform bill , and after extensive discussion , we have decided to comply with your request .
While we would like to have unseen drafts languishing in committee forever , we have asked Senate Democrats like Max Baucus and Kent Conrad to deliver a bill as soon as possible in order to allow the public to read it .
As you know , progressives wanted nothing more than to keep these drafts hidden for as long as possible , but in the interests of transparency and bipartisan consensus , we recognize that it 's vital to move the legislative process forward .
In fact , it is our hope that Baucus and Conrad will return from the August recess early in order to ensure that the public has as much time as possible to inspect their work .
We will not subsidize abortions with your hard - earned tax dollars .
Despite the fact that both FactCheck.org and Politifact insist that we already made this concession months ago , we 're going to make extra-special - super sure that we did .
Just give me a second ...
...
...
...
... yep , we did .
We will not allow the government to have direct access to your bank account .
I know several conservatives I 've spoken to are deeply concerned about this measure , and while we progressives are always looking for new ways for the government to unlawfully violate your privacy and steal your money , we have decided to remove this provision from the final bill .
While we may include a way for individuals to voluntarily set up an electronic funds transfer with their insurance provider , we will no longer push for government access to all individual bank accounts .
You 've won this one .
We will not provide illegal immigrants with unlimited free health care .
Though progressives want nothing more than to provide unlimited social services to illegal immigrants while denying them to everyone else , we now recognize that this plan was , perhaps , a bit inequitable .
However , while they will not be receiving unlimited free health care , each illegal immigrant will still receive a pretty pony .
I 'm sorry , but we have to draw the line somewhere .
Private health insurance will not be eliminated .
Though , as Drudge recently pointed out with a damning YouTube video , the long - stated Republican goal of moving away from employer - based coverage somehow means " eliminating private insurance " when Obama talks about the same thing , we 've decided to preserve private insurance plans for those who want them .
However , we have yet to convince ultra-socialist Charles Krauthammer to drop his communist crusade against employer - based ( i.e. , according to Drudge , " all private " ) coverage .
You will not be issued a " National Health Insurance ID . "
While we thought this was a fun idea , the final version of the health care reform bill will not require you to have any kind of ID when you 're pulled over for drunk driving or found loitering outside of a military base .
In fact , you are hereby encouraged not to carry any proof of insurance whatsoever .
Trust me , it 's a terrible idea !
There will be no super - secret - awesome health care program for ACORN employees .
Though we love our election - stealing squirrels , we have decided that they 'll have to settle for the same options as everyone else .
With these concessions having been made , I trust that we can now move forward on health care reform with a broad , bipartisan consensus .
Blue Dogs and Republicans , you can now rest easy knowing that the concerns of the town hall protesters have been met .
While the progressive dream of a nation in which old people are slaughtered to pay for the abortions of ACORN - employed illegal immigrants will again have to be deferred , we are willing to settle for a bill without these measures in the name of bipartisanship .
Congratulations , Republicans .
You 've won this round .

Enlarge By Steve Castillo , AP Ray Bradbury says he hopes that kids who read the new graphic novel of Fahrenheit 451 will then want to read the original novel .
Fahrenheit 451 in nine days — it came like an " explosion " of words , he says — his science - fiction classic is being reissued today as a graphic novel .
Fifty - six years after Ray Bradbury wrote the first draft ofin nine days — it came like an " explosion " of words , he says — his science - fiction classic is being reissued today as a graphic novel .
" It 's beautiful , " says Bradbury , who turns 89 on Aug. 22 , and harbors hopes that a new movie version will be made in his lifetime of a future in which literature is banned and firemen burn books .
Fahrenheit 451 : The Authorized Adaptation by illustrator Tim Hamilton ( Hill and Wang , $ 30 hardcover , $ 16.95 paperback ) follows François Truffaut 's 1966 film , stage and radio productions and a video - game version .
The title refers to the temperature at which books burn .
Bradbury wrote an introduction to the latest adaptation , but otherwise , " I did n't interfere . "
Speaking by phone from his Los Angeles home , he imagines " someone giving it to a 10 - year - old kid who then wants to read the original novel .
That 's what good graphic novels can do .
They can make you read more . "
Fahrenheit remains a staple of high school and college reading lists , which prompts a question : Does Bradbury worry that students will read just the graphic novel ?
" I do n't know , but I know when I was 5 years old , my parents gave me an illustrated version of Beauty and the Beast , and I loved it so much that I decided that I had to learn to read , and I did . "
He adds , " When I was 9 , the Buck Rogers comics took me to the future , and I never came back . "
Despite a stroke in 1999 , Bradbury continues to write short stories ( 500 and counting ) .
He can no longer type , so he dictates them to his daughter Alexandra .
He says Truffaut 's movie , with Julie Christie and Oskar Werner , was " ruined " by downplaying one of the novel 's characters , the free - thinking and questioning student Clarisse McClellan .
And he 's disappointed that during the decade in which Mel Gibson has owned the rights , no production deal has been made .
He says Gibson called him recently , " for the first time in six years , " to say he 's still interested .
If so , Bradbury has casting suggestions : Sean Connery as Fire Capt .
Beatty , who was once an avid reader , and Nicolas Cage as Guy Montag , a conflicted fireman :
The actors " are friends , and I 'd love to give them the work . "

Why August 25th ?

There are actually three " birthdays " one can identify for Linux :
The first was July 3rd , 1991 , when Linus posted his first query to a newsgroup for some information he needed to help him with a project .
That project was , of course , Linux :
From:torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI ( Linus Benedict Torvalds )
Newsgroup : comp.os.minix
Subject : GCC - 1.40 and a posix question
Message -ID : 1991Jul13 , 100050.9886@klaava.Helsinki.FI
Date : 3 Jul 91 10:00:50 GMT
Hello netlanders ,
Due a project I 'm working on ( in minix ) , I 'm interested in the posix
standard definition .
Could somebody please point me to a ( preferably )
machine - readable format of the latest posix rules ?
Ftp-sites would be
nice .
Linus Torvalds torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi
The next was August 25th , 1991 , when Linus first let the cat out of the bag about his project :
From:torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI ( Linus Benedict Torvalds )
Newsgroup : comp.os.minix
Subject :
What would you like to see most in minix ?
Summary : small poll for my new operating system
Message -ID : 1991 Aug25 , 20578.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI
Date : 25 Aug 91 20:57:08 GMT
Organization : University of Helsinki .
Hello everybody out there using minix -
I 'm doing a ( free ) operating system ( just a hobby , wo n't be big
and professional like gnu ) for 386 ( 486 ) AT clones .
This has
been brewing since april , and is starting to get ready .
I 'd like
any feedback on things people like / dislike in minix ; as my OS
resembles it somewhat ( same physical layout of the file - sytem
due to practical reasons ) among other things .
I 've currently ported bash ( 1.08 ) an gcc ( 1.40 ) , and things seem to work .
This implies that i'll get something practical within a few months , and I'd
like to know what features most people want .
Any suggestions are welcome ,
but I wo n't promise I 'll implement them :-)
Linus Torvalds torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi
Finally came Linus ' call to arms on October 5th , 1991 , when he posted this :
From : torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI ( Linus Benedict Torvalds )
Newsgroups : comp.os.minix
Subject : Free minix - like kernel sources for 386-AT
Message -ID : <1991Oct5.054106.4647@klaava.Helsinki.FI >
Date : 5 Oct 91 05:41:06 GMT
Organization : University of Helsinki
Do you pine for the nice days of minix - 1.1 , when men were men and wrote
their own device drivers ?
Are you without a nice project and just dying
to cut your teeth on a OS you can try to modify for your needs ?
Are you
finding it frustrating when everything works on minix ?
No more all -
nighters to get a nifty program working ?
Then this post might be just
for you :-)
As I mentioned a month ( ? ) ago , I 'm working on a free version of a
minix - lookalike for AT - 386 computers .
It has finally reached the stage
where it 's even usable ( though may not be depending on what you want ) ,
and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution .
It is
just version 0.02 ( +1 ( very small ) patch already ) , but I 've successfully
run bash / gcc / gnu - make / gnu-sed / compress etc under it .
Three clear candidates for a birthday , but one can , of course , have only one .
The 3 - Jul - 1991 message does not actually mention what the project * is* , while the 5 - Oct - 1991 message refers to his message earlier , which clearly mentions " I 'm doing a ( free ) operating system " .
Therefore , by convention , Linux was " born " on 25 - Aug - 1991 .
By the way , the name " Linux " did n't come from Linus .
That name was given by Ari Lemke , who chose it over Linus ' preferred name for the OS when he created the subdirectory for the source code on nic.funet.
fi .
So what was Linus ' preferred name for his baby ?
" Freax "
One can see that while Linus may be a great programmer and leader of ( wo ) men , he really should leave the process of naming projects to other people ;-)
STILL GRIM : Statistics New Zealand figures show exports fell 5.4 per cent in the June quarter , while imports were down 3.4 per cent .
New figures are highlighting fears that the improvement in New Zealand 's trade performance is in danger of petering out .
Data published today by Statistics New Zealand ( SNZ ) showed this country posted a $ 417 million trade deficit in June , dramatically different from the median forecast among economists of a $ 265 m surplus .
While the result was heavily skewed by the importation of several large aircraft for the start of domestic services by Jetstar , the figures also showed up worrying trends in major agricultural exports .
Excluding the aircraft , which were valued at $ 571 m , the trade balance would have been a surplus of $ 154 m , SNZ said .
But Goldman Sachs JBWere New Zealand strategist Bernard Doyle said the major disappointment was with exports , which fell 11 percent or $ 395 m from June 2008 to $ 3.2 billion last month .
Declines in dairy and meat exports were the key driver , and not surprising as those sectors were booming a year ago .
But volume data told a more concerning story , with dairy export tonnage up a " massive " 54 percent in the June quarter from a year earlier .
" This is clearly unsustainable and suggests dairy exports will underperform over coming months as volumes normalise , " Mr Doyle said .
The strength in dairy volumes had masked the impact of weak prices , while the rise in the New Zealand dollar was showing signs of weighing on other sectors .
At the same time , recovery in the domestic economy was likely to see import growth pick up .
" In other words , NZ 's nascent trade recovery is in danger of being snuffed out prematurely , " he said .
SNZ 's figures put the value of imports for June at $ 3.6 b , down $ 192 m or 5.1 percent from June 2008 .
Until the June deficit , New Zealand 's trade balance had been in surplus for four consecutive months .
ASB economist Jane Turner said that the trade surpluses had been driven by recovery in dairy production , following last season 's drought , and weakness in import demand due to recession .
" As we head into a new dairy season , dairy production will no longer be making a strong contribution to export strength and the underlying weakness in export demand will become apparent . "
With exports falling and imports likely to be flat , trade surpluses were not likely to carry on throughout the second half of 2009 .
For the year to June , the country recorded a trade deficit of $ 3.18 b .
The value of exports for the year to June rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier to $ 43 b , while imports rose 3.8 percent to $ 46.2 b .
For the June quarter exports fell a seasonally adjusted 5.4 percent from the preceding three months to $ 10.2 b , while imports fell 3.4 percent to $ 10.4 b .
The seasonally adjusted trade deficit for the latest quarter was $ 217 m , following an almost nil deficit in the March quarter .

As expected , The Pirate Bay moved a step closer Thursday to being sold to a Swedish - based software concern that hopes to turn the world 's notorious BitTorrent tracker into a legitimate , pay - to - play site .
Global Gaming Factory shareholders approved the $ 8.5 million transaction Thursday , four months after The Pirate Bay 's four co-founders were found guilty of facilitating copyright infringement .
Within weeks , the site is expected to become a subscription - based service , although no major content providers have agreed to license their wares .
The sale , which is expected to be largely funded via Hans Pandeya , Global Gaming 's chief executive , is one of two major blows to the illicit file sharing scene .
On Wednesday , Dutch - based Mininova , which many believed would become one of the main alternatives to a legitimate Pirate Bay , was ordered by a European court to remove all its copyrighted material or face millions in fines .
Still , concerns remain over Global Gaming 's ability to remain solvent or perhaps even complete the deal .
The AktieTorget , the Swedish - based exchange where the company is listed , is examining whether to delist the company amidallegations of insider trading ahead of the deal 's initial announcement weeks ago .
Pandeya and other board members are the main shareholders , and Pandeya promised to sell some of his holdings to help shore up the deal .
The Pirate Bay , as of 9:30 a.m. PDT , appeared operational for file sharers to hijack movies , games , software and music for free – despite a court order demanding it be shuttered .
The Pirate Bay 's four co-founders each face a year in prison , but remain free pending appeal .
The Pirate Bay 's domain still remains under the control of Fredrik Neij , one of the 5 - year - old site 's founders .

The circuit was recreated with 20,000 sections of track
Thousands of people turned out to watch Top Gear presenter James May 's attempt to recreate the famous banked Brooklands track out of Scalextric .
May and helpers pieced together 20,000 sections of track over the original 2.75 - mile ( 4.42 km ) circuit to set a world record .
His attempt is being scrutinised by the Guinness World Records and filmed as part of a new TV series .
Brooklands race track , in Weybridge , Surrey , closed in 1939 .
The team had to cross a river and roads to complete the circuit .
Slot car race
Once the track was finished , local residents and museum volunteers raced against a team of Scalextric Club members and enthusiasts .
The current record for a so - called slot car track measures 1.59 miles ( 2.56 km ) and was built in Berlin on 5 October 2007 .
Brooklands opened on 17 June 1907 and closed at the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , when the aerodrome was requisitioned by the government .
It had two banked sections nearly 30 ft ( 9 m ) high and cost £ 150,000 to build .
Last weekend May and student engineers at the University of Liverpool built a Meccano bridge to span part of a canal in Merseyside .
He has also created a house out of Lego for his new series , James May 's Toy Stories , which sees him make life - size constructions out of toys .

WASHINGTON , Jan 8 ( Reuters ) - France , Japan and Australia rated best and the United States worst in new rankings focusing on preventable deaths due to treatable conditions in 19 leading industrialized nations , researchers said on Tuesday .
If the U.S. health care system performed as well as those of those top three countries , there would be 101,000 fewer deaths in the United States per year , according to researchers writing in the journal Health Affairs .
Researchers Ellen Nolte and Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine tracked deaths that they deemed could have been prevented by access to timely and effective health care , and ranked nations on how they did .
They called such deaths an important way to gauge the performance of a country 's health care system .
Nolte said the large number of Americans who lack any type of health insurance -- about 47 million people in a country of about 300 million , according to U.S. government estimates -- probably was a key factor in the poor showing of the United States compared to other industrialized nations in the study .
" I would n't say it ( the last - place ranking ) is a condemnation , because I think health care in the U.S. is pretty good if you have access .
But if you do n't , I think that 's the main problem , is n't it ? "
Nolte said in a telephone interview .
In establishing their rankings , the researchers considered deaths before age 75 from numerous causes , including heart disease , stroke , certain cancers , diabetes , certain bacterial infections and complications of common surgical procedures .
Such deaths accounted for 23 percent of overall deaths in men and 32 percent of deaths in women , the researchers said .
France did best -- with 64.8 deaths deemed preventable by timely and effective health care per 100,000 people , in the study period of 2002 and 2003 .
Japan had 71.2 and Australia had 71.3 such deaths per 100,000 people .
The United States had 109.7 such deaths per 100,000 people , the researchers said .
After the top three , Spain was fourth best , followed in order by Italy , Canada , Norway , the Netherlands , Sweden , Greece , Austria , Germany , Finland , New Zealand , Denmark , Britain , Ireland and Portugal , with the United States last .
PREVIOUS RANKINGS
The researchers compared these rankings with rankings for the same 19 countries covering the period of 1997 and 1998 .
France and Japan also were first and second in those rankings , while the United States was 15th , meaning it fell four places in the latest rankings .
All the countries made progress in reducing preventable deaths from these earlier rankings , the researchers said .
These types of deaths dropped by an average of 16 percent for the nations in the study , but the U.S. decline was only 4 percent .
The research was backed by the Commonwealth Fund , a private New York - based health policy foundation .
" It is startling to see the U.S. falling even farther behind on this crucial indicator of health system performance , " Commonwealth Fund Senior Vice President Cathy Schoen said .
" The fact that other countries are reducing these preventable deaths more rapidly , yet spending far less , indicates that policy , goals and efforts to improve health systems make a difference , " Schoen added in a statement .
Gap 's ad campaign for its new line of 1969 Premium Jeans is meant to harken back to the chain 's early days as a purveyor of Levi ’s and vinyl records .
But instead of making you think about Gap ’s 40 - year legacy , it probably reminds you of something else : those minimalist , soft - porn ads for American Apparel .
( Above is a new Gap ad by Laird & Partners ; a 2008 American Apparel ad is shown below . )
Considering how American Apparel has saturated just about every city and social network with its stark white backgrounds , Helvetica headlines and erogenous models , I have a hard time believing Gap is unaware of the similarity , even if its ads are quite a bit classier in tone .
So , is this an intentional effort to co-opt the hipster style and perceived affordability of American Apparel ?
( Starting at $ 59.50 , Gap ’s new jeans will rival or even beat American Apparel ’s pricing of $ 74 - plus . )
Or maybe I ’m wrong , as Gap 's ads certainly do n’t seem like the daydreams of a sexual predator .

I 've had versions of this conversation many times over the last fifteen years :
Perfectly Nice and Well Meaning Person : " So , you work with children ? "
Me : " Yes . "
Perfectly Nice Person : " They are so smart . "
Me : " Some of them are , sure . "
Nice Person : " Boy , I wish I had an autistic kid .
I 'd make a million bucks in Vegas ! "
Me : ( sighing )
In 1988 , Dustin Hoffman won the best actor Oscar for his performance in Rainman .
For a good chunk of my , I 've had to explain to people that most autistic folk are not at all like Hoffman 's portrayal .
Before Rainman , many people had never heard of autism .
That movie and subsequent news stories about real children with autism focused on the autistic superman : Children and adults with the ability to memorize the phone book , play a concerto with zero training , and see mathematic equations float in a way similar to Russell Crowe 's Beautiful Mind ( even though he did not portray an autistic person in the film ) .
Rainman 's popularity shaped perceptions of autism for many years .
It certainly shaped mine .
In 1993 , when I first met a person with autism , it was nothing like I 'd imagined .
I played with a 4 - year old boy named Simon who did n't obsessively keep track of the time , did n't watch Judge Wapner on the People 's court , and did n't need to have his boxer shorts purchased at K - Mart .
Instead , Simon loved to play with his plastic toy cookie monster .
And he liked watching me go down a slide over and over , giggling each time I did so .
He also was n't a savant .
He was just a great kid .
I remember thinking , " This is not what I expected . "
I believe doctors misdiagnosed autism in the late 80's and early 90's with regularity , and I am sure Rainman did n't help .
Here in 2009 Autism has made its way into the mainstream consciousness .
The rest of the world understands more about the disorder .
Still , there seem to be two types of autistic people in most people 's minds :
1 ) The severely autistic , who does not speak , repetitiously waves his hands in front of his face ( or some other stim ) , and is in a seeming fog .
2 ) The hyper - smart case , who , like Sheldon on TV show The Big Bang Theory , works in a lab somewhere , drives a car , etc .
( If you are unfamiliar with Sheldon , here 's a great clip from the show )
While there are some people with autism who fit neatly into these two archetypes , the vast majority do not .
I 've known many parents who explained about their child 's autism to their fellow airline passengers , grocery store shoppers , etc .
This can be a fantastic thing to do in certain situations as it often results in help and sympathy for the parent , rather than disdainful glances .
If you are the parent of an autistic child , sometimes it may help to go further than simply saying , " My daughter is autistic . "
Explaining what your child likes and some of her skills may make for an easier flight for everyone .
Smiling as you say , " My daughter has autism , so you may hear from her a bit over the course of this trip .
She really loves talking about Elmo , so I in advance if you are not a big fan of his . " can make all the difference .
Giving the people sitting next to you on the airplane more information about your daughter allows them not only to be helpful and appreciate your daughter more , but also opens them up to autism 's myriad aspects .
It took about fifteen years to overcome Dustin Hoffman 's performance in Rainman .
It 's 2009 .
We should n't have to wait until 2024 for everyone to understand the truth : Autism has many faces .

What do you give a congressman for his birthday ?
If you 're Senate candidate Rand Paul and you 're choosing presents for dad , Rep. Ron Paul , whose birthday was yesterday , you go for gifts that scream politics .
" I gave him an original copy of Barry Goldwater 's Conscience of a Conservative that was given to me by the publisher , " Rand Paul tells Whispers , adding that it was published in Kentucky , where he 's running for U.S. Senate .
He also gave his pop , who 's a big fan of economics , some early 20th - century currency called gold certificates .
" So I gave him that , framed , with a statement at the bottom that says , ' When paper was as good as gold , ' " he says .
Though that 's nice , what Ron gave back to his son was better ; he let Rand use his birth date as a fundraiser .
" His birthday present to me , I guess , was helping with the ' money bomb , ' " says Rand Paul .
His campaign scheduled a money bomb — a mass online donation for Ron 's birthday and , within 24 hours , added $ 430,000 to its coffers .
While the underdog candidate has now raised over $ 680,000 , the original goal for yesterday 's money bomb was $ 1 million .
Rand tells us he 's not disappointed .
" I think you set high goals in order to try to motivate people to go for things , " he says .
" When my dad raised $ 6 million online [ during his presidential campaign ] , nobody remembers that his goal was $ 10 million . "

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
An angry , naked man commandeered a school bus full of teenage students Thursday in Atlanta , police said .
The man drove the bus for less than a mile before a student confronted him and the bus crashed into a wall off the road , according to police .
The incident started Thursday afternoon when the bus stopped to let students out , said Atlanta police officer James Polite .
Arris Pitmon , 23 , darted toward the bus and hoisted himself in through an open window , Polite said .
Pitmon took control of the bus as the frightened driver ran to the back of it , the officer said .
While the bus was moving , the man abandoned the steering wheel and walked toward the back of the bus , Polite added .
A student then ran toward the steering wheel , prompting the man to fight the student .
The unmanned bus continued until it left the roadway and crashed .
Students fled the bus , many using the back door emergency exit , and onlookers subdued the man until police arrived .
Some students were taken to area hospitals .
Their conditions were n't available Thursday night .
Chiquita Rogers told CNN affiliate WXIA that the man had tried to hit some of the students , including her 16 - year - old , Donte .
" He pushed my son , and that 's when my son hit him .
I guess everybody started swinging , and everybody just started out the back door , jumping .
I 'm just grateful that my son is still alive , because it could have been worse . "
Onlooker Corey Turner told WXIA , " Children were jumping out the emergency door ... jumping off the bus .
...
They were saying , ' Help , help , help ! ... Somebody hijacked the bus . ' "

TONY EASTLEY : It 's amazing what people will do for love .
A Palestinian woman has braved the threat of Israeli bombs by crawling more than one kilometre through a dangerous underground tunnel between Egypt and Gaza just to marry her sweetheart .
The tunnels are mostly used to smuggle rockets and other weapons to Hamas militants in Gaza or goods not allowed through the strict Israeli blockade .
People regularly die either from tunnels collapsing or the occasional Israeli bomb .
But for May Ahmed love conquered any fear and she was married on Tuesday .
Middle East correspondent Anne Barker reports .
( Sounds of music and clapping )
ANNE BARKER : True love it seems truly does know no bounds , least of all for a Palestinian couple who faced a giant hurdle to getting married .
He lived in Gaza which has been under total blockade for two years by the Israelis determined to stop further rocket attacks .
She lived in the West Bank , barely two hours away by road but separated by Israel .
And for a long while it seemed they might never even meet .
MOHAMMED WARDA ( translated ) : Unfortunately the Israelis they did n't show any mercy for us to let us meet .
ANNE BARKER : Twenty - five year old Mohammed Warda was introduced to 23 - year - old May Ahmed via Webcam .
After a whirlwind online romance they decided to marry .
MOHAMMED WARDA ( translated ) : I applied for the Israelis five times to get the permit to go and to get married with her officially , on using the official ways .
They rejected all the times .
I suggested to her family to bring her through Jordan , Egypt and then through a tunnel and they accepted the idea .
ANNE BARKER : Even getting to the tunnel was a challenge for May Ahmed that involved visa problems in Jordan , a four - hour boat trip to Egypt , then nine hours by road to the Gaza border and entry to the tunnels .
( Sound of May Ahmed speaking )
" It was really horrible , " she says " because Mohammed told me the Israelis sometimes bomb the tunnels and also it was exhausting .
It 's difficult to get through the tunnel on your hands and knees . "
ANNE BARKER : What did you think about when you were crawling through the tunnel ?
( Sound of May Ahmed speaking )
" I was really scared , " she said , " not just because of the bombs but because there were a lot of men there and I was the only girl inside a tunnel with men I 'd never met .
ANNE BARKER : Finally after nearly an hour crawling through mud May Ahmed climbed out of the tunnel on the Gaza side into the arms of her fiance .
MOHAMMED AHMED ( translated ) : Her clothes were dirty .
I could n't really recognise her and I felt I wanted to cry when I saw her .
( Sound of music and clapping )
ANNE BARKER : But for all their marital bliss the Israeli blockade in Gaza means these newlyweds wo n't be going anywhere for a honeymoon .
This is Anne Barker in Gaza for AM .
( Adds North Korea comments in paragraph 5 - 6 )
SEOUL , June 6 ( Reuters ) - South Korea will not back down to communist North Korea after it raised global concerns last week with a defiant nuclear test and threats to attack its capitalist neighbour , the South 's president said on Saturday .
The U.N. Security Council is looking to punish the reclusive North for its nuclear test which drew international condemnation , while a South Korean daily said U.S. officials are moving to clamp down on the impoverished state 's meagre international finances .
[ ID : nSEO370261 ]
" There is no reason to fear as we have a strong defence ...
There should be no doubt that there will be no compromise against things that threaten our people and security , " President Lee Myung - bak said in address to mark the South 's Memorial Day .
North Korea , which launched a barrage off short - range missiles last week , appears to be readying to test a long - range rocket that could hit U.S. territory .
Pyongyang 's official media KCNA reiterated a warning of " strong action " on Saturday , blaming the South for increasing military tension .
It said South Korea " should not make any reckless move " as " anyone making provocation will be met with strong action and unimaginable punishment " .
On Thursday in a step that could add to tensions with Washington , North Korea had put two U.S. journalists on trial for illegally entering the state .
Analysts say the two , Euna Lee and Laura Ling , who were working for the Current TV network co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore , have become bargaining chips in negotiations with the United States , which has long sought to end the North 's nuclear ambitions .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Friday she hoped the trial would result in their speedy release and confirmed the United States had explored sending a special representative to Pyongyang to negotiate for the journalist 's freedom .
" The trial which is going on right now we consider to be a step toward the release and the return home of these two young women , " she told reporters in Washington .
[ ID : nWBT011329 ]
Clinton did not discuss any bilateral sanctions the United States was considering but made clear Washington wanted the " strongest possible " resolution to emerge from negotiations at the United Nations to punish the North for its recent actions .
The two Koreas will hold rare talks next week over a joint industrial park that was once a symbol of reconciliation but has become a flash point for tension between the two states , which have yet to reach a peace treaty to end their 1950 - 53 war .
North Korea in May declared all contracts in the park invalid in what analysts said was a ploy to squeeze more money from the South .
It has also been holding a South Korean worker there for about three months on suspicion of insulting its leaders .
" The North must return our detained employee without condition and guarantee free corporate activities as promised , " President Lee said .
About 100 South Korean small and medium sized companies use cheap North Korean labour and land to make goods at the Kaesong industrial enclave located just inside the communist state .

I love the concept of 3D printing .
Of course , I also really enjoy teaching Calc II when we talk about slicing and shell formulas and volumes of revolution , because I remember the AHA !
moment when I suddenly put together what the formulas were all describing and it all made perfect sense .
( Sadly , this moment came when I was a senior studying for comps , several years after actually taking the class , but still , AHA ! moments are glorious . )
In 3D printing , objects are built from the bottom up , cross section by cross section , the same way you ’re supposed to envision the pieces when you calculate volumes by slicing .
This article in the Christian Science Monitor last week likens it to building with legos , although my experience with legos is that separate sections are constructed and then put together ( you build the walls , then add the furniture , then the roof ) ; that concept might work with printing too , where you print separate components and then put them together .
And what ’s amazing is that you can print some pretty complicated things with moving parts .
So what is used for the printing ?
The article above describes a layer of powder being put down and the printing is actually done by spraying glue instead of ink .
Wikipedia also describes printers that build with a liquid gel .
But my favorite is printing done with candy .
That ’s right : candy .
Not surprisingly , the CandyFab 6000 and it ’s earlier prototypes are made by the folk at Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories .
Here ’s an example of 3D printing :
Is n’t that amazing ?
Here ’s the machine it was done on :
You can see it making some 3D Candy above .
They keep making improvements , as you can see in the two dodecahedrons below ( printed at different times ) :
Here ’s another fancy piece o’ printing :
And finally , here ’s a Möbius Strip .
I thought it was a cake at first but no , it ’s eight pounds of sugar .
Now that ’s some pretty neat printing .
You can even see the “ slices ” on the surface .

READ BY JOHN FOWORA
I \'m sitting in front of the courthouse waiting for John Doe # 6 .
I picked him at random .
I number them according to my quota .
He went into the courthouse about five hours ago .
When he walks back out , I get out of my car and follow him .
I stand behind him .
See my heart flutter , pitter , and patter .
See the sweat on my brow accumulate and wait .
Wait .
Here I go .
I pistol - whip him and drag him back to my car , just a short distance away .
I put him in the passenger side seat and put on his seatbelt .
We\ 're going home .
When John Doe # 6 wakes up he is visibly disoriented .
I sit on a stool in the stark light of my basement and I watch him until he stands up .
" This is n\'t personal .
It \'s more of a statement , " I say .
" What are you talking about ?
Where am I ? " he says .
" Someday , they \'ll read about you .
" He looks like he\ 's going to make a run for it , so I run toward him , out of the light .
Then I swing .
Anytime you decide to swing , swing for the fences .
That \'s what my mother always told me .
The first time you see brains splattered on a wall like a Pollock , your initial reaction is shock .
This is natural .
What follows is the rush , a Bluetooth connection with the person you just introduced to mortality .
John Doe # 6 slumps backward to the ground .
His head lands with a thud and more gray matter spills from his nappy head onto the slab concrete in my basement .
This is me with my jackhammer .
DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH .
I stop and adjust my safety goggles DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH .
It \'s eleven in the evening and I \'m hoping someone hears me , DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH .
After sixteen men and twenty - two women , coated in lye and wrapped in cellophane ( which by the way , does n\'t do anything for the smell ) , I have to bury them somewhere .
DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH DUHDUH .
What better place than home ?
When I \'m done , I go upstairs and turn on the television in my living room .
I turn on Black Entertainment Television .
It \'s me .
I\'m on the television , mirroring myself , and I can \'t help but stop and stare at those bitches dancing around me on the screen .
On the TV I \'m sliding a black American Express card through the ass crack of this , this BITCH .
I \'m hard just thinking about the fact that she let me do this to her .
I come on the television screen .
I have to go to work in three hours .
I learned serial killing online .
It was a correspondence course with an online university ( accredited . )
They offered TV / VCR repair , refrigerator repair , and a GED .
The very last line was for serial killing .
The course packet they sent in the mail consisted of this : I had six weeks to complete all of the sections , including the tests at the end of each section and a final exam once the Professor received the rest of the course material .
I finished all of it in three weeks .
My Professor thought I was brilliant .
He wanted to know specifically about my essay from the last section of coursework , " Serial Killing and Diversity .
" I wrote an essay about why I wanted to be a serial killer .
" I feel that there are n\'t enough black serial killers out there .
There is a definite void that has to be filled .
" He responded like this :
He said that it would be impossible for me to gain any satisfaction from my killings because I would never , ever get caught .
Black people are n\'t profiled as serial killers , and there is no affirmative action for being a murderous psychopath .
Apparently " Serial Killing and Diversity " is mere window dressing .
" Serial Killing and Diversity " only applies to the people you kill , not to the killer .
My mother always told me that I have to do things twice as good as white kids to get noticed .
So I \'ll kill them until they notice , however long that takes .
And I \'m going to find my Professor and kill him , too .
I \'m going to rip his ears off and stick my black cock in his ear so he \'ll fucking listen .
But first , more practice .
I kill more people .
A lot more .
Mounds of people .
It \'s sort of strange that no one suspects I \'m a serial killer .
It 's unsettling , even .
I mean -- they \'d rather think I was out to rob them .
They 'd rather think that I have nothing on my mind but the contents of their wallets .
They \'d rather offer me their Movado and Brietlings .
They \'d rather placate me , give me what they think I want .
Jane Doe # 9 is tied to a chair in the part of my basement that is n\'t torn up yet .
Her head is hanging backward and there 's a trail of drool from her chin to her shirt .
She offered me her ATM card and her American Express card when I grabbed her by the hair .
I felt like smacking her in the face for being so obvious .
So I did , and knocked her out with a punch to her temple .
So now she is sitting here in my basement , disoriented , with her head tied to the back of the chair and her mouth held open by hooks in her cheeks and jaw .
She wakes up .
She 's screaming , sort of .
So I give her something to scream about .
I ram a fistful of fiberglass insulation in her mouth until my knuckles are tickling her tonsils .
She has the look on her face that most of them have when they realize that they will die .
They lunge and they gasp at life because life put them here , with me .
The randomness of me finding you , of me doing this to you .
Right now she is n\'t thinking about her family , her husband , her son , or her daughter .
She\ 's thinking of herself , numero uno , which is how we all go out , I 've found .
When I pour bleach into her mouth , she no longer screams or coughs up yellow clumps of fiberglass onto herself and my basement floor .
When I pour the bleach in , she gives up .
She gives up like she never had a chance in life , like she did n\'t aim high enough .
Bleach mixed with bile .
This is how I clean my floor .
It is late in the evening again ; I \'m not sure what time .
I\ 'm watching MTV's .
This rapper has a solid gold toilet bowl .
I 'm tired , but I can't forget what he said about that toilet bowl .
Solid gold .
Now there is a commercial on with a hip - hop soundtrack .
It has nothing to do with black people .
Another commercial comes on with a loudmouthed , Afro-wearing , black doll that spews all sorts of cliched Negrocity .
Yo .
That 's when it hits me .
We\'ve been forsaken by the new media .
We are n\'t black .
We\ 're a reflection of reflections .
We were probably better off picking cotton and talking real low when the white folks came around .
( Sometimes we still do ; that \'s why I watch " The Cosby Show . " )
We do n\'t aim high because we do n\'t have anything to shoot for .
Hope was the new slavery .
Then it was crack .
Now it 's digital cable .
I have thirteen channels of hip - hop and black grooves .
We do n\'t aim high because we\ 're too busy watching the rims spin .
Where does MTV come from ?
Sumner Redstone is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer at Viacom and Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer at National Amusements , Inc.I \ 'm going on a road trip .
I\'m going to travel across the country and kill Sumner Redstone .
Along the way I \'m going to kill my online Professor .
I \'m going to kill a lot of people , actually .
The sign says : you are now leaving California .
I\ 'm driving a jet - black Cadillac Escalade on 24 - inch Dub rims with spinners .
I have always been ( and always will be ) a very good student .
In Nevada I kill John Doe # 30 and Jane Doe # 15 .
I leave them at the Bunny Ranch in Vegas .
Palm Pilots are stuffed into their necks where their heads should be .
In Utah I kill John Doe # 35 .
It \'s easier to kill men than it is to kill women because men always think it can \'t happen to them .
They \'re always wrong .
In Indiana I kill John Doe # 38 with a 4 - iron and the element of surprise .
First , I knock his left eye out of his head in the parking lot after a Pacers game .
And to think : he had home court advantage .
In West Virginia I kill a mountaineer .
In Pennsylvania I drive by my mother \'s house and I want to go in and say hello and give her a big hug , so she \'ll be proud of me .
She always said she was proud of me .
I never believed her .
I finally find my professor in New Jersey .
His home office is three miles away from Rutgers University .
He is sitting inside drinking a cup of whatever , typing away on a laptop .
He 's typing more irresponsible blather , I know it .
I stare at him from across the street .
Apparently he lives alone , and he never seems to have company .
I \ 've watched him do the same thing for about a week now .
This guy does n\'t get out much .
I sneak in through his back door and quietly make my way through his house until I \'m directly behind him .
And just when I \'m about to chop into his skull with an axe , he says something .
" Not yet .
" I \'m not sure if he\ 's talking to me .
" Before you swing , tell me , why are you here ?
Are you a student ? " I put the axe down -- for now .
" Yes , I was a student of yours , " I say .
" But you should n\'t be allowed to teach anyone anymore . " " You 've been killing ? " " Yes .
Quite a bit , actually .
Why ? "
" If I \'m such an ineffective teacher , why are you here right now ?
If I \'m so ineffective , how come you \'ve been killing -- and doing well at it , apparently ?
Tell me why you\ 're really here .
" I tell him about the emails from him about my final paper .
I tell him how I did n\'t appreciate being told I was n\'t good enough to be a serial killer for something as inconsequential as the color of my skin .
I tell him about my theories on the media and Sumner Redstone , about how he deserves to die and how maybe -- just maybe -- killing him might make it all better .
The professor listens to me .
Finally he says : " I want to go with you .
I want to see where this goes .
Plus , I have n\'t killed anyone in a while .
I \'m sorry I offended you .
I just did n\'t want to see a student of mine go through the same things that I went through .
"
Oh , yeah -- the Professor : he\ 's black too .
Apparently he was killing for a little bit in the seventies and the early eighties , but he stopped because he was n\'t getting any recognition .
He quit doing that and he decided to get an M.A. in English instead .
He\ 's been teaching ever since .
He doesn\'t pack anything when we leave , like he expects us not to get caught .
When we get to New York City , he asks me about my methods .
" Anything I can get my hands on , really , " I say .
" Mostly golf clubs and blunt objects .
But sometimes I get creative .
How about you ? "
" I just like to choke people , " he replies .
" I do n\'t know why .
I just like to . " " Oh .
" We park the Escalade a few blocks away from where we have to go : 1515 Broadway .
I 'm wearing a blue , orange , white , and green striped button - up shirt with an oversized New York Mets baseball cap .
I have on a pair of baggy , two - year - wash jeans and tan Timberland work boots .
I\'m dressed like your favorite rapper .
Here in New York , people are famous for being famous , and that means I 'm going to be famous for the wrong reasons .
My Professor is acting as my manager today .
We 're going on MTV's " Total Request Live . "
From there , we\ 're going upstairs .
We 're going to see my boy Sumner .

Technology on way to forecasting humanity 's needs , IU researcher reports in ' Science '
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 23 , 2009
BLOOMINGTON , Ind. --
Much as meteorologists predict the path and intensity of hurricanes , Indiana University 's Alessandro Vespignani believes we will one day predict with unprecedented foresight , specificity and scale such things as the economic and social effects of billions of new Internet users in China and India , or the exact location and number of airline flights to cancel around the world in order to halt the spread of a pandemic .
Alessandro Vespignani
In tomorrow 's ( July 24 ) " Perspectives " section of the journal Science , Vespignani writes that advances in complex networks theory and modeling , along with access to new data , will enable humans to achieve true predictive power in areas never before imagined .
This capability will be realized as the one wild card in the mix -- the social behavior of large aggregates of humans -- becomes more definable through progress in data gathering , new informatics tools and increases in computational power .
Vespignani is the James H. Rudy Professor of Informatics and adjunct professor of physics and statistics at IU , where he is also the director of the Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research ( CNetS ) at IU 's Pervasive Technology Institute and the IU Bloomington School of Informatics and Computing .
Researchers have already shown they can track the movement of as many as 100,000 people at a time over six months using mobile phone data , and use worldwide currency traffic as a proxy for human mobility .
There are sensors and tags generating data at micro , one - to - one interaction levels , much as Bluetooth , Global Positioning Systems and WiFi leave behind detailed traces of our lives .

Such are some of the new sources of basic information that researchers are using to gain knowledge about aggregated human behavior .
This new " reality mining " should in turn enhance the ability of researchers and scientists to accurately forecast the effects of phenomena like catastrophic events , mass population movements or invasions of new organisms into ecosystems , Vespignani said .
" It is analogous to what happened in physics when we saw the shift from the study of atomic and molecular physics to the study of the physics of matter , " he said .
" Here we see a movement from the study of a small number of elements , or small social groups , to the study of the behavior of large - scale social systems consisting of millions of people that can be characterized in space , both social and geographic , and in time . "
In his article " Predicting the Behavior of Techno - Social Systems , " Vespignani also recognizes challenges in creating a predictive system that includes social adaptation .
Large - scale data , for example , is still needed about how information spreads and society reacts in times of crisis , but he believes advancing communications databases may address that issue .
Quantifying effects of risk perception and awareness phenomena among individuals on the larger techno - social network 's structure and dynamics needs to be designed into formal models , he added , and a need remains for the deployment of monitoring infrastructures capable of supplying real time information to computational models .
" While the needed integrated approach is still in its infancy , using network theory , mathematical biology , statistics , computer science and nonequilibrium statistical physics will play a key role in the creation of computational forecasting infrastructures , " Vespignani said .
" And that should help us design better energy distribution systems , plan for traffic - free cities and manage the deployment of the world 's resources . "
Vespignani's work on complex systems appears again in the same " Perspectives " section of Science as he is listed as co-author with five others on lead author Frank Schweitzer 's " Economic Networks : The New Challenges . "
Schweitzer , of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich , led the research examining interdependencies of economic networks as complex systems .
The paper , among other things , notes a need for advancing research on the complexities of the international financial network that in turn could lead to revision and extension of established paradigms in economic theory .

It was sleek , fast , deadly .
Typical Coralate semi-atmospheric fighter , but still no match for Tessa ’s Seindrive 4 .
The underslung Agere PD cannon on the nose of her rig alone could turn the Cygnan into swiss cheese from 50 meters away with a good shot , and it was a peashooter compared to the other ordinance she was carrying .
They did n’t build strong ships on Cygnus , but they knew how to build an engine like nobody ’s business .
The skies over Tarsis 12 were a deep afternoon purple , visceral against the rich reds and pinks pooling up from the dark aquamarine line of the horizon , and the Cygnan was a hot spot of brilliant silver in the glowing crimson reticle of her heads - up - display .
762 meters and arcing to the left at 2837 km/h .
Hauling ass , but still running on conventional drive .
Too risky to run the sublight stuff this far into the atmosphere .
Lips tightened , a sharp smile spreading across her face .
Her fighter was cutting edge Terran technology , the best that the Commonwealth ’s Galactic Naval Division had at its disposal , and tuned as tight as monowire by the best techs back on theuntil it pushed the envelope right to the edge in every direction and then some .
The gravity couch was the only real custom piece– something to counteract the effect of the increased G’s the rig ’s hyper - tuned drive kicked off at full speed , but throw it into a dive with the engines on full burn in normal atmosphere , and even the gravity couch could n’t keep you conscious for long .
“ Just long enough , ” a tech had told her once , “ for you to black out the instant before you leave a smoking crater on a nice green patch of alien soil . ”
Hell of a way to go .
The Cygnan was looping and twisting near the horizon now , accelerating and decelerating in harsh bursts as he harassed the colonial gear blasting useless flak into the atmosphere from the ground .
Briefly , she considered sending a volley of her wing - mounted Finsternis - XI warheads screaming after him , but the countermeasures on Cygnan vessels were as legendary as the engines that gave them their speed , and it would be about as useful as throwing rocks at flies– the Cygnan pilot would either have to be blind or real unlucky to get clocked by something as clumsy as the Finsternis - XIs .
Better to save those for bigger , slower game .
“ Screw it , ” She cursed under her breath , gloved fingers tightening eagerly over the dual wing of the throttle control .
Close - in fighting was better anyway ; you got to watch the way the Cygnan ’s rigs burnt as they fell , trailing hot rainbows of flame out of every hole in the hull until they nosed into the ground and imploded , caught in the short - range blast their destabilizing Singularity drives produced as they popped back into n-space along with whatever was left of the pilot , the airframe , and anything else that happened to be within five meters .
There was a flash of light from the ground– probably a hydrogen tank going up .
No point in waiting around , letting the Coralate rip up the colony unchecked .
She bit the inside of her lip and jammed the throttle forward .
Twin Icarus I610 F conventional Deca - bypass quantum hotcoil pods , each originally rated in excess of 348 kilonewtons of thrust at their highest settings , answered immediately , Schrödinger vectoring panels dilating into nth dimensional space as the Seindrive hurtled forward and closed the distance between her and the Cygnan in a matter of seconds .
But the Coralate pilot saw her coming– in the next instant , he was looping up and out of range of the majority of her hardpoints , the Seindrive ’s AI tracking him and blaring as the g- forces of sudden deceleration rolled off the rig like waves of turbulent water .
Tessa bit her lip harder , eyes flicking , flying across the HUD .
He was cutting in close , nosing over from a climb , forty - one meters off her seven , his plas - flechette railcannons heating up .
Reflexively , she flung the Seindrive over onto its side and pumped the throttle , just hard enough to put her ahead of the screaming cloud of blinding , superheated particles that scorched the air in her wake .
196 meters ahead of him now , the Cygnan diving square off her six .
Pretty typical Coralate move ; the little blue bastard was probably cussing in that weird click language of theirs .
Working quickly , Tessa swung the nose of her rig up and over , pumping the throttle lightly and putting the Cygnan roaring past her at ten o’clock .
Two seconds to prime the argon - ion L - web emitters and jam the caps off a line of Rapier A5 rockets , half a second to nudge the rig sixty degrees to the left ... She mashed the thumb trigger , and the Coralate fighter dove .
Reflexively , she yanked the Seindrive to the right , swearing , peeling away from her payload of explosives and hot blue light in a sharp turn as they passed harmlessly over the diving Cygnan .
Rising , the rockets tried to reorient themselves to follow the Coralate fighter , but the rig ’s countermeasures kicked in at the top of their climb and scrambled their sensitive tracking systems , sending the warheads twisting aimlessly off into the heavens .
She swore again , fingers working the two halves of the throttle control wing as she jerked the rig around and dove after the Cygnan , the colony a sprawling mass of blue - green and pavecrete grey smeared across the ground beneath them .
This guy was a hotshot , no question about it , but it was n’t like she had n’t dealt with Coralate aces before ; during a four - week campaign in the skies of a modest green gas giant called Erinye , she ’d lost both wingmen to the indirect fire of a Cygnan warship and had been limping back to thein her old Seindrive 2 when she ’d run across a squadron of four wicked little Coralate fighters out for Terran blood .
They ’d already taken down eleven other Terran rigs using hit and run tactics and a few flashy dive - and - roll maneuvers that were n’t covered in the holobooks , and seeing Tessa ’s beat uppowering hard for home , they made the mistake of taking her for an easy mark .
By the time she ’d finished with them , leaving two spinning listlessly toward the planet ’s core , one taken down by a lucky shot to his drive and the last desperately trying to escape on one engine , they ’d shot her rig all full of holes .
She had n’t made it out of that fight much better off than they had– her ordinance racks were empty , the old model L - web emitters had overheated and turned themselves to slag , and three of the four barrels in the little auto - fire rail - lance that had been replaced by the Agere PD cannon in later Seindrive rigs were jammed and totally nonfunctional .
Add to that the fact that only half of the S - vectoring panels were still live and capable of dilation , the reactor was leaking dangerous amounts of radiation , and both overworked 02 recyclers sounded like antique washing machines , clanking with the effort of replenishing oxygen that was draining out of a dozen tiny pinholes and fractures at an alarming rate– Tessa had to admit that she ’d been lucky to make it back to thealive .
Quick corrections by the Cygnan she was after brought her mind back to the chase ; spinning and darting , he yanked himself out of the dive and leveled out , Tessa coming up hot behind him .
Her finger tightened across the trigger for the Agere reflexively , but before she could squeeze off a line of fire , he threw his fighter into another spin and went hurtling off to the right .
1742 km/h and rising .
The plasmatic tracers carved an arc of hot lines through the sky in his wake .
This time it was reflexive– Tessa ’s fingers went tight around the throttle control as she rolled the Seindrive over and went after the Cygnan again .
He was darting left and right like crazy , trying to shake her off his tail and get her in his sights again , but she kept up with him , matching his every move , ready to send another line of tracers his way the instant she had a good shot .
The Coralate fighter spun suddenly left , then jammed the retros and went spinning back right for a half second before the pilot cut the thrusters and dropped the thing a hundred meters instantly .
Keeping his rig straight and level until she was practically right on top of him , he flipped the fighter over its blunt , silvery nose and hit full acceleration , jamming out of there inverted , another line of Agere tracers scorching the air behind him .
Tessa ’s fingers tightened across the throttle ; the Agere was n’t going to be enough .
She primed the L - web emitters again and pumped the throttle .
“ Yeeeeeeeeeeee haaaaaaaw ! ” Static lanced through the radio .
Something shot overhead with a buffeting shockwave and went blazing after the Coralate fighter , something covered in peeling red paint , plates of shiny new aluminum , and wide swathes of oily rust .
“ Move over sweetheart , this Ciggy ’s all mine !
Hah - HA ! ”
Blizzard on StarCraft 2 Expansions : ' We 're Not Going to Gouge People '
Producer Chris Sigaty responded to those concerns during a recent interview with Shacknews , telling us that the team is viewing the games as traditional Blizzard expansions , and not full sequels .
" We effectively look at it internally as expansions , " said Sigaty .
" So we 'll see what that means for the price -- we 're not just going to raise it and call it that for the purposes of that .
We would need to offer the same content . "
Sigaty 's guess is that the two expansions -- the Zerg- centric Heart of the Swarm and the Protoss chapter Legacy of the Void - - will not offer the same content as the original , and thus should be priced accordingly .
" I think internally , we want to do it a little bit fast , get a full campaign out there with enhancements to the multiplayer game , " he said .
" And in doing so , it would likely be an expansion - level product , and a Blizzard expansion - level product , but still something that does n't quite have the same content as the original . "
Of course , as the recent delay proved , nothing is set in stone at this point .
" We 're going to value it at what it 's worth , " he added .
" And honestly , internally , how we look at it , we look at it like it's the Frozen Throne and the Frozen Throne 2 , or Brood War and Brood War 2 .
We think we 're adding at least that amount of content , but we 're not going to gouge people .
We 're going to charge them what 's fair . "
" This is Zummo's Café — Pennsylvania's , and perhaps America's , best coffee shop . "
If you 're the sort of person that does n’t know why they should visit Scranton , Pennsylvania — except to see if the Dunder Mifflin office really exists — I 'm here to help .
Imagine you 're lost in a sort of run down neighborhood .
You spot a café , and pull over .
It ’s across the street from a church , down the street from a storefront courtroom , Catholic school , and rectory and in an old wood - frame house .
A police car is parked outside and construction workers are having a smoke out front .
What do you expect ?
Plastic - wrapped danishes ?
Week - old doughnuts ?
At least you 'll get directions .
When you walk in though , you notice the Clover machine .
Yeah , they make coffee here that way .
And the menu choices are n't for frozen , reheated sandwiches , they ’re for micro-roasted coffees prepared in the Clover ( there ’s espresso for dilettantes too ) , real sandwiches on good bread , and a row of candies .
Only in Scranton can you get a cup of micro-roasted , Clover - brewed coffee , and a pack of Skittles at the same shop .
For coffee fans , this place is so thrilling that you ’ll get all worked up before you even take a sip of caffeine .
This is Zummo's Café — Pennsylvania's , and perhaps America's , best coffee shop .
Grab your coffee ( I chose a “ Brazil - Fazenda Cachoeira Natural Yellow Burbon ” ) check out the local historical photos ( No ! the woman weight lifter with the big Seventies hair is n't the owner ) , study the map of Italy ( always appropriate in this corner of the world ) , and relax , work and pretend that every neighborhood café roasts its own single - origin beans , owns a Clover machine , and makes its own mozzarella .
Zummo's is the most public manifestation of Mary Tellie , a coffee fanatic and certified Q Grader who began by roasting beans with a heat gun in her basement .
Somehow , this begat the Electric City Roasting Company , a highly regarded micro-roaster , and then Zummo's Café .
Indeed , this is what Mary wanted in the first place : a local café serving world class product .
She frequently travels to the coffee farms she buys from , offers public cupping events — call ahead for this , they ’re not as frequent as you might wish — and employs two CIA grads to supervise the kitchen .
Most people who are serious about coffee know somebody who 's spent some time in their basement with a heat gun and find it hard to imagine that you could go from this level of extreme fanaticism to business ownership and somehow Mary Tellie managed .
She 's a former banker , hence the business skills , and a former New Jersey resident , hence the desire to create a comfortable space someplace else .
Mary and I sat down for a chat .
It did n't last long — not the chat , but the sitting .
She was everywhere !
There were several moments when I had to actually run after her so she could show me things or introduce me to staff members .
One minute , she ’d be pointing at that map of Italy so I could see where her ancestors came from , and then , suddenly , I ’d be watching one of the chefs pull mozzarella curd and trying to catch my breath .
Mary 's mantra is “ everything ’s fresh , when it ’s sold out , it 's gone . ”
This is n't surprising , she had another mantra though that was more to the point : “ roast to the equipment . ”
In other words , make sure the coffee beans , methods , and equipment suit each other .
Therefore , there are beans for espresso , that Clover , and even regular brewing .
Looking around , I was in a place I 'd always dreamed of ( indeed , my wife and I dreamed of opening just such a shop in nearby Jim Thorpe some years ago ) .
A local shop devoted to excellence in coffee , excellence in food , and with a box of Skittles on the counter .
A coffee lovers paradise .
And the name ?
Zummo's was the name of the business , a shoe repair shop , that occupied the space before them .
Why change ?
Zummo's Café
918 Marion Street , Scranton PA 18509 ( map ) 570-344-2715
Note :
For more information on Clover coffee machines go here and watch this video .
Since Starbucks bought the Clover company and stopped selling the machines to other shops , there 's been a huge amount of discussion .
I doubt this will stop master roasters like Mary though .
I suspect they can make a great cup of coffee with whatever is at hand , as long as they can , as they say , “ roast for the equipment . "

Like most web frameworks , Django provides a convenient mechanism for storing data across requests in a persistent " session " object .
Like most web frameworks , Django implements sessions using a simple mapping from a " session key " to a session object stored on the server .
And like most web frameworks , Django 's default session implementation is trivially vulnerable to session hijacking attacks .
Django 's session implementation is quite similar to that provided by PHP ; for all the gory details here is an excellent article on The Truth about Sessions , but the simplified version is as follows .
When you first visit a Django - powered site , the server generates a random " session key " and returns it to your browser in a cookie .
Any data that the server wants to remember about you ( say , whether you have logged in and under what username ) is stored in a giant dictionary indexed by the session key .
On each subsequent visit you browser sends the key back to the server , which looks up your data in this dictionary and proceeds merrily on its way .
The interaction looks something like the following :
You login at the ( hypothetical ) Django - powered website http://www.my-todo-list.com/.
The server stores your login details in its session database , and sends back a session key of " 123456 " .
You send a request to update your todo list , presenting a session key of " 123456 " .
The server looks up " 123456 " in its session database , checks that the session is correctly logged in as you , and proceeds with the requested update .
It 's a simple and convenient mechanism , but it has an important security issue : anyone who knows your session key can impersonate you to the server !
Consider what happens next :
Using my l33t hacking skillz , I manage to discover your session key .
I send a request to delete your todo list , presenting a session key of " 123456 " .
The server looks up " 123456 " in its session database , checks that the session is correctly logged in as you , and proceeds to delete all your data .
So the security of this session mechanism depends crucially on the secrecy of the session key .
Unfortunately , finding someone 's session key is far from complicated – it's frequently sent back - and - forth between your browser and the server in plain text , meaning anyone on your network can sniff it with ease .
Cookies can also be stolen using a cross - site scripting vulnerability or by exploiting browser bugs .
If the session key is embedded in the URL ( as PHP sometimes does ) then it can easily show up in referrer logs , bookmarks or emails .
Unlike certain other frameworks , Django does take some simple steps to avoid session - stealing attacks .
If you can suffer the increased server load , Django also allows you to restrict the session key to secure connections so that it cannot be sniffed in transit .
But there are a range of additional security measures that are n't currently available .
Inspired by this ancient ticket about session security , I 've developed a new app called django - paranoid - sessions .
It provides a middleware class to make Django work a lot harder at session security , through a ( configurable ) combination of :
periodic cycling of session keys .
HTTP header fingerprinting .
per -request nonces .
As usual there 's a tradeoff here , providing additional security at the cost of doing more work per request .
You also run the risk of rejecting legitimate user requests that happen to look suspicious .
For this reason django - paranoid - sessions is highly configurable , letting you find the right balance for your project .
The README has all the details , but I 'll provide a brief overview of each feature below .
First , a disclaimer : I 'm not a security expert and I 'm certainly not a cryptographer .
I 'm just interested in these issues and have read a lot about them .
I will not be held responsible if this app randomly boots users out of your site , slows your server to a crawl , or emails all your login details to North Korea .
Having said that , I 've been using it on my own projects and I 'm pretty confident it 's doing what it 's supposed to do – so on with the show :
Session Key Cycling
This is just what it sounds like – forcing the server to generate a fresh session key after a certain time has elapsed .
This means an attacker only has a certain amount of time to discover and exploit your session key before it is discarded by the server .
As an added bonus , it also makes brute - force attempts to guess a session key much more difficult .
HTTP Header Fingerprinting
This technique records certain characteristics of your browser in the session data ; commonly this will include your IP address and User - Agent string .
If a later request against your session does not match the recorded browser " fingerprint " , it is assumed to be a session - stealing attack and is rejected .
Such fingerprinting can help prevent casual or accidental session - stealing , but will not stop a determined attacker – all information that the browser provides to the server can potentially be spoofed .
It also runs the risk of terminating legitimate user sessions , for example if your ISP has a habit of changing your IP address mid-session .
Nevertheless , many sites find this to be an acceptable compromise between security and user convenience .
Per-request Nonces
Using this technique , the server sends another piece of information in addition to the session key : a cryptographic " nonce " that changes with every request .
Like the session key , your browser must present the server with a valid nonce in order to be permitted access to the session .
Unlike the session key , each nonce can only be used for a single request .
To see how this works , consider again my attempt to hack your todo list :
You login at the ( hypothetical ) Django - powered website http://www.my-todo-list.com/.
The server stores your login details in its session database , sending back a session key of " 123456 " and a nonce of " ABCDE " .
Using my l33t hacking skillz , I manage to sniff your session key and nonce .
You send a request to update your todo list , presenting a session key of " 123456 " and a nonce of " ABCDE " .
The server looks up " 123456 " in its session database and checks that the session is correctly logged in as you .
The server checks that " ABCDE " is a valid nonce , records that this nonce has been used , and proceeds with the requested update .
I send a request to delete your todo list , presenting a session key of " 123456 " and a nonce of " ABCDE " .
The server looks up " 123456 " in its session database and checks that the session is correctly logged in as you .
The server discovers that the nonce " ABCDE " has already been used , and rejects my request .
Much better !
The use of nonces dramatically narrows the window in which session - stealing attacks can be performed – not only do I have to steal your session key and nonce , but I have to use the nonce before you do .
Even then , your next attempt to use the nonce will invalidate the stolen session and hence limit the damage I can do .
Unfortunately things are not quite as simple as this example .
To allow a user to execute multiple overlapping requests , there must be a brief window during which duplicate nonces are accepted by the server .
django - paranoid - sessions lets you narrow or widen this window as you please , to find the appropriate compromise between security and user convenience for your application .
More ?
That 's about the limit of what I know when it comes to securing sessions , but I 'm keen to pack as much goodness into this app as possible .
If you 've got a favourite technique for squeezing a little more security out of your web apps , I 'd love to hear about it .

Brazilian facing two months out with knee problem
Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez has dismissed fears that Fabio Aurelio could be out of action for six months through injury .
Reports suggested Aurelio could miss the rest of 2009 after picking up a knee injury during a freak accident playing football with his kids in his native Brazil .
Benitez has confirmed Aurelio has undergone surgery on the knee injury , but insists the full - back will only be on the sidelines for up to two months .
" He was injured playing with his son and really disappointed because he was enjoying the summer , " Benitez said .
" He had the operation - he has had a problem with his cartilage - so he will be one month , maximum two months , not six months like I see in the press . "

Dog Days of Science By Alison Davis
In 1996 , Gordon Lark said good - bye to a beloved friend .
His dog Georgie died of an autoimmune disorder that had turned the animal ’s body against itself .
Lark knew he would dearly miss his pet , but what he did n’t know was that Georgie ’s passing would spawn a unique partnership between dogs and people : one that may one day find a treatment for the disease that took her life .
Lark had acquired Georgie as a stray 10 years before .
Despite not knowing much about the dog , he quickly fell in love with her and with her breed , the Portuguese Water Dog .
For centuries , these sturdily built dogs were a favorite of coastal Portuguese fisherman .
Hard - working and obedient , they have boundless energy and exceptional swimming and diving skills .
Water dogs are also fiercely loyal , endearing them to many people today .
With Georgie gone , Lark yearned for another Water Dog .
He contacted Karen Miller , a Portuguese Water Dogs are skilled
working dogs and great pets breeder who at the time was living on a New York horse farm an hour north of Manhattan .
She had a cute puppy , Mopsa , in mind for Lark .
Miller did n’t ask for money in exchange for Mopsa .
But she did ask for something else : Miller told Lark that he could keep Mopsa on one condition : that he begin genetic research studies with Portuguese Water Dogs .
To Miller , studies of how heredity contributes to appearance , behavior , and overall health would provide useful knowledge for breeding healthy dogs .
And Lark , a biologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City , had the skills for the job .
But the proposal was n’t exactly what Lark was expecting .
His immediate plans were retirement , as his wife Cynthia , also a biologist , had done a few years before .
She died of Alzheimer ’s disease in 2006 .
Lark faced a new chapter in his life , and he was n’t convinced that research with dogs would be part of it .
What is the Georgie Project ?
Research collaboration between owners , breeders , and scientists
Named after Georgie , a Portuguese Water Dog who died of an autoimmune disease
Scientific goal :
To study the genetics of the Portuguese Water Dog
Rewards for owners :
Healthier dogs , more informed breeding Rewards for scientists :
New system to study genetics using well - cared - for animals
Advances for human disease research genetics
Plant Scientist Learns New Tricks Until Georgie died , Lark ’s scientific specialty was soybeans .
For many years , his genetic research had centered on looking for the inherited factors that affect soybean nutrient quality and growth characteristics .
But although he had never studied Water Dogs , it did n’t take long for Lark to become sold on the potential value of studying their genes .
He learned that all Portuguese Water Dogs alive today descended from relatively few original dogs , called founders .
This simplifies DNA studies because the gene “ pool ” within this breed is relatively small .
Tracing genes to traits is easier .
Within a couple of months after sending Mopsa to Lark , breeder Miller shipped 5,000 Portuguese Water Dog pedigrees .
Detailed records of health and breeding characteristics , pedigrees are a treasure trove for genetic researchers .
In addition to accurate breeding records , pedigrees are a rich source of information about physical characteristics like size , build , color , disease , and behavioral attributes .
Lark , Miller , and others soon launched the “ Georgie Project , ” to begin studying the genetics of Portuguese Water Dogs .
The research effort was privately funded for 5 years until the National Institute of General Medical Sciences , one of the National Institutes of Health , stepped in to help support the work ( the project is still partially privately funded ) .
In a decade ’s time , the endeavor has contributed valuable knowledge about the genetic basis of health and disease .
It has also introduced hundreds of pet owners to research that helps inform the health of all Portuguese Water Dogs and humans , too .
“ The Georgie Project has given me more pleasure than almost any other scientific project , ” Lark says .
“ Dog work is full of surprises and we find things I never would have suspected . ”
One of the greatest gains of the Georgie Project — and , in fact , an intended goal — was learning how scientists and the general public can work together toward the common good .
“ We teach each other , ” says Lark , adding that owners , breeders , and researchers each have something to offer intellectually .
Life After Death
The benefits of autopsy to medical research are enormous .
Modern medicine got its start , for the most part , from making connections between a patient ’s symptoms and diseased organs found after death .
Autopsy has several purposes and benefits .
Examining a body after death can confirm or disprove a clinical diagnosis .
For people , this is important when the cause of death was an inherited disease .
Other family members can learn about their own risk .
The Georgie Project has performed autopsies on 100 Water Dogs ,
and 150 owners have consented to the procedure when their pet dies ( akin to a living will ) .
Georgie Project chief scientist Gordon Lark says autopsies tell much more than just the cause of death .
Detailed information about all the dogs ’ organs and tissues , in addition to their DNA , provides a wealth of research data .
This can help researchers make links between genes and disease .
Georgie Project staff work with owners and veterinarians to obtain the body of a deceased pet .
Despite the emotional and logistical difficulty , owners have been ready to comply .
The Project pays for transport of the dog ’s body and , through arrangements with a pet cremation company , returns the pet ’s remains to its owner after the autopsy is complete .
“ They sent a beautiful box and note , and the whole thing was so respectful , ” says owner Melinda Harvey of Canton , Connecticut .
“ Their respect for me and my dog made me willing to do something that is inherently uncomfortable and difficult . ”
Lark knows nearly all the dogs that die and personally shares in an owner ’s sorrow .
Water Dog breeder Karen Miller , who works closely with the Georgie Project , says more than one owner has been touched by Lark ’s extraordinary devotion .
“ Gordon called and cried with me , ” one owner told Miller .

Research @ Home
To date , the Georgie Project has involved approximately 1,500 Water Dogs and their owners , and dozens of scientists .
Some , like Lark , are also owners .
Georgie Project dogs have been analyzed for many different things ranging from blood chemistry and DNA variation to behavior , body shape , and bone structure .
Since dogs and people live together , we have similar “ conditioning triggers . ”
We breathe the same air — and all its unseen pollutants — and bathe in the same water .
We walk and run barefoot through the same grass .
Water Dog owners ’ veterinarians take X rays of their dogs .
Georgie Project scientists record precise measurements of bone shape and size .
The round circle ( top , right ) is a quarter coin used to calibrate the image .
That ’s important because many diseases , including autoimmune disorders like that which claimed Georgie– are thought to have environmental influences .
Perhaps the most important result the Georgie Project has turned up is that purebred dogs can be studied easily at home .
The dogs do not even know they are part of a research study .
Portuguese Water Dog owners such as Jean Hassebroek of Sargents Bluff , Iowa , have found it relatively simple to get involved .
“ I just contacted them and they sent me a kit , ” she says .
Georgie Project staff provide instructions for the owners ’ veterinarians to take X rays that cover the entire body of the dog , she explains .
The vets are also asked to collect blood and hair samples for DNA testing .
Hassebroek has enrolled half a dozen Water Dogs in the project in past years .
One of the best things about it , she says , is that her dogs are at home with her , not in a lab somewhere .
Veterinarians are reimbursed costs for all of this , and owners pay little to nothing out of pocket .
If an owner agrees to
an autopsy when their pet dies , the project mails the ashes back with a note commemorating the dog ’s service to science ( see “ Life After Death ” ) .
Why Dogs ?
People have had dogs as pets for just a fraction of the time that humans have lived on this earth .
Yet the variety among dogs is astounding : Compare a Chihuahua to a Great Dane , or a Labrador Retriever to a Poodle .
Through selective breeding , there are more than 400 very different types of dogs throughout the world today .
Dogs suffer from more than 350 inherited diseases , and up to 300 of these are similar to conditions in people .
Some of the most common are cancer , epilepsy , heart disease , allergies , retinal disease , and cataracts .
Geneticist Elaine Ostrander of NIH ’s National Human Genome Research Institute is an expert on dog genetics .
She also works with Lark on the Georgie Project .
Portuguese Water Dog breeder Karen Miller works with the Georgie Project .
Ostrander ’s research has found substantial overlap between diseases that strike dogs and people .
“ The genetics of bladder cancer is difficult to study in humans , ” Ostrander says , noting that this cancer is quite common in Scottish Terriers and West Highland White Terriers .
Lessons from Georgie
One of the things the Georgie Project has taught researchers is that some cases of Addison ’s disease , a condition relatively common among Portuguese Water Dogs , may appear along with a complex syndrome involving several organs in which the immune system rejects its own components as foreign and launches an attack on the body .
Two types of alternate DNA spellings , called genetic variants , have been identified in the DNA of Water Dogs with Addison’s .
One of them is the same as in the DNA of people with this disease .
Assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy had Addison’s , as did English novelist Jane Austen and comet - discoverer Eugene Shoemaker .
Research is ongoing to unravel Addison ’s and potentially related autoimmune conditions that appear to be much more complicated than once believed .
The Georgie Project continues to provide clues .
The Georgie Project also unearthed the surprise finding that a single spot of DNA — that controls the activity of a growth gene — accounts for whether a given breed will be large or small .
By studying hundreds of Water Dog DNA samples , Georgie Project researchers learned that this genetic variation explains why Pekingese are tiny and Irish Wolfhounds are huge .
The research has also shown that variation in shape — the difference between long , lean Greyhounds and short , stocky American Pit Bull Terriers , for instance — is a genetic “ trade - off . ”
Water Dogs are somewhere in between : faster but less forceful than American Pit Bull Terriers , but slower and more forceful than Greyhounds .
“ It ’s just like what I learned years ago with soybeans , ” Lark explains .
“ You simply ca n’t breed a soybean that has very high amounts of both protein and oil .
When you increase one , you decrease the other , and this kind of trade - off is very common in nature . ”
In a broader sense , The Georgie Project has brought together a vibrant community of animals and people teaming for better health .
" It floats like a breath , " said the tall and elegant woman with the beautifully bred terrier , spring - loaded and taut on a lead .
But , then , after 18 years as director of London 's Serpentine Gallery , Julia Peyton - Jones is genetically predisposed to the gracious dispensation of almost irresistible one - liners .
The " breath " she refers to is the new Serpentine Pavilion , designed by the Japanese architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa , which opens to the public on Sunday .
But it is n't a breath .
Nor is it smoke , or a reflective cloud , or a floating pool of water , or anything else that the Serpentine 's wordsmiths have come up with .
The architectural quest for metaphors is always problematic , and very often leads to hyperbole .
Which would be a pity in the case of Sejima and Nishizawa 's pavilion because , in essence , it is simply a very thin , shy , rather beautifully made aluminium wafer wavering three or four metres above the greensward in Hyde Park on gleaming , stick - thin legs .
Were it not quite so exquisitely elegant , the pavilion might be something encountered in an historic sci- fi props museum in Hollywood , labelled : " Zargon time machine from scene 12 , They Came From Tectonica , 1954 , director : Milton Shubasky Jr. "

There is so little of the pavilion that it barely exists .
It conveys no sense of mass , weight , enclosure , or dimension .
Even the lines of its form are tenuous .
The only things that register distinctly are the almost impossibly thin edges of the roof , the sheeny surfaces , and those shimmering , stork - leg posts that hold it up .
It is as if an amoeba - shaped sliver of aluminium had risen delicately in the mind of a graphic designer dreaming of a world - beating organic brandmark for the 2028 Olympic Games ; risen , and then began to settle again in a breeze wafting up Exhibition Road before being freeze - framed into something either rising or falling – does n't matter which – with some of its gloopy edges tipped up , and others caught and held in mid-loll .
The pavilion is an architecture which shies away from architectural reference .
Modernist ?
Not really , because there 's no vorsprung durch technik about it .
21st - century Arts and Crafts , perhaps ?
No , sorry , the ghost of William Morris is unlikely to materialise on Sunday .
Well , it must be a computer - generated whatsit , then , conceptually linked to a series of magic prime numbers – except that there 's no sense of geometrical obscurity about it .
Nor does the pavilion express the kind of left - field geometry that spools out of the architectural imaginations of designers such as Ben van Berkel and Cecil Balmond .
So , how do the architects – aka SANAA – explain their building ?
The reflective canopy undulates across the site , they say , expanding the park and sky .
Its appearance changes according to the weather , allowing it to " melt into the surroundings " .
" At first , " says Nishizawa , " we had no architectural idea .
Just water , rainbows , leaves or something .
Finally , we reached the organic shape for the roof , to create a relationship with the trees . "
And that 's the point .
The pavilion does not melt into the surroundings .
Nor does it , as they also suggest , sit " seamlessly within the natural environment " .
If it did , it would n't be engaging in a meaningful way .
Why must architects insist on imagining that buildings fit seamlessly into their surroundings when they themselves , along with the rest of humanity , inert gases , languages , ideas , X - boxes , and loaves and fishes – patently do not ?
If the pavilion is architecture – which I think it is – it can only be so if it reacts to its surroundings in something more than a passive , do n't - mind - me manner .
The pavilion may barely exist , physically , but it has a presence – and that presence is created by the tensions of its form , structure and abstraction .
The tension of its structure , for example .
One expects it to tremble in a gust of wind , and would be very disappointed if it did not .
And those sharp , silvery roof edges , like etched lines against the surrounding trees , sometimes distinct , sometimes not ; the reflections of clouds and sky , the felty greens of the horse chestnut and catalpa trees , smeared and acid-trippy on the pavilion 's highly polished aluminium skin .
This is Aphex Twin architecture : not quite ephemeral , subtle in its sensual harmonics , but seamed with unexpected visual and formal riffs .
It 's going to be popular with the bong brigade at sunset – " How did the sky get so totally in here , man ? " – and to those of filmic persuasion .
There is something uncanny about the pavilion , something that triggers the unearthly atmosphere of the park scenes in Antonioni's Blow - Up .
SANAA 's offering is the ninth pavilion in the Serpentine 's annual series , and it's the practice 's first completed project in Britain .
Ms Peyton - Jones , and her advisers , have conspired to create these Hyde Park surprise packages in an even - handed way .
The architects selected have either been the senior magi of the profession , such as Oscar Niemeyer and Alvaro Siza ; intellectuals including Rem Koolhaas and Daniel Libeskind ; fashionable A - listers like Zaha Hadid , Frank Gehry and Olafur Eliasson ; and coolly acronymic new - wavers such as SANAA and MVRDV .
And how does SANAA 's architecture stack up against the pavilions that preceded it ?
Well , it does n't have the lusciously overstated grace of Niemeyer 's , even if it does recall the Brazilian 's 1943 dance hall canopy at Pampulha ; it does n't present such an obviously brilliant essay in geometry as the Ito - Balmond pavilion ; it is not as brusquely strange as the pavilions by Siza or Gehry ; and it is not a literally inflated idea , like Koolhaas's .
SANAA 's design is about something else : edges that shy away from defining volumes of space , and surfaces that are equally vague about what is up and what is down , in or out .
Not that this is anything new to Sejima and Nishizawa 's architecture .
Their New York Museum of Contemporary
Art resembles a skewed stack of giant ice cubes , not quite solid , not quite porous ; and the Kumanokodo Nakahechi Museum in Japan repeats the effect , but in a modernist pavilion whose precision is worthy of Mies van der Rohe or Philip Johnson .
SANAA 's position in the 21st - century pantheon of rising stars is therefore already assured , and by the time their new Louvre museum at Lens , France , is completed in 2012 , they will be members of architecture 's established inner-circle .
One worries about Charlie , though , Ms Peyton - Jones ' admirable terrier .
What if she has a serious go at one of those skinny aluminium pillars , just to remind us that architecture that pretends to melt into its surroundings needs a damned good savaging ?

Modernist marvels :
Four more SANAA success stories
Zollverein School , Essen , Germany
This is a chunk of Japanese urban modernist architecture transplanted into a German setting .
The asymmetry of the windows , set into otherwise unremarkable facades , give thebuilding a sense of abstraction and tough playfulness .
Glass Pavilion , Toledo Museum of Art
The pavilion ’s interiors are SANAA ’s graceful homage to Mies van der Rohe ’s Barcelona Pavilion .
But the curved glass and warped reflections begin to hint at what they designed at both the Serpentine , and the forthcoming Louvre annexe at Lens , France .
Dior , Tokyo
SANAA have joined the premier division of architects who have designed buildings for famous fashion houses .
The materials and detailing are ultra-rich in every sense , but not as brilliant as in Herzog and de Meuron ’s Louis Vuitton building in the same city .
New Museum of Contemporary Art , New York
The architects have , in effect , joggled a pile of giant aluminium boxes to reduce the perceived mass of the museum .
But the textured aluminium surface is the real key , because , in a gritty part of the city , it creates the coolest of auras .
An openly gay Miami news anchor has officially been fired from his job , just one week after the guy filed a sexual discrimination complaint against his bosses -- and the anchor claims the timing is no coincidence .
The man in the center of the controversy is Charles Perez -- who you may remember from " Inside Edition " or his nationally syndicated talk show , " The Charles Perez Show . "
The drama all began in June , when Perez was " demoted " from the local ABC nightly evening newscast to the weekend edition -- and Perez claims it was because the station felt he was " becoming too gay " for the public to handle .
Perez decided to file a complaint with the Miami - Dade County Equal Opportunity Board , in which he details a performance review , where one of his bosses warned him that he smiled on air too much and that he and his female co-anchor were " like girlfriends while on the set . "
Perez believes he was fired in retaliation for filing the complaint with the EOB .
The station claims Perez 's recent " actions " left them " no real choice " but to fire him , according to The Miami Herald .
Here 's the catch -- the boss who demoted him is himself gay and issued a statement saying , " As a gay man myself , I can safely say the station does not discriminate against gay people . "
The station also denies the allegation .
But Perez is n't buying it , and tells TMZ he plans on filing a " 7 or 8 figure lawsuit " against both the station and it's parent company , the Washington Post .
But there 's more -- Perez believes this whole thing started because of a very private email that was hacked out of his computer by an ex-boyfriend and sent to his colleagues at his news station back in March .
Its called Rachel , Sony Erricson ’s first Android based phone which is scheduled to hit the market sometime this year .
The phone has 3.5 ” to 4.1 ” pressure sensitive ( might be multi touch ) screen ( rumored ) , a whopping 8 megapixel camera and to top that all it ’s based on Qualcomm Snap Dragon QSD8250 platform , enabling processor speeds of up to 1 GHz and HSPA speeds up to 7.2 Mbit per second which will naturally boost 3D graphics .
It ’s also reported that it also has a 3.5 mm jack connector as well as a mini-USB connector at the top of the phone .
The phone will be part of Sony Ericsson ’s XPERIA series .

" The only thing that came in this monstrous package is a simple power cord that HP inexplicably shipped in a box sturdy enough to ship the entire Canadian army . "
Either you are making a joke by exaggerating that it could hold something that massive , or you are joking about how small Canada 's army is .
I 'm going to risk sounding stupid here , and assume you meant the second of those two .
So FYI : The Canadian army is actually one of the largest and most powerful in the world .
I do n't understand where this misconception comes from .
As a Canadian living in America , and knowing someone in the Canadian Navy , it is always strange to hear these sort of jokes .
They fall sort of flat if you know the truth .
It 's larger than America's .
They just do n't USE it .
I would n't want to screw with Canada .
Anyway , if you did n't know , now you do .
NOW YOU KNOW .
If you did know that and you were just using that as an exaggeration , I apologize for my lack of joke interpretation abilities .

What 's the best way to save the planet ?
Do n't have kids , say researchers from Oregon State University .
" Clearly , the potential savings from reduced reproduction are huge compared to the savings that can be achieved by changes in lifestyle , " the report states .
The OSU study calculated the relative carbon impact of children born in the United States and then compared it to the carbon impact of other activities they considered to be unfriendly to the planet .
A couple not having a child saves twenty times the amount of carbon compared to if that couple undertook a multitude of other carbon - saving activities , according to the researchers .
Ann McElhinney , a film producer who focuses on global warming hysteria , called the report absolutely ridiculous , " and said it fit perfectly with what she had borne witness to while traveling around the world and examining global attitudes towards climate change .
" This idea that having children is somehow damaging the environment is extraordinary .
The environmentalists do n't seem to think [ this ] about large populations of elephants , newts , or lemurs , " said McElhinney .
But Laurie Mazel , writer and editor of a forthcoming book A Pivotal Moment : Population Justice and the Environmental Challenge , said she agreed with the report 's basic premise .
" I think it 's certainly true that people who live in industrialized countries have high per capita carbon emissions ... and that we should factor that into our childbearing choices , " said Mazel .
" The average American produces 20 metric tons of carbon every year , and the average African produces 1 ton , " she said .
Mazel made it clear that she was not interested in advocating for women to reduce the number of children they had as the result of this report .
Advocating for population reduction is a " slippery slope , " " scary , " " not a productive conversation to have , " and " not what we need , " according to Mazel .
But she still thinks " we should all make decisions in our lives that impact the environment , like the size of our car , house , and the size of our family . "
The report focused on the choice to reproduce and the resulting child 's environmental impact during his lifetime , as well as the environmental impact of children he may produce himself .
The report weighted these future children by picking a percentage of responsibility the original human had for his later descendants , saying that parent is at fault for half of that child 's carbon output , and one - quarter of his grandchild 's output .
The report did not state why the original human being would not be responsible for 1/8 of their great - grandchild 's carbon output or 1/16 of their great - great - grandchild 's carbon output and so on .
" Obviously , the choice to reproduce contributes to future environmental impacts .
There are immediate effects caused by each offspring over his or her lifetime , but , should the offspring reproduce , additional impacts could potentially accrue over many future generations , " the researchers wrote .
Mazel also agreed with the report 's idea of carbon accumulation over generations .
" There is still a lot of play in the population projections — there could be between eight and 12 billion of us by mid-century .
That 's going to make a lot of difference for a lot of things .... environmentalists and a lot of others believe that we should aim for the lower end of that spectrum , " she said .
Alyssa Cordova , a lecture director at the Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute , said that the very idea that family preferences should be affected by concerns about global warming was ridiculous .
Cordova said that the study was based on liberals ' hatred of traditional family values and penchant for using climate change alarmism to attack those ideas .
" To conservatives , people are a blessing and a resource , but to liberals in the environmental movement they are nothing more than parasites on the Earth , " she said .
" To say that American women should be discouraged from having children because of a ' larger carbon footprint is absurd . "
McElhinney had similar sentiments .
" This is a massive flaw in the environmentalists ’ philosophy ; leaving humans out of the environmental equation .
And the idea that humans can be compared to animals is absolutely ridiculous , " she said .
" We can't be compared to animals , to that kind of bestiality . "

In the aftermath of World War II , Germany approved a series of rules and restrictions designed to give teeth to the slogan “ never again . ”
More than 60 years later , it remains illegal to wear the swastika or to give the stiff - armed Nazi salute .
Denying the Holocaust is punishable by a prison term .
Since 1945 , it has also been verboten to publish “ Mein Kampf , ” Adolf Hitler ’s notorious autobiographical manifesto .
These rules were put in place with the best of intentions ; after a war that killed tens of millions of civilians , including 6 million European Jews , it seemed a small price to pay to help ensure that Nazism did not reappear .
But a liberal democracy cannot tolerate such bans on free expression indefinitely .
Last week , Stephan Kramer , the secretary - general of Germany ’s Central Council of Jews , the country ’s leading Jewish organization , said his group now backs a proposal to publish a new edition of “ Mein Kampf , ” albeit with a scholarly introduction and notes that put it in context .
The book , which Hitler wrote while he was serving a four - year sentence in a Bavarian prison in 1924 , offers a chilling preview of his thoughts on racial purity and the Jews , as well as his belief that Germany needed to conquer new territory to fulfill its historic destiny .
After Hitler came to power in 1933 , millions of copies of “ Mein Kampf ” were sold ( bought in many cases by the state and given out to newlyweds and soldiers in the Third Reich , making Hitler a millionaire ) .
Kramer ’s decision is understandably controversial in a country where neo -Nazi groups have gained some ground in recent decades .
The southern German state of Bavaria , which holds the copyright to “ Mein Kampf ” until it expires in 2015 , opposes lifting the ban on the grounds that publication could strengthen the far right .
Nevertheless , we believe Kramer ’s decision is both courageous and correct .
As Sir Ian Kershaw , a historian and respected Hitler biographer , told Germany ’s Stern magazine : “ A grown - up democracy like Germany does not need to fear that Hitler ’s damaging treatise would somehow constitute a threat to society . ”

That does n’t mean that Europe should relax its guard against racism , xenophobia or anti-Semitism .
Only 64 years have passed since the end of the war , and it must remain a central goal to ensure that nothing like it happens again .
But stifling information is often counterproductive and rarely succeeds in stopping the spread of noxious ideas .
“ Mein Kampf , ” for instance , is easily available on the Internet , and all the laws that have banned the signs and symbols of Nazism in recent decades have not stopped Europe ’s extreme right from espousing similar ideas .
Banning books raises questions that are difficult to answer .
Why should Hitler ’s works be banned but not those of Stalin or Mao ?
Why should a government assume that its citizens need to be guarded against ideas , or that they ca n’t judge right from wrong ?
What ’s the value of banning publication if the book is available in neighboring countries ?
And here ’s another reason Kramer is arguing in favor of publication :
When the copyright on “ Mein Kampf ” expires , the right to publish it could be opened to anyone -- which suggests that an annotated version today might be a far more responsible introduction to the work .
Advertisement
“ Mein Kampf ” will be immediately recognized by most readers for what it is : long - winded , repetitious , dense and , not to put too fine a point on it , evil .
That was the thinking of California ’s future U.S. senator , Alan Cranston , when he published an unexpurgated and annotated translation of “ Mein Kampf ” in 1939 , believing it would alert Americans to Hitler ’s nefarious intentions .
( When Cranston was subsequently sued by Hitler ’s publisher for copyright violations , he lost . )
Winston Churchill also believed that “ Mein Kampf ” was essential reading .
He called it “ turgid , verbose , shapeless , but also pregnant with its message ” and said that , at the time the war began , “ there was no book which deserved more careful study . ”
Even today , studying the ideas and conditions that brought Hitler to power -- rather than seeking to squelch such a discussion -- remains the best way to ensure that Nazism stays dead .

Hypnosis is a set of effective communication techniques for shaping one ’s beliefs , attitudes , thought - patterns , and behaviors .
Often these communication techniques take advantage of direct or indirect suggestions , of which a participant may accept or deny , depending on their own free will or “ condition of suggestibility . ”
Hypnosis should n’t be associated with a particular state of consciousness or awareness .
Different uses of hypnosis may call upon different mental states .
A patient in hypnotherapy may be put in a deep sleep or trance state in order for the therapist to have better communicative - access to a patient ’s subconscious mind ; but a stage hypnotist allows his or her participants to keep their awareness focused outwards within one ’s environment .
Some hypnosis plays upon the imaginative and generative faculties of the mind , while other hypnosis utilizes the exploratory and perceptive faculties of the mind .
So , there is no one mental “ state ” that hypnosis can be really associated to – this is why I keep its definition strictly in the realm of communication .
A hypnotist is essentially no different than a good communicator .
A hypnotist must have a good sense of flexibility in his or her vocabulary , tone of voice , and body language in order to be the best communicator he or she can be .
In other words , a suggestion that works on one individual does not necessarily work on another individual .
This is due to the inherit subjective nature of language , meaning , and communication .
There are some hypnosis techniques that are specifically designed to elicit this subjective information from the patient , and using this information a hypnotist can gain a better strategy on how to effectively communicate to that individual .
Elicitation strategies are not always used by hypnotists , but they are especially common for hypnotherapists – those who are trying to reshape a participant ’s underlying beliefs , attitudes , and thought patterns regarding a situation .
Stage hypnotists do n’t need to do these elicitation strategies since many participants are volunteers and thus already have a high suggestibility or willingness to “ play along ” with the hypnotist .
Another thing that plays a strong role in suggestibility during hypnosis shows is the social role of the hypnotist : he is the star and leader of the show , he has a certain aura of command within the room .
Thus , it is easy to find obedient participants .
And of course – these participants almost always have a fun time participating and using their imagination during hypnotist shows , so the entertainment aspect of hypnosis itself is always an enticing suggestion .
How do suggestions work ?
Suggestions can work in the same multitude of ways in which we can learn .
This can be through story - telling , analogies , asking questions , giving commands , providing information , evoking the imagination , encouraging contemplation , or a person ’s body mannerisms and body posture – all of these are different mediums in which a suggestion can take place .
A third party does not even need to be present in order for a suggestion to be suggested .
Instead , an individual may even suggest something to their own self and then try to convince this self that this suggestion is the right thing to do .
This interaction is typically the conscious self speaking with the unconscious self .
The unconscious self is best communicated to when it is brought into consciousness – this is why it is typically called “ subconscious ” ( which is just a useful term for : mental activity than can be brought into conscious awareness .
This is mental activity that is often ignored by the conscious mind , despite the role it plays in our thoughts and behaviors ) .
Another way to describe it is our “ conditioned self . ”
It is responsible for those actions we do that we continue doing , without question , because they have become second - nature .
Some hypnotists believe that all hypnosis is self - hypnosis .
In other words , the “ suggestion ” always originates in the mind of the individual in which it is being suggested , and then from there the individual either accepts or declines the suggestion .
The environment plays an important role in suggestibility as well .
If a hypnotist tells you over a YouTube video to quack like a chicken it may not be as effective then if you were in front of a live audience who are all waiting for you to respond as a chicken .
In reality , this is little more than social pressure and conformity , but it is all suggestion when it comes to the world of hypnosis .
A good hypnotist must therefore keep a strong mind on the environment , and the varying ways this can affect a particular person ’s response to a suggestion .
What effects the degree of suggestibility ?
A . The individuals preconditioned “ map of the world . ”
In other words , his or her preconceived concepts , language tendencies , thought - patterns , attitudes , and behavioral tendencies to a given subject or situation .
B . The environment in which the suggestion is being given ( You would n’t take a puff of a blunt right in front of grandma , but you might do it in the presence of a bunch of your friends ) .
C. The delivery of the suggestion : using effective verbal and reasoning skills , appropriate vocal tone , and congruent body language .
How can a hypnotist get better at giving suggestions and being an effective hypnotist ?
A . Be a good listener .
Pay attention to others ’ word patterns and language tendencies .
B. Pay attention to universals behind the meaning of body language and posture .
C. Read up on psychology , how the mind learns and creates associations , and how the mind and its environment interact .
D. Keep practicing and gaining new experience .
Experiment with different delivery styles and develop your own kind of niche for communicating effectively with others .

WHAT : Facilitated Communication : Holding on to ( False ) Hope
Facilitated Communication ( FC ) is a technique used on people with severe communication difficulties as an alternative to valid Augmentative and Alternative Communication methods .
Proponents claim that simply by providing emotional and physical support , people with disabilities can unlock inner language and literacy skills .
However , controlled studies of the technique repeatedly show that facilitators , not people with disabilities , are authoring messages obtained via FC .
Most major health and educational organizations have opposition polices for FC and strongly urge its members not to use the technique .
Still , the practice persists .
Former facilitator , Janyce Boynton , believes FC is not a communication technique , but a belief system within the facilitators themselves .
She will discuss the various forms of FC that exist today , as well as social , emotional , and political forces that attract people to FC in the first place and make it particularly difficult to let go once the belief system takes hold .
WHO : Janyce L. Boynton , M.Ed. , B.S .
Janyce is an artist , educator , and advocate for evidence - based practices in the field of communication sciences and disorders .
As a speech / language clinician in the early 1990s , she became involved with facilitated communication .
Her story , first as believer , then as critic , is well - documented and was featured on Frontline ’s “ Prisoners of Silence ” .
She left teaching to pursue her artwork but has continued to be active in educating people about the dangers of FC and other facilitator - influenced techniques .
An overview of her experiences with FC can be found in Stuart Vyse ’s “ An Artist With a Science - Based Mission ” , published in Skeptical Inquirer ( November 2018 ) .
Her 2012 article , “ Facilitated Communication : What Harm it Can Do – Confessions of a Former Facilitator ” , published in the journal Evidence - Based Communication and Intervention , was the first of its kind .
To date , she is one of the few facilitators world - wide to publicly acknowledge her role in producing FC messages and speak out against its use .
She is currently co-hosting a series of talks with Susan Gerbic exploring the many facets of FC .

Fathers still play a key biological role in rearing children ( Image : Ute Mans / Plainpicture )
YOU may be tempted to think men are becoming an optional extra in the mating game , but biochemical evidence in mice and people suggests that fathers may play a key role in the rearing of offspring .
Previous studies have hinted at the importance of fathers in child - rearing .
Some have shown that girls reach puberty younger , become sexually active earlier and are more likely to get pregnant in their teens if their father was absent when they were young .
Others have suggested that the sons of absent …

Web site ad rules
Court rejects Bar ’s
Web site ad rules

Questioning whether they would provide sufficient protection for the public , the Supreme Court has rejected the Bar ’s proposed lawyer Web site advertising rules , but made several suggestions on how the rules could be improved .
The Bar ’s proposals would have required that the home page of a lawyer Web site comply with all the substantive lawyer advertising regulations , which are set forth in Rule 4 - 7.2 .
After the home page , the remainder of the lawyer Web site has to comply with all substantive lawyer advertising regulations except for testimonials , references to past case results , and characterizations of the quality of their legal services — items that are prohibited in other types of lawyer ads .
The Bar would have required disclaimers if the lawyer included testimonials or references to past results .
The court found the Bar ’s proposed amendments were “ not sufficient ” to make material behind the home page fall under the concept of information “ upon request , ” but said “ sufficient changes ” could be made to the advertising rules to make pages behind the home page constitute material “ upon request . ”
Information provided at the request of a prospective client is not subject to the lawyer advertising rules , but can not be misleading .
To do that , the court suggested the Bar consider a two - step process — including having the public accept a disclaimer — before accessing the inside pages of a lawyer ’s Web site .
“ First , users could be required to complete a ‘ Request ’ page with their name , address , and phone number ( all required fields ) .
Second , a disclaimer page could appear with the bottom of the page requiring a click on a button to indicate that the user had read the disclaimer ( and an option for the user to discontinue the request for information ) , ” the court said .
“ Only after the user navigated through these two pages would the user be able to obtain the additional information . ”
The court said taking those added steps would make obtaining information from a Web site similar to getting information “ upon request ” from a lawyer , as when potential clients phone firms asking for information and then are mailed a DVD or brochure by the lawyer with the requested information .
The Bar contended that there are “ significant difficulties ” in regulating attorney Web sites in that posted material can be constantly changed and the site can present voluminous amounts of information , making review of that information an overwhelming task .
“ Thus , as the Bar is unable to review all of the material posted on attorney Web sites , we suggest that the Bar consider requiring attorneys to certify their compliance with the computer - accessed communications rules , ” the court said .
“ This required certification could be included on Bar members ’ annual dues statements , similar to the required certification of compliance with the trust accounting rules . ”
The court said if the Bar ’s general investigations of Web sites reveal an attorney whose site does not comply , the Bar could then proceed with a disciplinary investigation in a manner similar to when the Bar discovers violations of the trust accounting rules .
Chief Justice Peggy Quince , concurring in part and dissenting in part , said she disagrees with the portion of the opinion that suggests that if a user has to navigate at least two pages that would make the rest of the Web site “ upon request ” and , therefore , not be subject to regulation by the Bar .
Chief Justice Quince also noted the Bar ’s Citizens Forum — composed of citizens who could be consumers of legal services — looked at the proposed rules and recommended lawyer Web sites be subject to the same substantive rules as all other forms of lawyer advertisements , including submission of the filing with the Bar for review .
The Bar ’s Special Committee on Website Advertising made the same recommendation — excluding only the requirement of filing with the Bar for review .
“ I agree with these groups that the substantive advertising rules of the Bar should apply to Web - based advertisements , ” Chief Justice Quince said .
“ It seems incongruous to me that we are considering a loosening of the advertisement rules and the allowance of more self - lauding statements , i.e. , past results and testimonials , in a forum that the Bar admits it cannot adequately review and which changes frequently .
I would therefore apply the advertising rules to Web sites . ”
In a concurring opinion , in which Justice Jorge Labarga concurred , Justice Barbara Pariente said while the “ two clicks ” solution is a “ reasonable compromise ” she is still concerned about the use of “ testimonials . ”
Pariente said Bar rules presently do not define the term “ testimonial ” and asked the Bar to further study and define what is meant by the “ testimonial ” and report back to the court .
“ [ I ] find it is these laudatory - type statements or ‘ testimonials ’ that are the most troubling because they have the most potential for abuse and the most potential for further denigrating the justice system and this profession in the minds of the public , ” Pariente said .
Likewise , Justice Charles Canady , who concurred in result only , said the use of testimonials and statements regarding past results needs more study in that the rules as currently written are convoluted .
“ The provisions of Rule 4 - 7.2 ( c ) ( 1 ) suggest that testimonials and statements regarding results obtained may by their very nature run afoul of the general prohibition in Rule 4 - 8.4 ( c ) of ‘ dishonesty , fraud , deceit , or misrepresentation , ’ and thus would not be permissible even as information provided at the request of a prospective client , ” Canady said .
“ This is a matter that should be considered and clarified before a proposal such as that presented by the Bar is adopted , ” Canady said .
The Bar is reviewing the order and considering whether to file a motion for rehearing or clarification , according to Mary Ellen Bateman , director of the Bar ’s Ethics & Advertising , UPL , and Special Projects Division .
The court acted February 27 in case SC08 - 1181 .

Launching of the report of the Census Data Analysis Project the other day , reminded one of many a task , which despite its importance for the nation , is not recognized as such by vast majority of the people .
Census of population is one such undertaking .
Once it has been conducted in the field , everybody except some technocrats and users of its data , for­get about it , not realizing that the statistics generated by this operation will affect their lives for the next ten years through policies and plans using the census figures .
A country with a population of 150 million produces such a tremendous amount of data during the census , that it can keep a battalion of research workers busy in processing , analysing and re­porting for the decade to come .
We , in Pakistan , could not utilize all the data produced by all the five on a continuous basis .
Temporary staff was re­cruited to count population during a fixed period .
Equally , non-permanent personnel were engaged to carry out data entry .
Even the staff that analysed the data and wrote reports did not know about their future .
Once the operation was over and broad results became available , the bulk of the staff was disposed off , leaving behind only a skeleton strength of permanent employees .
The practice , apparently , is universal : ac­tually , it varies .
The permanent census staffs in other coun­tries are much larger which does not allow any slackness in research and analysis after the departure of temporary staff .
Pakistan experiences a slack period until preparations for the next census begin , reducing research and analysis to a trickle .
This tendency is illustrated by the fact that even a most desirable post - census evaluation survey to assess cov­erage of the census and detect any errors could not be car­ried out after the 1998 census .
It was only one out of many pitfalls of a census .
They can happen anywhere , if census is not given the place that it commands .
The census of popula­tion in British India aimed at compiling a complete economic , geographical , political , production , and land - use profile of British territories .
Although much of this system was inher­ited from the Suri , Mughal and earlier kingdoms , yet the British perfected it .
Census of population was an important component of the British information scheme .
Yet , problems did occur at times , e.g. in 1931 and 1941 due to bitter rivalry between the Hindu and Muslim populations .
But quick cor­rections were prompted by frequent use of census figures by the government .
Pakistan inherited from the British , the tradition of hold­ing a census every ten years .
The census of 1951 , as such , was held on time despite highly unsettled conditions com­pounded by arrival of around seven million refugees within a few months .
But the 1961 Census saw tempering like the 1941 Census .
This time , the tussle was between East and West Pakistan lobbies , instead of Hindus and Muslims .
As a result , there was estimated five to seven percent under enu­meration in West Pakistan .
This tendency took root and the census , once considered almost sacred , fell prey to ethnic , parochial and dirty local politics .
The East versus West Pakistan competition , however , disappeared with the emergence of Bangladesh .
But it was succeeded by provincial , linguistic and political prejudices .
The 1971 census could only be held in 1972 due to the separation struggle in erstwhile East Pak­istan .
But it was held to be comparatively fair because it was conducted in a society stunned by the shock of East Pakistan debacle .
The 1981 census had to face the brunt of well organized lobbies in favour and against other regions , commu­nities and political parties .
Technically , this census is recog­nized as superior to earlier exercises .
However , the - results had some big surprises in certain areas of Sindh and Balochistan :
Their population came out to be much higher than could be justified .
This started right from the housing census .
There was clearly a political hand in these distortions .
This census , however , was instrumental in bringing into open the miserable condition of education , especially that of women .
There were other candid statistics .
However , the mischief committeed at enumeration in the field intensified the struggle for numerical superiority .
Census , which was due in 1991 , was postponed again and again .
The 1990s saw four governments of two main parties .
Each of them claimed to have greater following in some constituency .
They were afraid that the census held by a gov­ernment of the rival party would manoeuvre to depress popu­lation figures in their areas of influence .
The census thus was held in 1998 .
But what happened during the seven years of postponement was so irresponsible and bizarre that one would prefer not to discuss it .
Only one episode will suffice :
On this particular occasion , the big count was due next morning when suddenly the government decided to stop it .
Next day , instead of the big count , there was an announcement that the census operations had been postponed due to ‘ inclement weather ’ :
While according to many a source there was not even a speck of cloud anywhere in Pakistan !
This incident speaks volumes about how the nation of ours has ruined its institutions and thrown the sanctity of tasks of national importance to dogs .
The census was , finally , held in 1998 , after a delay of seven years and a gap of 17 years .
However , the important step of post - census survey was missed mak­ing it difficult to assess the accuracy of results .
This short­coming was belatedly met through launching of a census data analysis project , by combining resources of two United Na­tions bodies ( UNFPA and UNSD ) , and two Pakistani agencies ( PIDE and PCO ) .
Coordination was assigned to a former joint director and economic demographer , Dr Mohammad Irfan , under the overall supervision Dr A R Kamal , Director PIDE .
The work was distributed among a team of 18 senior so­cial scientists - cum - demographers .
A technical committee over saw progress of the project .
These arrangements have been described in detail to give an idea of the work involved in cov­ering only one step of census operations .
One can well imag­ine the requirements of a high calibre permanent organization !
One could not go through the entire report due to time constraint , yet some conclusions can be drawn .
Feeny and Alma , two eminent demographer team members , in their paper , are of the opinion that the 1998 population was under­- enumerated ; though supervision and controls were good , due to the presence of military personnel during fieldwork .
Inac­curacies , thus , could have been introduced at the data - entry and data processing stages .
Illegibility of numerous enumera­tion forms received over long distances and stored in bulk was one of the major problems .
Unfortunately , the forms were dis­posed off rather early so no checking could be done for er­rors .
There are reports that at least 92 percent of filled ques­tionnaires had at least one blank entry .
Had the original forms been retained , these errors could have been detected before the final tabulations .
Although equipped only with a browsing of the summaries , yet one would not hesitate to venture to list measures , which could assure regular and re­liable decennial censuses in future .
First :
The census objec­tives should again be re-oriented to the real goals of a cen­sus .
It should unfold a complete picture of population and its environs for purposes of policy making .
The census should be unburdened of its role , determining the share of provinces in the NFC awards , as far as possible .
Second :
There should be permanent autonomous census organization to conduct the decennial census .
It should also undertake research stud­ies on a continuous basis .
It should be component of an information gathering network , engaged in population research , in the light of developments in related fields , in collection with other research organizations .
Third : Census Organization should have highly qualified staff at all levels .
It should be headed by a professional population scholar and re­searcher committed to the job on permanent basis .
Quality of even the enumerators should be assured .
Fourth : Processing of data should be made efficient and foolproof by stringent training , approoriate salaries and proper work plans .
Raw data should be retained for a reasonable period of time for re-checking and
Fifth : Data evaluation funtion should be built in the budget so that it is not missed .

A tree stump which some believe shows an image of the Virgin Mary has attracted thousands of people to a rural churchyard in County Limerick .
Workmen came across the stump at the Holy Mary Parish Church in Rathkeale while cutting down trees on Monday .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States believes Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a drone attack last week , President Obama 's national security adviser said Sunday .
Villagers gather at the rubble of houses belonging to supporters of Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud .
" We think so , " Gen .
Jim Jones told NBC's " Meet the Press , " adding , " We put it in the 90 percent [ likelihood ] category . "
Pakistan 's foreign and interior ministers said Friday the government was still waiting to conduct DNA analysis to confirm the identity of a man killed Wednesday in an unmanned aerial vehicle strike .
The suspected U.S. drone targeted the home of Mehsud 's father - in - law , Mulvi Ikram ud Din , in Pakistan 's South Waziristan tribal area , an intelligence official said .
Taliban officials have denied reports of Mehsud 's death .
Speaking to " Fox News Sunday " about reports that Mehsud was killed , Jones said , " All evidence that we have suggests that , " but he emphasized that the United States can not be sure .
Watch what Mehsud 's death would mean for anti-terror effort »
If Mehsud was killed , it means that U.S. cooperation with Pakistan is " having a good effect and that we 're moving in the right direction , " Jones said .
" Mehsud was a very bad individual , a real thug responsible for a lot of violence , a lot of innocent people losing their lives . "
A top Pakistani official said the government has information that a leading candidate to replace Mehsud was killed in a gunfire exchange Saturday between supporters of senior Taliban leaders .
Jones said the United States does not know if that is accurate .
But , he added , " if there is dissension within the ranks ... this is a positive indication that in Pakistan things are turning for the better . "

As if trying to pull meaning out of the medical literature were n’t difficult enough as it is , a new study demonstrates yet another obstacle to easy understanding : the adherer effect .
We ’ve all seen the headlines .
Statins improve bone health .
Statins prevent cancer .
Statins make us smarter .
Low - fat diets improve longevity .
All these headlines and others like them are followed by articles describing studies seeming to show that subjects taking certain medications ( usually statin drugs , it seems ) or following a particular diet have improvements in health and / or longevity .
The promise of these articles is that if we all take the medication or follow the lifestyle choice , we , too , will reduce our risk of [ fill in the blank ] or live longer .
But will we ?
Maybe so .
But not for the reason most people think .
The adherer effect demonstrates that people who adhere to medical or lifestyle regimens end up with better outcomes than those who don’t…even if the regimens are nothing but placebo .
I mentioned this phenomenon in an earlier post .
Almost thirty years ago a study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine looking at this very idea .
[ The adherer effect ]
The study that inspired the article did n’t start out looking at this idea , but one of the investigators noted a key piece of the data and published on it .
The study was looking at clofibrate , a pre-statin cholesterol lowering drug , and all cause mortality .
Subjects were randomized into two groups – those in one group got the drug , those in the other got the placebo .
After the subjects were on either the drug or the placebo for five years , researchers calculated the mortality from the number of deaths in each group .
Turned out that the five - year mortality of those on clofibrate was 20.0 percent whereas the five - year mortality of those on the placebo was 20.9 percent , or essentially the same .
Taking the drug was no different than taking the placebo , i.e. , the drug was worthless .
Had one of the researchers not looked a little closer , that would have been the end of the story .
When the data were looked at from the perspective of how many people actually took the drug as prescribed , the researcher discovered that those subjects who took at least 80 percent or more of their clofibrate had a five year mortality of only 15.0 percent , substantially less than the overall five - year mortality .
Those who took their clofibrate sporadically had a five - year mortality of 24.6 percent , significantly higher than those who took it as directed , a piece of data that would seem to confirm the efficacy of clofibrate .
Right ?
Not necessarily .
Let ’s look at compliance with the placebo .
Turns out that those subjects on the placebo who regularly took their placebo had a five - year mortality of 15.1 percent while those who took their placebo sporadically had a five - year mortality of 28.3 percent .
What this study really showed was that there is something intrinsic to people who religiously take their medicine that makes them live longer .
There was no difference between the drug and placebo in either those who took them regularly or those who took them sporadically , but there was a huge difference in mortality between those who took either drug or placebo on schedule and those who did n’t .
Gary Taubes discussed this same study and the adherer effect in a long article he wrote for the New York Times Magazine a few years ago :
A still more subtle component of healthy - user bias has to be confronted .
This is the compliance or adherer effect .
Quite simply , people who comply with their doctors ’ orders when given a prescription are different and healthier than people who do n’t .
This difference may be ultimately unquantifiable .
The compliance effect is another plausible explanation for many of the beneficial associations that epidemiologists commonly report , which means this alone is a reason to wonder if much of what we hear about what constitutes a healthful diet and lifestyle is misconceived .
The lesson comes from an ambitious clinical trial called the Coronary Drug Project that set out in the 1970s to test whether any of five different drugs might prevent heart attacks .
The subjects were some 8,500 middle - aged men with established heart problems .
Two - thirds of them were randomly assigned to take one of the five drugs and the other third a placebo .
Because one of the drugs , clofibrate , lowered cholesterol levels , the researchers had high hopes that it would ward off heart disease .
But when the results were tabulated after five years , clofibrate showed no beneficial effect .
The researchers then considered the possibility that clofibrate appeared to fail only because the subjects failed to faithfully take their prescriptions .
As it turned out , those men who said they took more than 80 percent of the pills prescribed fared substantially better than those who did n’t .
Only 15 percent of these faithful “ adherers ” died , compared with almost 25 percent of what the project researchers called “ poor adherers . ”
This might have been taken as reason to believe that clofibrate actually did cut heart - disease deaths almost by half , but then the researchers looked at those men who faithfully took their placebos .
And those men , too , seemed to benefit from adhering closely to their prescription : only 15 percent of them died compared with 28 percent who were less conscientious .
“ So faithfully taking the placebo cuts the death rate by a factor of two , ” says David Freedman , a professor of statistics at the University of California , Berkeley .
“ How can this be ?
Well , people who take their placebo regularly are just different than the others .
The rest is a little speculative .
Maybe they take better care of themselves in general .
But this compliance effect is quite a big effect . ”
In the same blog post of mine I linked to above , I wrote about another study showing the adherer effect , showing graphically how potent the phenomenon is .
Previously , the study of the adherer effect has been a secondary finding in studies of various drug regimens , but now comes a paper in which the adherer effect is the primary focus of the investigation .
Based on the data in this recent paper , the effect is robust and should be accounted for in the analysis of any data generated when subjects following a particular treatment are compared to those who do n’t .
The authors lay out the problem :
The healthy - user effect [ the adherer effect ] is a hypothetical source of confounding bias that is thought to affect observational studies of drugs , diets , screening procedures , and other health - related behaviors .
This bias presumes that patients who initiate and adhere to preventive therapies are more likely to engage in behaviors consistent with a healthy lifestyle than are patients who do not initiate or adhere to such treatments .
Aspects of a healthy lifestyle could include diet , exercise , moderation of alcohol , and avoidance of risky behaviors .
These characteristics , which are unmeasured in typical pharmacoepidemiological databases , may be associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes in observational studies .
Thus , failure to adjust for them can lead to bias in studies of preventive therapies .
The healthy - user bias has been suggested as an explanation for the discrepancy between several experimental and observational studies , including studies of the effects of long - term use of estrogen therapy and vitamin E .
It has also been discussed as a potential source of bias in observational studies of the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the elderly and the association between use of 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme
A reductase inhibitors ( statins ) and reduced risk of hip fracture , Alzheimer disease , sepsis , cancer , and mortality .
This bias has also been observed in randomized controlled trials in which adherence to placebo was found to be associated with decreased mortality .
Although long suspected as a source of bias , a paucity of empirical data exists on the healthy - user effect .
Here ’s how the study was set up .
It was really pretty simple .
The researchers looked at a group of patients who had been prescribed one of a variety of statin drugs and followed their compliance by looking at how many times these subjects picked up their medicines in the year following their prescription .
The typical statin prescription was for 60 days worth of the medication , and all subjects had available to them a full year ’s worth of medicines .
The researchers grouped subjects into two groups : one group who took the trouble to go get over 120 day ’s worth of the medication ( the “ more adherent ” ) and one group of subjects who were dispensed under 120 days of meds ( the “ less adherent ” ) .
All subjects entered into the study were evaluated after the one year baseline study period during which their effort to follow their prescribed statin regimen sorted them into the categories of more adherent or less adherent .
The researchers were looking to see which subjects – the adherers or the non-adherers – would develop problems that had nothing to do with the statin drugs .
We evaluated a spectrum of events after the 1 - year baseline period to assess the healthy - adherer bias .
The outcomes were grouped into 4 broad categories : accident events , screening events , other events not expected to be associated with statin exposure , and other events for which a possible association with statin exposure could be expected .
We included inpatient and outpatient events as well as primary and secondary diagnoses .
When the data on these 141,086 subjects was crunched , it turned out that the more adherent subjects had significantly fewer accidents , especially motor vehicle and workplace accidents .
The more adherent also had a lower likelihood of developing other disorders that were not likely to be attributed to the effect of the statin drugs .
In other words , whatever characteristic it was that made subjects hang in there with their statin prescriptions also made them less likely to indulge in risky behaviors and less likely to develop all kinds of medical problems .
Why ?
Probably because these people were simply more health conscious , kept themselves in better shape , and did n’t act impulsively .
The real take - home message from this study is that the adherer effect significantly affects the outcome of drug and lifestyle intervention studies .
If you see a study that says those subjects using statin drugs developed 20 percent fewer problems ( of whatever kind are being studied ) than those who do n’t use statins , you can be sure that the adherer effect is at work .
This adherer effect is why randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies are needed to determine the efficacy of any drug , and even then the adherer effect should be controlled for .
There is a big note , enclosed in a box and titled Clinical Perspective , at the end of this study that exhorts doctors to consider this adherer effect when looking at data from observational studies .
Here is the note in full .
Clinicians need to read observational studies reporting surprising benefits of drug therapy with a healthy skepticism .
Observational studies of preventive medications and health behaviors are susceptible to various sources of bias , including the so - called healthy - user and healthy - adherer biases .
In this article , evidence of the healthy - adherer effect is demonstrated by showing that adherence to statins is associated with a reduction in the risk of accidents ( eg , workplace or motor vehicle ) , outcomes that would not be expected to be affected by a statin .
The approximate magnitude of the adherer effect was a 15 % relative risk reduction .
The most likely explanation for this association is that good adherence to statin therapy is a marker for other healthy behaviors , most of which cannot be accounted for in this type of study .
In keeping with this explanation , the study also shows that adherence predicts a 7 % to 17 % increased incidence of medical screening procedures ( eg , fecal occult blood testing , mammography ) .
Risk of myocardial infarction , which has been demonstrated to be reduced by statin therapy in randomized placebo - controlled trials , was found in this study to be reduced by 28 % .
This observed relative reduction must be interpreted as reflecting a combination of the healthy - adherer effect and the drug effect .
Clinicians can also learn from this study that patients who follow their advice are also likely to have other healthy behaviors and a lower risk of adverse events .
It is unfortunate , but I doubt that many doctors ( or researchers , for that matter ) will consider the adherer effect when they read these studies .
I would bet that we will continue to see studies reported as if the positive effects found were a function of the drug or lifestyle regimen studied and not the adherer effect .
To me the saddest part of this study was the statistic that of the 141,086 subjects in this study , 49 percent were women .
The randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies of statins have never shown a benefit in terms of decreased all - cause mortality in women of any age .
Which means that over 70,000 women in this study took a drug that would do them no good , but which could well cause them significant and harmful side effects .
In this study , those who dropped out of their statin regimen because of intolerable side effects would be considered to be less adherent or non adherers .
My guess is that many of these ‘ non adherers ’ who dropped out because of side effects were really ‘ adherers ’ by nature .
Had these drop outs due to side effects been controlled for , I would bet that the difference between the less adherent and the more adherent would have been much larger than the data showed .
We all knew marijuana was a big business .
But now , amid California ’s latest and deepest financial crisis , the state Board of Equalization has put a revenue figure on the cannabis trade – and the potential benefit to government coffers .
A tax on pot sales in California could fetch as much as $ 1.4 billion , according to the board ’s analysis in response to a proposal by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) that would regulate cannabis much like alcohol .
Pro-pot groups ballyhooed the report as another sign that the long debate over marijuana legalization has entered a new , more serious phase .
The Drug Policy Alliance said the report “ amplifies the escalating national discussion of marijuana policy . ”
Ammiano ’s measure is staunchly opposed by law enforcement groups , but the lawmaker argues that it would generate much - needed revenue for the state , restrict access to only those over 21 , end environmental damage caused to public lands by illicit crops and redirect police efforts to “ more serious ” crimes .

With Republican opposition to health care reform hardening by the day , the Democrats may be forced to push forward on their own .
President Obama , who has barnstormed the country and called for bipartisan buy - in , has been met with vociferous attacks on his motives , and has spent considerable time fending off objections to ideas that are n’t in any plan .
Did President Obama make a strategic mistake by letting Congress take the lead in crafting legislation while he talked about general principles without having his own specific plan to present to the American people ?
Or has he , by going this route , avoided the blunders of the Clinton administration when it took on health reform in 1994 ?
Saps and Fakers
Theda Skocpol is a professor of government and sociology at Harvard University , and the author of “ Boomerang : Health Reform and the Turn Against Government , ” a book about the failed 1993 - 94 Clinton effort at comprehensive health reform .
President Obama may not have been mistaken to let Congress work on this for several months , not getting too far out in front with specific plans of his own .
But once it became clear by mid-July that the Senate Finance Committee ’s group of six included people acting in bad faith , just trying to delay and dilute the process , he should have switched course .
He should have crystallized a clear message and basic points of a plan that his supporters could mobilize around , and that the general public could understand .
Democrats would be better off to go down fighting for real reform — anything less would backfire on them .
Instead , the president just keeps muddling things .
A low point in the mess was when he said he “ did not agree ” with “ death panels . ”
How could he possibly validate this as if it were a policy disagreement ?
He should have declared , loud and clear : there are no death panels ; it is a lie from people trying to defeat reforms !
It is important to be clear who is acting in bad faith , trying to scuttle a reform effort that the nation and millions of its citizens badly need .
The Republican Party is acting as a spoiler for extreme purposes , and the news media has enabled this by not asking hard questions about lies and bad faith from so - called conservatives , including some Democrats as well as Republicans .
Senator Grassley , in particular , has acted abominably in all this .
He has now admitted that he never intended to vote for the “ compromise ” he has delayed the Finance Committee to work out !
And he helped to spread the “ death panel ” lie .
President Obama and Senator Baucus and the Democratic Party end up looking like saps , because they played along with fake “ bipartisan ” signals from Senator Grassley et. al. , and let things be delayed until disputes among Democrats could be sparked .
That has been the Republican and health insurance industry game plan all along .
As a scholar who has studied 100 years worth of failed efforts at universal health reform in America , none of this surprises me much .
But it is disappointing to see the president and the Democrats paint themselves into a corner , when they were at a high - mark of electoral and public support .

The issue in U.S. politics today is stark : not government versus the “ free market , ” but what kind of government and for whom ?
Is government authority going to be used to guarantee private profits to monopolies , or to spread security and opportunity to the majority ?
The current health reform battle poses this issue starkly .
Will President Obama settle for new rules and population mandates that guarantee monopoly profits to private insurers ?
Or will he fight for a robust public option — or better yet for letting individuals and businesses buy into Medicare if they choose to do so ?
It is not at all clear what he will choose .
But his choice will define his legacy .
Democrats would be better off to go down fighting for real reform , rather than to impose an insurance company tax on working and middle class Americans by forcing them to buy private insurance at inflated prices .
That would be no reform at all — and it would backfire on Democrats within a few years , as people would resent this — and rising costs for public programs would continue to undermine them .
President Obama has prided himself on avoiding President Clinton ’s mistakes .
But actually he has replicated them in new ways , by imagining that insider deals with industry people and attempts at bipartisan negotiation and “ reasoned arguments ” would hold sway .
That never happens in U.S. health reform debates .
It is a battle , pure and simple , and the folks who are most intense and willing to mobilize and exaggerate always win .
Cheerleader in Chief
Peter Wehner , a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center , has worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush , where he served as deputy assistant to the president .
As a general rule , it ’s hard to succeed as a salesman when you do n’t have anything in particular you ’re selling .
In that respect , President Obama has over - learned from the failures of HillaryCare .
In that instance , the Clinton administration wrote a bill under the cloak of secrecy and attempted to ram it down the throat of Congress .
In this instance , the Obama administration has deferred almost completely to Congress , which means it has lost control of the process and is creating enormous confusion .
Witness the last few days , when the administration distanced itself from the “ public option , ” which riled up liberals and forced the White House to re-embrace what it will eventually have to jettison .
Obama ca n’t argue for a specific reform or calm fears because he is championing “ reform ” rather than concrete plans .
With the House and Senate working on very different — and in some respects competing — pieces of legislation , the president is having to defend widespread criticisms of them in order to avoid alienating Hill barons whose support he will eventually need .
Nor can he effectively argue on behalf of specific reform or calm specific fears , since he is championing “ reform ” rather than concrete plans .
The White House need not have written legislation , but it should have produced clear outlines in advance .
The effect of all this is that President Obama looks more like a cheerleader than a leader .
He is speaking out all the time , and his words are being devalued by the day .
The more he talks , the more support for the reinvention of health care collapses .
The “ great communicator ” is mobilizing enormous and growing opposition to his plan .
It would be a mistake , however , to blame President Obama ’s problems primarily on a failure of communications .
ObamaCare is sinking because his plan is unwise , unworkable and terribly expensive .
The White House is doing a poor job selling its plans — but even a first - rate salesman cannot sell a defective product .
Who ’s Driving Reform ?
Glenn Greenwald , a former constitutional lawyer , is a columnist at Salon.com and the author , most recently , of “ Great American Hypocrites : Toppling the Big Myths of Republican Politics . ”
Obama administration officials have been content with the impression that they have allowed Congress to take the lead in negotiating and drafting the health care bill .
But this image of the White House as passive observer is quite dubious .
News reports and leaked documents strongly suggest that the administration secretly engineered a deal with the pharmaceutical industry whereby the White House would oppose efforts to negotiate for lower drug prices and drug importation — a clear violation of Obama ’s campaign pledge .
It defies credulity to suggest that President Obama and Rahm Emanuel have meekly ceded responsibility to Democratic committee chairmen .
Given that the president ’s signature is required for the enactment of any health care bill , it simply defies credulity to suggest that President Obama and Rahm Emanuel — who built his career controlling the inner workings of Congress — have meekly ceded responsibility for the drafting and negotiating process to Democratic Committee chairmen .
Ultimately , one can only speculate about the extent of the White House ’s role because virtually all negotiations have been conducted in complete secrecy — also a clear violation of Mr. Obama ’s oft - stated campaign pledge .
At a January , 2008 Democratic primary debate , he vowed that health care reform would be achieved “ not by negotiating behind closed doors ” but rather by “ broadcasting those negotiations on C - SPAN . ”
In a 2008 interview with The San Francisco Chronicle , he elaborated that his C - SPAN commitment would ensure that “ the public will be part of the conversation . . . . so if a member of Congress is carrying water for the drug companies ” by opposing price negotiations , they will be “ shamed ” into abandoning those industry - beholden positions .
Read more …
But the exact opposite has occurred : the negotiations have taken place in secret ; it is the White House that appears to be carrying water for the drug companies by opposing price negotiations ; the pharmaceutical industry is so delighted with what they think will be the ultimate plan that they are spending large sums of money to advocate for it ; and the elimination of the “ public option , ” when combined with mandates that force uninsured citizens to buy high - priced private health insurance , would vastly increase the profit of these industries , as well as the overall costs of health care .
The alternative “ co- op ” approach is the brainchild of a Democratic Senator , Kent Conrad , who is incapable of explaining how it would reduce costs .
The Times reported yesterday that “ the co-op idea is so ill defined that no one knows exactly what it would look like . ”
Two Wisconsin House members yesterday said a co-op in their state “ has n’t saved the state any money whatsoever . ”
All that , combined with the fact that the House contingent standing in the way of a public option ( Blue Dogs ) are the favored recipients of industry largesse , should generate great skepticism towards the ability of co-ops to control costs .
In this context , it appears likely that the “ public option ” was never a serious White House commitment , but merely a bargaining chip to string along progressives , one which would be ultimately sacrificed to secure industry and Blue Dog support .
Either that , or the president failed to use to his substantial institutional weapons to compel party support for his plan ( note how , in the past , Rahm Emanuel was extremely aggressive , even threatening , in pressuring defiant House progressives to support legislation the White House favored ) .
Neither option reflects well on Mr. Obama .
Health care reform was as vital to his campaign as any other commitment — arguably more so — and , for whatever reasons , he has failed to take a stand for ( if not actively renounced ) its central planks .
It is now left to the progressive members of House to fulfill their commitment to oppose any health care plan that lacks a “ public option . ”
Getting Your Own Party On Board
Celinda Lake is a Democratic strategist who has worked for senators , governors and members of Congress .
She is involved in the health care issue , working for a number of groups and labor unions promoting health care reform .
There ’s no easy or good way to do health care reform .
Obviously , there are real enemies to reform , so it ’s really tough no matter how you do it .
The advantage of getting the legislation from the House and Senate is that you get Congressional buy - in , rather than having some members of your own party oppose you from the start .
The flipside is , it ’s harder to get the message out and harder to control the message .
And we ’ve suffered from having the message scattered with so many versions out there rather than one version .
It ’s a trade - off .
Not having one version out allows President Obama to keep the dialogue on principles and preserves the popularity of the main spokesperson a bit longer .
And it prevents his own party from being divided from day one .
But I think maybe the president ’s team overlearned the lessons from 1994 and underestimated the difficulties of this approach .
Of course , there was going to be a fight no matter what .
I think the president does have his own plan .
And he will have to give clear direction when the legislation gets into House - Senate conference .
He Has n’t Made the Case
Karlyn K. Campbell , a professor of communication studies at the University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , is the co-author of “ Deeds Done in Words : Presidential Rhetoric and the Genres of Governance . ”
President Obama did not make a mistake .
If he had laid out a specific plan , members of Congress who have struggled toward a compromise would rightly feel cheated .
His mistake has been not to make the case that we cannot afford to go on as we are .
Until the public understands the escalating financial crisis of the status quo , there wo n’t be popular support for any substantial change .
Medicare and Medicaid contribute substantially to federal deficits , and state governments have cut these programs because of budget shortfalls .
The costs of employer - provided health insurance rise steadily , partly because of payments based on fee for service .
Much of the public seems to not understand the escalating financial crisis of the status quo .
Until they do , there wo n’t be popular support for any substantial change , and President Obama has not made this case .
Do you believe in some sort of god or gods ?
Are you absolutely certain of your answer to question # 1 to the degree that you have no doubt whatsoever that your answer is correct ?
For a variety of reasons , some Christians erroneously insist that atheism entails absolute certainty that no gods exist .
They attempt to paint atheists as irrational or demand that we somehow prove that there are n't any gods .
This reflects either a misconception about the meaning of atheism or another less innocent motive .
In fact , atheism does not require any particular level of certainty .
All it requires is the failure to affirm belief in some sort of god(s ) .
Consider each of the following two questions for a moment , and notice the important difference between them ?
Only one of these questions is relevant to atheism .
I 'll give you a hint : it is n't the second one .
Okay , that is not really fair .
Both are relevant , but only the first isto classify someone into the mutually exclusive categories of theist and atheist .
By definition , a theist is someone who believes in some sort of god or gods .
That is , one must answer question # 1 in the affirmative in order to be a theist .
And yes , anyone who affirms question # 1 is a theist .
This is why atheists ask theists for evidence of their god(s ) .
The theist is making a positive claim that something exists , and so the atheist is inquiring about the evidence to support this claim .
An atheist is someone who does not believe in any sort of god(s ) .
One who fails to affirm question # 1 is , by definition , an atheist .
Again , if you do not believe in some sort of god(s ) , you are an atheist .
Question # 2 is relevant in the sense that it contributes information about one 's level of confidence , but it is not necessary in order to classify someone as theist or atheist .
And as we know , one 's confidence in any particular belief is not a valid indicator of the truth of that belief .
And so one is a theist if one answers " yes " to question # 1 regardless of how one answers question # 2 .
Some theists do profess quite a bit of certainty ; others report considerable uncertainty .
Doing so does not make them any more or less of a theist , although we might call a theist who is very low on certainty an " agnostic theist .
" Likewise , those who do not answer " yes " to question # 1 are atheists , regardless of how they answer question # 2 .
That is , atheism does not require any particular level of certainty .
An atheist reporting low certainty might be called an " agnostic atheist , " but that does not make him or her any less of an atheist .
We would not say that a Christian who experiences some doubts about her faith is suddenly no longer a Christian because she does not claim to be 100 % certain .
In the same way , an atheist who is not 100 % certain ( or uncertain , if you prefer ) does not magically stop being an atheist .
The Obama administration is urging a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit weighing whether a sitting U.S. president may lawfully create a spying program to eavesdrop on Americans ’ electronic communications without warrants or congressional authorization .
The nearly 5 - year - old case , having a tortured procedural history , is the furthest along in challenging the Bush administration ’s warrantless , Terror Surveillance Program adopted in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks .
Two former American lawyers for a now - defunct Saudi charity brought the case .
They allege some of their 2004 telephone conversations to Saudi Arabia were siphoned to the National Security Agency without warrants .
The allegations were based on classified documents the government accidentally mailed to the two former lawyers of an Oregon chapter of the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation .
After a mountain of paperwork , a trip to the appellate courts and countless hearings and motions , U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker of San Francisco ruled in June that the lawyers must make their case without the documents , which both the Bush and Obama administrations claimed were a state secret .
Among other things , the government argued in a filing ( .pdf ) late Thursday :
" Plaintiffs rely on a string of sheer conjecture in an attempt to prove they were subject to the alleged TSP surveillance in 2004 .
But the fact that the president authorized the TSP , that the government has investigated terrorist financing by charitable organizations like the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation of Saudi Arabia and its worldwide branches , that plaintiff AHIF - Oregon had been designated as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist , and , indeed , that this designation had been supported by ' classified ' ' intelligence ' information , does not establish that the government electronically surveilled the plaintiffs under the TSP or otherwise . "
It was the fourth time the government moved to dismiss the case .
Last month , meanwhile , counsel for the Al - Haramain lawyers cited a bevy of circumstantial evidence ( . pdf ) that they claimed demonstrated that the two charity lawyers – Wendell Belew and Asim Gafoor – were unlawfully spied upon .
The evidence included speeches by government officials discussing an investigation that concluded with the listing of Al - Haramain as a terror organization to the FBI ’s public disclosure that it monitored Al - Haramain officials .
The legal issue centers on whether future presidents may adopt a so - called Terror Surveillance Program , which was President George W. Bush ’s once - secret warrantless wiretapping program disclosed in 2005 by The New York Times .
Bush said his war powers granted him the power to create the TSP program .
A hearing was set for September 23 .
In July 2008 , Bush signed legislation authorizing the type of surveillance at issue in this case – allowing the warrantless monitoring of Americans ’ electronic communications if they are communicating overseas with somebody the government believes is linked to terrorism .
Then - Sen. Barrack Obama , now president , voted for that legislation , which also immunized the nation ’s telecommunication companies from lawsuits charging them with being complicit with the Bush administration ’s warrantless , wiretapping program .
Those lawsuits – combined into one in San Francisco federal court – are on appeal .

Eerie Sounds of Saturn 's Radio Emissions
Saturn is a source of intense radio emissions , which have been monitored by the Cassini spacecraft .
The radio waves are closely related to the auroras near the poles of the planet .
These auroras are similar to Earth 's northern and southern lights .
This is an audio file of radio emissions from Saturn .
The Cassini spacecraft began detecting these radio emissions in April 2002 , when Cassini was 374 million kilometers ( 234 million miles ) from the planet , using the Cassini radio and plasma wave science instrument .
The radio and plasma wave instrument has now provided the first high resolution observations of these emissions , showing an amazing array of variations in frequency and time .
The complex radio spectrum with rising and falling tones , is very similar to Earth 's auroral radio emissions .
These structures indicate that there are numerous small radio sources moving along magnetic field lines threading the auroral region .
Time on this recording has been compressed , so that 73 seconds corresponds to 27 minutes .
Since the frequencies of these emissions are well above the audio frequency range , we have shifted them downward by a factor of 44 .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C. The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The radio and plasma wave science team is based at the University of Iowa , Iowa City .

Thinking about file - sharing ?
Do n’t .
You ’ll get fined , and crime does n’t pay ( unless you rob banks and / or armored cars , then it pays very well ) .
Take it from Jammie Thomas , who was fined $ 2 million for downloading 24 songs , or anyone else who tried to fight the RIAA .
Instead , try another crime , because plenty of them draw far lighter penalties than downloading Jason Mraz ’s latest .
Thanks to the Mechanics blog at Gapers Block , here are seven crimes that will get you smaller fines than file - sharing :
1. Child abduction : the fine is only like $ 25000 .
2. Stealing the actual CD : the fine is $ 2,500
3 . Rob your neighbor : the fine is $ 375,000
4 . Burn a house down :
The fine is just over $ 375,000
5 . Stalk someone :
The fine is $ 175,000
6 . Start a dogfighting ring : the fine is $ 50,000
7. Murder someone :
The maximum penalty is only $ 25,000 and 15 years in jail , and depending on your yearly salary , would probably be far slighter a penalty that $ 2 million .
Seriously , murdering someone will result in a lighter overall penalty than downloading a bunch of songs and getting caught .
Granted , you do n’t get shivved in the showers at home , but still .

Renting Tents for your summer parites
Six Tips For Making Good Choices Concerning Tent Rental and Supplies
Introduction
Are you having a fun party this coming summer ?
Have you considered doing a tent rental ?
It could add a new level to your party , especially if you plan on having a lot of kids there .
Sometimes the right event only needs the right tent .
Six Things To Consider With Your Summer Party Rentals
1 )
You want the entrance to look appealing in some way .
No one wants to come to a boring summer party ( no matter what the theme is ) .
Do you remember one of the beginning scenes in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One ?
They had that large tent for the wedding .
That is the type of appeal you want .
We are not saying that you need to make it over the top( like in the movie ) , but your canopy rental should entice the party goers to find out more .
2 )
Do you plan on having a guest DJ and food partition for the party ?
You need to plan for that .
That means your canopy rental needs to be large enough for your guests , the DJ , and food .
Wait !
What about dancing ?
Do you want to go big with a dancing party ?
Plan on including that in the rental fees .
Most canopy rentals that come with a DJ and food partition charge at about $ 275 a pop and that is on the low end of the scale .
You might have to spend more than $ 300 depending on the size of the party and the guest list .
Summer parties get expensive .
3 )
The next thing to talk about is the AC situation .
Hey , it is summertime .
It gets hot .
Do you plan on having AC units to cool your guests down ?
You might want to think about it .
You should plan on between $ 500 - 5,0000 .
Summer parties get expensive ( especially during peak times ) .
4 )
You need to think about the number of people you want at your party .
There are some packages available .
That number will be included in the table and chair rentals .
Some of the packages include one for 75 people ( that will include the table and chair rentals ) .
You will spend at least $ 3500 .
Do you want to invite up to 100 people ?
That will cost you another $ 1,000 .
A tent package that holds 75 - 240 people can run up to $ 7700 ( depending on size , scope , and what you need ) .
FYI :
The tables and chairs have a cost of their own .
Tables will run you at least $ 14 for each one .
Chairs will be about $ 12 ( that is on the low end of the spectrum too ) .
5 )
The lighting is the next issue .
Every option has a different cost .
Would you like to have a mix of par lighting and crystal chandeliers ?
The par lighting will run you about $ 500 ( give or take ) .
The chandeliers will run you about $ 130 for every chandelier you require .
Two will run you at least $ 760 .
6 )
You cannot forget about the anchors needed for the tents .
You could be charged anywhere from .30 cents to $ 5 for one anchor .
Tent rentals in Phoenix are a must with the scorching heat , and are always broken down into sections .
One final thing to consider with the rental is the curtains .
Some suppliers will charge $ 5 for one curtain while others are going to charge more .
Something to think about as you plan your summer party .

The Minister for Lands and Natural Resources , Alhaji Collins Dauda has appealed to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation ( FAO ) to assist Ghana to reclaim its forest lands .
He expressed worry about the fast rate of the depletion of the nation 's natural resources , especially its forest cover which he blamed on the rapid population growth .
Alhaji Dauda made the call yesterday when the new African Regional representative of FAO , Musa Saihou Mbenya , paid a courtesy call on him at his office in Accra .
He asked for assistance for farming practices in Ghana , particularly in the area of technology to improve farm yields and reduce the pressure on lands .
' What we need now is the type of agriculture that requires less land so that people will stop encroaching on our forest reserves , ' he stated .
Alhaji Dauda called for more collaboration between the FAO and the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources in the sustainable management of the country 's forest reserves .
Mr. Mbenga assured the Minister of FAO 's readiness to assist the country to improve its agricultural practices .
Though not a donor organisation , he said the FAO can assist the country to solicit for funds for some of its programmes , especially those aimed at protecting the natural resources .
The Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor , created in the 1950s to break the mob ’s grip on the docks , became its own bastion of lawlessness , employing some of the same corrupt , self - serving methods as the gangsters it was supposed to pursue , investigators said Tuesday in a scathing report .
Top officials at the $ 11 - million - a - year bistate agency divided spoils , helped cronies evade the law and thwarted security provisions meant to safeguard the port against terrorism , according to the report by the New York State inspector general , which capped a nearly two - year investigation in 2007 and 2008 that the commission had sought to block in court .
As a result of the findings , virtually the entire executive staff has been ousted  with the New Jersey commissioner , Michael J. Madonna , a former police officer and union representative , dismissed last week , the commission revealed .
The former New York commissioner , Michael C. Axelrod , who was also faulted for abuses , was not reappointed after his term ended last year .
New leadership was put in place starting last year .
“ It was an utter disaster when we stepped in , ” the inspector general , Joseph Fisch , said in an interview , calling the state of affairs then “ a remnant and continuation of the old waterfront . ”
Autism : It 's the Environment , Not Just Doctors Diagnosing More Disease
California 's sevenfold increase in autism cannot be explained by changes in doctors ' diagnoses and most likely is due to environmental exposures , University of California scientists reported Thursday .
The scientists who authored the new study advocate a nationwide shift in autism research to focus on an array of potential factors in the environment that babies and fetuses are exposed to , including pesticides , viruses and chemicals in household products .
" It 's time to start looking for the environmental culprits responsible for the remarkable increase in the rate of autism in California , " said Irva Hertz - Picciotto , an epidemiology professor at University of California , Davis who led the study .
Throughout the nation , the numbers of autistic children have increased dramatically over the past 15 years .
Autistic children have problems communicating and interacting socially ; the symptoms usually are evident by the time the child is a toddler .
More than 3,000 new cases of autism were reported in California in 2006 , compared with 205 in 1990 .
In 1990 , 6.2 of every 10,000 children born in the state were diagnosed with autism by the age of five , compared with 42.5 in 10,000 born in 2001 , according to the study , published in the journal Epidemiology .
The numbers have continued to rise since then .
To nail down the causes , scientists must unravel a mystery :
What in the environment has changed since the early 1990s that could account for such an enormous rise in the brain disorder ?
For years , many medical officials have suspected that the trend is artificial - due to changes in diagnoses or migration patterns rather than a real rise in the disorder .
But the new study concludes that those factors cannot explain most of the increase in autism .
Hertz - Picciotto and Lora Delwiche of the UC Davis Department of Public Health Sciences analyzed 17 years of state data that tracks developmental disabilities , and used birth records and Census Bureau data to calculate the rate of autism and age of diagnosis .
The results : Migration to the state had no effect .
And changes in how and when doctors diagnose the disorder and when state officials report it can explain less than half of the increase .
Dr. Bernard Weiss , a professor of environmental medicine and pediatrics at the University of Rochester Medical Center who was not involved in the new research , said the autism rate reported in the study " seems astonishing . "
He agreed that environmental causes should be getting more attention .
The California researchers concluded that doctors are diagnosing autism at a younger age because of increased awareness .
But that change is responsible for only about a 24 % increase in children reported to be autistic by the age of five , according to the report .
" A shift toward younger age at diagnosis was clear but not huge , " the report says .
Also , a shift in doctors diagnosing milder cases explains another 56 % increase .
And changes in state reporting of the disorder could account for around a 120 % increase .
Combined , Hertz - Picciotto said those factors " do n't get us close " to the 600 % to 700 % increase in diagnosed cases .
That means the rest is unexplained and likely caused by something that pregnant women or infants are exposed to , or a combination of genetic and environmental factors .
" There 's genetics and there 's environment .
And genetics do n't change in such short periods of time , " Hertz - Picciotto , a researcher at UC Davis ' M.I.N.D. Institute , a leading autism research facility , said in an interview Thursday .
Many researchers have theorized that a pregnant woman 's exposure to chemical pollutants , particularly metals and pesticides , could be altering a developing baby 's brain structure , triggering autism .
Many parent groups believe that childhood vaccines are responsible because they contained thimerosal , a mercury compound used as a preservative .
But thimerosal was removed from most vaccines in 1999 , and autism rates are still rising .
Dozens of chemicals in the environment are neurodevelopmental toxins , which means they alter how the brain grows .
Mercury , polychlorinated biphenyls , lead , brominated flame retardants and pesticides are examples .
While exposure to some - such as PCBs - has declined in recent decades , others - including flame retardants used in furniture and electronics , and pyrethroid insecticides - have increased .
Household products such as antibacterial soaps also could have ingredients that harm the brain by changing immune systems , Hertz - Picciotto said .
In addition , fetuses and infants might be exposed to a fairly new infectious microbe , such as a virus or bacterium , that could be altering the immune system or brain structure .
In the 1970s , autism rates increased due to the rubella virus .
The culprits , Hertz - Picciotto said , could be " in the microbial world and in the chemical world . "
" I do n't think there 's going to be one smoking gun in this autism problem , " she said .
" It 's such a big world out there and we know so little at this point . "
But she added , scientists expect to develop " quite a few leads in a year or so . "
The UC Davis researchers have been studying autistic children 's exposure to flame retardants and pesticides to see if there is a connection .
The results have not yet been published .
" If we 're going to stop the rise in autism in California , we need to keep these studies going and expand them to the extent possible , " Hertz - Picciotto said .
Funding for studying genetic causes of autism is 10 to 20 times higher than funding for environmental causes , she said .
" It 's very off - balance , " she said .
Weiss agreed , saying that " excessive emphasis has been placed on genetics as a cause .
" The advances in molecular genetics have tended to obscure the principle that genes are always acting in and on a particular environment .
This article , I think , will restore some balance to our thinking , " he said .
Some issues related to whether the increase is merely a reporting artifact remain unresolved .
There could be other , unknown issues involving diagnosis and reporting , scientists say .
The surge in autism is similar to the rise in childhood asthma , which has reached epidemic proportions for unexplained reasons .
Medical officials originally thought that , too , might be due to increased reporting of the disease , but now they acknowledge that many more children are asthmatic than in the past .
Experts suspect that environmental pollutants or immune changes could be responsible .
Autism has serious effects , not just on an individual child 's health but on education , health care and the economy .
" Autism incidence in California shows no sign yet of plateauing , " Hertz - Picciotto and Delwiche said in their study .

White analyzed data on 3.5 million subprime and alt - A mortgages in securitization pools overseen by Wells Fargo and found the average loss was 64.7 percent of the original loan balance .
" Here are the numbers : the average loan balance began at almost $ 223,000 .
But in the liquidation sale , the property sold for $ 144,000 less , on average , " Morgenson writes .
That 's got to hurt .
Beyond the mists of time , having witnessed the brutal death of his blacksmith father and the massacre of the entire village by the murderous followers of Thulsa Doom , the undead evil wizard and servant of the serpent - god , Set , Conan , the orphaned young Cimmerian , is condemned to a life of slavery .
Chained to the perpetual
Wheel of Pain , the helpless boy grows into a man , and after years of rigorous training as a fierce gladiator , Conan , now an unstoppable mountain of muscle , regains his precious freedom .
But , with the image of the blood - soaked raid etched on his mind , Conan teams up with Subotai , the Hyrkanian thief , and Valeria , the Queen of the Bandits , and embarks on a peril - laden journey to the mysterious Mountain of Power , and the impregnable Snake Cult Temple .
Will Conan avenge his parents ?

Sorry it 's a little late .
Rita Magil was driving down a Montreal boulevard one sunny morning in 2002 when a car came blasting through a red light straight toward her .
“ I slammed the brakes , but I knew it was too late , ” she says .
“ I thought I was going to die . ”
The oncoming car smashed into hers , pushing her off the road and into a building with large cement pillars in front .
A pillar tore through the car , stopping only about a foot from her face .
She was trapped in the crumpled vehicle , but to her shock , she was still alive .
The accident left Magil with two broken ribs and a broken collarbone .
It also left her with post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and a desperate wish to forget .
Long after her bones healed , Magil was plagued by the memory of the cement barriers looming toward her .
“ I would be doing regular things — cooking something , shopping , whatever — and the image would just come into my mind from nowhere , ” she says .
Her heart would pound ; she would start to sweat and feel jumpy all over .
It felt visceral and real , like something that was happening at that very moment .
Most people who survive accidents or attacks never develop PTSD .
But for some , the event forges a memory that is pathologically potent , erupting into consciousness again and again .
“ PTSD really can be characterized as a disorder of memory , ” says McGill University psychologist Alain Brunet , who studies and treats psychological trauma .
“ It ’s about what you wish to forget and what you cannot forget . ”
This kind of memory is not misty and water­colored .
It is relentless .
More than a year after her accident , Magil saw Brunet ’s ad for an experimental treatment for PTSD , and she volunteered .
She took a low dose of a common blood - pressure drug , propranolol , that reduces activity in the amygdala , a part of the brain that processes emotions .
Then she listened to a taped re-creation of her car accident .
She had relived that day in her mind a thousand times .
The difference this time was that the drug broke the link between her factual memory and her emotional memory .
Propranolol blocks the action of adrenaline , so it prevented her from tensing up and getting anxious .
By having Magil think about the accident while the drug was in her body , Brunet hoped to permanently change how she remembered the crash .
It worked .
She did not forget the accident but was actively able to reshape her memory of the event , stripping away the terror while leaving the facts behind .
Brunet ’s experiment emerges from one of the most exciting and controversial recent findings in neuroscience : that we alter our memories just by remembering them .
Karim Nader of McGill — the scientist who made this discovery — hopes it means that people with PTSD can cure themselves by editing their memories .
Altering remembered thoughts might also liberate people imprisoned by anxiety , obsessive - compulsive disorder , even addiction .
“ There is no such thing as a pharmacological cure in psychiatry , ” Brunet says .
“ But we may be on the verge of changing that . ”
These recent insights into memory are part of a larger about - face in neuroscience research .
Until recently , long - term memories were thought to be physically etched into our brain , permanent and unchanging .
Now it is becoming clear that memories are surprisingly vulnerable and highly dynamic .
In the lab they can be flicked on or dimmed with a simple dose of drugs .
“ For a hundred years , people thought memory was wired into the brain , ” Nader says .
“ Instead , we find it can be rewired — you can add false information to it , make it stronger , make it weaker , and possibly even make it disappear . ”
Nader and Brunet are not the only ones to make this observation .
Other scientists probing different parts of the brain ’s memory machinery are similarly finding that memory is inherently flexible .
Someday this new science of memory could cure PTSD and other mental traumas .
Already it corrodes our trust in what we know and how we know it .
It pokes holes in eyewitness testimony , in memoirs , in our most intimate records of truth .
Every time we remember , it seems , we add new details , shade the facts , prune and tweak .
Without realizing it , we continually rewrite the stories of our lives .
Memory , it turns out , has a surprising amount in common with imagination , conjuring worlds that never existed until they were forged by our minds .
On the Trail of the Memory Meme Neuroscientists have long viewed memory as a kind of neural architecture , a literal physical reshaping of the microstructure of the brain .
In the 19th century , the pioneering neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal theorized that information was processed in our heads each time an electrical impulse traveled across a synapse , the gap between one nerve cell and the next .
Memories were made or altered , he proposed , when structures near the synapse changed .
More than a century later , the textbook description of episodic memory ( conscious knowledge of an event ) is a more sophisticated version of that same basic idea .
Memory formation requires an elaborate chemical choreography of more than a hundred proteins , but the upshot is that sensory information , coded as electrical pulses , zips through neural networks of the brain .
The impulses cause glutamate ( one of the brain ’s main neurotransmitters ) to pop out of one nerve cell and travel across the synapse to activate the next by binding to its receptors , chemically active signaling stations on the cell surface .
Ultimately the electrical and chemical signals reach the centers of memory , the almond - size amyg­dala and the banana - shaped hippocampus , adjacent structures buried on either side of the brain .
Neuroscientists believe that memory forms when neurons in these key brain structures are simultaneously activated by glutamate and an electrical pulse , a result of everyday sensory experience .
The experience triggers a biochemical riot , causing a specialized glutamate receptor , called NMDA , to spring open and allow calcium ions to flood the cells .
The ions stimulate dozens of enzymes that reshape the cells by opening up additional receptors and by prompting the formation of more synapses and new protrusions that contain still more receptors and synapses .
In aggregate , these changes make neurons more sensitive to each other and put the anatomical scaffold of a memory in place .
Enacting all these changes takes time , and for up to a few hours the memory is like wet concrete — solidifying but not quite set , still open to interference .
Once the process is over , though , the memory is said to be “ consolidated . ”
In the textbook description , neuroscientists talk of memory the way geoscientists describe mountains — built through a dynamic process , but once established almost impossible to reshape quickly except by extraordinary means .
By the late 1990s , this explanation of memory was so widely accepted by neuroscientists that its major author , Columbia University neuroscientist Eric Kandel , was awarded the Nobel Prize .
It seemed that the most important questions about memory had been answered .
No wonder , then , that Nader — at the time a young postdoc studying the neurobiology of fear at New York University — was electrified when he attended one of Kandel ’s lectures .
“ It was so beautiful and so convincing , ” Nader says .
But he began to wonder :
What actually happens when we recall the past ?
Does the very act of remembering undo what happened ?
Does a memory have to go through the consolidation process again ?
Nader asked his adviser , the noted fear researcher Joseph LeDoux , if he could study these questions .
LeDoux says his initial response was “ Do n’t waste our time and money , ” but Nader talked him into it , little suspecting just how far this line of research would go .
Y’know , the attitude of a comic book store employee can really impact the future profitability of the shop .
I ’m of the belief that going to the comic book store is a fairly unique experience .
It ’s a pilgrimage us hardcore comic geeks make once a week or so .
Most of us have some sort of pull / hold / reserve list at our local comic shop , so not only do they have the new comics we ’re looking for , they ’re already stashed behind the counter specifically for us .
That ’s a pretty cool specialized service you do n’t find outside the comic book industry .
In addition to our weekly haul , many of us are looking for some sort of camaraderie with the employees behind the counter .
Many are looking for a friendly face , others a shared interest in certain titles , or some want to debate who ’s stronger – Hulk or Superman .
The important thing to realize is that your comic book store is n’t selling anything different from the comic shop down the street .
The one thing that can make a comic shop stand out is the relationship they develop with their customers .
We ’re talking about customer service here .
A comic book store known for poor customer service is doomed to failure .
This is where the employees play a vital role in the continued profitability of a shop .
I ’ve been out of town a couple times within the past few weeks .
Whenever in a different city , I like to visit new comic shops .
I like to look for rare items , or perhaps a different display will attract my attention to something I ’ve previously skipped over , or maybe I ’ll get caught up in an interesting conversation / debate .
Regardless the reason , I always look forward to checking out new and different shops .
Recently I visited a comic book store in Savannah , Georgia and another in Jacksonville , Florida .
Sadly in both cases the employees were more interested in chatting with their friends than making an effort to engage the customers .
It was really disappointing .
Both stores had just one employee working , and each were so involved in their discussions they barely glanced up to look as I walked in .
Neither said “ Hello ” or “ May I help you ” until I ’d already been in the store almost a full ten minutes .
If the store had been busy , I might have been more forgiving , but in each case there were almost no other customers there .
When I finally approached the counter to make a purchase , I received the warmth you might expect from an apathetic cashier at the grocery store .
Needless to say , my overall experience at those stores was underwhelming .
Therefore , when I ’m in those cities next , I wo n’t bother stopping by again .
There it is … the lack of customer service from the employee just cost them potential future profits .
It seems to me that too many comic shops hire fanboys as their employees .
While that ’s fine in concept , I ’d say you need someone that is half - fanboy , half - salesperson .
In the interest of full disclosure , I managed a comic book store for four years , so I ’m biased and a harsh critic .
With that said , here are some tips I ’d recommend to any comic shop owner :
You need outgoing employees that are willing to greet the customer as they come in .
A simple , “ Hello ” will do .
Or think about the welcome you get when you walk into the burrito place , “ Moe ’s ” .
Or would n’t it be great if the comic shop employee made you feel like Norm from Cheers ?
Your employees need to understand that every person that walks through the door is a potential lifelong customer .
As we mentioned , comic shops have the unique feature of pull / hold / reserve lists and customers that return each week for them .
Therefore , anyone who comes in could potentially be your next regular customer .
You need someone that is going to chat with the customer .
They need to make an effort to connect with the shoppers .
A good salesperson can find some common ground to talk about , whether it is a title , a character , a writer / artist , comic - related movies , or simply the love for the medium .
The better the connection , the more likely that customer is to return .
If you ’re really lucky , you ’ll hire someone that goes the extra mile and learns the names of the regular customers .
Since customer service is really the only thing that separates you from the comic shop up the road , calling someone by their name can go a long way .
Okay , I ’m done ranting .
I ’m just passionate about comic book stores and I can’t stand poor customer service .
For the record , I still shop at the same comic book store I worked at 15 years ago .
Ned and Lindsey do a great job at the Cosmic Cat ( a.k.a. Mail Me My Comics.com ) making the customers feel welcome .
Next time you go into your local comic book store , see how you are being treated .
You might realize how much they value you , or that they simply do n’t care .
The Retail Revolution
How Wal - Mart Created a
Brave New World of Business
Nelson Lichtenstein

--
Bentonville , Ark. , may be unknown to most Americans , but it is the center of the world for some 750 corporations that manufacture consumer goods -- because Bentonville is the legendary home office of Wal - Mart , and those corporations want to sell their products to the world ’s largest retailer .
It ’s also the largest private employer in the nation , operator of 4,200 stores .
Bentonville is a key to understanding the success of Wal - Mart , historian Nelson Lichtenstein argues in his terrific book , “ The Retail Revolution : How Wal - Mart Created a Brave New World of Business . ”
Legendary founder Sam Walton did n’t start in Bentonville , in the Ozarks in northwestern Arkansas .
The first store he ran in the late 1940s was in Newport , Ark. , in the Black Belt along the Mississippi where chain stores like Woolworth ’s soon became the target of sit-ins and business boycotts organized by the nascent civil rights movement .
Advertisement
But when Walton lost his lease on his first store in 1950 in the Delta he decided to relocate to the Ozarks , far from the social conflicts of the midcentury South .
He was able to develop his business in a remote , isolated area .
“ The Ozarks were not just rural and poor , ” Lichtenstein writes .
“ They have long been uniquely homogeneous , among the most exclusively white regions in the nation . ”
One of Lichtenstein ’s most original contributions is his argument that Wal - Mart created its own corporate subculture rooted in this region .
Sam Walton said Wal - Mart workers were “ a family , ” and Lichtenstein writes that the company would create “ a self - contained corporate culture , an ideology of family , faith , and folk communalism that to this day co-exists in a strange harmony with a Dickensian world of low wages , job insecurity , and pervasive corporate surveillance ” -- a culture where the female workforce was , in Lichtenstein ’s words , “ cheap and grateful . ”
If Wal - Mart ’s success depended first on this Bentonville subculture , it was also based on the creation of an advanced global system for manufacturing cheap goods and a pioneering bar - code - based computerized shipping network that got the goods to the stores in record time .
Lichtenstein ’s sympathies lie with the workers Walton called “ associates . ”
They are recruited by the hundreds of thousands from the ranks of the retired , those willing to work part - time , and people who want a second job .
Their wages are so low that a startling proportion of Wal - Mart associates are also welfare recipients .
According to a 2004 UC Berkeley study , “ Wal - Mart wages -- about 31 percent below those in large retail establishments as a whole -- made it necessary for tens of thousands of company employees to rely on public ‘ safety net ’ programs , such as food stamps , Medicare . . . and subsidized housing , to make ends meet . ”
Managers , Lichtenstein adds , “ even pointed struggling associates to the appropriate government agency where they could apply ” for assistance .

And because Wal - Mart runs 24 hours a day , lots of people have to work in the middle of the night or suffer through chaotic shift schedules .
An associate ’s work life can often revolve around trying to get a decent schedule , one with steady daytime hours .
The low wages and scheduling problems create massive turnover .
But Wal - Mart , Lichtenstein reports , has concluded that hiring and training a steady stream of new associates is cheaper than keeping the ones they have by paying decent wages and opening careers to promotion and advancement .
As Lichtenstein writes : “ Michael Bergdahl , who worked in the home office as head of the Wal - Mart People Division during the last years of Sam Walton ’s life , let the cat out of the bag in his 2004 memoir - advice book ‘ What I Learned From Sam Walton . ’
‘ It ’s hard to believe , but turnover drops millions of dollars to the bottom line in cost savings for the company .
When an experienced associate leaves the company he or she is replaced by an entry - level associate at a lower wage .
Turnover of associates , for this reason , actually appears , from an expense standpoint , to be a competitive advantage . ’ ”
Wal - Mart managers , Lichtenstein writes , know their success “ depended on keeping trade unions at bay . ”
The home office in Bentonville goes wild when workers anywhere get interested in a union .
One of Lichtenstein ’s most striking stories centers on nine meat cutters in small - town Texas who voted to join a union .
The company responded by ceasing all meat - cutting at its supercenters in a number of states and selling only prepackaged meat .
The Wal - Mart work force does have what Lichtenstein calls “ a labor aristocracy ” : the 8,000 truck drivers .
Their work was too important to be outsourced -- Wal - Mart requires total control over shipping from its distribution centers to guarantee on - time delivery to stores .
So the drivers get high wages and good working conditions .
Since the early 1980s , drivers have not been “ required to help load and unload their shipments .
Their uniforms were now always clean ; their equipment was the best in the business . ”

But the associates , Lichtenstein emphasizes , are not the lowest workers at Wal - Mart .
At the bottom are the janitors who clean the stores overnight .
Over the years , many worked for independent subcontractors , and many were undocumented immigrants exploited ruthlessly because of their illegal status .
Wal - Mart locked in the janitors , and other workers , overnight -- the company said to protect them from robbers , though many store managers contend that it was to discourage theft by those very workers -- so that even if they got sick or had a family emergency , they could n’t get out of the store except by an alarmed fire door ( and they could face dismissal if there was no fire ) , until the manager arrived in the morning .
That led to bad publicity , and changes .
Across the Pacific are the real proletarians of Wal - Mart : the hundreds of thousands of young single women who work in the factories in southern China that make the toys , sneakers , clothing , electronics that fill the shelves in the U.S.
They come from poverty - stricken villages far away ; Lichtenstein describes the crowded dorms where they live , their extremely long work weeks , and the policies that send them back home to their villages if they get sick or pregnant .
Lichtenstein is a historian , and he does a beautiful job of putting Wal - Mart in its historical context .
The glory days of Wal - Mart were the Reagan - Clinton - Bush years , the years of unions in retreat , global free trade , lax enforcement of labor laws , and , for most Americans , stagnating wages that led them to seek cheap consumer goods .
Advertisement
But that era has finally come to an end , and with Barack Obama in the White House , Lichtenstein argues .
Wal - Mart faces “ a day of reckoning ” :
The Democrats will raise the minimum wage , encourage unionization , rigorously enforce laws governing wages and hours , and require employers to pay some of the health insurance costs of their workers .
And as Lichtenstein points out , there is an anti-Wal - Mart out there : Costco .
It pays veteran workers a lot more than equally experienced workers at Wal - Mart : $ 5 an hour more .
It provides almost all of its workers with a good health insurance plan .
Costco has a different lineage -- in contrast to Sam Walton , Costco “ owes its character to Sol Price , the Jewish , New Deal Democrat whose social and cultural values were those of Depression - era New York . ”
And while Wal - Mart has been stagnating for the last several years , Costco has been booming -- it ’s now the fourth - largest retailer in America .
Thus Lichtenstein has written a definitive account not only of Wal - Mart ’s past but also of the forces shaping its future .
A 23 - year - old Sussex woman 's cunning plan to smuggle cocaine into the UK concealed in the shafts of golf clubs fell apart , when she mistook suspicious customs officials ' quizzing about her handicap for a request for information as to whether or not she was disabled .
According to the Sun , Kayti Ella Dryer from Lewes jetted in to Manchester Airport from Jamaica 's Montego Bay on 3 April .
Despite her claims she 'd been on a golfing holiday , she failed to recognise the terms " birdie " and " fairway " .
Mike O'Grady of HM Revenue and Customs said : " When Dryer was asked questions about golf , it was clear that she was totally unfamiliar with the game and she had no legitimate reason for travelling with the sports equipment . "
An airport source elaborated : " When asked about her handicap , she looked blank and asked them to repeat the question .
It appeared as if she thought they were asking her if she had a disability . "
Customs operatives found a kilo of Bolivian marching powder - estimated value £ 83 k - inside Dryer 's golf clubs .
She pleaded guilty to attempted drug smuggling , and was jailed for four years at Manchester Crown Court last Thursday . ®
Richard Poncher ’s eternal sleep will soon be disrupted .
The onetime Beverly Hills resident , who died 23 years ago at the age of 81 , will be moving out of the crypt above Marilyn Monroe ’s resting spot at the Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park cemetery .
Poncher ’s wife intends to sell the crypt , said to have once been owned by Monroe ’s former husband , Yankee great Joe DiMaggio .
So although the plaque on Poncher ’s crypt reads : “ To the man who gave us everything and more , ” his wife , Elsie , is hoping that he has just a little more to give .
She wants to use the money to help pay off the $ 1.6 - million mortgage on her 1 3/4 acre Beverly Hills home .
“ I ca n’t be more honest than that , ” she said .
“ I want to leave it free and clear for my kids . ”
Advertisement
Elsie Poncher plans to start the bidding at $ 500,000 when she places the crypt on EBay , making it -- on a per-square - foot basis -- one of the most expensive pieces of real estate on the market .
Richard Poncher was a serial entrepreneur , to hear his wife tell it , who made a fortune with a variety of electronics firms and once sold surplus U.S. Army airplanes and parts .
She claims that he built two bulletproof cars for Al Capone and owned 12 Rolls - Royces in his lifetime .
“ He was n’t afraid to tackle anything , ” Elsie said .
“ Besides that , he was a helluva nice guy . ”
She said they lived a colorful , outsized life after meeting in Chicago and moving West .
“ He knew all the gangsters , ” Elsie said .
Advertisement
They ate at the legendary Los Angeles restaurants that catered to Hollywood -- the Brown Derby , Chasen ’s and Perino’s .
They owned an apartment at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong .
The house where Poncher ’s widow still lives is something of a museum , with a Picasso drawing tucked away in a back hall and signed prints by him and Chagall on the living room wall .
When she brings out a photo of her husband dressed in a conservative black suit and her wearing a saucer - sized pendant with rubies and diamonds , she tells a story of how it came from a deal her husband did with a relative of King Farouk of Egypt .
Elsie said her husband bought the crypt from DiMaggio during his 1954 divorce from Monroe .
She does n’t remember Poncher being particularly enamored of Monroe .
The actress did n’t commit suicide until 1962 , so Poncher had no idea what an icon she would become in death or that she ’d someday be entombed at the Westwood cemetery .
Elsie is n’t sure how her husband knew DiMaggio .
Advertisement
“ He knew a lot of people , ” she said with a wave of her hand .
The couple were at the Regency Hotel in New York talking to DiMaggio , she said , when the retired ballplayer asked , “ You want to buy two crypts ? ”
“ Who the hell wants two crypts ? ” her husband replied .
He must have had a change of mind , because he bought them , one for him and one for his wife .
Advertisement
Elsie , wearing gray sweats and with long pink fingernails , admits to being in her 70s but is quick to add , “ I do 20 laps in the pool every day . ”
She said that when she sells the crypt , she ’ll put her husband ’s remains in the one reserved for her , and when her time comes , she ’ll be cremated .
This will be the second time that Poncher ’s long sleep has been disturbed .
When he was dying , Elsie said , her husband approached her with a request .
“ He said , ‘ If I croak , if you do n’t put me upside down over Marilyn , I ’ll haunt you the rest of my life . ’ ”
Right after the funeral , Elsie said , she told the funeral director of her husband ’s wish .
“ I was standing right there , and he turned him over , ” she said .

The cemetery , which is hidden away off Glendon Avenue , is the final resting spot for many celebrities , among them Natalie Wood , Dean Martin , Rodney Dangerfield , Merv Griffin , Mel Torme , Truman Capote and -- most recently -- Farrah Fawcett .
Monroe , though , is the most popular .
Admirers leave roses and lipstick marks on the crypt , marked with a simple plaque , “ Marilyn Monroe 1926 - 1962 . ”
For several decades , DiMaggio had a dozen roses delivered regularly to the crypt .
Jolene Mason , general manager of the cemetery , said there still is one empty crypt in the Corridor of Memories Mausoleum where Monroe and Poncher are buried .
It is located two spots above the actress and to the left .
It can be yours for $ 250,000 .
Playboy ’s Hugh Hefner bought the crypt next to the actress in 1992 for $ 75,000 .
He said he has many friends buried there , and living close by , it ’s almost the neighborhood cemetery .

“ I ’m a believer in things symbolic , ” he said .
“ Spending eternity next to Marilyn is too sweet to pass up . ”

Puppies , kittens , infants : All adorable .
And do you know why ?
Because they 're tiny .
If you start to magnify these things , then you wind up with the substantially less cute wolves , jaguars and teenagers .
Yes , if there 's one thing nature teaches us , it 's that what may start out as an adorable little animal friend can quickly turn into a Lovecraftian horror when its itty - bitty wittle mouth gets big enough to start eating your face .
And when the little versions are already a little bit creepy , the big versions are the stuff nightmares are made of : Advertisement
7 Snails Continue Reading Below Advertisement Snails are like minuscule old - timey hobos ; the charming kind you see in silent movies with little red bags on sticks -- not the kind that pee in your hand when you fall asleep on the subway .
They carry their homes on their backs , pose no threat to anybody and generally stay out of sight from polite society .
Occasionally , you might see one that 's an inch or more and think , " Christ , that thing is fucking huge ! "
But , as we told your mom when she exclaimed that very same thing last night : " You ai n't seen nothin ' yet . "
The Horror , Oh God the Horror : The Giant African Land Snail is one of the rare things that both science and religion can agree should not exist :
They can be up to 14 - inches long , are simultaneously male and female and can survive up to three years sealed in their shell .
And , as you can see from the above picture , they are aggressively not cute .

While tiny humans lose their cuteness gradually after reaching puberty , it 's actually quite easy to identify the precise moment a snail stops being cute :
When its sickly green snail labia drape over your outstretched fingers like the genitals of an old whore stationed too long outside an army base .
Holy Shit !
Is it Dangerous ?
Yes , sort of .
They 're highly invasive and can utterly destroy a local ecosystem .
In fact , they were introduced on purpose to several islands in Indonesia during WWII in an attempt to cheaply produce food for U.S. troops .
This ingenious plan ultimately failed when U.S. troops , after suffering the countless hardships of war , were less than eager to go down on a snail the size of their face for dinner .

( Newser ) – A 48 - year - old Thai elephant who stepped on a landmine 10 years ago got fitted for permanent artificial leg today , the AP reports .
Motola , who 's become a cause celebré for the plight of elephants worldwide , got measured for the new limb at an elephant hospital in Thailand .
Until now she ’s been walking on a temporary canvas leg .
" I do hope she will accept the new leg , " said an official with an advocacy group .
" It would be wonderful to see Motola and Baby Mosha walking together side - by - side . "
Mosha is a 3 - year - old at the same hospital who became the first elephant to get a prosthetic leg 2 years ago .
She stepped on a landmine while just 7 months old .
Thailand 's borders with Cambodia and Burma are rife with the unexploded mines .

The relationship between faith and science in the United States seems , at least on the surface , to be paradoxical .
Surveys repeatedly show that most Americans respect science and the benefits it brings to society , such as new technologies and medical treatments .
And yet , religious convictions limit many Americans ’ willingness to accept controversial scientific theories as well as certain types of scientific research , such as the potential use of embryonic stem cells for medical treatments .
Science and religion have traditionally , and often incorrectly , been viewed as enemies .
This perception has been fueled in part by a number of famous episodes in history that have pitted scientists , like Galileo and Darwin , against the prevailing religious establishments of their time .
But more often than not , scientists and people of faith have operated not at cross purposes but simply at different purposes .
Today the situation is much the same .
Certainly , there are modern scientists who are actively hostile to religious belief .
British biologist Richard Dawkins , for instance , in his best - selling book , The God Delusion , argues that many social ills – from bigotry to ignorance – can be blamed , at least in part , on religion .
In addition , a significant number of scientists – roughly a third according to a 2006 Rice University survey of more than 750 professors in the natural sciences – do not believe in God , compared with only one - in - twenty in the general population .
But regardless of their personal views , most scientists tend to view the two disciplines as distinct , with each attempting to answer different kinds of questions using different methods .
The late evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould famously referred to this complementary relationship as “ non-overlapping magisteria . ”
But there are times when the “ magisteria ” do overlap .
The debate over the origins and development of life is the most compelling example of this .
All but a small number of scientists regard Darwin ’s theory of evolution through natural selection as an established fact .
And yet , a substantial majority of Americans , many of whom are deeply religious , reject the notion that life evolved through natural forces alone .
Indeed , according to a 2006 survey from the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life and the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , 42 % of Americans reject the notion that life on earth evolved and believe instead that humans and other living things have always existed in their present form .
Among white evangelical Protestants – many of whom regard the Bible as the inerrant word of God – 65 % hold this view .
Moreover , in the same poll , 21 % of those surveyed say that although life has evolved , these changes were guided by a supreme being .
Only a minority , about a quarter ( 26 % ) of respondents , say that they accept evolution through natural processes or natural selection alone .
Interestingly , many of those who reject natural selection recognize that scientists themselves fully accept Darwin ’s theory .
In the same 2006 Pew poll , nearly two - thirds of adults ( 62 % ) say that they believe that scientists agree on the validity of evolution .
Moreover , Americans , including religious Americans , hold science and scientists in very high regard .
A 2006 survey conducted by Virginia Commonwealth University found that most people ( 87 % ) think that scientific developments make society better .
Among those who describe themselves as being very religious , the same number – 87 % – share that opinion .
So what is at work here ?
How can Americans say that they respect science and even know what scientists believe and yet still disagree with the scientific community on some fundamental questions ?
The answer is that much of the general public simply chooses not to believe the scientific theories and discoveries that seem to contradict long - held religious or other important beliefs .
When asked what they would do if scientists were to disprove a particular religious belief , nearly two - thirds ( 64 % ) of people say they would continue to hold to what their religion teaches rather than accept the contrary scientific finding , according to the results of an October 2006
Time magazine poll .
Indeed , in a May 2007 Gallup poll , only 14 % of those who say they do not believe in evolution cite lack of evidence as the main reason underpinning their views ; more people cite their belief in Jesus ( 19 % ) , God ( 16 % ) or religion generally ( 16 % ) as their reason for rejecting Darwin ’s theory .
This reliance on religious faith may help explain why so many people do not see science as a direct threat to religion .
Only 28 % of respondents in the same Time poll say that scientific advancements threaten their religious beliefs .
These poll results also show that more than four - fifths of respondents ( 81 % ) say that “ recent discoveries and advances ” in science have not significantly impacted their religious views .
In fact , 14 % say that these discoveries have actually made them more religious .
Only 4 % say that science has made them less religious .
These data once again show that , in the minds of most people in the United States , there is no real clash between science and religion .
And when the two realms offer seemingly contradictory explanations ( as in the case of evolution ) , religious people , who make up a majority of Americans , may rely primarily upon their faith for answers .
The Federal Appeal Court upheld a ruling Friday that ordered the Canadian government to press for the return of Omar Khadr from a U.S. military detention centre in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
In this photo of a sketch by courtroom artist Janet Hamlin , reviewed by the U.S. military , Canadian Omar Khadr sits during a U.S. military tribunal hearing in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in January .
( ( Janet Hamlin / Pool / Associated Press ) )
In a 2 - 1 judgment , the Appeal Court found that Khadr ’s rights under Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms — the rights to life , liberty and security of person — had been breached when Canadian officials interviewed him at the prison at Guantanamo Bay and shared the resulting information with U.S. authorities .
In April , Federal Court Judge James O'Reilly ruled in favour of Khadr 's charter challenge of the Canadian government 's decision not to request his repatriation from Guantanamo Bay .
The federal government had appealed O'Reilly 's decision and has long maintained that because of the seriousness of the charges , Khadr should face military proceedings in the United States .
Noting that the Appeal Court 's ruling was a split decision , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said that he would n’t comment until the Department of Justice had examined the decision .
But the Appeal Court agreed with O’Reilly that Canada had an obligation to take steps to " protect Khadr from further abuse " and that by refusing to request his repatriation , his charter rights were also violated .
The Appeal Court also rejected the Crown ’s argument that O'Reilly 's ruling was a serious intrusion into the conduct of Canada ’s foreign affairs .
" In the unusual circumstances of this case , it was reasonable for [ the judge ] to conclude that being ordered to make such a request of a close ally is a relatively small intrusion into the conduct of international relations , " the Appeal Court wrote .
The Appeal Court also dismissed the claim that there is little chance the U.S. will abide by the repatriation request , since the U.S has complied with similar requests from other Western countries .
" The fact that Canada has no control over the response of the United States does not mean that it is inappropriate to order the request to be made , " the Appeal Court wrote .
" In the circumstances of this case , making the request is the most appropriate remedy Canada can offer . "
Dissent
But in a dissenting opinion , Justice Marc Nadon wrote that he believed O'Reilly erred in a number of his decisions .
Nadon said O'Reilly 's ruling was a " direct interference into Canada ’s conduct of its foreign affairs . "
" It is clear that Canada has decided not to seek Mr. Khadr ’s repatriation at the present time .
Why Canada has taken that position is , in my respectful view , not for us to criticize or inquire into , " Nadon wrote .
" Whether Canada should seek Mr. Khadr ’s repatriation at the present is a matter best left to the executive . "
Nadon also wrote that Canada had used " all necessary means at its disposal " to protect Khadr and that the only possible steps for the government were the ones that it took through diplomatic channels .
As for the Khadr interrogations by Canadian officials , Nadon noted that he could not " see the link between the inappropriateness of the interviews and the remedy of repatriation , a remedy which is , in my view , totally disproportionate in the circumstances . "
The Toronto - born Khadr , now 22 , is being held at Guantanamo and is accused of killing a U.S. army soldier with a hand grenade during a gunfight in Afghanistan in 2002 , when Khadr was 15 .
His case remains on hold pending a review of the U.S. military tribunal system by the Obama administration .
In his 43 - page decision , O'Reilly wrote that the federal government 's continued refusal to request his repatriation to Canada " offends a principle of fundamental justice and violates Mr. Khadr 's rights . "
" To mitigate the effect of that violation , Canada must present a request to the United States for Mr. Khadr 's repatriation as soon as practicable , " the judge wrote .
Threatened with rape
Khadr 's lawyers have argued the Canadian government was complicit in the detainee 's alleged torture and mistreatment while in U.S. custody and is obliged under international law to demand his return .
Documents show Khadr's U.S. captors threatened him with rape , kept him isolated and deprived him of sleep .
In 2003 , Canadian Security Intelligence Service officers travelled to Guantanamo to question Khadr and shared the results of their interrogations with the Americans .
The watchdog over CSIS recently found the spy agency ignored concerns about human rights and Khadr 's young age in deciding to interview him .
Nathan Whitling , one of Khadr 's lawyers in Edmonton , said while he welcomed the ruling , he does not expect his client will be released any time soon .
He said Khadr has won cases at the U.S. and Canadian Supreme Courts but so far , it has not done him any good .
" So we 're not uncorking any champagne at this point .
We 're hopeful that this will result in some benefit for Omar .
But that 's just not clear yet . "
Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae said it 's time for Khadr to come back to Canada .
" This is the time when the Canadian government has to take a position on behalf of a Canadian citizen .
It is no longer acceptable for a Canadian citizen to be held in these circumstances . "
The new Google Maps feature Latitude , which debuted six months ago for several smartphones , has arrived for the iPhone .
Well , sort of .
It 's a web application made to work with the handset , rather than a downloadable , native app .
Wired.com covered Latitude in February , but here 's a quick recap of how it works :
Google users have to opt in to use the Latitude feature and invite friends to join .
Then , you and your Latitude - connected buddies can view each other 's locations on a map , denoted by personalized icons .
That way , you can spot buddies nearby and send them a text , e-mail or IM to meet up .
Because Latitude is a web app , iPhone users must access the feature by visiting in their Safari browsers .
From there , they can create a shortcut to the web app on their Home screen by tapping the + icon , then selecting " Add to Home Screen " and " Add . "
The downside of Latitude for iPhone :
It can't run in the background .
So each time you close the Safari app to open your e-mail , for example , you lose connection to the service .
So much for real - time stalking your exes .
Google Latitude .
Now for iPhone .

From the American Bankruptcy Institute : Consumer Bankruptcy Filings Reach Highest Monthly Total Since 2005 Bankruptcy Law Overhaul
U.S. consumer bankruptcy filings reached 126,434 in July , the highest monthly total since the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act was implemented in October 2005 , according to the American Bankruptcy Institute ( ABI ) , relying on data from the National Bankruptcy Research Center ( NBKRC ) .
The July 2009 consumer filing total represented a 34.3 percent increase nationwide from the same period a year ago , and an 8.7 percent increase over the June 2009 consumer filing total of 116,365 .
Chapter 13 filings constituted 28.3 percent of all consumer cases in July , slightly above the June rate .
" Today 's bankruptcy filing number reflects the sustained and growing financial stress on U.S. households , " said ABI Executive Director Samuel J. Gerdano .
" Rising unemployment on top of high pre-existing debt burdens is a formula for higher bankruptcies through the end of this year . "

StarCraft 2 Delayed to 2010 , Battle.net Blamed
In the long battle between Blizzard 's standards and the calendar year , the calendar again came out the loser today with the announcement that the studio's anticipated RTS sequel StarCraft II has been delayed into the first half of 2010 .
Blizzard attributed the delay to needing additional time to produce the new version of Battle . net , its online gaming service .
Though few details are available on the new portal , Activision CEO Bobby Kotick likened it to Xbox Live in its combination of gameplay and social networking features .
" Over the past couple of weeks , it has become clear that it will take longer than expected to prepare the new Battle .
net for the launch of the game , " said Blizzard in a statement .
Added the company : " The upgraded Battle . net is an integral part of the StarCraft II experience and will be an essential part of all of our games moving forward .
This extra development time will be critical to help us realize our vision for the service . "
The shift of StarCraft II does not come as a huge surprise , as some analysts were already predicting the sequel might slip into the next year .
Blizzard had previously stated the StarCraft II beta could last from four to six months , meaning that even if the beta had begun in August , it would have left a very tight window for Blizzard to work in .
While affirming the game was planned for release by the end of 2009 , Blizzard president Mike Morhaime said in May : " But as always , we wo n't release it until it meets our standards and the expectations of our players . "

Hipsters Desperately Seek New Anachronism To Claim As Own
The hipster community , having exhausted most known pre-1999 lexicons and fashions to reinvigorate , now finds itself in a life - or - death struggle as the lack of a new anachronism to latch on to threatens the viability of the entire social structure .
Experts say the staidness of Converse sneakers , fedoras , and pretending to enjoy Pabst Blue Ribbon could sideline the whole hipster community unless a cutting - edge anachronism can be discovered .
" We 've been through the thrift - store phase , the dress - like - grandpa phase , the intentionally scruffy phase ... there 's almost nowhere to go , " said Paula Dumond of Portland , OR .
" It may be too early to bring back the Chicago - cop bushy moustache , for example , so until that look is safely in the past and totally forgotten , we will need something else to buoy the entire community , and there 's nothing hip on the scene now , not even single - gear bicycles , which anyone who 's anyone knows is totally lame .
Again . "
With post - punk 80s music being co-opted by bands like Vampire Weekend and vintage record stores popping up in every neighborhood , even the hipster music community seems to some to be on the verge of imploding by the weight of its own success .
" It 's basically a death sentence to be compared to Echo and the Bunnymen or even Hall and Oates anymore , " said Chicago musician Alex Boor .
" The only way to get anywhere today is to draw comparisons to some unknown Detroit punk band from the early 70s that never released a single record or ever played a show or came into contact with any humans , but even that 's on the way out . "
Boor said that there is n't really a singular genre his band , Boyfriend Boyfriend ( or " Double B " as they call themselves ) , can reference as a main influence and not sound " like complete tools who are totally out of touch with what 's happening now . "
" We recently updated our MySpace page to list ' Organ - Grinder Punk Swing ' under the ' Sounds like ' field , but MySpace is almost as out - of - style as AOL now , " he said , before reconsidering , " Wait , maybe an AOL email address would be totally cool again .
Screw Gmail -- AOL 's where it 's at . "
Many others have refused to give up hope .
That there exists somewhere in the past an item , ostensibly useless to humanity now , that could become a necessary accessory , is only a matter of creativity and originality , says male boutique owner Jim Samson of Seattle , WA .
" It was just the other day when I was cleaning out my grandpa 's closet -- he just died last week -- and came across his old smoking jacket , " said Samson .
" It was just like , ' Eureka ! ' and it occurred to me that by just wearing this smoking jacket in the store -- or maybe I 'll have Vladimir , our designer , make me a new one with a Che Guevara motif embroidered in it -- that I could save the whole hipster community and get kids to start wearing smoking jackets out to bars , even if they do n't smoke . "
Samson did admit that actually smoking does n't really fly anymore , unless smoking Basics or Lucky Strikes , but that maybe a new use for smoking jackets could be found , " kind of like how Dead Kennedys records are more popular as framed wall - art than they are for actually getting played on a turntable , even if it is a vintage model . "
Others are looking even farther into the past to find something that could be a mark of hipness in the present , up to and including the early 1840s .
" Oh , this ?
Not a big deal -- just my evening gown , " said Seattle resident Donna Palmer nonchalantly , gesturing to her lace flounce collar , pointed waist , and long pleated skirt as she shopped at a local organic food market .
" What are you wearing , pants ?
That 's so quaint ! "
Palmer went on to express support for the United States in the Mexican - American War .

Scientists have traced a sudden collapse in plant biodiversity in ancient Greenland , some 200 million years ago , to a relatively small rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide which caused a rise in the Earth ’s temperature .
According to the findings published in the leading journal Science , the current estimated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide which are thought to lead to sudden biodiversity loss may have to be revised downwards .
However , the scientists from University College Dublin , The Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC and Oxford University , have cautioned that their study findings may not have accounted for additional atmospheric gases such as sulphur dioxide which may have emerged from extensive volcanic emissions at the time to also play a role in driving the rise in the Earth ’s temperature .
“ Examining the 200 million year old fossil leaves from East Greenland , we discovered that the ancient biodiversity crash happened at atmospheric greenhouse gas levels of approximately 900 parts per million , ” said Dr Jenny McElwain from the UCD School of Biology and Environmental Science at University College Dublin , Ireland , the lead researcher on the project .
“ If we continue with the current intensive use of fossil fuel energy , some estimates calculate that carbon dioxide levels in the earth ’s atmosphere will reach 900 parts per million by the year 2100 .
This is exactly the same levels at which our study identified the mass biodiversity collapse in ancient Greenland . ”
But according to Dr McElwain , this is a worst case scenario .
“ Clearly , our study on ancient ecosystems shows that we must take heed of the early warning signs of deterioration within modern ecosystems , as we have seen from the past that very high levels of species extinctions - as high as 80 % - can take place very suddenly although preceded by long intervals of ecological change , ” she explains .
Using a new technique developed by Professor Peter Wagner at The Smithsonian Institute , the team of international scientists were able to detect very early signs at which plant diversity in ancient ecosystems were in a state of steady decline before they went extinct .
The new method reveals the early warning signs that an ecosystem is in trouble in terms of extinction risk .
“ The differences in species abundances for the first 20 meters of the cliffs from which the fossils were collected , are of the sort you expect given imperfect sampling of the same ecosystem , ” said Professor Wagner .
“ But the final 10 meters show dramatic loses of diversity that far exceed what can be attributed to sampling error : the ecosystems were supporting fewer and fewer species . ”
" Earth 's deep time climate history reveals startling discoveries that shake the foundations of our knowledge and understanding of climate change in modern times , " said H. Richard Lane , program director in the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) 's Division of Earth Sciences , which partially funded the research .

PayPal has generated its fair share of controversies over the years , but it has begun to stir up another one by adding new transaction fees that affect all customers — without telling anyone about them .
The company slipped the fees in with a more general update to its " send money " service in June , but because the changes were so well hidden , the Internet has been slow to wake up to what amounts to a good increase in PayPal 's income .
Under the previous system , fees were charged based on the type of account the receiver was using as well as where the money was coming from .
If the receiver was a premium or business account owner , he or she was charged 30 � plus 2.9 percent of the transaction — the same applied to all accounts if the money was coming from a credit or debit card instead of a PayPal balance or directly from a bank account .
People using personal accounts could make all these payments to anyone else for free .
In June , PayPal made a number of changes to its User Agreement and posted an update to the PayPal Blog .
At that time , director of product marketing Heinz Waelchli wrote that PayPal had now begun allowing those with business and premium accounts to make personal transfers to friends and family for free .
This , in itself , is a welcome update — I use my PayPal account to receive payments for items I sell on Etsy , but now I can send money to my brother from the same account without either of us having to give PayPal a cut .
What PayPal failed to do was inform users of the fact that any transfer having to do with goods or services will be charged the 3� + 2.9 percent fee no matter who or where it 's coming from .
This includes payments sent from personal accounts as well as payments made after someone has sent you a request for payment ( even if that request has nothing to do with goods or services ) .
For example , a personal account sending another personal account money for a one - time payment for , say , mowing your lawn was not previously charged any fees on either side , but is now charged the usual transaction fee ( the sender gets to decide who pays ) .
The only way to avoid this is by selecting " gift " when making the transfer — something you can't do if you 're following through on a purchase or invoice from someone .
And , if you fall into this category ( which many people do ) , it 's likely that you had no idea about the changes until just now .
On the one hand , PayPal insists that it made the changes clear to customers via e-mail and a " formal notice " ( aka legalese buried deep within the bowels of paypal.com and behind the login wall ) , but it only takes a bit of digging around to discover that this issue was obviously not clearly communicated at all .
When pressed for a reason for being so quiet about the changes , PayPal PR manager Charlotte Hill told PC World , " We did n't want to make a huge formal communication out of this pricing change , because we were n't really adding any fees , and we were hoping it would be a more useful experience for people . "
Well , it appears as if the lack of a " huge formal communication " has now begun to anger users , as it comes off as a shady way to hide the addition of fees to mass numbers of transactions .
Sure , users would have been irritated either way , but does n't PayPal know that the way to handle bad PR is to be the first one to control the message ?
People value openness and transparency — especially when bad news is involved .
Now , those controlling the message are other , ticked off users , and that wo n't be an easy one to clean up after .
Update :
We spoke to PayPal spokesperson Anuj Nayar who explained that the fees were basically shifted from account types ( business versus personal ) to payment types ( personal transfers versus goods and services ) .

Stem cells can be programmed to become many kinds of tissue
It is hoped the newly - created cells will eventually help scientists find new treatments for diseases such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer's .
BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh said the cells should help researchers test the effectiveness of new drugs .
Stem cells are " master " cells that can become many kinds of tissue .
Nerve stem cells are those which help build the brain and central nervous system .
STEM CELL MILESTONES
1960s : Research begins on stem cells taken from adult tissue 1968 : Adult stem cells used to treat immunodeficient patient 1998 : US scientists grow stem cells from human embryos and germ cells , establishing cell lines still in use today 2001 : Embryonic stem cell turned into a blood cell 2004 : South Korean scientists clone 30 human embryos and develop them over several days 2005 : Korean team develops stem cells tailored to match individual patients
The university 's Dr Steven Pollard said : " This is incredibly exciting in terms of curing disease .
" We may be able to create the disease in a dish .
If we do that , we 'll be able to better understand the disease and also to test drugs . "
Our correspondent said the long - term aim of the Edinburgh research is for cells to be used to build replacement neural tissue for Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's sufferers .
But he said the more immediate use for the artificially - created cells is to test out the effectiveness of new drugs .
Professor Austin Smith , who led the research at the University of Edinburgh , told the BBC : " We 're already talking with the bio-technology and bio- pharmaceutical companies about taking these cells into screening systems for new drugs .
Hopefully that will come to pass within two to three years .
" In terms of the possibility of using the cells for transplantation , that 's a much more difficult and longer term thing and I think there we 're talking more of the five to ten year range . "
However , critics say it is unethical to use human embryos in scientific research .
Previous attempts at creating the nerve cells have produced contaminated samples that have not been scientifically useful .
Robert Meadowcroft , of the Parkinson 's Disease Society , welcomed the news : " The purity of these cells should prove particularly valuable in studying the possibilities for transplantation and replacement of damaged tissue . "
The Alzheimer 's Society echoed this view , saying that the inability to grow nerve cells from human embryonic stem cells had previously been a major obstacle to progress in this area .
The breakthrough comes three months after scientists at Newcastle University announced they had successfully produced a cloned embryo using donated eggs and genetic material from stem cells .
It was the first time a human cloned embryo had been created in Britain .
