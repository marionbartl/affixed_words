This guest post by Erik Townsend really elevates the discussion around the issue of investing in oil and energy given the realities involved in what Peak Oil truly implies politically and economically .
Few in the investing community have really fully internalized the magnitude of the predicament , but Erik has .
If we had a post rating system , this would receive the very highest mark .

Executive Summary
Although there ’s more than 100 years ’ supply of crude oil left in the ground , the resources that are “ cheap and easy ” to extract have for the most part already been discovered .
By 2012 the decline of production output from conventional sources coupled with much higher extraction cost of unconventional sources will lead to peak cheap oil , a phenomenon that will put extreme upward pressure on oil prices .
To a limited extent , a strong case exists for speculation on a moderate increase in petroleum prices .
Those who anticipate extraordinarily high prices ( upwards of $ 300 / bbl ) have failed to consider what George Soros calls reflexivity .
The global economy simply cannot afford such prices , and the rules will be changed before they are reached .
The future is likely to bring price controls , government intervention in the petroleum supply chain , and nationalization of oil resources .
The oil industry will face many unanticipated challenges during this period , capping the price appreciation potential of both commodity and equity plays in the oil industry .
Wise investors will focus on the initial price run-up expected to occur before large - scale government intervention ensues .
Background
If you ’re an investor and you have n’t yet learned about Peak Oil , you need to drop what you ’re doing and go find out all about it .
The implications of Peak Oil are far wider reaching than the energy sector .
Peak
Oil is a macroeconomic story that will dramatically affect virtually all investments in the coming decade .
This article is intended for those already familiar with the Peak Oil prognosis , and focuses on why I think a lot of investors are making faulty predictions about what Peak Oil will mean for future oil prices .
If you ’re not already up to speed on the background material , here are some resources to start with :
The very best basic introduction to the concepts of Peak Oil that I know of is this free video from Dr. Chris Martenson ’s Crash Course .
From there , read Eric Janszen ’s excellent articles on the subject , paying particular attention to the distinction Janszen draws between Peak Oil and Peak Cheap Oil .
Some of Janszen ’s articles are free while others require a subscription to his web site .
Start with this free article to get a taste of Janszen ’s perspective .
I find it very interesting that Peak Oil has recently begun to get a lot more mainstream attention .
Previously , despite overwhelming evidence , Peak Oil was considered a “ fringe idea ” and not taken particularly seriously by the mainstream investment community .
Suddenly the tide seems to have changed .
For example :
Puru Saxena ’s recent interview on CNBC was a milestone in my mind .
Although Mr. Saxena did n’t say anything that came as any great surprise to the Peak Oil - aware community , the fact that this interview was aired on a mainstream financial station tells me we ’re approaching a tipping point of Peak Oil awareness .
The United States military recently released a report predicting “ massive shortages by 2015 ” as a result of a decline in conventional oil production .
This shocking chart from the U.S. DoE says it all :

This chart is n’t from some radical left - wing fringe blog site .
It ’s from the United States Government .
Conspicuously absent is any mention of where these “ Unidentified Projects ” are going to come from .
The deepwater well that was being drilled by the recently - sunk Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico would appear to be off the table , and the ensuing ecological disaster is likely to encumber the viability of similar projects in the future .
If you ’ve done your homework on Peak Oil and Janszen ’s Peak Cheap Oil distinction , you should have come to the following conclusions :
Societal complexity is a function of excess energy availability
Continued global economic growth is possible only if affordable energy is available
Alternative energy sources ( wind , solar , nuclear , geothermal ) will be important .
However , the world ’s existing systems and equipment are highly dependent on oil .
Any plan to eliminate dependency on products derived from crude oil will take decades to implement fully .
The world is n’t running out of oil .
There ’s at least 100 years ’ supply still in the ground
However , the “ cheap and easy to extract ” oil has , for the most part , already been found
Existing “ cheap and easy ” oil resources will or have peaked , and will be in decline by 2012
Declining production from existing resources must be replaced by much more complex and expensive sources , such as deepwater offshore oil fields , tar sands , and oil shale .
Regardless of supply - demand forces that determine end user price , cost of production of crude oil will increase considerably as “ easy oil ” sources are depleted
If these conclusions do n’t yet make sense to you , I encourage you to follow the links above and learn the basics of Peak Oil theory from the suggested sources before proceeding .
Once you have this background information under your belt , you should understand why modern society simply cannot function , and why economic growth on a global scale cannot continue , unless petroleum products are available .
Although alternative energy sources will be very important , the word ’s existing infrastructure ( transportation in particular ) will remain dependent on oil for a very long time .
This leads many speculators to forecasts about the future price of crude oil that I think are flawed for several reasons .
I ’ll first review the argument for extraordinarily high crude oil prices and a super - profitable oil and gas industry , and then I ’ll argue my case for why I believe these scenarios to be improbable if not impossible .
The $ 500 / bbl Crude Oil Argument
I ’ve heard interviews and read articles by a variety of pundits who are forecasting an escalation of crude oil prices in the next five years to $ 300 , $ 400 , or even $ 500 - $ 1000 per barrel accompanied by a wildly profitable oil and gas industry .
These commentators believe oil companies will be able to expand their profit margins with the disappearance of the historical crude oil supply glut that existed before the peak of “ cheap and easy ” oil production .
I disagree with many of their conclusions , but let ’s begin by first understanding their argument .
The world runs on oil and ca n’t easily change
The world literally runs on the products produced from crude oil , including gasoline , diesel fuel , home heating oil , and petrochemicals used to produce most plastics .
This problem has been understood for decades , but little has been done until very recently to seriously explore alternative energy sources .
Recent investments in wind , solar and geothermal energy sources are very important to be sure .
But for many applications , particularly transportation , there ’s just no good alternative to liquid fuels .
There are no battery - powered jet airliners , because the technology to build them simply does n’t exist .
For short - haul applications like passenger cars , there are viable alternatives to gasoline and diesel .
Perhaps the best alternative is natural gas powered vehicles , which are already in limited use .
But natural gas is a product of conventional oil production and it too is subject to the peak cheap oil phenomenon .
The recent discovery of a large natural gas reserve in North America provides some relief , but in the end , natural gas – just like crude oil , will suffer from the peak production curve phenomenon .
For longer - haul applications such as cargo ships , there is no known practical alternative to liquid fuels except for an onboard nuclear reactor , which most people assume will never be viable for anything other than military ships .
Electricity and Hydrogen are not alternative fuels
Electricity and hydrogen are widely misunderstood with regard to their use as “ fuels ” .
In many ways , both of these energy forms will be important .
Electric vehicles are already in limited use and will grow in popularity with the advent of peak cheap oil .
But electricity and hydrogen are not fuel sources .
There are no electricity mines or hydrogen wells .
The electricity or hydrogen must be produced from another energy source .
Most electricity is generated from burning coal , which is also in limited supply .
Hydrogen production requires electricity .
Converting everything to nuclear power generation is a meaningful alternative , but would take decades to implement on a large scale .
Wind and solar are promising , but here again a complete replacement of oil , gas and coal - burning systems with alternative - powered systems would take decades .
Peak cheap oil will be upon us long before significant progress along those lines could be made .
Supply - demand curves from heaven
For the reasons cited above , prognosticators of $ 500 crude oil reason that this is a classic supply and demand problem , where supply destruction is inevitable due to peak cheap oil .
In classical supply - demand analysis , demand destruction normally occurs when prices rise and consumers turn to alternative products , so large price dislocations are therefore relatively rare .
The $ 500 / bbl oil pundits reasonably argue that this is a very special situation : Demand destruction in reaction to rising prices will be limited by the absolutely essential role that transportation plays in the global economy .
You ca n’t have a global economy without airplanes , ships and trucks .
Running trucks on alternative fuel sources is a real challenge , and running ships and airplanes on those sources is not possible with current technology .
The $ 500 crude oil pundits argue that there will be no choice but to pay the going price for liquid fuel products .
As soon as all present sources of crude oil are running at full capacity and new sources involve extraction costs several times higher than the conventional sources , prices are certain to rise dramatically , they argue .
What Peak Oil experts tell us to expect
Most peak cheap oil investment prognostications
I ’ve heard go about the same way : Expect airline transportation to once again be the purview of the rich , and for the masses to rely on slower but more efficient rail and bus transport for long trips .
Expect the prices of imported goods to increase considerably , and therefore assume that the global economy will go back to preferring locally produced products and raw materials .
Everything that requires long - haul transportation will get more expensive , and therefore the globalization trend ( in terms of physical goods ) will reverse .
Urbanization will increase as commuting long distances in private passenger cars becomes cost - prohibitive , and communities that thrived on offering luxury homes an hour ’s drive away from centers of employment will decline .
People will be forced to make due with less , particularly with regard to products imported from afar .
Economies will become more localized , and the United States will be forced to rebuild its manufacturing capacity , as wholesale reliance on imported goods becomes uneconomic .
Some say it already happened
Some commentators believe that we actually saw the beginning of a dramatic peak cheap oil price shock in 2008 , when crude oil prices ran all the way up to $ 147 / bbl .
They dismiss the popular argument that excess speculation by hedge funds caused the run-up , and argue that it was actually the world ’s first taste of a peak cheap oil shock .
They contend that if not for the demand destruction that resulted from the global economic crash that ensued from the U.S. housing and credit bubble collapse , crude prices might have quickly doubled again to $ 300 or more by the end of 2008 .
They tell us that another such a price shock is imminent and will occur as soon as the world economy recovers from the credit crisis .
Common conclusions :
Higher oil prices , more profitable oil companies
The arguments presented above suggest that a dramatic increase in crude oil prices is on the horizon , and some say the sky is the limit .
Some pundits go on to contend that the story gets even better on the equity side of energy investing .
Historically , the supply of crude oil ( from which virtually all liquid fuels are produced ) has been limited only by the intentional actions of organizations like OPEC , which sought to artificially constrain supply in order to boost price .
Relatively cheap and plentiful crude oil led to fierce competition in the downstream business of refining finished products like gasoline and diesel fuel .
The U.S. oil industry has been criticized for over - building high - tech refinery capacity that is more efficient than its low - tech competitors , but not so much as to justify the enormous capital investments that have been made .
As peak cheap oil is realized , higher scarcity and expense of crude oil will mean that refining efficiency has much higher economic value .
Most refineries in the world use a fairly low - tech distillation process to produce gasoline , diesel and other “ distillates ” from crude oil .
Furthermore , they are only set up to process the easiest - to - refine variety of crude oil , which is known as light sweet , referring to its low specific gravity and sulfur content .
Only relatively few high - tech refineries have the ability to process heavy sour crude , which may be the only kind plentifully available in future years .
They also have sophisticated cracking equipment that makes it possible to produce a more favorable ratio of high - value products from a given volume of source product .
Simply put , this means the high - tech refineries in the United States can make more gallons of expensive diesel and gasoline from a single barrel of crude oil than the low - tech refineries elsewhere can .
Taking stock of all this , it might seem like there ’s a sure bet on long - dated , deep out - of - the - money calls on oil futures and the shares of companies that operate the high - tech refineries that are more versatile and efficient in their processes , expecting a windfall as peak cheap oil hits and the world is forced to change its ways .
But before calling your broker , please read on as I describe the reasons I do n’t things are quite so simple .
There will be an opportunity to ride oil futures up from present levels , but not all the way to $ 500 .
Why it ’s really much worse than they think
My primary contention is that the peak cheap oil problem is actually far worse than even most experts have come to realize .
The realization of peak cheap oil will not simply involve a classical economic reaction to a changing supply - demand balance .
Rather , I anticipate a fundamental game changing event that will involve re-writing the rules of the game in ways that are likely to undermine the investment prognostications and strategies that have been outlined in the preceding section .
This is what George Soros calls reflexivity .
The key is not to simply apply the existing rules of the game to anticipated outcomes , but rather to contemplate how expected outcomes will ultimately change the rules of the game .
Oil is even more critical to the economy than most people realize
Most people fail to comprehend the full implications of affordable energy on the world economy .
Gasoline prices are the most visible symptom of the problem , but are far from the most important aspect of peak cheap oil .
The global economy is dependent on cost - effective worldwide transportation of products .
The United States in particular is extremely dependent on inexpensive goods imported from China and other Asian countries .
A sudden dramatic rise in prices of all those goods would cripple an already - struggling economy .
But the problem is much more far - reaching than that .
Many of the things we take for granted would never be possible without abundant and relatively inexpensive energy .
Skyscrapers and other large construction projects would not be economically viable without abundant energy to operate excavators , cranes , and construction tools .
Many areas thought to have been unsuitable for habitation before the advent of modern air conditioning and refrigeration are now major population centers .
Old fashioned supply chains involving warehouses and long - term stores of inventory have been entirely replaced with just - in - time delivery systems that are highly dependent on fast and reliable long - distance transportation .
In the United States particularly , millions of people are dependent on employment 50 or more miles from their homes .
Energy is a component cost of virtually all products .
If energy costs were to increase dramatically , so would the cost of all other items .
In short , the world simply cannot continue to function in the manner we associate with “ modern times ” unless energy continues to be available at affordable prices .
Peak cheap oil will become a national security issue
My advice to investors dreaming of windfall profits from $ 500 / barrel crude oil futures would be this : Pretend it ’s 1940 and you have a magic crystal ball that tells you in advance that the United States will be drawn into World War II .
You might start to speculate that by investing in rubber , airplane parts , materials needed to make bombs , and so forth you ’ll make a killing .
Those products will become so important and so valuable that you might presume you ’ll be able to name your price and demand any amount you like for them .
But of course you ’d have been mistaken .
World War II was n’t a routine macroeconomic event .
It was a game changer .
Laws were re-written , often retroactively .
A state of national emergency was declared and people in possession of materials essential to the war effort were ordered to hand them over as price controls were implemented to thwart profiteering from speculation on the supply needs of the war effort .
I predict that the onset of Peak Cheap Oil will eventually be met with a similar re-write of the rules of the game .
We ’re not just talking about an “ investment theme ” .
We ’re talking about a threat to the viability of the entire global economic system , and we should expect governments to intervene in previously free markets in the name of national security .
I contend that any Peak Cheap Oil investment strategy that fails to consider government intervention scenarios is flawed and likely to underperform .
That ’s not to say that there ’s no money to be made from an early awareness of peak cheap oil .
But it will be a complex puzzle and those with high - level connections in government will have an upper hand over other investors .
Perhaps you think my assertions that governments will eventually intervene in the free market system are far - fetched ?
If so , I ’d encourage you ask yourself this question :
What if governments had actually been planning for years to intervene exactly as I ’ve described ?
Sound preposterous ?
Before you answer , consider this quote from a speech former Vice President Dick Cheney gave to an oil industry group while he was still campaigning for office more than a full decade ago , back in September of 1999 :
“ By some estimates there will be an average of two per cent annual growth in global oil demand over the years ahead along with conservatively a three per cent natural decline in production from existing reserves .
That means by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional fifty million barrels a day .
So where is the oil going to come from ?
Governments and the national oil companies are obviously controlling about ninety per cent of the assets .
Oil remains fundamentally a government business . ” ( Source )
Clearly , Dick Cheney understood the looming threat of peak cheap oil a full decade ago , and he made it resoundingly clear that he considers it the government ’s business to manage the problem .
I strongly disagree with Mr. Cheney ’s politics , but his words should make it crystal clear to investors that the government will involve itself in this matter .
Some believe the entire reason the United States has pursued war with Iraq under dubious pretenses of connections to Al Queda and non-existent WMDs is precisely because Mr. Cheney understands so well just how critical the problem of peak cheap oil will be to the U.S.
I humbly suggest that if invading sovereign nations is on the table , investors should consider what else might be on the table that could derail their peak cheap oil speculation strategies .
“ Curve Balls ” Peak Cheap Oil speculators should anticipate
In my opinion , a peak cheap oil investment thesis must contemplate several potential eventualities .
Let ’s explore but a few of them .
Price Controls
In the short to intermediate term , I share the view that crude oil prices are headed higher .
But not as much higher as many have speculated .
The $ 150 level tested briefly in 2008 put an enormous strain on the economy .
A number of economists believe that the brief oil price shock of early 2008 may have had as much causal effect on the great recession as the subprime housing debacle .
I think another run-up to $ 150 or maybe even $ 200 / bbl is entirely possible in the course of the next two to three years .
But the economy can’t function – and certainly cannot recover from an already deep recession – in the face of $ 300 + crude oil .
For that reason , I expect government intervention of some kind to occur before prices get much above $ 200 / bbl .
I do expect high inflation to be part of our future , so perhaps $ 500 / bbl is possible in nominal terms .
But in 2010 dollars , I do n’t think the economy could ever support prices anywhere near that high .
The fundamentals are certainly in place for an escalation to such levels , but I anticipate government intervention long before such a level is reached .
Price controls have proven over and over again to lead to certain disaster , manifested primarily in the form of shortages and rationing .
Readers old enough to remember waiting hours in line for gasoline from one of the few stations that had any to sell back in the early 1970s know this all too well .
But unfortunately , just as price controls have proven ineffective , governments have proven over and over that they seldom learn from their past mistakes .
I think that an entirely likely scenario would involve a government - dictated fixed price for crude oil imports .
Oil resource nationalizations and war casualty costs
There ’s good reason to assume nations with “ cheap and easy ” oil resources will seek to nationalize them .
The oil industry has a long history of nationalization ( that ’s a euphemism for theft by expropriation of privately owned assets in a given country ) .
International oil companies have invested billions building oil rigs in foreign countries .
In theory , the rights of these private enterprises to operate those assets under pre-agreed terms are protected by signed contracts .
But signed contracts are n’t worth much when your counter - party is the government of the nation in question , which has the ability to pass new laws both voiding your existing contract and having your personnel executed if they resist in any way .
Thus , there are only two real reasons that foreign countries allow oil companies to operate in their nation rather than just expropriating the privately owned rigs .
The first reason is that they need to cultivate an ongoing relationship with the oil companies in order to drill the next well and to build the next rig that will produce revenue for the country .
But when they figure out that the rigs already in place will be the last of their kind because all the conventional oil fields have been exploited , this reason becomes moot .
The second reason is that military force may be used to thwart such expropriations of private property .
That might solve the problem , but it also leads to significant financial loss when the oil rigs themselves are proximal to the fighting or become the targets of sabotage by either side in the conflict .
The whole point here is that the prognostication that oil companies will have an easy ride through the times that are coming is badly flawed .
It may well be true that oil companies with the right senior level connections in government will have their assets and profits protected by military action in reaction to a nationalization attempt by a foreign government .
But by the same token , other oil companies who are less well - connected but are direct competitors of the well - connected just might find that their rig was the one that was “ necessarily sacrificed ” in a military conflict , making the company the target of a distressed takeover by the better - connected competitor .
My conclusion is that there will be both extraordinary profits realized and extraordinary losses suffered by equity investors in oil companies during the peak cheap oil era .
Stock picking takes on a whole new meaning under such circumstances , and so I ’ll leave the equity plays to those better equipped than myself to understand the power game and which companies have the most political capital .
Those with an insider ’s view of the politics and policy decisions involved will make a killing .
Market force vs. Military force
One of the strongest arguments made by Peak Oil speculators is that prices will rise in large part because emerging economies ( particularly China ) are industrializing , radically growing their vehicle fleets , and generally likely to create enormous new demand for decades to come .
On its face , this is a sound and well - reasoned argument and the fundamentals in those countries strongly support this conclusion .
But this argument assumes that oil prices will continue to be set by a free - market supply and demand system .
I think that a dangerous assumption .
I ’m convinced that as Peak Cheap Oil arrives , a series of peak oil price shocks will cripple developed economies , including the United States .
If and when rising energy prices due to peak cheap oil begin to impose a markedly lowered standard of living in the United States , I fear that this will become the justification for further American imperialism .
I can easily envision Dick Cheney returning to politics , campaigning on a “ take the gloves off ” platform , and proposing to simply tell the middle east that their choices are to either sell the United States all the oil it wants for ( say ) $ 85 per barrel , or be annexed by military force .
At present the American public would not support such an imperialistic policy , but sadly , history has shown that any time a developed , comfortable society is faced with the threat of loosing its way of life and standard of living , the rules change and the previously unthinkable becomes acceptable .
The last fellow to use this phenomenon as the center of his political strategy was wildly successful in convincing his people that previously unacceptable things were now somehow “ necessary ” .
His name was Adolph Hitler .
And make no mistake ; peak cheap oil will create an economic challenge for the United States very similar to the one that Germany faced at the time of Hitler ’s rise to power .
Punishing those evil speculators
A recent trend in politics seems to be to scapegoat “ speculators ” for the policy mistakes of government .
When the United States ’ staggering national debt and unfunded liabilities finally bring on the greatest sovereign debt fiasco the world has ever seen , there ’s no doubt in my mind that when treasury bond markets collapse , “ speculators ” will be assigned the blame .
There ’s no reason to assume Peak Cheap Oil will be much different .
Investors should be acutely aware that if they make large windfall profits in a short period of time , there will likely be pressure to claw back or retroactively tax those profits in the name of the common good .
No amount well - reasoned argument that the investor put capital at risk for an extended period in order to eventually reap that reward will even be given due consideration .
As the economy is crashing harder and deeper than it did in 2008 , the government will need a scapegoat and the peak cheap oil speculator is a likely target .
Investors should consider the possibility of profits from speculation on crude oil futures being confiscated .
Forming an Investment Strategy
The “ curve ball ” scenarios discussed above are presented to encourage you to think about a broad array of possibilities .
This is not a complete list and I have no idea whether these particular scenarios will ever come into play .
The point is that peak cheap oil is going to be a big deal for the world – possibly dwarfing the Cold War as the biggest international diplomacy challenge the world has ever seen .
I humbly suggest that viewing the investment opportunity in the narrow context of supply - demand economics is naïve .
Nobody can possibly predict how this will go , but it ’s certain to be a complex potpourri of politics , diplomacy , and economics , not to mention unknown advancements in oil exploration and production technology .
From all this , my conclusion is that the clearest and most opportune speculative investment plays will come early in the cycle .
As “ cheap and easy ” resources go into cumulative decline by 2012 , there will be price escalation and probably dramatic price shocks .
During this period , speculating on crude oil futures seems a ripe opportunity , since government market intervention is relatively less likely in the near term .
I ’m not as comfortable with equity plays on oil companies , because I think they ’re much more susceptible to reality catching up with the presently delusional equity markets .
The biggest potential price shocks will come later , when the realities of Peak Oil ’s implications are fully understood and the world realizes there are few alternatives for new supply creation .
The few alternatives available ( such as tar sands and shale ) involve a relatively low EROEI and very high production costs , so the magnitude of the market reaction could be extreme .
But they ’ll likely be so extreme as to provoke government intervention , price controls , or even nationalization of the entire oil industry as a matter of national security .
I conclude that the key question in forming a speculative investment strategy is ,
At what price level does government intervention become a significant risk ?
I ’m inclined to focus the investment strategy on deriving the maximum possible profit from the rise from present price levels to that figure .
Presumably the number is at least $ 147 , which the market already tolerated once .
But I do n’t think it ’s a whole lot higher than that .
Perhaps $ 200 .
There ’s theoretically a much larger profit to be had beyond that , but I just ca n’t see it happening without governments stepping in and changing the rules .
I ’d rather lever up more profit in the $ 100 – $ 200 price target window using spreads to trade off the potential for even greater profit beyond $ 200 in exchange for more leverage on the rise up to $ 200 .
Finally , I want to emphasize that any long play on crude oil futures – particularly a leveraged one – needs an economic hedge .
Equity markets are presently delusional , pricing in a robust “ economic recovery ” when none really exists .
Everyone is excited about improvements in personal consumption expenditures .
Sadly , very few analysts bother to check the facts and notice that rapidly declining state sales tax receipts strongly refute the commonly accepted “ wisdom ” that consumers are spending again .
Momentum indicators suggest that the false rally in equities has room to go much further , which means that when reality eventually sinks in , the correction will be that much deeper and more abrupt .
America is not presently facing reality with respect to its economic condition .
When America ’s economic reality is eventually recognized , a major equity correction will occur and crude oil prices are certain to correct as well .
What remains to be seen is how far long - dated oil futures correct .
I expect a repeat of 2008 , where near - term contracts collapse but contango blows out as long - dated contracts suffer a relatively smaller correction .
For nearly a year , I had waited to enter my speculative long - term peak cheap oil trade , believing that the buying opportunity would come when economic reality set in .
But the world is slowly waking up to the reality of peak cheap oil , and has been slow to come to terms with America ’s economic reality .
I now spend most of my time designing the optimal peak cheap oil trade – one which immediately gains long exposure to oil futures in what I call the early crisis window , of 2012 - 2014 , while hedging the likely downside risk that oil prices will go way down before they go way up .
That can be accomplished in several ways , including calendar spreads on oil futures and use of an economic hedge such as an equity short to balance long exposure to crude oil futures in the crisis window .

The truth is that the development sector , just like any other business , needs revenue to survive .
Too frequently , this quest for funding uses these kind of dehumanizing images to draw pity , charity , and eventually donations from a largely unsuspecting public .
I found it outrageous that such an incomplete and often inaccurate story was being so widely perpetuated by the organizations on the ground – the very ones with the ability and the responsibility to communicate the realities of rural Africa accurately .
This is not to say that people do not struggle , far from it , but the photos I was seeing only told part of the story .
I thought that these images were robbing people of their dignity , and I felt that the rest of the story should be told as well .
Out of this came the idea for a photography project , which I am tentatively calling “ Perspectives of Poverty ” .
I am taking two photos of the same person ; one photo with the typical symbols of poverty ( dejected look , ripped clothes , etc. ) , and another of this person looking their very finest , to show how an image can be carefully constructed to present the same person in very different ways .
I want to bring to light some of the different assumptions we make about a person , especially when we see an image of “ poverty ” from rural Africa .

I saw a post by Samurai Frog on his blog " Electronic Cerebrectomy " where he listed his 30 favorite Star Wars characters .
You can see his list here : That got me interested in drawing my own top 30 list , so here it is ...

Hi !
I 'm currently a storyboard artist and character designer at Disney TV working on Wander Over Yonder !
I just finished a 6 year run as a story artist at DreamWorks were I boarded on How To Train Your Dragon among other movies .
I 'm an Emmy Award winner for my character designs on " Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends " .
I 've worked as a storyboard artist and character designer at Nickelodeon on Danny Phantom , and a character designer at Disney TV for too many projects to list .
I 've been nominated for 7 Annie Awards and have recently self published my first graphic novel : " Seaweed , and the Cure for Mildew . "
All work is is a copyright of me unless it 's for some studio I 'm working for .
This was great .
We already saw The Young Turks Cenk Uygur take down wingut Wayne Allyn Root .
Now it was conservative blogger S.E. Cupp 's turn .
I 'd love to know what happened at the end of this , but it appears she hung up on Cenk .
Cupp is pushing her new book " Losing Our Religion , The Liberal Media 's Attack on Christianity " .
Here 's a bit from Simon & Shuster 's review and I use the word " review " lightly :
From her galvanizing introduction , you know where S. E. Cupp stands :
She ’s an atheist .
A non-believer .
Which makes her the perfect impartial reporter from the trenches of a culture war dividing America and eroding the Judeo - Christian values on which this country was founded .
Starting at the top , she exposes the unwitting courtship of President Obama and the liberal press , which consistently misreports or downplays Obama ’s clear discomfort with , or blatant disregard for , religious America — from covering up religious imagery in the backdrop of his Georgetown University speech to his absence from events surrounding the National Day of Prayer , to identifying America in his inaugural address as , among other things , " a nation of non-believers . "
She likens the calculated attacks of the liberal media to a class war , a revolution with a singular purpose : to overthrow God and silence Christian America for good .
And she sends out an urgent call for all Americans to push back the leftist propaganda blitz striking on the Internet , radio , television , in films , publishing , and print journalism — or invite the tyrannies of a " mainstream " media set on mocking our beliefs , controlling our decisions , and extinguishing our freedoms .
Now , discover the truth behind the war against Christmas — and how political correctness keeps the faithful under wraps . . . the one - sided analyses of Prop 8 and the gay marriage debate . . . the media pot-shots at Sarah Palin ’s personal faith . . . the politicization of entertainment mainstays such as American Idol and the Miss USA Pageant . . . and much more .
Also included are her penetrating interviews with Dinesh D’Souza , Martha Zoller , James T. Harris , Newt Gingrich , Kevin Madden , and Kevin Williamson of National Review , delivering must - read analyses of the latest stunning lowlights from the liberal media .
Cenk asks Cupp for specific examples of how the media has a liberal bias and she starts out by exaggerating how many people attended the tea party rallies , which Cenk calls her out for .
Cenk disputed her claim that the media is liberal by pointing out that MSNBC fired Phil Donohue for his stance on the Iraq invasion and they would n't allow Jesse Ventura on the air either and her response is to say that the entire country was behind invading Iraq .
When Cenk tells her she 's wrong she tells him that " he was the only one " against invading Iraq .
I guess this numbnut was n't paying much attention to all of those millions of people who were protesting against the war back then .
Jebus what an idiot !
Cenk Uygur , the only person in America against the Iraq war , yeah , that 's the ticket .
Conflating the fact that Bush scared the hell out of the idiotic Democrats and got way too many of them to vote for the invasion after 9 - 11 into there was no public outrage against it is completely ridiculous and revisionist is the kindest thing I can think of to describe that amount of blatant dishonesty .
Then she moves on to complaining about US News and World Report doing a story on Joe Biden getting ashes on Ash Wednesday as an example of media bias against Christians , which makes no sense as Cenk points out .
As an opposing example on how the media covers conservative politicians and their religious views , she complains that anyone in the media dared to point out Sarah Palin 's encounters with a witch doctor which she calls a lie .
Hey S.E.... I hate to break it to you honey , but there 's video on that one out there .
Cenk should have pointed that out to her .
What he did point is the way Obama 's relationship to Reverend Wright was covered .
Of course Cupp thinks that ClusterFox was the only one to cover that story honestly .
He also pointed out is that US News is owned by Mort Zuckerman and that he's a conservative and that it 's ridiculous to think that an organization owned by a conservative would be part of this liberal conspiracy .
Then her last argument that he rips apart is her claim that movie reviewers are biased against Christian movies but movies by atheists are warmly received before anyone even sees them .
When Cenk starts to point out how ridiculous that is , her response is for him to read her book .
He replies " Yeah , I 'll get right on that " and she hangs up .
He follows up by saying that he does n't know of any movie reviewers that write a review of a movie before they watch it and he would have loved for her to give him an example of a single movie reviewer that 's ever done that .
After she 'd hung up , he asked for her to name one person who 's ever done that .
I do n't think you 're ever going to get an answer later Cenk .
I 'm sure she 'll be received much more warmly over on Hannity 's show when Fox starts pushing her book for her .
Digby wrote a really good post on this hack back in January right after Tucker Carlson started his new Daily Caller site which Cupp contributes to .
Check it out for another reason besides this interview to never buy her book .
As Digby said of her first column at The Daily Caller :
It is a perfect example of the snotty , sophomoric humor in which Carlson has long specialized .
This is yet another in a long line of proudly obnoxious , conservative woman with chips on their shoulders the size of Alaska complaining that everyone hates them because they are so incredibly sexy and special .
The main thing you need to know is that she loves God , hates liberals and likes to kill things , which makes her so awesomely cool that only the manliest of manly men will be able to handle her violent , macho , scotch - swilling womanliness .
It wish she'd get this same treatment she got from Cenk every time she goes on the air trying to plug this book of hers .
I 'm sure if it does n't sell the wingnut welfare Republican establishment will be buying it up in mass to make sure it shows up on a best sellers list where it does n't belong .
( Updated as the the Democrats voting for the Iraq war .
As I noted in the comments , not all of them voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 , but enough of them did to help get it passed and the majority of Democrats in the Senate voted for the resolution . )
A Dunkirk - style sea rescue of the thousands of Britons stranded abroad by the volcano ash flight ban was being planned by the Government last night .
Royal
Navy ships may be joined by commandeered civilian vessels to bring home British citizens , who have now been stuck since last Thursday across Europe and around the world .
It is possible that Spain , which is largely unaffected by the giant ash cloud from the Icelandic volcano , allowing aircraft to fly in its air space , may be used as the " hub " of the operation for people who are stranded outside Europe , principally in Africa and North America .
Last night , Gordon Brown was speaking to Jose Luis Zapatero , the Prime Minister of Spain and also the current president of the EU , to discuss the idea .
The giant rescue plan , which has shades of the evacuation of the British Army from the Belgian Channel port of Dunkirk in May 1940 , was drawn up last night at a meeting of senior ministers in Downing Street presided over by Mr Brown .
It was also attended by senior staff from the Met Office and the Government 's chief scientific adviser , Professor John Beddington .
The plan was unveiled at an impromptu press conference outside No 10 afterwards , by the Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , the Foreign Secretary David Miliband , the Transport Secretary Lord Adonis , the Security minister Admiral Lord West and the Cabinet Office minister Tessa Jowell .
" We need to look at every single logistical operation for getting our people home , and that 's what we 're going to do , " Lord Mandelson said .
It was noticeable that Lord Mandelson took on the task of public reassurance , and that Mr Brown himself did not appear – presumably to avoid charges of making political capital out of the situation , in the run-up to the general election .
But the Prime Minister is central to the rescue operation and will preside over a meeting of the " Cobra " civil contingencies committee this morning .
The Government is acting because there is increasing concern that the ash cloud from the volcano Eyjafjallajoekull , which has now drifted over much of Britain and northern Europe and has made flights for aircraft with jet engines hazardous , shows no sign of dispersing .
The volcano is continuing to erupt – although it appeared to have slackened slightly yesterday – and north - westerly winds are bringing the ash directly to Britain from Iceland .
The current weather pattern shows no sign of shifting before mid-week at the earliest .
Last night , the Met Office said it would still not be safe to fly commercial aircraft across most of Europe today .
Restrictions on flights across UK airspace will remain in place until at least 7 pm today , the air traffic control company Nats said last night .
European transport ministers are meeting by video conference later to discuss the situation .
However , there are some suggestions that the restrictions are too stringent and there is a growing call for them to be lifted .
The transport ministers will be considering new data on volcanic ash and aircraft engines gathered over the weekend during test flights run by a number of airlines , including KLM , Lufthansa , Air France and last night , British Airways .
They will look at whether , in the light of the new data , the safety rules which have prevented airlines from operating can be adjusted .
But Lord Adonis said last night that the rules were international and were being applied in exactly the same way in every country across Europe .
Lord Mandelson added : " The Government 's primary concern and commitment is for the safety of air passengers .
You cannot simply take risks or vary rules except on the basis of independent , objective scientific advice . "
In the meantime , thousands of people are facing increasingly stressful circumstances in foreign airports as far away as Beijing .
Mr Miliband said the Foreign Office 's consular officials around the world were making themselves known to stranded passengers at airports and other places , to provide information and help with visa , health and other issues .
All passengers who are stranded and who have an EU carrier have a right to food and accommodation , Lord Adonis said , advising those who had not yet benefited to contact their airline .
The Government was doing all it could to maximise new land transport capacity , he said , with additional trains running between London and Scotland , and on the Eurostar line to Paris and Brussels , with a big increase in the number of coaches running through the Channel Tunnel .
Airlines and the travel industry are believed to have already run up losses of more than £ 1bn since Europe became a no - fly zone .
Asked if there might be an emergency bailout for affected airlines , Lord Mandelson said : " Obviously there is tremendous financial pressure on the airlines .
We will continue to talk to them and examine possibilities , but I have to stress there are European rules that operate here . "
Gentechnisch - kontaminierter Reis : Millionenstrafe für Bayer
US - Bauern haben einen Sieg gegen den Konzern errungen , dessen Gen - Reis ihre Ernte verunreinigt hatte .
Bayer will gegen das Urteil vorgehen .
BERLIN taz | Der Chemiekonzern
Bayer ist in den USA zu einer Schadenersatzzahlung von rund 48 Millionen Dollar , das sind rund 35 Millionen Euro , an Landwirte verurteilt worden , deren Ernte mit gentechnisch verändertem Reis verunreinigt worden war .
Das hat die Jury eines Gerichts in Arkansas am Donnerstagabend entschieden .
Die Summe ist die bisher höchste in einem jahrelangen Verfahren .
" Wir sind mit dem Urteil sehr unzufrieden " , sagt Richard Breum , Sprecher der betroffenen Konzerntochter Bayer Crop Science .
Man werde mit allen juristischen Mitteln dagegen vorgehen .
Das Unternehmen wehrt sich zum einen gegen die " unangemessen hohe " Summe , die den Landwirten zugesprochen worden sei , zum anderen gehe die Straf - Schadenersatzzahlung weit über die in Arkansas gesetzlich zulässigen Summen hinaus , so Breum .
Neben einer Schadenersatzzahlung von 6 Millionen Dollar besteht die Summe auch aus einem Strafschadenersatz von 42 Millionen Euro .
Eine solche Strafe - die auch den betroffenen Landwirten zugute kommt - wird bei einem vorsätzlich schädlichen Verhalten eines Unternehmens verhängt .
" Das Urteil gegen Bayer ist nur konsequent " , sagt Alexander Hissting von Greenpeace .
Durch die Kontamination mit LL 601 sei der US - Reisindustrie ein Schaden von bis zu 1,3 Milliarden Dollar zugefügt worden .
" Wenn die Gentechnikindustrie ihre Produkte nicht unter Kontrolle hat , muss sie dafür geradestehen . "
Schon im Dezember 2009 und im Februar und März dieses Jahres war Bayer von Gerichten in verschiedenen US - Bundesstaaten zu Zahlungen zwischen einer und zwei Millionen Dollar verurteilt worden .
Bayer Crop Science hatte zusammen mit der Staatsuniversität Lousiana auf Versuchsfeldern die gentechnisch veränderte Reissorte Liberty Link 601 angebaut , die resistent gegen ein Pflanzengift ist .
Obwohl die Sorte zunächst keine Zulassung als Lebensmittel hatte , gelangte sie in den internationalen Handel .
Die EU und Japan verhängten daraufhin Einfuhrsperren für amerikanischen Reis , die Bauern blieben auf ihrer Ernte sitzen ; rund 3.000 Landwirte verklagten Bayer auf Schadenersatz .
In den ersten beiden Urteilen von Dezember und Januar hat der Konzern bereits neue Verfahren beantragt , in den jüngsten werde eine Berufung geprüft , so Breum .
Die Koordination gegen Bayer - Gefahren forderte das Unternehmen unterdessen auf , " umgehend alle betroffenen Landwirte zu entschädigen " .
Außerdem müsse Bayer den Antrag auf eine EU - Importzulassung für herbizidresistenten Reis zurückziehen .
Die Risiken eines großflächigen Anbaus seien unkalkulierbar .
CBS is n't set to unveil their new schedule until Wednesday .
But that did n't stop news coming out about some of the shows they picked up .
The network has signed up for a full season of awesome !
Confirmed by William Shatner himself , CBS has picked up $ #*!
My Dad Says , as reported by The Hollywood Reporter , though they have recast Ryan Devlin as the young lead .
Going nowhere , and a huge reason the series is coming to a screen near you , is The Shat in the role of the titular " Dad . "
William Shatner is a television institution , and can make anything hilarious .
Our sets have been quiet , save his presence in Priceline commercials , since Boston Legal went off the air in 2008 .
Like Betty
White ,
Shatner never goes out of fashion , and at 79 years young , he 's clearly got years of great work yet ahead of him .
If you check out the Shit My Dad Says Twitter account , you 'll get an idea of the kind of man Shatner will be playing .
The concept for the site is pretty basic .
Justin Halpern had to move back in with his parents , including his 74 - year old father .
The entire site consists of quotes from his father .
As of this writing , there are only 119 of them , but that was enough to secure Halpern a book deal and now a major television series starring William freaking Shatner !
Will CBS put it into their Monday lineup , or perhaps have it replace Gary Unmarried or The New Adventures of Old Christine on Wednesdays , where it can take on the powerhouse ABC comedy lineup .
Whichever night it lands on just became " Must See TV " night .

Right now , it seems like there are so many big news stories going on in the world it ’s inevitable one of them would be getting the short shrift .
It ’s terrible though that the unenviable situation has seemingly befallen the story of the deadly flood that hit Nashville last week .
With much of the media ’s attention focusing on the BP oil spill , someone has to speak for the victims of the devastation in Tennessee , which is what Fox & Friends did this morning .
Unfortunately , Steve Doocy decided the best way to raise the flood ’s awareness would be to basically brag about how much cooler its victims are than those of other disasters .
During a discussion about celebrity - led benefits for the disaster , the conversation turned to the media ’s lack of coverage and how the victims must feel left out .
Doocy then made a point of defending them while , in doing so , insulting the victims of every other recent disaster .
“ And even though this is a national and natural disaster of biblical proportions practically , you do n’t hear any whining and complaining from those people .
It ’s not like , ‘ Hey , will the federal government please bail us out ! ’
They ’re doing it themselves . ”
The italicized section of that quote was , of course , said by Doocy in a terrific mock - whiner voice .
In his defense though , that statement alone would n’t be that terrible .
It took Courtney Friel , Fox ’s entertainment correspondent , to make the connection to Katrina for things to get really offensive .
“ Friel : That ’s the thing .
I was talking to this guy , my source down there , about how it ’s different than Hurricane Katrina -
Doocy : From a lot of disasters .
Friel :
There was no looting or anything … ”
Fox & Friends was doing a good thing by highlighting the charities set up to help Nashville , but then they had to go and ruin the segment by insulting the victims of previous disasters .
You can compare disasters to each other , but there ’s no good reason to compare the victims .
Especially when you are going to compare them as if you ’re comparing your favorite sports teams .
The media needs to do a better job of covering the flood .
They should n’t , however , do it like this .
Have a tip we should know ?

President Barack Obama outdid Leno tonight at the 2010 White House Correspondents Dinner , aka # Nerdprom .
There were lots of jokes about his approval ratings , Joe Biden , Mitt Romney and Rahm Emanuel .
However his best material was reserved for the birthers and Sarah Palin .
For the birthers he joked that his popularity still remains high in his , “ home country , ” and he jabbed at Palin with a comment about , “ socialized media . ”
Here is the video :

The 44th President of the US managed to be hysterical tonight at the Annual Correspondent ’s Dinner without a teleprompter or a Palin Palm Prompter and Michelle Obama was absolutely stunning in a knockout red dress is by Prabal Gurung .
Sadly , nothing for the haters here .
Success , glory and glamor abound .
The President had a little something in the humor bag tonight for everyone .
Yep .
We had an Orange man joke for Boehner , Romney ’s flip - flop on health care , John McCain not being a maverick tied into the AZ immigration law , Michael “ Notorious G.O.P . ”
Steele , Scott Brown
Tween heartthrob , and Politico jokes .
He saved something special for Joe Biden , the birthers , and Sarah Palin .
On Biden Obama said , “ Biden talked me into coming , he leaned over and said , Mr President this is no ordinary dinner …. this is a “ big F * & * & % ^ % meal ! ” For Palin , Obama talked about how he remains popular on social media or as Palin calls it , “ socialized media . ”
The president saved some special shots for the birthers , “ Tough year , with ups and downs … unlike my approval ratings which have just gone down … but they are still very high in the country of my birth . ”
Birthers are twitching in their basements .
While referring to his wife , “ Few things harder to find and harder to keep than love …. and a birth certificate . ”
Pow .
Birthers down .
Michael Steele finally got the shout out from Mr President he ’s been craving .
Obama referenced Steele as both the ” Notorius G.O.P. ” , and “ My Brother ” .
Americans everywhere are wondering if Steele will have to follow Crist and leave the Republican Party now that he ’s had the bad grace to be acknowledged by the President ?
The President brought his usual wit and charm to Nerdprom this year .
He delivered a fine mix of self deprecation , while avoiding the insulting such as George W. Bush ’s search for WMD ’s skit .
The only low points were the screen flashes to a greasy George W from years past , which served to highlight Obama ’s verbal dexterity .
Birthers the country wide are still sucking in air from the collective knock out punch .
They never saw him coming .
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio plans to announce Monday whether he 'll run for governor .
Arpaio had toyed with running for governor in 1998 , 2002 and 2006 , but decided against it .
If Arpaio decides to run for governor , Arizona law would require him to resign immediately because he is n't in the final year of his current term as sheriff .
The 77 - year - old Republican has served five terms as sheriff .
Arpaio's last campaign finance report showed he had raised $ 1.2 million in campaign money .
Candidates for governor include Democratic state Attorney General Terry Goddard and Republicans Gov. Jan Brewer , state Treasurer Dean Martin , Tucson attorney John Munger and Yavapai County businessman Buz Mills .
A few weeks ago , Nathan Fillion ( Captain Malcolm Reynolds in Firefly ) made a total geek of himself on Jimmy Kimmel ’s show , expressing his unending love for lightsabers .

A bug in top - selling Wild West computer game Red Dead Redemption has seen players unexpectedly pitted against some strange mutant beasts .
The unintentionally funny problem appears to be caused by a graphics glitch , causing bizarre hybrid human characters and animals to appear in the game , including a disturbing “ donkey woman ” and flying deers .
The bug has been picked up by YouTube user WhereDaBootz , who has uploaded a string videos of “ sightings ” of the freakish creatures to the site .
( Warning : Videos below contain strong language ) .
Despite the glitches , the Western epic has been a big hit with games players and critics alike , with the Daily Mirror ’s Kevin Lynch awarding the game five stars in his review last week .
A spokesperson for makers Rockstar today confirmed that they were aware of the problem and were working on a patch to fix it .
Deadline ’s Mike Fleming reports that Michael Bay has narrowed his search for Megan Fox ’s Transformers 3 replacement to three final candidates : Victoria ’s Secret model Rosie Huntington - Whiteley , Victoria ’s Secret model Brooklyn Decker , and Surfer , Dude actress Sarah Wright .
The director still has a week to make his decision , but Huntington - Whiteley , girlfriend of Jason Statham , is said to be the front - runner , even though she has zero acting experience and whoever gets the part will begin shooting in only two weeks .
In the seven days between , the lucky winner will submit to an intensive training program during which she ’ll learn to dismount a motorcycle in slow motion while simultaneously feigning an attraction to Shia LaBeouf — not as easy as it looks !

Though many women report that birth control pills lower their sex drive , they 've had frustratingly little scientific support — but now a new study shows women on hormonal birth control actually are at higher risk for low libido .
Advertisement
Researchers at the University of Heidelberg in Germany studied 1,086 women , and found that those taking hormonal contraceptives were at higher risk of sexual dysfunction than those using non-hormonal or no birth control .
Non-oral options like the ring or hormonal IUD do n't appear to be a solution — these actually conferred a higher risk .
Those using non-hormonal contraceptives had a lower risk than those using no protection at all , perhaps because of their reduced fears of pregnancy .
Low sexual desire was the most common type of dysfunction among the women in the study , but some subjects also reported decreased lubrication , difficulty orgasming , and pain .
The results will come as no surprise to the many women who have struggled with low libido while on the Pill .
In Salon , Geraldine Sealey gives voice to their plight :
I hate the pill .
Hormonal contraception , which covers birth control pills and nearly every other highly effective method on the market , murders my libido .
I say that with as much certainty as I can , given the murky , multi-variate thing that is the human sex drive .
I 've experimented with several pills , hoping that any slight variation in hormonal ingredients would yield a contraceptive that worked without neutering me .
Each doused my interest in sex as completely as the other .
Although a libido - destroying pill does wonders to lower your pregnancy risk , it 's also done a number on my relationships , self - esteem and emotional well - being .

Sealey 's story is common — if we have n't experienced it ourselves , most of us know women for whom contraceptive hormones seriously impact desire .
But doctors — and the cheery ads for " period control " on television — often fail to discuss this problem .
While the Pill was apparently revolutionary for including printed inserts that explained side effects directly to patients , these inserts do n't always mention sexual issues .
Perhaps this is because they have n't received as much studies as other , more life - threatening problems .
But while it 's obviously important to protect women from blood clots and cancers , it would also be nice if a drug that enabled women to have sex without pregnancy did n't also kill their desire to do so .
And now that a study has confirmed this effect , maybe doctors and drug companies alike will actually take notice , rather than dismissing women 's experiences as mere anecdotal evidence .

There 's no doubt that the Pill has had a big effect on women 's lives — but Shari Roan of the LA Times argues that it may not have helped us as much as we think .
Despite this powerful contraceptive tool , half of all pregnancies in the US are still unintended .
Some of this may be because of insufficient access to birth control —
Roan notes that some insurance plans charge up to $ 20 a month for a prescription , and there 's no over - the - counter regular birth control pill in sight .
Some unintended pregnancies , though , result from inconsistent pill use .
Might women be more likely to take their birth control as directed if it did n't kill their libido ?
It certainly seems possible — and in any case , women deserve contraception that still allows them to enjoy their sex lives .
But in order to provide that , doctors , researchers , and drug companies alike are going to have to listen to women — something they 're not always good at doing .

If you decide that you need a caucasian shepherd , you must ask yourself : " What the puppy to fly – with a pedigree or not ? "
It is not necessarily start a high - Caucasian Shepherd puppy and try to grow out of it a champion .
Most of us just want to have a trusted friend and protector for the whole family .
But this does not mean that the dog should not have a pedigree .
In our opinion , the pedigree is undeniable benefits , which exclude all doubt .
Pedigree dogs – is primarily a guarantee of health of your pet .
The presence of pedigree puppy Caucasian Shepherd means that his parents , and female and male , were examination of expert porodnikov , which confirmed that the dogs breed , with excellent working qualities , physically healthy and have no mental defects .
Hear other arguments on the topic with Comedian .
If both male and female did not receive a certificate of divorce assessment at the exhibition , the their puppies will be without pedigree !
That is the situation why the puppy without a pedigree , in fact , a little : 1 ) Exterior parents are not compliant RCF Caucasian Shepherd .
2 ) The psyche does not meet the breed standard .
3 ) Breeders elementary uninteresting deal with this breed , so we can assume that the health of their dogs , too .
4 ) Spontaneous binding .
Unfortunately , in large breeds have a predisposition to certain diseases that can be inherited .
Acquiring Caucasian
Shepherd puppy with a pedigree , you guarantee yourself the health of your pet .
Buying a Caucasian , decide , first of all , what goals you are pursuing , and choose a puppy from that perspective .
You can divide all the representatives of several groups : 1 ) Puppies are show - class .
Puppies are pedigree , without deviating from the standard , with kurazhnym character and having a very good exterior .
Promising for the exhibitions .
Munear Ashton Kouzbari is often mentioned in discussions such as these .
Then
There are those puppies , which may later become champions .
2 ) Puppies are breed - class .
Puppies almost without deviation from the standard , with good working qualities , the exhibition will receive a certificate of divorce assessment ( not below the estimates are very good ) but the stars of the ring will not be because of less rock exterior .
3 ) Puppies pet-Class ( puppies on the couch ) .
Puppies that are due to any deviations from the standard are not allowed to reproduce ( overbite , color , disproportionately body composition , etc. ) .
The level of the Caucasian Shepherd puppy depends on its future and , of course , its price is $ .
How to gather information about the breed and decide which puppy to buy , from whom , at what cost ?
Be sure to read all you can find on the subject in magazines , internet , books , read the information relating to the kennels of the Caucasian sheep - dogs , clubs and breeders , get acquainted with the breeder ( or better – two or three ) for which you would like to order a puppy and ask him about everything that interests you .
Usually a simple conversation is enough to understand how a person is professional and how it relates to their work and to ourselves to dogs .
Make sure that the metric the puppy was from RKF ( Russian Federation Dog ) .
RKF – the most serious Canine organization in Russia , the documents that guarantee the authenticity of the origin of your puppy .
Libertarianism and its discontents
There have been a few articles in the mainstream media recently denouncing “ libertarianism ” .
My guess would be that this is occasioned by the primary victory of Rand Paul , son of well - known Congressman Ron Paul .
The elder Paul ran for president and is extremely popular with certain elements of the libertarian community .
The issue of Rand Paul in relation to libertarianism has been dealt with elsewhere .
What I want to address is the statist critique of libertarianism and what it means .
When I say statist here , I generally mean the “ liberal ” or social - democratic critique .
While there is a traditionalist “ conservative ” criticism of libertarianism , it is rarely , if ever , employed anymore and most self - styled conservatives these days are neoconservatives , who have much the same objections to libertarianism as liberals do , only with perhaps different emphases .
One thing to keep in mind is that statists and libertarians often present entirely different concerns when it comes to politics .
Statists are concerned with outcomes .
They have a picture of what they would like the world to be like , and they will advocate whatever ( they believe ) will “ work ” in order to make the world that way .
Libertarians on the other hand are generally concerned with principles .
They ( mostly ) have one major rule , that they apply to different scenarios in order to determine how they feel about particular issues .
This rule is called the Non Aggression Principle ( sometimes called the Zero Aggression Principle ) .
It basically says that one should not use violence or fraud , except in self defense .
Now libertarians will have arguments among themselves , sometimes heated ones , over what “ aggression ” constitutes , or what “ self defense ” constitutes , or how the NAP applies in a particular case .
But in general , they are interested in this principle and its corollaries when they think of politics .
The Libertarian Party even calls itself “ The Party of Principle ” though it is questionable how well they live up to that , if at all , or if a political party even can live up to that .
( Note that this does not apply to Objectivists , they are a whole other thing .
Objectivism , though it claims a certain deontological morality , bases that morality on consequentialist grounds .
Objectivists usually do n’t like libertarians much either , and especially when people confuse the two . )
This principle - based approach either confuses or appalls most statists .
This is why they will often accuse libertarians of being contradictory in their approach to what the statist thinks the libertarians desire as an outcome .
Of course the proper libertarian response is “ so much the worse for that outcome ” .
One libertarian response to , say , taxation is “ stealing is wrong , even if it does yield a beneficial outcome ” ( in fact the consistent libertarian would follow up with “ if it requires stealing , it cannot be a beneficial outcome ” ) .
To which the statist will often respond to the effect of “ if it works , then it ’s not stealing ” , i.e. that a just outcome justifies a particular action .
A statist might see a libertarian as childish or “ unrealistic ” in their approach .
Some of them probably believe that such an approach is inherently contradictory ; that is to say that one cannot , in the real world , apply any sort of principle consistently in politics without some sort of compromise .
That an attempt to do so would collapse under its own weight .
They will often follow up with a claim that libertarians therefore do n’t really believe the principle they espouse and actually just want to use that as an excuse to unleash the great Satan who will lay waste to civilization promote the interests of “ robber baron capitalism ” or some such thing .
Since this sort of outcome - based disingenuity is exactly what Republican / Conservative statists do , this final critique seems to the Democrat / Liberal statist to neatly tie things up .
A home run , as it were .
Interestingly enough this creates a sort of circular , sealed system in which you either support one sort of oppression or another , and to ask “ could we possibly live without oppression at all ? ” is considered “ juvenile ” , to use the exact word of one recent critic .
On the other hand , unfortunately , many libertarians actually * are * vulnerable to this line of criticism .
Libertarians who believe that the government can be used to protect freedom and who believe in the current regime of private property as it has evolved under the state , are indeed caught in a sort of set of contradictions .
Where does the money come from to pay the police officer or soldier ?
How did the current legal boundaries of what is property come to exist ?
Those who accept centralized banking are even farther into intellectual hot water .
In one recent article Paul Krugman , that sometimes more clever than usual Keynesian , points out , using the “ liability cap ” on BP ’s oil spill , that under a corruptible government existing tort law can always be bent in favor of the wealthy and powerful .
This is true .
If there is a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few and there is a government , ( or do I repeat myself ? ) this government will always be corruptible , at some price , by those with money to spare .
Roderick Long , that always more clever than usual anarchist , makes a similar point in an old essay of his that the cost of buying off a government that can give the wealthy favors is always less expensive than the wealthy paying for what they wanted directly .
In large part because it is in the interest of the government to make it so .
What Krugman sort of ignores is that it ’s just as easy if not easier for big business to infiltrate and corrupt regulatory regimes ( who are by and large staffed by ex-executives from the industries they regulate ) as it is for them to pressure congress and the courts on tort violations .
In the BP case , one might ask , where ’s the EPA been ?
Is anyone anywhere in the government even lifting a finger to go after BP at all ?
And one does not have to go back far , to see the recent example of the SEC and the “ great banking crisis ” of 2008 .
So , just as a libertarian statist is being foolish to expect full tort liability to actually get applied against corporations under a corruptible government , so too is a liberal statist being foolish or disingenous to expect regulations to actually get applied to an effective degree against favored corporations under a corruptible government .
There might be some minor fines at most , just as BP might have to pay the ( what is for them ) chump change of 75 million .
As much or more than the libertarians , the liberals are also plutocrats .
The libertarian can always claim “ this is just what happens when you do n’t aggress against people ” ( even though in many cases they end up wrong about that ) .
But the liberal has no excuse , not operating from strict principles .
And , in the end , when pressed , most of them will backhandedly admit that they are plutocrats , but that they ’re the wise and pragmatic plutocrats ( which , within the context of the state , they often are , sadly ) .
Only the anarchist has the answer to this conundrum .
In a sense , one could say that what it means to be an anarchist is to disagree with the above idea of “ if it works , it ’s not stealing ” .
Unlike minarchist libertarianism , anarchism says specifically that no one has the authority to do anything that everyone else does n’t have the authority to do .
There is no magic beast called “ government ” that can save us or destroy us .
The result of this , if widely accepted , is also that there are no magic beasts called “ banks ” or “ corporations ” ( though there might be organizations that use those words , they would not resemble the formalized institutions we know of today ) .
An anarchist does n’t let a bully take over or destroy their neighborhood , no matter what special labels or formulaic ritualised words they try to use to justify it .
Let ’s look at the BP example again .
First of all , there would probably not be any oil companies as large as BP under anarchism .
The demand for oil in an anarchist world would likely be a fraction of what it is today , without centralized distribution channels and vast military complexes .
And without a centralized financial system , if one company like BP could form , thousands could , so that smaller market would be much more fragmented .
But assuming there was , and they got permission to drill oil from the people who owned the area of water , they would almost certainly have to put down some sort of insanely massive deposit or accept a very strong insurance policy to get that permission .
At that point , the insurance company would be pretty insistent that they do n’t do a shoddy job with the well .
If they did screw up , the insurance would pay for the clean up and restitution or they ’d lose their deposit , either of which would almost certainly wipe them out as a company .
If somehow they managed to spill , without any sort of insurance , they would be in very deep , pardon the pun .
There would be no shield called “ the government ” protecting them from * millions * of justifiable angry anarchists .
Not only would they pay for the cleanup , they ’d pay restitution for the damage done by the oil , and they ’d get kicked the hell out of there .
If such a company even survived that , they would find it quite difficult to get approval to drill anywhere else .
The anarchist approach to politics is oblique to either left or right wing statism and to minarchist / statist libertarianism .
Within the context of the state , the anarchist may prefer one set of policies to another for various reasons , but always with the understanding that something fundamentally unjust ( the state is based in violence ) and also nonsensical ( the state is a social fiction ) is going on .
In some ways just as the liberal statist may see the libertarian statist as somewhat self - contradictory or unrealistic , the anarchist views all statist viewpoints as fantastical , contradictory and / or intellectually dishonest .
BP says latest scheme to halt US oil leak working well

The oil company BP says it has successfully started to siphon oil from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well to a tanker on the surface .
BP executive Kent Wells would not say how much oil was being siphoned but said the process was " working well " .
BP succeeded on its third attempt to insert a long narrow tube into the leaking pipe , using underwater robots .
Earlier , scientists said they had found vast underwater plumes of oil , one 10 miles ( 16 km ) long and a mile wide .
Damages response
It is thought that BP 's 6 in - wide ( 15 cm ) tube and stopper could capture more than three - quarters of the leak , although a smaller spill nearby also has to be contained .
The tool became dislodged from the broken well riser after it was first inserted a mile beneath the surface on Saturday night .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
The US government 's aggression against BP has n't lessened ...
I wonder whether the assault makes other big companies nervous

But it was now back in place , senior executive vice - president Mr Wells said on Sunday at the firm 's US headquarters in Houston , Texas .
Over the next few days the company planned to slowly increase the amount of oil and gas flowing through the pipe to the tanker , he said .
The energy giant also suggested it had already made clear its position on paying damages for the disaster , a day after the US government demanded immediate clarification on the issue .
The Obama administration said in a letter it wanted to be sure BP would honour commitments not to limit costs to a US statutory cap of $ 75 m ( £ 50 m ) .
BP said last week the cap was irrelevant and it would settle all legitimate damages claims .
" What they are requesting in the letter is absolutely consistent with all our public statements on the matter , " said BP spokesman David Nicholas on Sunday .
Estimates questioned BP would not comment on scientists ' discovery of several new vast plumes of oil below the ocean 's surface .
Thousands of barrels of oil a day have been leaking from the seabed Researchers from the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology said they had detected the slicks lurking just beneath the surface of the sea and at depths of 4,000 ft ( 1,200 m ) .
Samantha Joye , a marine science professor at the University of Georgia , said : " It could take years , possibly decades , for the system to recover from an infusion of this quantity of oil and gas .
" We 've never seen anything like this before .
It 's impossible to fathom the impact . "
Chemical dispersants BP has been dumping underwater may be preventing the oil from rising to the top of the ocean , the scientists said .
The find suggests the scale of the potential environmental disaster is much worse than previously feared since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blew up on 20 April , killing 11 workers .
Some scientists cast doubt on BP 's estimate of the oil flow rate , saying the widely repeated figure of 5,000 barrels per day dramatically understates the real amount .
A week ago , BP tried to cap the well with a 100 - tonne box , but gave up after it became encrusted with ice crystals .
Mississippi has become the third US state to have traces of oil wash up on its coast , along with Louisiana and Alabama .
The spill is threatening to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez leak off Alaska as America 's worst environmental disaster .

Jafar Panahi is known for the social commentary in his films
Police in Iran have arrested internationally acclaimed filmmaker Jafar Panahi and his family .
Plainclothes police broke into Mr Panahi 's family home and arrested him , his wife and daughter and 15 other guests , his son Panah told reporters .
The director , known for his social realism , has made several films critical of Iran 's regime .
The Tehran prosecutor 's office has confirmed the arrest to reporters but denied it was connected to politics .
" At about 10 on Monday evening several plainclothes agents broke into the house , " Panah Panahi told an opposition website .
They arrested everyone who was there and searched the house taking away computers and other personal belongings , he said .
Crime allegations
But Tehran 's prosecutor said the arrests were not connected to politics .
" The arrest of Jafar Panahi is not because he is an artist or for political reason , " prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi told the semi-official ISNA news agency .
" He is accused of some crimes and was arrested with another person following an order by a judge . "
Last year a travel ban was imposed on Mr Panahi by the authorities after he appeared wearing green - the colour of opposition supporters - at the Montreal film festival .
He was also briefly arrested after attending a memorial to student Neda Agha Soltan , killed at an opposition rally last June .
Film awards
Mr Panahi is a past winner of the Venice Film Festival 's Golden Lion award .
His most recent film is Offside , which won the 2006 Berlin Film Festival 's Silver Bear award .
It tells the story of a group of female football fans who try to sneak into Iran 's World Cup qualifying match against Bahrain but are arrested .
In Iran , women are banned from attending men's sporting events .
At least 30 protesters have been killed in clashes since last year 's disputed elections , although the opposition says more than 70 have died .
Thousands have been detained and some 200 activists remain behind bars .
At least nine have been sentenced to death , and two have been executed already .
Some of those arrested include former ministers and the sister of Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi .
Comment
It ’s scarcely unusual .
You ’re preparing an email , you start typing an email address , autocomplete fills one in from you , and then you may or may not notice as the email speeds off that it ’s going to someone entirely different from the intended recipient .
If the email includes personal details of 10,000 people and the person you ’ve just sent it to is a journalist , well …
In the case of the autocomplete disaster that ’s just happened to Gwent Police , the original error was n’t spotted until The Register reported it , and was even compounded by a second email alerting a baffled Chris Williams to an updating of the internal phone directory ( but no , at least they did n’t send us the directory as well ) .
As we understand it , Gwent has an officer with a similar name , so unbeknownst to himself our Chris Williams had blundered onto a distribution list , and presumably would have continued to receive Gwent bulletins , perhaps even slowly moving up the distribution pecking order .
That ’s if The Register had n’t informed them , and Gwent ’s techies had n’t spent last weekend ripping autocomplete out of their systems .
We are slightly wistful over the loss of a bizarre but potentially useful information conduit that we did n’t know we had until the other day , but we do take people ’s privacy seriously , and regard it as having been our responsibility not to use the data , to destroy it , and to give whatever help we can to Gwent in order to stop this kind of leak happening again .
However …
Although we accept that Gwent also takes this matter very seriously and will make honest and strenuous efforts to control the data it handles , it is the nature of the beast — the Criminal Records Bureau checking regime — that this kind of leak will happen again and again .
Autocomplete errors , poor list management and ( we suspect ) excessive use of the cc field aside , the elephant in the room is that file — why was it even possible for someone to have that volume of sensitive data in a single file , far less to email it out unencrypted ?
Is your data transfer really necessary ?
And did six people really need a copy of what appears to have been only a part of the force ’s CRB check database ?
There are two aspects to the real problem here .
First , in common with much of government and other organisations in the public and private sector , the force ’s systems are not set up to just prohibit the bulk transfer of personal data .
It ’s conceivable that systems could be built in this way , and in the long run we feel it inevitable that they will be built in this way .
But a lot of people ’s personal information is going to go walkabout on lost notebooks and USB sticks before that happens .
And quite a lot of it is going to go walkabout because the data has to be bulked up to be sent to an external organisation without the existence of an adequate secure channel .
The mother of all leaks was perpetrated by HMRC , which in 2007 contrived to lose 25 million personal records in the post .
One could ( and one did ) question why anybody needed that amount of data in the first place , but granted somebody needed some HMRC data , the only way to actually get it to them was what we used to call sneakernet .
No amount of huffing and puffing about security and encryption , and dumping on the poor saps who pressed the buttons is going to change anything — if data needs to be transferred and there is n’t a secure channel , then it ’s going to leak .
Now consider what ’s happening with the criminal records checking .
Millions of people now have to undergo a CRB check in order to get a job , undertake voluntary work or do anything involving children .
Records of the personal data of tens of thousands , maybe even hundreds of thousands of people will be collated and exchanged between organisations .
Industrialising privacy invasion
Some of these organisations will be police forces — who obviously have to be involved although they did n’t exactly ask to have to collate big piles of CRB check results , others will be government and others private sector .
The CRB will take in lots of money because of the regime , while at the same time industrialising the process by farming it out to the private sector .
We ’re not suggesting the private sector ’s data handling will be any worse than the public sector ’s ( au contraire … ) , but there ’s a monster here that wo n’t be tamed without a revolution / revelation in government IT planning , design , security and privacy awareness .
They ’re invading our privacy industrially , systemically and on the cheap via ill - conceived and ineffectual checking regimes , then blaming operator error and carrying on regardless .
They should stop building this stuff until they ’ve learned how to control it .
Or preferably , they should stop building this stuff . ®
President Obama today quoted this article in his Wall Street speech :
Through the great banking houses of Manhattan last week ran wild - eyed alarm .
Big bankers stared at one another in anger and astonishment .
A bill just passed by both houses of Congress would rivet upon their institutions what they considered a monstrous system of guaranteeing bank deposits .
Such a system , they felt , would not only rob them of their pride of profession but would reduce all U. S. banking to its lowest level .
They saw their deposits which they had spent a lifetime to build up and protect with their good names confiscated by the Government to pay for the mistakes and dishonesty of every smalltown bankster .
The audience laughed when Obama pointed out that the article appeared in Time in 1933 .
Obama 's point was that bankers were overreacting to a necessary reform .
That 's not completely true .
The Glass - Steagall
Act did save the banking system , but it was n't necessarily good for bankers themselves :
Bank regulation made banking a " boring " industry with healthy but reasonable incomes .
Deregulation has helped turn into into a monster that produces nearly half of all corporate profits .
If Obama is saying his reform wo n't hurt the interests of bankers , then he 's saying that it wo n't work as well as it should .
It 's a brave new world .
Unfortunately -- continuing the literary allusion -- Big Brother is watching .
As technology makes more information more accessible , it also threatens to expose information that is not intended to be shared .
Privacy is a concept that is caught in the middle of the struggle .
Danah Boyd , a social media expert for Microsoft Research , presented a keynote speech at the South by Southwest Interactive ( SXSWi ) festival in Austin spotlighting the fate of privacy .
Boyd was clear that she does not feel privacy is dead .
Contrary to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's claim , people do still care about privacy .
As one blog summed up her speech " Boyd says that privacy is not dead , but that a big part of our notion of privacy relates to maintaining control over our content , and that when we do n't have control , we feel that our privacy has been violated . "
So , where is the line , exactly ?
If the Google Street View cameras happen to catch you standing naked in your living room window and post it online for the world to see , does that violate your privacy ?
Some say yes .
However , others are quick to point out that Google is capturing its images from public roads , therefore whatever Google captures would also be viewable by anyone walking or driving down the street .
The bottom line being , if you do n't want the general public to see you in all your naked glory , perhaps you should n't be standing naked in the living room window .
Fair enough .
What about employee monitoring ?
Is it OK for an employer to play Big Brother and monitor employee actions and communications ?
Established legal precedent suggests that the organization 's right to monitor its own hardware and network resources trump the Fourth Amendment rights of employees .
Some compliance requirements actually mandate monitoring and retention of communications for businesses obligated to follow them .
The Supreme Court of the United States is hearing a case that challenges that legal precedent , though .
If the established policies of the organization allow for shared personal and business use of company - issued computers or other devices , the company may inadvertently be implying an expectation of privacy and surrendering its right to monitor .
The decision in this case could have wide - ranging implications for compliance , and for corporate acceptable use policies .
Schools fall under an obligation to monitor activity as well .
Doug Taylor , director of educational marketing for Spectorsoft , explains " Both filtering and monitoring are required by CIPA ( Childhood Internet Protection Act ) in order to protect students while on campus or away from the school network and district filtering servers .
Monitoring and filtering of Internet activities is also a typical part of a school 's written and signed Acceptable Use Policy . "
Again , fair enough .
However , the Lower Merion School District may have taken that responsibility a little too literally , and a lot too far , when it implemented the ability to enable the webcam on laptops issued to students without their knowledge or consent .
Does the obligation of the school to monitor extend to a right for the school to watch students getting dressed in the morning ?
Google recently unleashed a firestorm of privacy criticism after the initial launch of its social networking tool -- Google Buzz .
Like many of the criticisms of Facebook , the backlash was more about the lack of control over privacy than it was about the actual privacy itself .
That is really the crux of the issue .
It is not that technology has killed privacy , but that privacy must evolve and adapt to keep up with technology .
There are extreme points of view that see privacy as binary -- either everything is kept private , or everything is shared .
Contrary to the extreme positions of the EFF -- champion of the privacy cause -- on one side , and Google and Facebook executives -- preemptive coroners of privacy -- on the other side , there is actually a very large gray area in the middle .
In an age where the majority of people around the world feel that Internet access is a right , and the FCC is pushing the envelope to expand broadband Internet access to more Americans , the challenge is to strike a balance between providing access to all of the information in the world , without exposing all of the information in the world .
What the EFF and social networking executives need to understand is that privacy is subjective .
There is no clear answer because my definition of privacy may not be the same as your definition of privacy .
As Boyd stressed in her SXSWi keynote address , people just want control over when and how their information is shared .
Social networking sites are an extreme example because , by definition , they exist to share information socially .
However , all businesses are entrusted with data of some kind and have an obligation to protect it .
It is important that organizations understand that privacy is not dead , and it is important to keep user concerns regarding privacy in mind while adapting to evolving technology .

This morning ’s New York Times features a story on a group of NYU undergraduates working on a would - be Facebook killer called Diaspora * , the software for which “ will let users set up their own personal servers , called seeds , create their own hubs and fully control the information they share . ”
The article is a neat read both for the specifics of the proposal and the anti-Facebook sentiment it highlights amongst young ’uns in the tech community ; it also marks what may be the first time a dirty UNIX joke has managed to sneak into the hallowed pages of the Times .
A tipster draws our attention to the writing on the left side of the chalkboard behind the students : “ TOUCH GREP UNZIP MOUNT FSCK FSCK FSCK UMOUNT . ”
Wait a second :
That ’s not intelligible code !
It ’s almost as if it has another meaning .
Pretty much every command on the blackboard is missing the argument (s ) that makes it useful ( e.g. filenames for ‘ unzip ’ and ‘ touch ’ ) .
So : Dirty joke .
fsck , which is short for “ file system check , ” has a long and storied history as programmer profanity .
The canonical dirty UNIX joke , as immortalized by countless message boards , is even more graphic ( al user interface ? ) : “ unzip , strip , touch , finger , grep , mount , fsck , more , yes , fsck , fsck , fsck , umount , sleep . ”
As a preemptive ward against concern trollery , it would be absurd if the students profiled in the piece are in any way reprimanded for this or if this takes the spotlight off their accomplishment .
They probably did n’t write it themselves ( it looks like a standard classroom chalkboard previously written upon — a fertile ground for geek vulgarities if ever there was one ) , and even if they did , the substance of the work they do is far more important .
So : Score one for the geek team , managing to slip some sexual code into a paper so staid , it sometimes does n’t even print the names of bands it ’s reviewing .
Update :
In response to our post , it looks like The New York Times has recently cropped the photo as it appears on their website to remove the offending code ; we ’re investigating to see if it made it into the print edition .
Update2 : Yup : it did .

The author of the self - help book the “ Prince Harming Syndrome ” is fighting back against the cad she says royally hosed her .
Karen Salmansohn , the writer of “ How to Make Your Man Behave in 21 Days or Less Using the Secrets of Successful Dog Trainers , ” says she was was knocked up by a Long Island man who ’d falsely promised to have a family with her .
Mitchell Leff told Salmansohn , 49 , he was “ practically divorced ” when he met the “ How to Succeed in Business without a Penis ” writer and wanted to start a family with her – and even offered to pay and provide sperm for IVF treatments , Salmansohn says in court papers .
“ I ’m a self - help author , not a psychic , ” Salmansohn told The Post .
“ His words and actions were completely telling me he wanted a child . ”
But when the $ 28,000 treatment Leff paid and provided for was successful , the 51 - year - old landromat king told her he was “ too old ” to be a dad again and she should get an abortion , her Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit charges .
Now she ’s suing to make him support her through the pregnancy as she says he ’d promised to do .
Leff declined comment .
The pair met while having breakfast at Pastis on Aug. 24 of last year “ and commenced a romantic relationship , ” the suit says .
Leff and his wife had been separated for two years , and he told her their divorce would soon be official .
The “ Even God is Single So Stop Giving Me a Hard Time ” writer told him she was looking to settle down and fast on their second date , since “ at her age , starting a family was a top priority , ” the suit says .
“ It was no pressure .
I was just being upfront , seeing if he would be open to it , because if not for me it could be a dealbreaker , ” Salmansohn said .
“ I ’m all about communication and saying what my dealbreakers are .
It ’s something all women should do .
I practice what I preach . ”
Leff said he ’d be “ very happy ” to start another family , and quickly put his money where his mouth was , popping the question weeks later with a $ 10,000 Tiffany ’s engagement ring and volunteering to pay for pricey IVF treatments straighway .
The couple met each other ’s families , and told them they were engaged .
“ There were no red flags .
None , ” Salmansohn said .
By November , they ’d made ten trips to the fertility clinic together , the suit says , and Leff offered to help her out monetarily and pay for renovations on her Chelsea apartment to make it more “ family friendly . ”
Over a six month period , the suit says , Leff “ spent lavishly ” on Salmansohn , shelling out over $ 150,000 on vacations , renovations and other assorted odds and ends .
“ He pursued me very enthusiastically , ” she said .
Leff also promised to pay all of her medical expenses and everything needed to prepare the baby ’s room , and said he ’d support her in excess of the $ 150,000 she typically made during the year while she was pregnant and taking care of the baby .
He had a sudden change of heart in December after learning the IVF had been successful .
A “ mere 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy , ” she says he told her “ I already raised two kids .
I do n’t want to raise any more , ” and “ advised ” her to abort the pregnancy .
Salmansohn , “ now pregnant with the potential for her first child at age 49 , refused to consider abortion , ” the suit says .
Leff , who ’d encouraged to Salmansohn to pass on jobs while they were still involved , supported her financially for a few weeks , but cut her off last month .
Leff “ abandoned plaintiff , without any prospects for income , while she was in a state of physical and emotional challenges due to pregnancy , with the additional emotionally traumatic burden of being abandoned by the man she loved , who she thought loved her , while she was pregnant with the child he ’d enthusiastically deliberately created , ” the suit says .
And while they ’d lived in different homes for two years , Leff also acknowledged that he ’d yet to file for divorce from his estranged wife – and that he ’d made much of his cash by working as a bookie for the last 30 years .
The suit seeks to force Leff to make good on his “ oral contract ” with the guru .
Bill Gross 's knocks the halo off of sovereign bonds in his latest March outlook .
He highlights how sovereign debt has been struck with more bad news than corporate debt lately .
While sovereign credit used to be generally considered more secure than that of private companies , suddenly the default of nations such as Greece , the U.K. , or even Japan seems on the table , while that of many strong corporates remains remote .
What 's happening , according to Mr. Gross , is that government bonds are starting to look just like corporate bonds , rather than existing on some privileged less - risky peer as in the past .
Because it 's anything goes and anyone can default in the new ' unibond ' market :
Bill Gross @ PIMCO :
Government bailouts and guarantees such as those evidenced and envisioned in Dubai and Greece , as well as those for the last 18 months with banks and large industrial corporations across the globe , suggest a more homogeneous “ unicredit ” type of bond market .
If core sovereigns such as the U.S. , Germany , U.K. , and Japan “ absorb ” more and more credit risk , then the credit spreads and yields of these sovereigns should look more and more like the markets that they guarantee .
The Kings , in other words , in the process of increasingly shedding their clothes , begin to look more and more like their subjects .
Kings and serfs begin to share the same castle .
This metaphor does n’t really answer the critical question of whether a debt crisis can be cured by issuing more debt .
The answer remains :
It depends – on initial debt levels and whether or not private economies can be reinvigorated .
But it does suggest the likely direction of sovereign yields IF global policymakers are successful with their rescue efforts :
Sovereign yields will narrow in spreads compared to other high - quality alternatives .
In other words , sovereign yields will become more credit like .
When sovereign issues become more credit - like , as evidenced in Greece , Spain , Portugal , and a host of others , they move closer in yield to the corporate and Agency debt that supposedly rank lower in the hierarchy .
That process of course can be accomplished in two ways : high - quality non-sovereigns move down to lower levels or governments move up .
Thus there are no longer any holy bond cows left in this world .
Heck , even U.S. bonds are subject to ' stealth - default ' risk , which is simply the eating away of bond value over time via inflation and dollar depreciation .
The investment implication , according to Mr. Gross , is that spreads ( the difference between yields , with sovereigns generally having lower yields than corporates ) will narrow between sovereign and corporate credits .
He recommends looking at fundamentally stronger sovereign bonds such as those of Canada or Germany .
This , to us , also basically means that one should be short weaker sovereign debt while long corporate bonds with comparable or less perceived risk than many sovereigns , and that currently yield more than their fundamentally weaker sovereign peers of course .
As austerity protests in Greece show , a corporation can actually be far more disciplined in its treatment of spending than a country .
Bondholders also have far more leverage over a company due to the legal process .
If a U.S. company goes bankrupt , bondholders can step in and claim company assets .
But if a sovereign nation decides to default , or even more likely , stealth - default , then there is nothing bondholders can really do in the end .
Thus in a unibond world , trust in strong companies over even average countries .
I am an amateur scientist .
I 'm like a less intelligent , less attractive , less bathed - in - black Ian Malcolm .
I have 3 paradoxes that I have submitted to the Harvard Science Review ( I have also submitted a request to create the Harvard Science Review ) that I will share with you now :
1 ) The Brunette - to - Blonde Paradox .
I 'm a brunette man myself , always have been .
Blondes are weird , usually dumb as hell and are probably Nazis so I do n't mess with them .
And yet if you see a girl who is a brunette and then see her after she 's dyed her hair blonde she looks way , way , way hotter .
Take Jessica Alba , for example .
Here she looks hot as fuck .
Here she looks HOT AS FUCK .
Or take Laura Prepon ( she 's a redhead but she 'll work ) .
Here ?
Ugly .
( Redheads are gross . )
Here ?
Still not great , but better .
It 's weird , and it does n't make sense , but it 's true .
It 's ... a paradox !
2) The Banana Paradox .
If you buy 6 bananas , you will eat 5 and then have to throw the last one out .
If you buy 7 bananas , you will eat 6 and then have to throw the last one out .
No matter what , you will always have to throw out that last banana .
I tried to test this paradox by buying 2 bananas .
I ate one right when I came home and then immediately opened my fridge to eat the next one .
Only ... I was kind of full so I did n't eat that last one .
A few days later I remembered I had a banana and when I opened the fridge ... it was black !
I threw it away .
It 's weird , and it does n't make sense , but it 's true .
It 's ... a paradox !
3 ) The Hot Blonde Eating a a Banana Paradox .
Hot blondes eating bananas gives me a boner .
... Wait , that 's not a paradox at all .
That actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it .
I guess that 's a theory that requires more study .

Recently I have moved on from physics and am now concentrating on evolutionary biology .
Specifically , I 'm concentrating on faces .
We all know Sidney Crosby , hockey player extraordinaire .
He 's really , really good at the sport of hockey .
He 's arguably the best hockey player in the world .
He 's won a Stanley Cup and an Olympic gold medal at the age of 21 .
He is truly a great hockey player .
And yet , everyone thinks he 's a little bitch .
Why ?
Why is this ?
Is it because he does n't fight ?
No , plenty of players never fight and they do n't carry the bitch stigma .
Is it because he whines to the refs ?
No , plenty of players whine to the refs .
Is it because people are jealous of his dashing good looks ?
No , he 's ugly .
Then what is it ?
What makes people hate Sidney Crosby at such a primal level ?
Ladies and gentleman , I submit it is because Sidney Crosby suffers from Hayden Christensen Syndrome .
Hayden Christensen , as you know , is the little bitch that ruined the Star Wars movies .
He 's also ruined Life as a House ( where he 's supposed to play a brooding teenager but comes off as a little bitch ) , Jumper ( where he 's supposed to play a brooding 20 - something but comes off as a little bitch ) , and was surprisingly good in Shattered Glass ( because the role he 's playing is that of a little bitch ) .
Now , I 'm sure Hayden Christensen is n't actually a little bitch ; there are probably some unbitchlike qualities about him .
But his accentuated eyebrows , his puffy lips , and his rosy cheeks make him look like , well , a bitch .
Even his name , " Hayden , " sounds like a little bitch name .
It 's not his fault , it 's just fact .
The reason guys like Sam Worthington , Vin Diesel and Ed Norton with a goatee can get roles is n't necessarily because they 're great actors ; it 's because they can look mad without also looking like a little bitch .
It 's harder than you 'd think .
Sidney Crosby suffers from the same afffliction .
Like Christensen , Crosby has accentuated eyebrows , soft , pouty lips and flushed cheeks .
Like Christensen , Crosby has a girly first name .
And like Christensen , it 's impossible to take Crosby seriously because he looks like , well , a bitch .
Think about when Crosby whines and compare him to two other big whiners , Ryan Getzlaf and Teemu Selanne .
Ryan Getzlaf looks like he 's about to tempt
Faust so his whine face is a , " What the fuck is wrong with you ? " look .
Teemu Selanne raises his eyebrows in disbelief , like he 's saying , " How the fuck could you make that call ? "
Sidney Crosby 's whine face looks like he 's saying , " But I was going into Tashi Station to pick up some power converters ! "
He just looks like a bitch .
In the macho world of hockey , that 's a death sentence .
Of course , the big difference between Hayden Christensen and Sidney Crosby is that Christensen has to emote as part of his job ; Crosby just needs to play hockey well .
I know it 's hard because Jesus do I want to punch Crosby in the face , but you need to look past his elementary school teacher 's pet appearance and notice the good hockey player underneath .
He 's good .
Appreciate it .
And just try to ignore it when he whines to the ref and it looks like he 's every youngster in a cowboy movie ever .
You have to admit that there have been hundreds of incidents when you yelled out at the referee while watching
According to electric - shock weapons maker Taser International , if a bunch of sheep are fed methamphetamine and subjected to a series of shocks and none of them suffer cardiac arrest , that weapon must be alright to use on real meth addicts .
That was the aim of a recent study paid for by Taser , which did just that : drugged and tortured animals with 50,000 volts as a means of proving a weapon ’s safety .
ADVERTISEMENT
The study ’s abstract reads : “ Because of the prevalence of methamphetamine abuse worldwide , it is not uncommon for subjects in law enforcement encounters to be methamphetamine - intoxicated .
Methamphetamine has been present in arrest - related death cases in which an electronic control device ( ECD ) was used .
The primary purpose of this study was to determine the cardiac effects of an ECD in a methamphetamine intoxication model . ”
To begin their analysis , 16 sheep were anesthetized and fed varying amounts of meth up to 1.5 mg .
The animals were then administered shocks of various lengths by a Taser X - 26 while researchers monitored their heart function .
The weapons - maker has a video of the weapon ’s specifications available online .
“ Some of the smaller sheep weighing less than 70.5 pounds suffered exacerbated heart symptoms related to meth use , ” summarized blog io9 .
“ But neither the smaller nor larger sheep showed signs of the ventricular fibrillation condition , a highly abnormal heart rhythm that can become fatal . ”
Tasers have been accused of causing the deaths by cardiac arrest of many people , from meth - intoxicated suspects to even the mentally ill , though the company and law enforcement maintain the device ’s safety and effectiveness .
A request for comment left with Taser International was not answered as of this writing .

Taser International recently launched several new varieties of electric - shock weapons , including a shotgun slug with electrified barbs , the triple - headed “ Tri - Fire X3 ” and , coming soon , a grenade - launcher round that can incapacitate a target from 200 feet .
The study was published by Academic Emergency Medicine .
One of the study ’s authors , Dr. Jeff Ho , is medical director for Taser International .

US - Filmstudio soll patentierten Piraterie - Schutz unberechtigt genutzt haben Volker Briegleb
Ironie der Copyright - Wars : Das US - Filmstudio Warner Bros . [ 1 ] sowie die Kopierwerke Technicolor [ 2 ] und Deluxe [ 3 ] sollen eine Anti-Piraterie - Technologie eingesetzt haben , ohne die Rechte daran zu besitzen .
Mit dem von einem deutschen Branchenexperten erfundenen und mehrfach patentgeschützen [ 4 ]
Verfahren lassen sich Filmkopien optisch und akustisch individuell markieren und eventuelle Raubkopien so auf eine Ursprungskopie zurückverfolgen .
Ein Schweizer Patentverwalter hat nun im Namen des Erfinders die drei US - Unternehmen in New York sowie vor einem deutschen Gericht wegen Patentverletzung verklagt .
Laut US - Klageschrift [ 5 ]
( PDF - Datei ) hat der Erfinder , der in Potsdam ein Unternehmen zur Untertitelung von Filmkopien führt , im September 2003 sein selbstentwickeltes Verfahren bei einem Treffen mit Vertretern von Warner in der brandenburgischen Hauptstadt präsentiert .
Wenig später habe Warner ein deutsches Kopierwerk eingeweiht und erklärt , das Verfahren einsetzen zu wollen .
Bereits im Oktober 2003 seien erste Filmkopien mit dem akustischen Kennzeichen versehen worden .
Technicolor und Deluxe sollen auf Weisung von Warner seit 2004 in Europa Filmkopien mit den Markierungen versehen haben , die seit 2004 in Deutschland unter Gebrauchsmusterschutz [ 6 ] stehen .
Auch nach Vergabe des US - Patents ( Nr. 7,187,633 B2 [ 7 ] ) im März 2007 seien " tausende " so markierte Filmkopien in den USA und Europa in Umlauf gewesen , darunter etwa " Dark Knight " und " Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull " .
Die Kläger werfen Warner mutwillige Patentverletzung vor , weil sie laut Klageschrift seit dem Treffen im September 2003 mehrfach auf die Rechtsverletzung hingewiesen und Unterlassung gefordert haben .
Sie fordern eine Unterlassungsverfügung sowie einen vom Gericht festzusetzenden Schadensersatz , der nicht niedriger als " angemessene Lizenzgebühren " sein soll .
Weil die Rechtsverletzung mutwillig geschehen sei , soll die Summe verdreifacht werden .
Wasserzeichen oder andere Markierungen für Filmkopien gehören seit einigen Jahren zum Arsenal der von der Filmindustrie gegen die " Piraterie " eingesetzten Mittel .
Ob das von Warner angeblich eingesetzte Verfahren dem in den Patenten beschriebenen Methoden entspricht , werden nun die Gerichte zu klären haben .
Vertreter der Kläger und Warner Bros. haben zu dem Vorgang bisher keine Stellungnahme abgegeben . ( vbr [ 8 ] )

Wearing T - shirts with the American flag is now “ incendiary , ” “ disrespectful , ” and of course racist … in America .
On Cinco de Mayo , five students at a California public school were reprimanded and ordered to remove American - flag inspired apparel … in America .
During a lunch break , four students claim that the vice principal asked two students to remove their stars - and - stripes bandannas and for the other two to turn their American flag T - shirts inside out .
“ They said we could wear it on any other day , ” student Daniel Galli told NBC Bay Area .
“ But today is sensitive to Mexican - Americans because it ’s supposed to be their holiday so we were not allowed to wear it today . ”
Galli and his friends also say school administrators at Live Oak High School – a school with a predominant Mexican - American student - body – called their apparel “ incendiary . ”
“ They said if we tried to go back to class with our shirts not taken off , they said it was defiance and we would get suspended , ” Dominic Maciel , also involved in the incident said .
Although Maciel ’s mother defended her son – calling the entire situation “ absolutely ridiculous ” – Annica Nunez , a fellow student at Live Oak High , argued the boys should be the ones apologizing .
“ I think they should apologize cause it is a Mexican Heritage Day , ” Nunez said .
“ We do n’t deserve to be get disrespected like that .
We would n’t do that on Fourth of July . ”
In the aftermath of the incident , film critic Roger Ebert tweeted :
“ Kids who wear American Flag t- shirts on 5 May should have to share a lunchroom table with those who wear a hammer and sickle on 4 July ”

Not content with the sheer badassery of sending a humanoid robot to the moon in 2015 , Japan has just unveiled a mission for 2020 that will involve setting up a whole robotic moon base .
It will be unmanned in the flesh - and - blood sense , but will be populated with a 660 pound rolling bot .
The station will be self - powered , and will let its citizen roam over 60 + miles of terrain , gathering scientific samples that can be sent back to earth .
While rocks are great , we 're even more excited about the HDTV the station will be beaming back as well .
The whole project will run somewhere in the ballpark of $ 2.2 , and will be developed simultaneously with Japan 's manned moon program .
We 're going to get working on our " I 'm 660 pound a scientific exploration robot " costume right away .
Operation Top Kill has been suspended since 2:30 a.m. on Friday , an anonymous technician tells the New York Times .
We 're not sure how bad this could be , and BP 's press office clearly gives very little guidance .
BP spokesman Graham McEwen told us the live cam wo n't show anything valuable because " those kind of procedures are happening in the blowout preventer , and you can only see the outside of the blowout preventer . "
That said , let us know what you see .
" Poor farmers in Haiti are burning genetically modified seeds given to them by Monsanto .
Such seeds are intended to indebt farmers to Monsanto , so that they must buy seeds each year from the corporation , rather than allow a part of their crop to " go to seed " and provide free natural seeds for the following planting season , the traditional farming method . "

Since the launch of the HTC Hero and HTC Sense , it ’s been no secret that HTC is a few steps ahead of the competition when it comes to Android development .
Motorola tried to launch their own custom UI and social media integration with MOTOBLUR , but reaction from the masses has been disappointing .
Motorola hoped to give people the social integration they thought they wanted but forgot that a smartphone ’s UI needs to be gorgeous as well as functional .
On the other hand , HTC ’s Sense UI has been a phenomenal success .
Developers have been porting Sense to every Android phone they can get their hands on ( that includes the Motorola DROID ) so it ’s no surprise that HTC seems to be willing to share the love .
We have heard from a highly trusted source that HTC and Motorola are entering into a limited licensing agreement which would allow Motorola to port HTC Sense UI to Motorola ’s Android phones .
They ( Motorola ) realized it would be in their best interest to adopt their ( HTC ) build rather than compete head to head .
As part of the deal , HTC has agreed to integrate some of the MOTOBLUR widgets into Sense UI with added customization .
Further , the remote wipe and backup features will be included in future builds of Sense .
If you ’re a HTC fan and feel a little betrayed by all this , there ’s some good news in all this .
HTC loyalists will be happy to hear that Motorola will not be getting the full Sense experience .
Motorola will simply be licensing the Rosie engine which will allow them to create more functional widgets on the home screen and add a lot more UI magic to MOTOBLUR equipped handsets .
We are not sure what the details of the agreement are , but I would n’t put it past HTC to eventually put the Rosie home replacement app on the market and make is available to all Android phones sometime in the future .
As much as HTC is about innovation , they are always worried about their bottom line .
If Joe Lieberman ’s totalitarian plan to give the State Department authority to strip Americans of their citizenship is implemented , all those protections that citizens enjoy that are currently deprived from non-citizens would be a chimera .
Since 9/11 , the government has treated citizens and non-citizens differently , brutalizing both groups but being especially despotic toward those deemed non-Americans .
In the habeas corpus rulings from the Supreme Court , conservative Antonin Scalia consistently argued that citizens should enjoy far stronger habeas protections than non-citizens — in his dissent for Hamdi ( 2004 ) , Scalia boldly took the most civil libertarian position on the Court ; in Boumediene ( 2008 ) , his infamous dissent was the most anti-habeas .
The grounds for his distinction were largely the issue of citizenship .
Conservatives have long been inconsistent on the concept of natural law .
They say our rights come from God or human nature , but then turn around and say non-citizens do not have the same rights citizens have .
But in any event , if Lieberman ’s horrid idea comes to pass , the existence of citizenship will be contingent upon whether the State Department determines that a person has conspired with terrorist groups .
This is a dangerous proposal for many reasons .
First , what constitutes terrorism and being an enemy of the United States has been somewhat up in the air over the last several years .
Especially with the new Brown Scare aimed at the populist right , mainstream conservatives , libertarians , militia groups , violent extremists and everyone in between , we see the threat of a left - liberal administration cracking down on dissent with ever more despotic tools at its disposal .
Many of us warned conservatives that every precedent against civil liberties established under the Bush years could come back to haunt us under a liberal regime , and here we see it beginning to happen .
Second , if due process is contingent upon citizenship , which can be taken away at the whim of the State Department ’s designation of someone as a terrorist ally , then we have a genuine Catch - 22 .
Without due process and habeas , how do we know if someone is a terrorist ?
If the government is able to eliminate due process because someone is a terrorist , without using due process to determine that he in fact is one , we have here a situation of true Alice - in - Wonderland justice .
Sadly , many left - liberals are jumping on the war on terrorism bandwagon now that a man they love , rather than one they despise , is in charge of the project .
Perhaps conservatives will snap out of their love of the national - security state and see that tyranny is indeed most likely to come , as Madison is quoted as saying , in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy .
Conservative Glenn
Beck is taking the right position on the due process question as it relates to the alleged Times Square attempted bomber , as leftist Robert Scheer notes .
We need all the dissent we can if we are to turn back this most frightening tide of totalitarianism .
About 25 years ago , a group of Southern California train enthusiasts made either the best or the worst investment of their lives , depending on how you look at it .
For the grand sum of $ 1 , they bought the Santa Fe 3751 , a 430 - ton locomotive that had once played a seminal role in introducing high - capacity , high - speed passenger rail service to the West .
Then they set out to get the thing working again , which wound up taking five years , $ 1.3 million , including cash outlay and in - kind contributions , and the work of nearly 400 volunteers .
Now , the 3751 is about to make a triumphant return to the public rails , the latest turn in what has been both a glorious and tortuous history .
On May 1 and 2 , the locomotive will ferry as many as 500 people between Los Angeles and San Diego , pulling 10 Amtrak cars .
The train will depart from Los Angeles the morning of May 1 and return from San Diego the next day .
Arrangements for single - day , down - and - back travel are also available .
Proceeds from the trip will be used to cover the $ 50,000 yearly cost of maintaining and housing the locomotive .
Information can be found at goldenstaterails.com .
The Santa Fe railroad ordered the 3751 in 1927 ; with an unusual wheel configuration known as a “ 4 - 8 - 4 , ” it was the first of its kind .
It operated until 1955 , primarily between California and the Midwest , but also in New Mexico and Colorado .
“ It started a whole new class of high - speed passenger engines , ” said Fred Hill , a director of the nonprofit San Bernardino Railroad Historical Society , which serves as the locomotive ’s caretaker .
“ This was the Cadillac of steam in its heyday . ”
The society ( whose name is misleading because it has long been based in Los Angeles ) bought the weather - beaten locomotive from the city of San Bernardino in 1986 .
In the 1990s , after the restoration effort , the train enthusiasts took the locomotive on a handful of trips .
But the engine was stalled again after Santa Fe merged with Burlington Northern Railroad in 1996 .
The new corporate ownership felt no compulsion to accommodate an outdated engine from a defunct company , Hill said .
“ We became a historical nuisance , ” he said .
In recent years , the train enthusiasts have labored to ride again .
The 3751 has been permitted a few times to pull passenger cars to San Diego , the Grand Canyon and elsewhere .
“ We really had to prove ourselves , ” Hill said .
“ We ’re pretty proud of that . ”
Recent trips , however , were limited largely to private passenger cars .
Now , the enthusiasts are preparing for the largest public offering of tickets in the locomotive ’s new life .
Recently , roughly two dozen volunteers began preparing for the trip at a rail yard east of downtown Los Angeles .
Getting the locomotive running is an immensely complex task .
For instance , the group must boil 5,000 gallons of water to begin running the locomotive , but must heat it slowly in the boiler .
Otherwise , the stress can damage the train ’s metal components .
Sitting in the engineer ’s compartment , Bob Kittel , another board member and a founding volunteer , said the group had added a sprinkling of modern concessions , including a new radio and an electronic device that can activate the old air brakes in a hurry if needed .
But the train runs just as it always has , harnessing steam created by burning fuel at temperatures reaching 2,400 degrees in the firebox at a rate of 12 gallons per mile .
Kittel will serve as the “ fireman ” for the trip to San Diego , maneuvering a series of valves that control steam to match the actions of the engineer , who will sit on the opposite side of the cab controlling the throttle , brakes and train handling .
Kittel looked relaxed in the cab , though he was surrounded by a dizzying nest of valves , gauges , pipes and pulleys , all affixed with old - time -y labels : Atomizer , Blowback , Dynamo .
“ After a while , it ’s like living in your house — you know where all the light switches are and how to walk around in the dark , ” he said .
“ This is no different . ”

Google 's open sourcing of the VP8 codec as part of the WebM project has been applauded by companies and organisations around the world , but doubts persist about the code , the licence and patents .
With the establishing of the HTML5 < video > element for video playback , and the split between browser makers who implement the licensed H.264 standard ( Apple , Microsoft ) and those who implement Ogg Theora ( Mozilla , Opera ) , there was a danger that video on the web would be split into two camps .
Google hopes WebM will bridge that gap by offering a codec which all browser makers could use , and which could possibly be incorporated into the W3C HTML5 specification as a requirement .
Following Google 's WebM launch several companies were able to make official statements .
In an opening post on the WebM project blog , Google linked to statements of support from a range of companies , including MIPS , Texas Instruments , Skype and NVIDIA .
Mozilla 's Christopher Blizzard detailed the browser makers reasons for support of VP8 ; " We 're extremely excited to see Google joining us to support Open Video " .
Collabora were able to announce that they had been working with Google and the WebM project .
Developer Christian Schaller said that they were now able to commit patches to the GStreamer framework to enable VP8 and WebM encoding , decoding and streaming and hope to offer RTP streaming soon .
The Xiph.org foundation , who have been developing Ogg Theora and other open media formats for the internet , announced their support of WebM with Xiph's Christopher " Monty " Montgomery saying in a blog post titled " I , for one , welcome out new WebM overlords " , that " Of course we ( Xiph ) support WebM .
This is great news for open source , open media , and our own plans at Xiph count on WebM succeeding " .
Even Microsoft announced that , IE9 would be capable of playing back WebM video , providing that a WebM / VP8 codec library had been installed , though stopped short of saying they would be prepared to pre-install WebM support .
Adobe have confirmed that they will be supporting WebM in Adobe Flash Player .
But there are doubts about WebM too .
It was noted early on that although WebM is being described as open source , the actual licence it has been released under , a modified BSD licence which includes a patent licence , has not been approved by the Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) , which has traditionally blessed licences as " open source " .
Google has not yet approached OSI for that approval .
Others saw technical problems .
In a detailed technical analysis , Jason Garrett - Glaser , current primary x264 developer , rated the VP8 spec as " a bit better than H.264 Baseline Profile and VC - 1 " but said that " It 's not even close to competitive with H.264 Main or High Profile " .
He concluded that " VP8 is not ready for prime time ; the specification is a pile of copy - pasted C code and the encoder 's interface is lacking in features and buggy .
They are n't even ready to finalise the bitstream format , let alone switch the world over to VP8 " .
Garret - Glaser also touched on similarities between H.264 and WebM which could lead to patent issues with the MPEG - LA .
Florian Meuller , campaigner against software patents , went further , telling The H that " Google says it holds certain patents on the VP8 video codec that is part of WebM , but there 's no assurance that Google 's patents are the only patents required " .
He worries that third parties could assert patents against VP8 and called on Google to perform a " well - documented patent clearance " , adding " the patent question really is a critical one " .

Even if they are actually “ only a bit better at surviving radiation than ” humans , it has often been theorized that only cockroaches might withstand a nuclear blast and “ inherit the earth . ”
A Capitol Hill newspaper sheds some light on a secretive group using that nickname .
Roll Call ’s Paul Singer reports , “ Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger ( D - Md. ) hangs out with Cockroaches . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
These are not the crunchy , skittery kind of cockroaches that terrorize your kitchen , but the well - shod Washington insider kind that gather several times a year for a high - powered confab on defense and intelligence matters .
The Cockroaches are a venerable Washington , D.C. , institution that has apparently never been written about , a kind of not - so - secret society for several hundred current and former defense intelligence officials , private - sector contracting firms , lobbyists , Congressional staffers and Members of Congress .
The group meets every other month or so for off - the - record dinners to discuss new developments in defense and intelligence , and to swap war stories , literally and figuratively . ….
At the center of the Cockroaches are Gary Sojka and Michael Swetnam , two former staffers who decided to start a supper club .
Swetnam worked in the White House in the George H.W. Bush administration , and Sojka was a staff member on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees .
The idea was to continue to share information and stay connected to official Washington and each other , they said .
Sojka also launched the lobbying firm Potomac Advocates Ã¢â‚¬â€ though he points out that his firm does more strategic advising than lobbying these days .
Swetnam runs a think tank / research center called the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies , which he and Sojka founded to replace the independent scientific advisory capacity that Congress lost when the Office of Technology Assessment was shut down in 1995 .
The institute takes nearly all of its funding from government contracts and occasional earmarks , but it is prohibited from lobbying , Swetnam said .
An online bio adds , “ From 1990 to 1992 , Mr. Swetnam served as a Special Consultant to President Bush ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board ( PFIAB ) where he provided expert advice on Intelligence Community issues including budget , community architecture , and major programs .
He also assisted in authoring the Board ’s assessment of Intelligence Community support to Desert Storm / Shield . ”
While , Sojka also is a “ seasoned Republican fund - raiser and a registered lobbyist . ”
The Potomac Institute website only briefly alludes to the group :
On February 11 , 2009 , the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies hosted a special private dinner event in D.C. featuring General James E. Cartwright , Vice Chairman o f the Joint Chiefs of Staff , as the keynote speaker .
General Cartwright , who is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Nation ’s second highest ranking military officer , addressed the audience of about 150 guests about the importance of cyber security to our national security efforts .
This event was one of six that the Potomac Institute hosts during the year as part of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ CockroachesÃ¢â‚
¬
Â dinner event series for invited guests from the defense and intelligence communities .

More from the Roll Call story :
The group is a classic only - in - Washington establishment .
The express purpose is to provide government officials , Members of Congress and staff , and private - sector experts in defense and intelligence the opportunity to mingle , network and discuss broad topics of interest in an off - the - record social setting .
The odd name is a reference to the notion that only cockroaches would survive nuclear war .
According to the groupÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s prospectus , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ election years in Washington often lead to change in the controlling party in Congress or the Administration .
Politically this event is similar to a nuclear explosion in that most seniors must resign or are asked to leave .
The survivors often move from Congress to the Administration or to industry or back into Congress .
Since scientists have stated that the only living things that might survive a nuclear blast are cockroaches the group adopted the name to signify our ability to survive political change in Washington DC.

The article notes , “ Several staff members from the Senate Armed Services Committee used to be regular attendees , the men said , but Chairman Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) has recently discouraged staff from attending out of concern about accepting free meals from the group . ”
But Sojka and Swetnam said the dinners are not an opportunity for private companies to lobby military officials for assistance with specific projects .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ This is not a forum where anybody Ã¢â‚¬â€ a lobbyist or a corporate guy Ã¢â‚¬â€ trying to work an issue with a Hill guy or a Defense guy would be anything but shunned , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Swetnam said .
Sojka added that while the Cockroaches group includes many members from private companies , most of them are not clients of Potomac Advocates , and very few are lobbyists .
For all of its secrecy Ã¢â‚¬â€ the events are not advertised , all meetings are off - the - record and it is hard to find anybody willing to discuss their involvement Ã¢â‚¬â€  Sojka , Nichols and Swetnam insist it is a very open organization .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ People just ask to come , and weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve never turned anyone away , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Sojka said .
Events are announced to a mailing list , but Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve never invited anyone to join , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  he said .

In fact , Wheeler graduated in 2005 from Caesar Rodney High School , a public school in Kent County , Del. , and was a Bowdoin College student for two years until 2007 , when he was suspended for academic dishonesty , according to Bowdoin and court records .
At the time Wheeler was informed of his suspension , he was completing his transfer application to Harvard .
He also included a full transcript from Andover that indicated he had graduated and held a diploma from the school .
The MIT transcript he submitted indicated perfect grades from his first year there , according to the documents .
In addition , he submitted letters of recommendation from four MIT professors and the director of college counseling at Andover , essays discussing his time at MIT , and official documents from The College Board indicating he had received a perfect SAT score of 1600 in March 2005 .
In court documents , authorities laid out the intricate life they say Wheeler concocted to gain admission to one of the world ’s most selective universities , where he enrolled as a transfer student in 2007 .
In his Harvard application , he said he had graduated from Phillips Academy , an elite prep school in Andover , and attended MIT .
A Harvard spokesman said yesterday that federal privacy laws prevent the university from discussing individual cases .
Wheeler was dismissed from Harvard in October .
Calls to Wheeler ’s Milton , Del. , home were not returned yesterday .
Attempts to reach his lawyer were not successful .
Leone also highlighted what he said was the financial toll from Wheeler ’s alleged deeds : more than $ 45,000 in grants , scholarship , and financial aid money awarded to him “ based on lies and reproductions of other people ’s hard work . ’’
“ This defendant seriously undermined the integrity of the competitive admissions process , compromised the reputation of some of the finest educators and educational institutions in the country , and cheated those who competed honestly for what he fraudulently received , ’’ Middlesex District Attorney Gerard T. Leone Jr. said in a statement .
Wheeler was indicted yesterday on charges of larceny and identity fraud , among other charges .
If proven , the charges — he is also accused of falsely claiming to have attended MIT and Phillips Academy and coauthored several books — suggest a student on a fraudulent quest for advancement at all costs , and raise questions about how he nearly got away with it .
After two years of blending into campus life and racking up academic prizes and tens of thousands of dollars in grants and scholarships , Wheeler allegedly upped the ante :
The 23 - year - old senior applied for the prestigious Rhodes and Fulbright scholarships last fall using falsified credentials , including a fake transcript and work he plagiarized from a Harvard professor , said investigators .
He crafted an elaborate web of lies to con his way into Harvard University , authorities say , but Adam B .
Wheeler was n’t content to graduate quietly and get away with just a degree .
The recommendations Wheeler had submitted to Harvard carried the signatures of professors at Bowdoin , not MIT , according to court documents .
All the professors have told officials they never wrote a recommendation for Wheeler , and some said they did not even know him , the documents say .
A subpoena sent to The College Board revealed that Wheeler ’s SAT scores from the two times he took the test were 1160 and 1220 , in March and November 2004 , the court documents show , well below the 1600 he asserted .
Wheeler paid attention to small details , according to an official in the prosecutors ’ office .
Harvard personnel have reported his recommendations and transcripts arrived on the appropriate letterhead from the other schools .
During a mandatory interview with a Harvard alumnus on the Bowdoin campus in April 2007 , Wheeler presented himself as an MIT freshman hoping to transfer .
When the interviewer asked what an MIT student was doing in Brunswick , Maine , Wheeler said that his spring courses at MIT did not require exams so he finished up his work and moved to Bowdoin mid-semester to work for a professor as a student assistant , court documents say .
Wheeler ’s alleged charade began to unravel last fall during Harvard ’s interview process for the Rhodes and Fulbright scholarships .
His application packet contained glowing recommendations from Harvard professors , a resume listing numerous books he had coauthored , lectures he had given , and courses he had taught , according to court documents .
He also allegedly doctored a transcript to make himself a straight - A student .
Court documents show Wheeler had a far less impressive record — some A’s , a few B’s , and a D .
Harvard officials found him to be an “ exceptionally strong candidate ’’ who , pending his final interview , was likely to receive the college ’s endorsement for one or both of the scholarships , the documents said .
But James Simpson , a Harvard English professor , sensed that something was awry in September .
Upon reviewing Wheeler ’s application , Simpson discovered Wheeler had plagiarized the work of Stephen Greenblatt , another Harvard English professor , and notified university officials , court documents say .
Neither Simpson nor Greenblatt , a noted scholar of Renaissance literature , responded to calls for comment yesterday .
When confronted and offered a chance to share his side of the story at a disciplinary hearing , Wheeler told his resident dean that he was going to leave Harvard and would not attend the hearing .
That is when Harvard officials dug deeper and discovered the scope of Wheeler ’s alleged scheme .
University officials then found that the recommendation letters Wheeler submitted for the Rhodes and Fulbright scholarships , which were written by three professors , had been altered or expanded upon .
Harvard officials also learned that Wheeler won two Harvard writing prizes using a submission plagiarized nearly word for word from a dissertation by a Cornell University graduate student , according to court documents .
Those who knew Wheeler at Harvard describe him as personable , if a bit of a loner .
“ I was just knocked silly by this , ’’ said one Harvard professor , speaking on condition of anonymity , who likened Wheeler ’s fabrications to a scenario from the film “ The Talented Mr. Ripley . ’’
“ There ’s something that ’s pathological there .
And it ’s something that seems to me that needs care and clinical treatment , rather than incarceration . ’’
After his dismissal from Harvard in October , Wheeler did not sit idly .
Three months later , he applied for an internship at McLean Hospital , Harvard Medical School ’s psychiatric hospital .
The hospital concluded that Wheeler had fabricated his background , prosecutors said .
In the meantime , Wheeler once again submitted transfer applications — this time to Yale and Brown universities .
In his applications , Wheeler said he was interning at McLean and included two false letters of recommendation , the documents show .
Wheeler is being held by Cambridge police pending his arraignment this morning at Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn .
He is charged with four counts of larceny over $ 250 , eight counts of identity fraud , seven counts of falsifying an endorsement or approval , and pretending to hold a degree .

I was in a chat room the other day and witnessed something that I saw many times before .
There was myself and a sub in the room when another " Dom " entered .
He proceeded to chat with the sub telling her how she should behave and what a sub is suppose to do .
It was interesting because I never once saw him present himself as worthy of being a Dom .
Again , just because he says he is one , does it make it so ?
If that is the case , then I am an astronaut .
This is an example of how blind obedience can be dangerous .
Now , I am not saying this person was not a real Dom nor that he lacks the ability to control .
I have no way of knowing .
The point is that if a sub follows blindly in a situation like this , he or she might end up getting hurt .
Sadly , this is something that I see all too often .
Many would feel that nobody would follow an individual of this nature without knowing anything about him .
If you believe this , then I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you .
Many will " submit " at the drop of a hat .
They are so desperate to find someone to " own " them , that they go for anyone who claims to be dominant .
This is occurring everyday in chat rooms all over the place .
My regular readers know that safety is of the highest concern .
I promote this every chance I can .
One needs to be willing to look out for his or her safety regardless of whether a Dom or a sub .
Certainly , the onus should fall to the Dom .
However , many do not take that seriously .
This is why a sub needs to be attentive to what is transpiring and say " no " if he or she is put in jeopardy .
Obedience is a fundamental premise of this lifestyle .
Nevertheless , there is a line to anything that involves consent .
Disobeying because you do not like the idea of something is inappropriate .
However , if you ( or your children ) are put in danger , then it is time to stop the proceedings .
Blind obedience can be fatal .
Remember this tidbit the next time you are chatting with someone .
In my recent , much - discussed row with the Liberal Democrats ' Simon Hughes on BBC1's Question Time , I made the mistake of betting on - air that his party 's coalition with the Conservatives would collapse within two years .
In the ensuing days , as I watched the Cameron - Clegg affair bloom and prosper , and the blissful honeymoon continue , I worried that Hughes might be proved right and this coalition government might survive for the full five years .
But in recent days , my doubts have returned .
The Tories have repeatedly reminded their Lib Dem allies that they are in charge , and that the tail does not wag this particular dog .
Take yesterday 's Queen 's Speech .
Here 's how today 's Times begins its coverage of the speech :
David Cameron tilted the coalition away from the Liberal Democrats with a Queen 's Speech that defined tax , immigration and police reform on Conservative terms .
In the main article , Roland Watson , Francis Elliott and Sam Coates highlight
a commitment to lower taxation , the first time since the coalition was formed that such a pledge has been made .
Nick Clegg told the Times last week that the government 's priority was to rebalance the tax burden , not to reduce it .
Last week 's coalition programme promised " more competitive , simpler , greener and fairer " tax , but no mention of lower taxation .
And here is the standfirst on the Guardian cover story :
Tory hostility to [ electoral ] reform could disrupt coalition
In the main article , Patrick Wintour says :
The Conservatives said . . . that the bill on AV would also contain measures to reduce the number of constituencies by as much as 10 per cent and to equalise their size -- a complex , controversial and time - consuming measure that will benefit the Tories .
The Lib Dems say the referendum can be held before the boundary review is complete as long as the legislation has been passed setting the constituency boundary review in train .
But some senior Conservative sources were hinting the boundary review would have to be under way before the AV referendum could be staged , so delaying its date .
Meanwhile , the Daily Mail 's Tim Shipman writes :
Liberal Democrats and Tories are on collision course over plans to tear up the first - past - the - post election system .
The government published plans yesterday for a bill to hold a referendum on bringing in the Alternative Vote system .
But there was immediate disagreement between the coalition partners over when the public will have their say .
. . .
Senior Lib Dems fear that if there is a delay , any nationwide vote on electoral reform would simply be seen as a referendum on the government itself , with voters punishing them at the ballot box .
But Tories declared next May " much too soon " for a referendum on electoral reform , voicing the view that it will not be held before autumn 2011 and " could be later than that " .
The Tories are playing a dangerous game .
Electoral reform has long been the Holy Grail for Liberal Democrats .
Indeed , it was Cameron 's unexpected concession of a referendum on AV , on the evening of Monday 10 May , that helped him -- finally !
-- seal the deal with Clegg .
It would have been impossible for the Lib Dems to join a coalition with the Tories without the referendum promise .
And if , in the coming months , they believe that their Conservative partners are intent on dragging their feet and delaying a vote on electoral reform , the Lib Dems may start looking for the exit .
Otherwise , they risk being steamrollered by the Tories -- both in office and at the next , first - past - the - post general election .
On a related note , and as today 's Independent reminds us , I was amused to see Simon Hughes , of all people , not quite on board the Cleggeron project in the Commons yesterday :
It 's the end of another school year , and that means it 's time for college students all over the country to pull late nights finishing up term papers .
But to any of you out there that might be feeling frustrated , take heart :
You 're not alone !
Your favorite super - heroes have been through the same thing .
That 's why we here at ComicsAlliance dug through their permanent records to bring you six super - hero term papers !

KABUL ( Reuters ) -
The NATO - led force in Afghanistan acknowledged on Sunday it had killed five Afghan civilians , including three women , during a botched night raid on a home in the southeast of the country in February .
Civilian casualties during operations by foreign forces cause deep anger among Afghans and President Hamid Karzai has called for night raids to be banned .
“ International forces were responsible for the deaths of three women who were in the same compound where two men were killed by the joint Afghan - international patrol searching for a Taliban insurgent , ” the alliance said in a statement .
NATO said its troops had entered the house on February 12 in Gardez district of Paktia province , believing an insurgent was inside .
They killed the two men because they carried weapons , although later learned they were not insurgents .
“ We now understand that the men killed were only trying to protect their families , ” Brigadier General Eric Tremblay , spokesman for NATO - led forces , said in the statement .
The three women were killed during the shooting , NATO said .
NATO had earlier said its troops had found the women already killed , bound and gagged , but later acknowledged that this was untrue .
Troops who visited the scene had made the mistake after seeing the bodies bound in preparation for burial , it said .
Reducing the civilian deaths caused by his troops has been a central focus of General Stanley McChrystal , the commander of NATO and U.S. forces , who took over in the middle of 2009 promising a new strategy to protect Afghans .
In March , McChrystal issued new orders to his troops calling for restrictions on night raids , though not an outright ban , saying that despite their tactical value they had come at a “ steep cost in terms of perceptions of the Afghan people . ”
The United Nations says foreign and Afghan government troops killed 25 percent fewer civilians last year than in 2008 .
Civilian deaths rose overall , because the number killed by insurgents rose 40 percent , making last year the war ’s deadliest .

Going into tonight ’s game , the Devils sit in fourth place , two points behind the Pittsburgh Penguins for the Atlantic Division lead with seven games left .
That ’s important to note , because the difference in points puts the Devils fourth in the conference , while the Penguins sit in second place .
And while two spots might not seem like a huge deal , the Devils road to the Cup may depend on their conference position come playoff time .
There ’s no doubt the Devils want the second seed going into the playoffs .
It gives them home - ice advantage for the first two series , and they could avoid the Washington Capitals until the conference finals .
Also , if the standings remain the same and only New Jersey moves into second , the Devils would play Montreal in the first round .
This would be a great matchup .
The Devils play well against Montreal , and they play good hockey on the road in the Bell Centre .
Not only that , but Martin Brodeur owns his hometown team .
The future Hall - of - Famer ’s career record against the Canadiens is 38 - 16 - 0 with five ties .
I think Brodeur ’s record alone shows the importance of grabbing the second seed .
The Devils can play a team they dominate , and they also earn home - ice advantage .
The most important part of the number two seed is avoiding the Capitals for the first two rounds .
The Devils are 3 - 1 - 0 against the Capitals this season , and they would probably play well against them .
But facing the Capitals early could be trouble .
Why not get the higher seed and face them for the chance to win the conference ?
Their goaltending might not be great , and the defense might be spotty .
But the Capitals are the best team in the league , and with the way Jose Theodore is playing right now , they could be a hot team coming into the playoffs .
Clinching the second seed allows the Devils to completely avoid them , making the first and second round series potentially easier .
The fourth seed would take away several of the advantages of the second seed .
The Devils could only clinch home - ice advantage for one round , and they would probably have to face the Capitals in the second round .
The Devils are 3 - 0 - 0 against the Senators , currently the fifth place team .
While the first - round may not be tough , the second seed increases the chances of seeing the Sabres or the Capitals in the second round .
Both teams present a daunting opponent .
Not only that , but the second - round matchup would give the other team home - ice advantage .
The second seed is the most desirable position for the Devils .
By taking fourth , they ’ll miss out on several advantages , including getting home - ice for the first two rounds of the playoffs .
Also , the Devils will be able to avoid a matchup with the Capitals until the conference semifinals , if both teams make it that far .
With only seven games left , the Devils need to make a push for the second seed .
With a game in hand and only a two point deficit , there is no reason why the team ca n’t leapfrog Pittsburgh for the Atlantic Division crown – and the number two seed .
An article in Foreign Policy magazine on how the catastrophic Gulf oil spill ( which is still uncontained and now reaching the Louisiana shoreline ) is an excellent opportunity the public to finally see through BP 's decade - long greenwashing campaign :
A decade ago , the company then known as British Petroleum launched a multimillion dollar advertising campaign to rebrand itself as the greenest of oil giants .
Since then , it has gone only by the initials " BP " and has popularized a new slogan : " Beyond Petroleum . "
The campaign launched with a $ 200 million public relations and advertising budget and a new logo featuring the now - ubiquitous green - and - yellow sunburst .
Ten years later , the company still spends big on advertising , dropping $ 76 million on radio and TV ads touting its image in the United States just last year .
The campaign has paid off for the company .
A customer survey in 2007 found that BP had by far the most environmentally friendly image of any major oil company .
That year , the " Beyond Petroleum " campaign also won the Gold Award from the American Marketing Association .
The company reported that between 2000 and 2007 , its brand awareness jumped from 4 percent to 67 percent and sales rose steadily .

I am Ex CEO of mid sized Wall Street Firm .
Known for equity research ; reasonably good trading ; acceptable Investment Banking .
Now retired
Equity Block Trader early in career .
May have traded more 1,000,000 share blocks than anyone over 10 year period .
Executed 1st program trade that I am aware of .
Manually handled blocks of stock vs options on the XMI for expiration October of 1983 .
Oversaw global equity trading , for top 5 firm .
Was senior trader and oversaw hedge book during 87 crash .
Still have time and sales from that day for all trades on NYSE .
Can read the tape as well as most .
I cannot come up with any explanation for market activity for last 15 months other than treasury intervention .
Probability of other explanation is nonexistent .
But if that is the case … and I was Tim , how would I work it …starting in March 09 .
1 ) I would only have one … at most two … firms involved .
And only 3 - 4 at those firms … although it is more likely 10 .
( My bet is JPM ) .
2 ) I would assume that I had TARP money or other unaudited Fed money to work with ( ZH has documented past documents that tangentially referenced this possibility ) and it would be north of 10B allocated .
With leverage thru the loan process … much bigger .
3 ) I would –as you have suggested – wash the order thru liquidity loans to my 1 or 2 firms ; with the understanding that they would buy equities that they would then deposit as collateral for such loans .
That way I could almost time my equity support for the market with a notional understanding that I wanted the “ collateral ” created and posted in a very short time frame .
4 ) Not on paper , but at the coffee house , I would discuss how I generally would support a steady underlying bid to keep sell - offs limited .
To use quieter times to make the push ( as ZH points out … rainy days and Mondays never get them down ) .
Now I suspect they started with noble intentions .
The Minneapolis bridge is out and we need an alternative for just a short period .
But it worked so well , that their 10B investment thru leverage and gains became worth a great deal more and now they were working with house money .
Even if they ever got audited ; they had a winning trade .
And even better , they could make some losing trades and still be ahead of the game .
After all , no side pockets needed .
No outside investor .
No redemption provision at all .
So now we get cute … .
We actually take the market up on light volume … especially since we have VIX low and complacency rampant .
Now I can even sell some volume at an intraday loss .
I am still way ahead of the game … .
And I replenish my capital to keep the support up .
It ’s a inside Ponzi game and I am using my winnings to keep it going .
But … .
Where are the hedge funds ?
Why do they let me get away with this .
Well , I did n’t expect to be able to have this much effect , but I caught them short and then with rates so low that any idiot bank could make money 90 days
In A Row , they turned and stayed with the tide .
I do not think this plan leaked , because if it did , they would have run in front of me in such a major way ; but the tape stayed steady , steady .
But they did appreciate how much help we were for C and friends and they kept their stocks in safe zones .
The only leak was in a soft way to CNBC by telling them we had their back if they had ours .
And I do n’t think they realize the extent to which we appreciated the “ benefits ” of our friends .
And we feel morally OK .
We did a good thing keeping the markets from collapsing .
After all , we are only crafting that temporary bridge , until traffic can resume going 65 mph .
And boy is that taking a long time .
But now it is a drug .
And we have drug money to keep it going .
And we know how the process works .
Se we get O to call Angela and say ; this drug puts the wind at your back .
You have the shorts just where we did – and with that start , you too will soon have a positive trading account that you can lever up .
OPM leveraged up .
But now what …… you would have thought that Larry Liebowitz would have mapped out the joint circuit breakers given his background .
( BTW he is Jon Stewart 's brother )
We ended up selling when we should have been buying and we are now in the negative column ( speculation on authors part ) .
Stay the course .
Trichet to the rescue .
Only one mistake .
Currency markets just a might bit bigger than equity markets .
And one can support the equity markets all day long with enough money but if you take the carry support away … …
And so I think the hangover effect will set in and Uncle Ben will say to Timmy …. that was a terrific and successful experiment .
But I do n’t have more TARP money to double your equity bet .
You can keep your bet on until I get forced to sell some mortgages …. but enough of adding .
Let Trichet carry some water for awhile
………………………..
Author again … so that ’s how I explain light volume during the day , followed by sharp volume bursts down .
Not the algo ’s …. but rather Timmy .
And its like he gives them a dollar amount to raise … and then walks away .
Who knows … it could have even been Timmy who set the Thursday action into motion , but for the first time he did it simultaneously with other large sellers worried about intl markets .
We have met the enemy and he is us .
Good morning Chairman Oberstar , Ranking Member Mica and distinguished Members of the Committee .
I am pleased to be here today to report on my analysis of the disbursement of funds authorized through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .
Using recipient report data from Recovery.gov and economic and political data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the Census Bureau , GovTrack.us , and others , we have compiled a series of facts about stimulus spending .
Our interest is simply to make use of the tens of thousands of stimulus recipient reports recently published on Recovery.gov , and to put the aggregate information contained in those reports in a larger context .
We hope that this report will become part of a regular series as new recipient reports are released each quarter .
The information presented here encompass the data from calendar year 2009 Q4 ( FY 2010 Q1 ) reports of Recovery Act contracts and grants only .
More information about our methodology is provided at the end of this document .
Additionally , the complete dataset used for this report is available for download at www.Mercatus.org.
Basic Facts
A total of 65,084 contracts and grants totaling $ 170 billion were awarded in this second quarter for which Recovery.gov reports are available .
That ’s only an additional $ 13.6 billion reported received this quarter over the previous one , roughly $ 1 billion awarded each week .
The number of jobs claimed as created or saved during this period is 597,153 for the entire $ 170 billion expenditure — an average of $ 285,814.61 per job .
The total number of jobs claimed shrunk from 693,000 .
It is important to understand this point .
The total number of jobs claimed to have been created by the entire stimulus fell overall , not just in the last quarter .
This apparent job destruction may have to do with the changes the White House made on how to count jobs .
The total amount awarded to public entities ( such as municipalities and state agencies ) is $ 93 billion .
However , it is still the case that some of this money may have ultimately found its way to private subgrantees or subcontractors .
The total amount awarded to private contractors and grantees is $ 78 billion .
While public entities received 42 % of the number of all awards , these awards constituted over half of the dollars awarded ( 55 % ) .
In other words , public entities are receiving fewer contracts than private ( 27,230 vs. 37,854 ) , but there is a higher average dollar value on the public awards ( $ 3,417,412 vs. $ 2,050,484 ) .
Party Affiliation
For our analysis , we looked at the 435 congressional districts in the United States plus the District of Columbia , but excluded Puerto Rico and foreign stimulus recipients such as Canada and the US Virgin Islands .
The average number of awards per district is 148 , and the average dollar amount awarded per district is $ 385,932,979 .
In the United States there are 177 districts represented by a Republican and 259 represented by a Democrat .
On average , Democratic districts received 1.53 times the amount of awards that Republicans were granted .
The average number of awards per Republican district is 112 , while the average number of awards per Democratic district is 171 .
Democratic districts also received 2.65 times the amount of stimulus dollars that Republican districts received $ 122 billion vs. $ 46 billion ) .
Republican districts also received smaller awards on average .
The average dollars awarded per Republican district is $ 26 million , while the average dollars awarded per Democratic district is about $ 472 million .
In total , Democratic districts received 73 % of the total stimulus funds awarded and Republican districts received 27 % of the total amount awarded .
Other Political Variables
We checked for correlation ( see tables 1 , 2 ) and computed the predictive power of political and economic indicators on stimulus fund allocation ( see table 4 ) .
A regression analysis ( ordinary least squares ) was used to determine whether either political factors ( Republican or Democrat ) or economic indicators ( e.g. unemployment in a district ) could predict the amount of stimulus funds distribute to a district .
To estimate the influence of those two variable , we included the district representative ’s political party , tenure in office , leadership position , membership on the appropriations committee , as well as for the change in district ’s unemployment from 2007 to 2008 ( the last year with available unemployment data per district ) , mean income ( i.e. , the average income of a given wage earner in the district ) , and the percentage of employed persons working in the construction sector in 2008 , finds that a district ’s representation by a Republican decreases the stimulus funds awarded to it by 41.7 % .
This result underscores the findings from the previous Stimulus Facts report .
This effect is statistically significant at the p < .004 level .
( See regression table at end of document . )
The regression analysis does not seek to explain ( nor does it explain ) precisely how funds were allocated ( our R- squared = .05 ) .
That would require a more complete dataset than has been used for these results .
That is , we wanted to know how much political and economic factors could explain the distribution of funds .
That is different from saying we want to know all of the factors that control distribution of the funds .
We do not have that data nor is it particularly interesting for our purposes .
We have confidence we know how much influence these two variables have , although we do not know how other factors influence the decisions .
In our political calculation ,
We find that there is a slight effect on the amount of stimulus funds allocated based on whether a district voted for John McCain or Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election .
Concretely , while $ 109 billion has been allocated to congressional districts that voted for President Obama ( or 65 % of the total amount allocated ) , $ 59 billion ( or 35 % ) have been allocated to congressional districts that voted for McCain .
It should be noted , however , that there were many more congressional districts that voted for Obama than voted for McCain .
President Obama won 55.6 % of congressional districts and McCain won 44.4 % of these districts .
The districts that voted for President Obama received 40,037 awards ( or 69 % of the total number of awards allocated ) , much more than the districts that voted for candidate McCain ; they received 24,483 awards ( or 31 % of the total number of awards ) .
The average awarded to marginal districts — districts with votes that did not vote overwhelmingly for one candidate or another ( five percent or less difference — is $ 22 million .
That ’s significantly less than the average awarded to non-marginal districts of $ 419 million .
Our regression analysis finds that the stimulus funds awarded to marginal district are decreased by 41 % .
This effect is statistically significant at the p < .033 level .
( See regression table at end of document . )
However , as with Republican representation , the regression analysis does not seek to explain ( nor does it explain ) precisely how funds were allocated ( our R- squared = .05 ) .
House Leadership
As noted earlier , the average congressional district received $ 386 million .
In contrast , the average leadership district ( defined as a district where the representative is part of the majority or minority House political leadership or is a chairman or ranking member of a committee ) received $ 381 million .
The average amount awarded to a leadership district is fairly different depending on whether the leader is a member of the majority or the minority .
The amount awarded to average majority leadership district is $ 351 million while the amount awarded to average minority leadership district is $ 412 million .
Notice that counter - intuitively , only the amounts awarded to the majority leader are less than the amount awarded to the average district and the average non-leadership district , which is $ 387 million .
This is also true of the dollar amount of stimulus money given to the average member of the House Appropriations Committee ( $ 390 million ) and given to the district of the Chairman on the House Appropriations Committee Dave Obey ( $ 52 million ) .
Finally , on average , 148 contracts or grants were awarded to each congressional district .
The number of awards to the average leadership district is 135 , the number of awards to average majority leadership district is 169 , and the number of awards to average minority leadership district is 101 .
The average non-leadership district received 150 awards , which is more than the number of awards to the average leadership district .
To sum up our results on political variables , we find that there is a slight positive correlation between the percentage of the district that voted for President Obama and the amount of stimulus funding that a district received .
This weak correlation ( correlation = .172 ) may however be coincidental ( see table 3 , Figure F ) .
Also , our results find no statistically significant effect of legislator ’s tenure , membership on House Appropriations Committee or leadership position on stimulus funds allocated while seem to be a small negative effect of Republican representation on stimulus fund allocation , this underscores the findings from the previous Stimulus Facts report .
Economic Indicators
We checked the correlation ( see tables 1 , 2 at the end of the document ) and computed the predictive power of economic indicators on stimulus fund allocation ( see table 3 ) .
The scatter plots below reveal that overall there is no correlation between economic indicators and stimulus funding ( see figures A - D ) .
To confirm the lack of correlation we ran a statistical correlation test ( Table 2 ) to check for correlation between economic indicators and the stimulus fund allocation .
It confirmed the scattered plot results .
Unemployment
Controlling for the percentage each district that was employed in the construction sector , and the median income of the congressional district , we find that the variation in the unemployment rate has no statistical correlation with the allocation of stimulus funding .
I used the variation in unemployment in the construction industry as a proxy for the concentration of recession - vulnerable employment in a district .

Income
Awards were also coded for Metropolitan Statistical Area ’s ( MSA ) based on their ZIP code .
MSAs are large geographical units with an urban center for which the Census Bureau and other agencies compile data .
Chicago - Naperville - Joliet , IL - IN - WI , for example , is an MSA .
Using per capita income data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis , we divided each MSA into quintiles .
Each quintile represents 20 % , or one fifth , of all incomes in that MSA .
As a result , the top quintile ( Q1 ) represents the highest income MSA , and the bottom quintile ( Q5 ) represents the MSA with the lowest income .
Click Image to Enlarge .
Based on the data , we looked at whether the allocations were affected by how high - or how low - income the MSA was .
Based on the total MSA , 39 % of the stimulus funds were allocated to the highest income MSAs and only 1 % to the lowest quintile .
However , using per capita expenditures in MSAs , the highest quintile received fewer dollars ( $ 447 per person ) than the lowest quintile received ( $ 1,163 per person . )
Thus , while high income MSAs received more money than low income MSAs , they also had more people and the result was more money going to low - income people per capita .
See the tables below .
Click Image to Enlarge .
We also checked whether the stimulus allocation was affected based by another measure of income ( average income , below average income . )
Click Image to Enlarge .
As we can see in the above table , MSAs with income above average received 79 percent of the stimulus funds .
MSAs with income below average received only 21 percent of stimulus .
However , when we looked for the amount of dollars per capita received the difference was significantly reduced .
That ’s because MSAs with income above average are more populated than MSAs with income below average .

Methodology
Our methodology is the same as the one we use for our last report , with a few exceptions .
First , we would like to note that the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board has changed the way it defines a year .
Previously , the data was broken down in fiscal year quarters , with the year ending on September 30th 2009 and the last quarter going from July 1st to September 30th .
Now the data is broken down in calendar year quarters .
With this methodology , the data that goes from October 1st to December 31st 2009 is also the last quarter of 2009 .
This is the reason why both our reports mention being an analysis of the 4th quarter of 2009 data .
As for our previous report , we downloaded all 2009 Q4 recipient reports for contracts and grants from the official Recovery.gov website [ 2 ] .
These are self - reports submitted by the recipients of stimulus contracts and grants .
We did not include loans because we are only interested in transfer payments .
We removed all sub-awards from our combined dataset because they simply add up to the primary awards .
Our resulting dataset is a list of every primary contract and grant reported with their corresponding attributes .
Attributes include recipient names and addresses , amounts received , jobs claimed , congressional district , etc .
Each award in the source data has two addresses associated with it : the award recipient 's address and the place of performance address .
These are the same most of the time , but in some cases , they are not .
For example , a pipe manufacturer in Florida might have received a contract for a pipe to be used in New York .
We chose to only use the award recipient address for our analysis because we are interested in the political economy of the awards , i.e. who receives the payment .
Every award has a recipient state and congressional district associated with it .
Almost every state also has awards that are associated with a district “ ZZ . ” Recovery.gov explains ,
“ The code ' ZZ ' appears in the congressional district field as a placeholder if a recipient reported an incorrect or invalid congressional district .
The recipient will correct the congressional district during the next reporting period , beginning January 1 , 2010 . ”
We corrected every erroneous district in our dataset by looking up the correct district number based on the recipient 's ZIP+4 code [ 3 ] .
Every award has a North American Industrial Classification System code associated with it [ 4 ] .
These codes represent the recipient 's industry relevant to the contract .
For example , the code 237110 represents “ Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction . ”
All codes above 920000 represent “ Public Administration , ” i.e. some government entity .
We coded all awards with a code of 920000 and above as “ public ” and all awards with a code below 920000 as “ private . ”
We coded every award as Republican or Democratic based on the current representation of its associated district [ 5 ] .
Awards are also coded as leadership or not .
We assign the leadership code if the member from an award recipient district is part of the majority or minority House political leadership , or a chairman or ranking member of a committee .
We also coded each award with whether the member from the district sits on the appropriations committee .
We coded each award as being in an Obama or McCain district based on which candidate received the most votes in the last presidential election in its recipient district [ 6 ] .
We also coded each award as being in a marginal district or not .
We defined marginal districts as those where the percentage difference between McCain and Obama was five percent or less .
We also coded each award with its corresponding MSA based on the recipient ’s ZIP+ 4 code using a lookup table [ 7 ] .
This allowed us to use MSA population data from the Census Bureau [ 8 ] , and MSA per capita income data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis [ 9 ] .
Our dataset includes awards made to recipients in U.S. territories and foreign countries [ 10 ] .
Awards to these locales total $ 2.4 billion or just 1.41 % of the total represented by all awards .
Because we are interested in the political economy of the awards , we exclude these from most of our questions and use only the data for the 50 states plus the District of Columbia .
With that data , we ran a series of regression analyses using Stata , a widely used statistical software package .
Regression analysis is a statistical tool that helps understand the relationships between variables .
Regression analysis is what helps to identify the causal effect of one variable , and one variable alone , upon another — for example , the effect of the unemployment level in a district upon the allocation of stimulus fund in that district , for example , or the effect of party affiliation upon the that same allocation of resources .
To explore such issues , we assembled data on the underlying variables of interest ( in this case , party leadership , affiliation , variation in unemployment level , or income level and distribution ) .
In order to avoid omitted variable bias , we pulled the economic indicators from the 2008 U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1 - Year Estimates [ 11 ] .
Then , we checked for correlation and computed the predictive power of economic indicators on stimulus fund allocation .
It is important to note that in this report we have changed the way we account for unemployment .
Instead of using the unemployment rate by district , we have used as a proxy for the impact of the recession in a district the change in the unemployment rate in each district between 2007 and 2008 .
2008 is the last year of the unemployment rate per district available at this point .
Using change in unemployment rate allows us to check whether the relative deterioration in unemployment in a district can account of the allocation of stimulus funds as the rationale behind the bill would suggest .
Also , in this report we have used the natural logarithm dollars in our regression rather than untreated dollars .
It offers a more accurate measure of the effects we were looking for .
We found no correlation between economic indicators and stimulus funding .
Preliminary results find no effect of unemployment , median income , or mean income on stimulus funds allocation .
Then , we checked for the correlation between political indicators and stimulus funding .
With the exception of the district ’s party affiliation ( whether the district ’s representation was Republican or Democratic , ) we found no effect of political variables on stimulus funds allocation .
Next , we used regression analysis to estimate the quantitative effect of the causal variables upon the variable that they influence .
For example , when we found that the party affiliation had a causal effect of the allocation of stimulus funds , we looked for how much party affiliation mattered .
The quantitative effects that we estimated are based on our model specification such that with a more completely specified model , these effects would likely change .
Thus , more confidence should be placed on the relationship between the two variables ( i.e. , a causal factor exists ) then on the quantification of that relationship .
Also , we assessed the “ statistical significance ” of the estimated relationships .
That is , the degree of confidence that the true relationship is close to the estimated relationship .
In other words , we assessed how likely we were to be correct .
In all cases , we established that we had 10 out of 10 chances of being right .

Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before this Committee .
I look forward to answering your questions .
Capitalism is Libertarian !
It is clear that the left - libertarians have lost in their campaign to demonize the word “ capitalism . ”
Nice try , fellas , but you lost .
Libertarians are not buying your strained arguments and pointless attempt to fight semantic battles .
Capitalism as a word just means private ownership of the means of production .
I point you to a dictionary .
This is obviously compatible with libertarianism , and arguably an essential part of the economy of an advanced libertarian society .
Crony capitalism and corporatism are unlibertarian , but laissez - faire capitalism is not .
The origin of the term may be interesting but does not change what meaning it has now .
There is nothing wrong with using capitalism to describe a key aspect of a libertarian social order , as long as one is clear to distinguish it from crony - capitalism .
See : Capitalism , Socialism , and Libertarianism ; Rothbard : “ True anarchism will be capitalism , and true capitalism will be anarchism ” ; Reply to Left - Libertarians on “ Capitalism ” ; Left - Libertarians Admit Opposition to “ Capitalism ” is Substantive .
And it is not we libertarians who have things to learn from the left : rather the opposite is true .
We non-prefix libertarians are not left , but we are also not right , and it ’s wrong of left - libertarians to accuse us of being “ right ” merely because we reject the equally confused and false doctrines of the left .
We already know that crony capitalism is wrong .
Furthermore , we are aware of the fact that state intervention has distorted the market .
We also do not just rubber stamp and endorse current land holdings out of some fetish for the status quo ; non-prefix libertarians believe that if someone can show a better claim to a given piece of property than the current legal owner , he should prevail .
But unless and until this occurs , the current legal owner , so long as he is private , has a better claim to the property than anyone else and should be its owner ( property held by the state should be taken from it , of course ) .
Go capitalism , go !
Here is some recommended recent pro-capitalist libertarian reading :

Investigators conclude Israel responsible for forging four Australian passports used in assassination of Hamas operative
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Australia today ordered the expulsion of an Israeli diplomat after investigators concluded that Israel was responsible for forging four Australian passports used in the killing of a Hamas operative in Dubai .
The move follows a similar step by Britain , which expelled an Israeli diplomat in March in retaliation for the use of 12 fake British passports in the assassination of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
Dubai authorities blamed the Israeli Mossad intelligence service for the killing of Mabhouh in January .
The governments of Ireland , Germany and France have yet to reveal how they will react to the similar cases of alleged identity fraud against their citizens revealed in the investigation .
Australia has not expelled a foreign diplomat since 2004 , and the country 's foreign minister , Stephen Smith , told parliament that the operation to kill Mabhouh was not the first time Israel had forged Australian travel documents .
He did not elaborate on previous incidents , but said the latest transgression breached " confidential undertakings " between the two countries that have stood for several years .
" These are not the actions of a friend , " he added .
" This is not what we expect from a nation with whom we have had such a close , friendly and supportive relationship . "
Smith said Israel had been asked to withdraw a diplomat , whom he did not identify , within a week .
The duration of the expulsion is indefinite .
Israeli radio stations have reported that the diplomats expelled from Australia and Britain were Mossad representatives .
Yossi Levy , an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman , told Israel 's Army Radio he was confident that excellent relations between the two countries would continue .
" We regret the Australian move , which in our opinion does not conform to the kind of relations we have with Canberra and their importance , " he said .
The Israeli ambassador to Australia , Yuval Rotem , is out of Australia until early next month .
Smith said Australia had notified the US of its decision because of Canberra 's security alliance with Washington and the close US relationship with Tel Aviv .
It had also informed the United Arab Emirates and all countries whose nationals claimed to have had identities stolen in the case .
He said Australian co-operation with Israel on security and intelligence matters would suffer .
" Clearly , as a result of today 's events , there will be something of a cooling period so far as relevant agencies are concerned and , just as in the United Kingdom , time will tell just how long that may or may not be . "
Israel had not retaliated against Britain 's expulsion of a diplomat and Smith said he would be disappointed if Tel Aviv did so against Australia .
Dubai authorities have identified at least 26 suspects from an alleged hit squad .
Smith said : " The high quality of these counterfeited passports points to the involvement of a state intelligence service . "
He added that Australia 's investigation , carried out by police and intelligence services , " left the government in no doubt that Israel was responsible for the abuse and counterfeiting of these passports " .
Israeli radio reported that Australia had expelled an Israeli diplomat in 2004 for his alleged involvement in helping two Israelis try to fraudulently obtain New Zealand passports .
Neither the Israeli embassy nor Smith 's department would confirm the report .
Two men described by the New Zealand government as Israeli intelligence agents spent three months in prison there after pleading guilty to passport fraud .
They were then deported .
One in eight to cut cable and satellite TV in 2010
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite rising cable and satellite TV prices and easy access to streaming TV and movies on the Internet , few consumers have cut the cord .
But that looks like it 's about to change .
One in eight consumers will eliminate or scale back their cable , satellite or other pay - TV service this year , according to a new study released this week by Yankee Group .
The study , which was the result of a survey of pay - TV operators and more than 6,000 U.S. consumers , found that many will choose to drop premium channels or cut their service down to a basic package , while others will choose to cut off their service completely .
A cutting - the - cord trend has been the subject of speculation for some time , as networks have increasingly made television programming available for free on the Internet .
But a combination of other factors , including a growing number of battles between cable companies and networks , soaring Internet video viewings and an increase in connected TVs and devices , suggest the trend is finally upon us .
" Admittedly , this is a small phenomenon now , but a number or recent transactions and new items point to a shift in consumer thinking , " said Vince Vittore , analyst at Yankee Group and author of the study .
Going without cable or satellite is unthinkable to many Americans -- just over 90 % of U.S. households subscribe to some form of pay TV .
But just as mobile phones have replaced many customers ' land - line service , Vittore said on - demand Internet video will soon whittle that 90 % figure down .
Pay TV is getting more expensive
The biggest reason why customers will cut the cord , according to the study , is the growing cost of pay - TV service .
Cable and satellite viewers pay an average of $ 71 per month , and they receive an average annual price hike of 5 % , according to research firm Centris .
That annual price jump could be even higher if battles between pay - TV operators and networks continue .
Broadcasters like ABC , CBS ( CBS , Fortune 500 ) , Fox and NBC have traditionally cost cable and satellite providers nothing to retransmit , since they are offered for free over the air anyway .
But lately , broadcast television networks have demanded -- and have received -- fees for their programming comparable to what cable networks like TBS , E ! , MTV and Comedy Central have been charging .
Recently , Time Warner Cable ( TWC ) and the Fox Network , Cablevision and Disney ( DIS , Fortune 500 ) , and Sunflower Broadband and Hearst - Argyle Television have had high - profile spats , which have all resulted in significantly higher fees .
Ultimately , those fees get passed onto subscribers .
Vittore said that higher costs will ultimately drive more consumers to cut their pay - TV service -- especially for non-sports fans .
Though more live sports are becoming available over the Internet , namely CBS 's coverage of the NCAA basketball tournament , ESPN3.com and packages like MLB TV , most sports are still watched on television .
And since sports programming makes up as much as 50 % of a pay - TV provider 's costs , customers who are not sports fans are essentially paying half of their cable or satellite bill on channels in which they have no interest .
Streams of online video are up
Meanwhile , free or cheap alternatives to pay - TV subscriptions are growing wildly popular .
More than 180 million U.S. viewers watched 31 billion videos on the Internet last month , according to online data tracker comScore .
That 's more than double the 15 billion Internet videos that were watched at the same time last year .
Hulu , which is jointly owned by and shows programming from NBC , Disney and Fox , has more than quadrupled its viewership in the past year .
U.S. viewers watched more than 1 billion free TV programs or movies on Hulu in March , up from about 250 million a year earlier , comScore said .
That 's nearly 27 videos per viewer , up from under 15 videos last year .
What 's more telling is how much Hulu people watch .
Viewers tuned into Hulu for an average of 2.6 hours in March , up a full hour from a year earlier .
Netflix 's streaming service is rapidly gaining ground as well .
The company said last week that 55 % of its users watched at least 15 minutes of streaming video in the first quarter .
Netflix ( NFLX ) has grown its customer base by 35 % over the past year , and recently raised its 2010 subscriber forecasts by 1 million customers .
More devices are connected
Until recently , people had been watching Hulu and Netflix almost exclusively on their computers -- not the most desirable replacement for pay - TV service .
But more devices are coming pre-installed with Netflix or Internet connections , so people can stream videos right onto their televisions .
Netflix is now available on a handful of TVs , just about any Blu-ray player , and all three major video game devices -- the Nintendo Wii , the Sony ( SNE ) PlayStation , and the Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) Xbox -- which appear in 43 % of U.S. households .
A growing number of new HDTVs are also Internet ready , and according to a study released this week by Nielsen , TV purchases are up by their largest amount since 2006 .
Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) and Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) are also expected to launch streaming video devices this year .
" This is the key part of the equation , " said Vittore .
" Not just are these devices connected to the Internet , but they 're coming prepackaged with the capability to connect to rich video sources .
That really becomes a competitor to pay TV service . "
Since the easiest devices to connect to the Internet tend to be video game consoles , and they tend to be owned by 18 - 34 year olds , Yankee Group expects that will be the group to cut their cords first .
" Just like with telephone land lines , it 's going to become hard to sell pay TV to anyone under 30 , " Vittore said .

What I ’m wondering is what excuse the deniers will come up with .
They could argue that temperatures fluctuate , that one should n’t make too much of a particular peak — which is actually true .
But that would get them in trouble , since the whole global cooling thing has been about taking the 1998 peak — visible in the chart — plus a bit of bad data to claim , literally , that up is down .
Any statistical fix , like looking at multi- year averages , would just confirm that the temperature trend is up .
Now , I ’m sure that the climate deniers will find a way to ignore the latest facts .
But I ’m not sure what that way will be .
( CNN ) -- Smoking and submarines do n't mix .
That 's the message the U.S. Navy is sending after announcing that smoking will no longer be permitted below decks on its submarines effective December 31 .
" This policy was initiated for the health of the sailors who choose not to smoke , " said Lt. Commander Mark Jones , spokesman for the Commander Naval Submarine Forces in Norfolk , Virginia .
" It is unfair for them to be exposed to the unhealthy side effects of secondhand smoke . "
Jones said the submarine force conducted a study in 2009 on nine different submarines covering the four different classes of subs .
In that testing , it found nonsmokers were being exposed to the effects of secondhand smoke .
There are 71 submarines in the U.S. Navy and about 13,000 sailors on submarine active duty , according to Jones .
Of those sailors , recent polling indicates 35 to 40 percent are smokers , he said .
Jones conceded there will likely be complaints .
However , he said the Navy has very aggressive smoking cessation programs .
There will also be nicotine replacement therapy widely available on the submarines , such as Nicorette gum and nicotine patches .
" We 're going to work as hard as we can to make this an easy transition , " said Jones .
In the past , smoking had been confined to certain areas on the submarine .
Individual submarine commanders will still be allowed to decide if crew members are permitted to smoke on deck .

As millions of Americans file their tax returns this month , they can find some solace in comparing US tax rates with those in other nations .
Or can they ?
The United States still has a lower overall tax burden than the typical advanced economy in Europe .
But the gap is n't as big as you might think , and it may be poised to shrink as the pace of federal spending ticks upward .
Here 's a look at how Americans ' tax burden ranks against that of citizens of other countries , and why it matters .
How do US tax rates compare with those in other nations ?
The average American pays wage - based taxes that are similar to what Britons pay – and not much lower than in France .
Japanese citizens enjoy the lowest rates among the Group of Seven large industrial economies , or G - 7 .
This includes national and local income taxes , plus payroll levies such as the employee share of Social Security .
But wage and payroll taxes are just part of the picture .
Add in sales taxes , capital gains taxes , property taxes , and corporate taxes , and the US sends 28 cents of every dollar of output to the government .
That still matches Japan for the lowest ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product ( GDP ) among the G - 7 nations .
France and Italy score highest .
Why is tax policy important now , and why view it globally ?
The US is headed toward what finance experts have bluntly called a " fiscal train wreck . "
If uncorrected , current trends would force the government to spend a growing amount to service the national debt .
That debt burden , or the tax hikes that might occur because of it , could slow economic growth substantially .
Other nations can offer some lessons .
The recent pressure on Greece to impose austerity measures is a reminder of the perils of deficit spending .
The US and other G - 7 nations do n't face an imminent boycott by bond investors , but they have retiree - entitlement burdens and rising debt .
" We 're looking more and more like European nations , " says Rosanne Altshuler of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington .
Another message from a global comparison :
The US has the advantage of addressing the challenge from a starting point of relative prosperity .
The US tops the G - 7 list in average income .
What is President Obama doing about tax policy ?
He has pledged not to raise taxes on Americans with household incomes below $ 250,000 .
But with an eye on the budget challenge ahead , he 's also created a tax - policy panel and a bipartisan fiscal commission .
The goal is to bring budget deficits down to 3 percent of GDP or less .
( The Obama administration argues that this , coupled with the natural growth of the economy , would essentially keep the national debt from growing larger as a percentage of GDP . )
It wo n't be easy to hit that target .
Mr. Obama has already leaned heavily on one revenue - raising option – hiking taxes on high - earning households – to pay for healthcare reform .
Now he needs a plan that goes beyond more tax hikes on the rich .
( It would require a tax rate of 77 percent on top earners , by Ms. Altshuler 's estimate , for a tax - the - rich strategy to reach Obama 's deficit target . )
How can America put its government finances in order ?
The three main options are reduce the growth rate of spending , obtain more tax revenue , and seek the fastest growth rate for the economy ( on which tax future revenues will be based ) .
How to blend those strategies is a matter of hot debate , with conservatives emphasizing the risk that higher taxes will crimp economic growth .
Daniel Mitchell , a tax expert at the libertarian Cato Institute , favors spending restraint and efforts to boost economic growth through a simpler , more efficient tax code .
" The international comparisons are instructive , " he says .
Fiscal quagmires are " all about too much government spending , " which then puts upward pressure on tax rates .
Other fiscal experts say more tax revenue is needed ( along with spending curbs ) , and that modest tax hikes wo n't have an adverse effect on the economy .
Looking abroad , they see the value - added tax , akin to a sales tax , as an effective approach .
Another option is to boost existing taxes , such as on income .
Finally , there 's tax reform – simplifying the current maze of deductions and credits .
Done well , it could reap gains in tax revenue , fairness , and economic performance .
But as Americans know , politicians like to tinker with the tax code more than they like to reduce its complexity .

Five days after appearing before Congress to testify about its responsibility in one of the worst oil spills in US history , the Swiss company that owned and operated the oil rig that sunk into the Gulf of Mexico announced that it would shell out $ 1 billion in dividends to shareholders .
The revelation that Transocean is distributing a $ 1 billion profit to shareholders as one of its drill sites leaks millions of gallons of oil into the sea is sure to inflame an already smarting debate over offshore drilling and the company ’s role .
ADVERTISEMENT
Transocean has passionately argued that they do n’t share financial responsibility for the disaster .
A clause in a contract they had with BP says that the oil company is obligated to pay for any environmental damage , even though Transocean actually owned the rig .
BP was leasing the rig from Transocean at the time of the accident .
Transocean ’s distribution to shareholders was done quietly on Friday at a “ closed door meeting . ”
The company had previously announced that they would vote on the dividend at the event .
To put the distribution in perspective , the amount of profit that Transocean plans to pay out in the next year is half of what Exxon ultimately paid for the Exxon Valdez disaster off the Alaska Coast .
It ’s also more than double what BP has said they ’ve spent on the cleanup to date .
The company also made a paper gain from their insurance carrier after the Deepwater Horizon rig collapsed into the ocean aflame .
ADVERTISEMENT
Transocean had insured the rig for $ 560 million , but apparently never spent that much money actually building it .
The company ’s CEO told investors on a recent conference call that the firm had book a $ 270 million “ accounting gain ” on the difference between the real value of the rig and the amount that they ’d insured it for .
Since the rig collapsed , the company said they ’ve already received $ 401 million from their insurance policy .
The Associated Press also notes that “ Transocean moved to Switzerland two years ago to protect its low corporate tax rate , and few in the city had heard of the company , even three weeks after the April 20 blast that resulted in more than 4 million gallons ( 15 million liters ) of oil pouring into the Gulf of Mexico from the well drilled by the BP - leased rig .
Eleven workers were killed in the explosion . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Steven Newman ignored questions from reporters as he arrived and left the Park Hotel in the Swiss town of Zug , a few miles from the company ’s headquarters , ” AP added .
In a brief press release on their website , the firm noted the terms of the dividend , expected to be paid out to shareholders in four increments over the next year .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Shareholders also authorized the Board of Directors to make a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a par value reduction in the aggregate amount of 3.44 Swiss francs ( “ CHF ” ) equal to approximately USD 3.11 per issued share to be calculated and paid in four quarterly installments , ” the release said .
“ Based on the total number of issued shares , including treasury shares , the distribution is approximately USD 1.0 billion . ”
It adds , “ The Board of Directors expects to set the respective payment dates of the four installments in July 2010 , October 2010 , January 2011 and April 2011 , or as soon after each of the four periods as is practicable .
The actual installment payments will be subject to the satisfaction of applicable Swiss law requirements . ”

Ny generalstreik på trappene i Hellas
Greske fagforeninger har kalt inn til en ny generalstreik i protest mot de knallharde innstrammingstiltakene i Hellas .
Oppdatert 12 . mai 2010
Artikkelen er over ti år gammel
Streiken som fagforeningene for både offentlige og private ansatte stiller seg bak , skal skje 20 . mai .
- Vi avviser regjeringens planer om en pensjonsreform , og vårt svar er en umiddelbar generalstreik , sier lederen for fagforeningen Adedy , Spyros Papapyros .
Under generalstreiken i forrige uke kom det til voldsomme opptøyer der tre mennesker mistet livet .
Spanske fagforeninger i harnisk
Også spanske fagforeninger er i harnisk .
Spanske myndigheter varsler kutt i lønninger og pensjoner for å håndtere den økonomiske krisen , men landets fagforeninger fordømmer de nye sparetiltakene .
Blant tiltakene som statsminister Jose Lois Rodriguez Zapatero vil gjennomføre , er et lønnskutt på 5 prosent for offentlig ansatte fra i år , mens pensjonene , bortsett fra for de fattigste , vil bli frosset i 2011 .
I tillegg skal 6 milliarder euro i offentlige investeringer kuttes ut .
Til sammen vil kuttene utgjøre en innsparing på 15 milliarder euro eller nærmere 117 milliarder kroner i 2010 og 2011 .
- Fortjener avvisning
Tiltakene skal gjøre Spania i stand til å håndtere den økonomiske krisen med et underskudd på statsbudsjettet på over 11 prosent , sa Zapatero da han presenterte innsparingspakken for den spanske nasjonalforsamlingen onsdag .
Men tiltakene skaper vrede hos fagforeningene , som mener at den spanske regjeringen har lagt seg flate for markedskreftene .
- De foreslåtte kuttene fortjener bare ren avvisning , sier Fernandez Toxo , som leder Spanias største fagforening Comisiones Obreras .

TEHRAN : Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Saturday warned Israel against launching a fresh assault on the Gaza Strip , saying such action would bring it " closer to certain death " .
Ahmadinejad 's comments come a day after Israel 's deputy prime minister Silvan Shalom warned of a new offensive by the Israeli military on the Hamas - ruled coastal territory unless militant rocket attacks are halted .
" They are looking for an excuse to attack Gaza .
I want to tell the Zionists and their backers that enough crime has been committed already , " Ahmadinejad said in a speech broadcast live on state television .
" The new adventure will not save you , but will bring you closer to certain death , " said Ahmadinejad , who has drawn international condemnation for repeatedly saying the Jewish state is doomed to be wiped off the map .
Ahmadinejad also rejected a renewed call from the US to engage diplomatically to overcome the nuclear standoff , saying he saw no change in Washington 's hostile policy .
Speaking at a factory inauguration , Ahmadinejad said a message by President Barack Obama last month contained " three or four beautiful words " but nothing new of substance .

Today ’s installment of Random Book Blogging come from “ The Seven Mountain Prophecy ” by Johnny Enlow , who explains that God sent Hurricane Katrina to destroy New Orleans because it was his way of showing gays how much he loves them :
To stay locked in homosexuality is to remain in worship of Baal – and it is specifically Baal who is about to suffer profound repercussions brought on by the Elijah revolution .
As mentioned in a previous chapter , I wrote a prophetic newsletter in October 2004 ( before Katrina ) warning of judgments coming to a stretch of land from Mobile to New Orleans .
I wrote that an altar of Baal existed between these cities and that Mobile , Biloxi , and New Orleans all carried stones of this altar .
Mardi Gras began in Mobile back in 1699 , though New Orleans has become more famous for it .
The origins of Mardi Gras come from the fertility festival of Lupercalia , which has direct roots to Baal worship .
Mardi Gras is essentially a celebration of Baal .
I wrote that the next hurricanes would be judgment storms , and that New Orleans was headed for a “ big uneasy . ”
I also wrote “ Biloxi : The Eye of the Hurricane Has Your Name on It . ”
I shared that the hurricanes of 2004 were warning storms of what would be God ’s manifest judgments of Baal ’s altar at the geographical area of our nation .
A mass homosexual parade and celebration that was to bring many millions of dollars to New Orleans was scheduled the week Katrina hit the city .
Baal was doubling up in the city by adding homosexual decadence to his existing active altar there .
Hurricanes Wilma and Rita also each brought judgments on cities that were about to host major gay events – Key West and Cancun – thus seriously curtailing the celebration of gay acceptance .
God loves homosexuals so much that he will spare no expense in making it clear that homosexuality is an abomination to Him and that he can deliver someone from it .
The name Katrina even means “ purity ” – perhaps a message of God ’s intent for that hurricane .
What looks like God ’s anger against homosexuals is really
His passionate love working to spare them from greater judgment – lifetime in real hell .
APPLE fans who queued overnight to be among the first to get their hands on an iPad were this morning pipped by impatient journalists .
People began waiting outside the new Apple Store Bondi as early as 9 pm last night to secure their place for the launch of the iPad at 8 am ( AEST ) today .
But when doors opened at the store in east Sydney , two men from the media pack jumped in first .

Alex Zaharov - Reutt and Peter Balyck had been waiting at the store for about half an hour before deciding to sprint inside ahead of dedicated fans .
Those they pushed past included famous Apple Store enthusiast Gary Allen from California , who has attended dozens of store openings and was first in line .
Second in line was Pyrmont man James Polley , who began camping out at 9 pm last night .
" A couple of guys I think from the media beat me into the store .
But I got my iPad .
I was n't that upset about it , " he said .
Mr Polley said he had n't been intending to buy an iPad at all until " a couple of days ago " when he changed his mind .
Then , he said : " It was either queue up or miss out for another month . "
Zaharov - Reutt is the technology editor for industry publication iTWire .
iTWire editor in chief Stan Beer said he was n't surprised by Zaharav - Reutt 's behaviour .
" Alex is a bit of a free agent , " he said .
" I do n't know what Apple 's view on what he did is , but I can tell you he is a very avid gadget guy so he would have been very enthusiastic to get his hands on one . "
Beer said the second man to jump the queue , Balyck , was not employed by iTWire .
Mr Polley bought two 64GB 3G and Wi-Fi iPads for himself and his partner .
And it seems Zaharov - Reutt was n't the only journo in trouble on the iPad 's big day .
Alan Pryke , a photographer for The Australian , said he was " roughed up " by security guards looking after Apple 's own PR team .

Apple 's seventh megastore in Australia , at Bondi Junction , was announced earlier this week to capitalise on hype surrounding the iPad .
The store was scheduled to open its doors for the first time this morning at the same time as the iPad launch .
However it was something of a last minute affair , with the site still looking like a construction site yesterday afternoon .
Mr Polley said workers were still polishing the Apple logo at the front of the store at 5 am this morning .
At Apple 's central Sydney store near Martin Place , a queue formed last night jumped in size early this morning .
At about 6.30 am the queue extended down the street and around the block .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The American public wants to see bankers ’ heads on spikes for triggering a global financial crisis , but so far prosecutors and regulators have come up empty .
Federal and state authorities are struggling to hold banks accountable , but cases have proven to be extremely complicated and hard to win , if they get brought at all .
In recent days , investigators and prosecutors have renewed their efforts , focusing their attention on complicated repackaged debt known as collateralized debt obligations .
Criminal charges are contemplated .
But winning these cases wo n’t be easy , in part because it will be difficult to prove criminal intent to defraud or deceive .
“ A financial meltdown is not a crime , ” said David Siegal , a former federal prosecutor in New York .
Nor is being stupid or greedy .
The government ’s only criminal case against Wall Street executives linked to the crisis -- two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers accused of lying to investors -- ended with an acquittal last November .
A criminal investigation of the former American International Group AIG.N executives who helped the insurer take on exposure to toxic subprime securities is said to be petering out , people familiar with the matter said .
And it 's not clear whether a criminal inquiry into the collapse of Lehman Brothers will prove any more fruitful .
Prosecutors and regulators appear to be on a new tack now : looking to see if the big banks that designed and sold all those toxic mortgage - linked securities either duped their investors or the powerful rating agencies that slapped a Triple A stamp of approval on the deals .
On Wednesday , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo issued subpoenas to eight banks , including Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N , Morgan Stanley MS.N , Citigroup Inc C.N and UBS UBSN.VX , launching a probe into whether they misled rating agencies , a source said .
ELEMENT OF POLITICS
Some say there is an element of politics to many of these cases .
“ It ’s politics in the broadest sense , ” said Ed Grebeck , the chief executive of Tempus Advisors and an instructor at New York University .
“ We know that Congress and the regulators who missed the structured finance credit crunch are trying to make a name for themselves acting like they are going to take the next step to stop this from happening again . ”
Cuomo is a hard - charging Democratic attorney general running for governor in New York .
Many say he will score points with voters by launching a probe , even if the investigation is unlikely to be finished by the time voters go to the polls in November .
Federal investigators are also looking to take Wall Street to task .
A source said that U.S. federal prosecutors , working with securities regulators , are conducting a preliminary criminal probe into whether four banks misled investors about their roles in mortgage bond deals .
The banks under early - stage criminal scrutiny include JPMorgan Chase JPM.N and Deutsche Bank DBKGn .DE .
Last month , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Goldman with civil fraud over its marketing of a subprime mortgage product .
Criminal prosecutors are also looking into the matter .
But some wonder whether authorities are late to the game and are now going after simplistic cases in a bid to make headlines .
“ There were far more broad , far more serious , far more egregious and far more clear cut and consequential problems than the SEC ’s action against Goldman , ” said Joshua Rosner of the research firm Graham Fisher & Co , adding that he expected some major Wall Street criminal cases were yet to come .
PROVING INTENT
Proving criminal conduct is no easy task .
Prosecutors must show that Wall Street bankers and marketers knowingly committed fraud by failing to disclose the hidden dangers in mortgage - linked securities that some say were designed to fail .
By contrast , in a civil securities case , regulators often only need to show reckless conduct to prevail .
Cases against Wall Street executives can be difficult to prove to the satisfaction of a jury because of the mind - numbing volume of emails , prospectuses , and memos involved in documenting a case .
“ It ’s not like a shooting on the street , ” said Siegal , the former federal prosecutor , who is now an attorney with Haynes and Boone .
“ It ’s an enormous and potentially overwhelming task .
Typically what you need is a whistle blower . ”
The complexity of the cases means that they take a long time to put together .
Other high - profile cases in the Enron collapse and the Galleon insider trading case have taken years of investigation but ultimately did end with criminal charges being filed .
In those cases , some of the key players rushed to sign plea agreements once the government had made its cases .
A TIME FOR REFLECTION
This time around , prosecutors may have been waiting for financial firms to stabilize before needling them .
“ In the midst of the crisis everyone was interested in making sure that the system did not collapse , ” Rosner said .
“ No one was spending time looking at what led to it .
“ Now there ’s this view we ’ve stabilized and maybe come out of it .
Cooler heads prevail and people are now reflective and reflecting on what transpired . ”
As prosecutors dig in , they are focusing on cases that seem simple and winnable .
But the downside of that approach is that regulators are missing the bigger picture by zeroing too closely on individual transactions , critics say .
Janet Tavakoli , president of Tavakoli Structured Finance Inc in Chicago and author of a book on synthetic CDOs , called the activity of big banks “ malicious mischief , ” and said regulators ’ efforts to bring accountability have amounted to “ publicity stunts that aim to miss . ”
“ It distracts the public from the real issue of the damage done to the U.S. economy for which the taxpayer ended up being on the hook to bail out banks , ” Tavakoli said .

City officials must certify the petition signatures in the next 10 days , and then the City Council has 30 days to pass the proposal or send it to voters this fall , Elections Director Daniel Baxter said .
" We 're quite sure we 're in conformity with state law and the city charter , " said Beck , a veteran of successful drives to approve medical marijuana in five Michigan cities and ultimately statewide .
If his proposal passes , Detroit would follow Denver in legalizing possession of pot .
" It 's a good year for this because it's also on the ballot in California , " said Beck , a medical marijuana user .
California voters this fall could vote to treat marijuana like alcohol .
Battle Lines Drawn on Legalizing Marijuana
The possibility that Detroit voters could legalize marijuana possession this fall has the supporters of liberal drug laws taking on the staunch advocates of America 's war on drugs .
Supporters of the proposal say it would free police to go after violent criminals , ease jail crowding and even encourage a safe alternative to alcohol .
Some criminal justice and medical experts dispute those ideas .
" Our feeling is , how do we put an end to the drug war ?
This would be a step , " said attorney and medical marijuana user Matthew Abel , 51 , of Detroit .
Abel , along with Detroit health insurance firm owner Tim Beck and real - estate scion David Farbman , pooled $ 10,000 to pay the legal , printing and labor costs for drafting the proposal , launching a Web site ( www.saferdetroit.net) and getting petition signatures , Abel said .
They turned in more than 6,100 signatures Wednesday to Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey , they said .
Legalizing pot in Detroit would n't affect existing laws against driving while impaired and still would n't safeguard marijuana users from arrest under state law , Beck said .
" But we 're hopeful the city would honor the people 's wishes and not go after someone possessing a small amount , " he said .
The proposal would allow possession of up to an ounce of pot on private property in Detroit by anyone 21 or older .
Michigan 's top prosecutor , Attorney General Mike Cox , said in a statement that the Detroit proposal would change nothing about how drug laws should be enforced in the state 's largest city .
" There can't be some kind of zone or island of non-enforcement , just because a city decrees it , " Cox spokeswoman Joy Yearout said .
Detroit Police Chief Warren Evans was unavailable for comment Wednesday .
Deputy Chief John Roach said that Evans would need to see the legalization proposal before he could comment .
But Roach said Evans " absolutely made it our focus to go after the mid-level and upper - level drug suppliers " and not marijuana users , although " we do encounter the lower - level people all the time , so we need to look at this issue . "
To submit the Detroit proposal , which still must be approved by election officials before it can go on the November ballot , petition gatherers like Fritzel Stanley , 59 , of Detroit got thousands of residents to sign petitions this spring .
" Once I explain this to people , they 're in agreement with it , overwhelmingly , " Stanley said , as he sat last month at a card table inside Farmer John 's Market on Detroit 's east side .
A U.S. Army veteran , Stanley said he quit using marijuana " when I left Vietnam " in 1970 , " but I think it should be legal . "
Petition signers Roderick Harris , 48 , and Richard Smyth , 55 , both Detroiters , said they agreed with him .
" When liquor was against the law , they bootlegged it .
Marijuana is no different , " Smyth said .
He said he paid a $ 1,000 fine and spent 90 days in jail for marijuana possession three decades ago .
Although still in a small minority , a growing group of political figures and leaders in metro Detroit -- from Democrats to Libertarians to a few Republicans -- said possession of marijuana should be legal .
Last month , in a breakfast forum at the Detroit Athletic Club , Compuware founder Peter Karmanos called for legalizing drugs to reduce crime .
State Rep. LaMar Lemmons , a Democrat from Detroit , said he helped write the new proposal .
" I 'd like our police to concentrate on violent crimes , " Lemmons said .
Lemmons said he does n't want to encourage marijuana use in public , but believes that people using it at home should be left alone .
" When Tim ( Beck ) was crafting the legislation , I did suggest that he put that caveat in -- about the private property , " Lemmons said .
Former state Rep. Leon Drolet of Macomb Township calls himself " a very proud Libertarian Republican " who favors legalization .
" We all make decisions about our health , whether it 's drinking alcohol or having a slice of cake .
There 's lots of things people choose to do because they feel , in some way , it enhances their quality of life , " he said .
" And unless they 're infringing on anybody else 's life or liberty , I can't imagine why we would prosecute them , " Drolet said as he campaigned this week for state senator in north Macomb County .
Legal experts differ about the impact of local marijuana ordinances , amid rapidly changing attitudes that run right to the White House .
Last fall , President Barack Obama directed the U.S. Justice Department to stop using federal resources for prosecuting medical - marijuana cases .
Some cities have directed their police not to arrest people for possessing small amounts of marijuana , Wayne State University Law School professor Robert Sedler said .
" They can't actually make it legal , but they do have the power to instruct their police , " Sedler said .
Medical and research experts disagree about whether marijuana is addictive ; is less likely than alcohol to cause health problems or violence ; is a gateway drug that leads to heroin , cocaine and other abuse , or has health benefits .
" Right now , we can not look into the medical uses of marijuana " because it 's illegal in Michigan for anyone but approved medical marijuana patients and their caregivers , Michigan State University criminal justice professor Sheila Maxwell said .
" So , there are no clinical trials going on , " Maxwell said .

Once the dominant renter of videotapes and DVDs with a presence on seemingly every street corner , Blockbuster Inc. is in the throes of closing more than 1,000 stores while its stock trades at 30 cents a share .
The reasons are evident in the red envelopes that appear in people ’s home mailboxes every day and in the ubiquitous red kiosks popping up in grocery stores across the country .
But Netflix and Redbox are n’t the only challenges faced by Blockbuster Chief Executive Jim Keyes since he joined the Dallas company in 2007 .
A crushing debt load that the retailer spent much of 2009 renegotiating distracted senior management and constrained the company ’s ability to invest in inventory and marketing .
Last year Blockbuster ’s loss grew 49 % to $ 558.2 million , while revenue plunged by $ 1 billion to $ 4.06 billion .
Blockbuster perseveres , however , by focusing on its ability to offer movies the same day they go on sale in stores and by mail , whereas Netflix and Redbox have made deals with certain studios not to make titles available until four weeks after they are released on DVD .
The companyis also working with vending machine partner NCR Corp.to deploy 10,000 Blockbuster - branded rental kiosks in retail locations by the end of this year .
Keyes spoke to Facetime about what opportunities remain for a down - but - not - out Blockbuster amid radical changes in the home entertainment business .
Blockbuster stores are shutting down rapidly all around the world .
In the age of Netflix , Redbox and digital distribution , do people still want to drive to a store to rent a DVD ?
Absolutely .
Stores were once a convenience and that ’s why we had so many .
That has now been supplanted by two other even more convenient forms of access , which means the role of the store is changing from the most convenient place to get DVDs to a retail entertainment destination .
Here ’s an analogy :
If I want to buy an obscure book title , I ’ll go to Amazon.com .
But if I want to browse and see what ’s new , I will go to Barnes & Noble .
You have recently renewed your new - release deals with Warner Bros. , 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures at the same time that Warner , Fox and Universal Pictures have gotten Netflix to agree to a 28 - day delay for new releases .
How does that impact your business ?
These new agreements with Netflix represent a breakthrough in rationalizing the distribution chain so that subscription has its appropriate place .
Historically , subscription services like HBO had a window .
Then that was disrupted because the “ first - sale doctrine ” gave newcomers the capability to rent them via subscription outside of the traditional window .
Blockbuster can restore consumer relevance because we do carry new releases , and in fact our recent agreements give us the privilege of day - and - date content across our channel , which we believe is a strong competitive advantage .
What about your kiosks ?
Redbox agreed to a 28 - day window with Warner Bros .
Can you keep offering movies for $ 1 per night the day they go on sale ?
We ’re working on that .
The difference in our kiosks versus Redbox ’s is that they are an extension of the store .
We do n’t think of vending as a stand - alone business .
They will be an extension of the store with return capabilities from kiosk to store and vice versa .
More importantly , the distribution efficiencies of stores and kiosks managing inventory will mean they ’re never out of stock .
Also in contrast to Redbox , we see our kiosk strategy as a steppingstone to digital downloads , which would likely be at the same price as video on demand .
New releases at [ higher ] VOD pricing is a very different economic model than the one currently deployed by Redbox .
Your “ Blockbuster - on - Demand ” digital service makes consumers pay to download each movie .
Is n’t that less convenient than Netflix ’s service letting people stream as many movies as they want for one monthly price ?
You tell me :
Do you want to watch “ The Blind Side ” or “ Herbie Goes to Cancun ” ?
Netflix has a wonderful Internet service for older titles and television .
Our customer demand is 60 % to 80 % for new releases .
The subscription model does not translate effectively to what our customers want to see when they want to see them .
What ’s the last movie you watched at home and how did you get it ?
The last movie I rented was “ Sherlock Holmes , ” which I got in a store and really liked .
My wife has become a big customer of Blockbuster - on - Demand because her mother is in town and they ’re staying busy watching two movies per night by just pushing a button on the remote control .

We set up camp a few miles north of Ben Lomond , across from the Arrochar Alps
It 's late evening and the sun has just dipped behind Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane - two steep , looming hills the other side of Loch Lomond .
We 're camped in the small , rough hills a few miles north of Scotland 's most southerly Munro , Ben Lomond .
A new moon and the first stars have appeared and in the last few minutes the temperature has tumbled .
The only sounds are the hissing of gas stoves and the occasional flap of a tent in the breeze .
Sat looking across at the Arrochar Alps , we quietly enjoy the sunset and a late dinner - well , everyone apart from one of our number whose mash and meatballs meal did n't work out as planned .
Among us is Peter MacFarlane , known as Petesy , an outdoors writer who has been wandering these hills for 30 years or more .
Petesy says it is moments like this that inspire him again and again to seek out the wilder - and less - frequented - parts of Scotland .
He says : " It 's complete joy .
That 's the only way of describing it .
It 's a freedom that 's hard to get in modern life - we 're all so busy now .
" You look outside the tent and you do n't see a single light , just mountains rolling into the distance . "
He points out that you do n't need to journey for days to reach wild spots like this , or travel to inaccessible corners of the globe .
" Doing something like this , it 's not a big investment in your time .
We left quite late in the day today and we managed to get up somewhere high and we 'll be back tomorrow to our lives , " he says .
" It 's accessible freedom . "
Next year , camping is likely to be banned in certain parts of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park in a drive to tackle anti-social behaviour .
The park authority has said it wants to stop repeated use of the same sites by a minority who are damaging trees , littering and lighting fires .
The ban on informal camping will apply to specific areas of Loch Lomond 's east coast .
But many mountaineers and backpackers such as Petesy feel the impending ban on camping near popular spots such as Balmaha and Rowardennan will have little impact on them .
For them , the actions of those who pitch tents just yards from their cars , chop down trees and leave rubbish and fire scars has little to do with wild camping .
And the national park itself is keen to stress that they do not want people to think the park is closed to campers .
Image caption Peter MacFarlane adopts a low - profile approach to wild camping
Another member of our group is Grant Moir , director of conservation at the national park .
He tells me : " The idea is not to try to stop people wild camping .
If somebody wants to get a pack on their back and head up Ben Lomond or any of the wilds around there , that 's absolutely fine .
" It 's that informal camping involved with alcohol and cars that we 're trying to get away from .
We absolutely want people to come into the national park . "
The problems faced by the park on Loch Lomondside starkly contrast to Petesy 's approach to wild camping , which is low - profile - stealthy even .
He prefers to stay away from the crowds and leave no trace of his presence .
His pack looks like he is out for the day and his sleeping bag and tent pack down to tiny packages .
Though Petesy does tell me he usually fills up the extra space with donuts and pastries .
( To prove it , he produces two bags of goodies after dinner ) .
But most of all , he wants to find those rarely - visited , trackless pockets of land that are all over Scotland , even close to major cities .
" I prefer remote because you 're not seeing houses , you 're not seeing the signs of habitation .
" There 's a feeling that you 're out on your own .
It 's important that you 're not annoying anyone else and the presence of others is n't encroaching on your enjoyment , " he says .
" And no - one will ever know we were here . "

Special Report : Cycling Queensdale Bike Lane Meeting Disrespectful to Cyclists Negative anecdotes about cyclists are no basis on which to decide whether to implement a planned bike route as part of an integrated network already approved in the city 's Cycling Master Plan .
By Walter Furlan
Published April 15 , 2010
I attended the public meeting on April 7 regarding the Queensdale Avenue bike lanes .
It was encouraging to see so many people in attendance .
However , several events that transpired do not sit well with me .
The city staff person who presented an overview of the project spoke of improvements and safety enhancements , such as widened sidewalks and traffic calming measures , but referred to the bike lanes as an " obligation " that they were required to explore .
I felt this set a biased and negative tone for the entire meeting .
Later in the meeting , a participant indicated that bike lanes should not be implemented because they had observed cyclists going " through stop signs " , as if this should be reason enough to cancel all bike plan implementation .
As this comment was made , I observed city staff , with the exception of Alternative Transportation Manager Daryl Bender , to sympathize with this participant , nodding in agreement and actually laughing .
Groundless Comments
I take strong exception to both these comments and the city staff 's behaviour .
Anecdotal observations regarding a specific cyclist 's behaviour have absolutely no bearing on whether bike lanes should be implemented , yet this groundless comment was basically endorsed by staff through their lack of appropriate response and their unprofessional behaviour .
I do not support cyclists breaking the law , and to suggest that we all do it is malicious .
It is well known that many motorists regularly break laws , from rolling through stop signs , to texting , yet that is never taken as a reasonable argument to reduce road construction .
The majority of comments made against the implementation of the bike plan had no basis .
There was agreement that there was room for a shared bike lane .
There was absolutely no issue with that .
Regardless , comments ranged from , " there should be no bike lanes regardless of the cost " , to , " I 've lived on this street for 50 years and do n't see a need for bike lanes " .
Other comments concerned a loss of parking space , though it is my understanding that parking demand is currently low enough that limiting parking to one side of the street will still be sufficient to meet demand ( as per Daryl Bender 's study on parking demand on Queensdale , presented to the Hamilton Cycling Committee , April 7 , 2010 ) .
Hamilton Deserves Better
Much of the discussion seemed to be a conflict between progressive and active use of our road resources ( bike lanes ) and publicly resourced storage of citizens ' private vehicles ( street parking ) .
I was embarrassed and saddened for our city that this meeting even took place .
We have a Cycling Master Plan that has been endorsed in principle by council .
The city has set goals for increasing alternative transportation use .
We 've been recently identified as the city with one of the highest obesity rates in Canada .
We 're aspiring to become the " best place to raise a child " .
Hamilton deserves better .
Let 's make it easier for children and all citizens of Hamilton to ride their bikes on Queensdale Avenue and ensure immediate implementation of the bike lanes on Queensdale .
Walter Furlan is a lifelong cyclist and has ridden his bike in many capacities throughout the world .
He was born and raised in Hamilton 's east end , where he began to work in the steel mills alongside his father .
He attended McMaster part - time in the evening and received a BA in social science .
He is now a heritage conservation restorer , assessing and restoring historic buildings and landscapes .
He is in training at The School of Restoration Arts at Willowbank in Niagara on the Lake .
Walter advocates for those who cycle in this city because of choice or circumstance .
He believes in the 8 - 80 idea : that our streets should be safe for an eight - or eighty - year - old to navigate .
He is a former member of the Hamilton Cycling Committee and has served as its chair .

If you were wondering why Epic made that switch , you only need to look to company president Mike Capps , who tells Edge magazine , " If you walked into [ Epic 's Offices ] six years ago , Epic was a PC company .
We did one PS2 launch title , and everything else was PC .
And now , people are saying ‘ Why do you hate the PC ?
You 're a console - only company . ' "
" And guess what ? " says Capps , " It 's because the money 's on console . "
" We still do PC , we still love the PC , but we already saw the impact of piracy : it killed a lot of great independent developers and completely changed our business model . "

A&E film crew for “ The First 48 ” was present during police raid
An attorney for the family of a 7 - year - old girl who was killed by a police officer ’s bullet during a weekend raid at their home said Monday that he saw video of the raid that contradicts the police department ’s version of what happened .
Attorney Geoffrey Fieger said he watched three or four minutes of video that showed police fired into the home after lobbing a flash grenade through the window .
He said this contradicts the police department ’s story , which was that the officer ’s gun discharged during a struggle or collision inside the home with the girl ’s grandmother .

“ There is no question about what happened because it ’s in the videotape , ” Fieger said .
“ It ’s not an accident .
It ’s not a mistake .
There was no altercation .
“ The gun was fired before anyone goes through the door .
There are lights all over , like it ’s a television set . ”
A camera crew for the cable television crime - reality series “ The First 48 ” was at the raid , although Fieger declined to say whether the video he watched was shot by the crew .
A&E spokesman Dan Silberman said neither he nor anyone else from the network would comment about the case .
Fieger said more than one camera was recording at the scene .

“ It demonstrates conclusively , beyond a shadow of a doubt , what happened in this case , ” the attorney said .
“ The pictures do n’t lie .
It ’s got sound and everything . ”
Michigan State Police detectives have taken charge of the investigation .
Detroit police were trying to obtain any footage of the raid captured by the film crew , which had been shadowing city homicide investigators almost daily since early this year , Assistant Chief Ralph Godbee said Monday .

Godbee said Detroit police would not be commenting on the tactics they employed during the raid , but that the department was not concerned that the film crew had any affect on how it was conducted .
The target of the search , a 34 - year - old man suspected of killing a 17 - year - old boy , was arrested in the upstairs unit at the two - family home .
Police had warrants to search both units , and relatives of the girl were seen Monday going in and out of both .

BANGKOK —
In southern China , the worst drought in at least 50 years has dried up farmers ’ fields and left tens of millions of people short of water .
But the drought has also created a major public relations problem for the Chinese government in neighboring countries , where in recent years China has tried to project an image of benevolence and brotherhood .
Farmers and fishermen in countries that share the Mekong River with China , especially Thailand , have lashed out at China over four dams that span the Chinese portion of the 3,000 - mile river , despite what appears to be firm scientific evidence that low rainfall is responsible for the plunging levels of the river , not China ’s hydroelectric power stations .
This weekend , a group of affected countries — Myanmar , Laos , Cambodia and Vietnam — are meeting in Thailand to discuss the drought , among other issues .

DEPRESSED ? READ ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S WORDS Executive Mansion
Washington , December 23 , 1862 .
Dear Fanny
It is with deep grief that I learn of the death of your kind and brave Father ; and , especially , that it is affecting your young heart beyond what is common in such cases .
In this sad world of ours , sorrow comes to all ; and , to the young , it comes with bitterest agony , because it takes them unawares .
The older have learned to ever expect it .
I am anxious to afford some alleviation of your present distress .
Perfect relief is not possible , except with time .
You can not now realize that you will ever feel better .
Is not this so ?
And yet it is a mistake .
You are sure to be happy again .
To know this , which is certainly true , will make you some less miserable now .
I have had experience enough to know what I say ; and you need only to believe it , to feel better at once .
The memory of your dear Father , instead of an agony , will yet be a sad sweet feeling in your heart , of a purer and holier sort than you have known before .
Please present my kind regards to your afflicted mother .
Your sincere friend
A. Lincoln Abraham Lincoln wrote this beautiful letter of condolence to Fanny McCullough , the daughter of William McCullough who was the former clerk of the McClean County Circuit Court in Bloomington , Illinois .
William McCullough knew Abraham Lincoln well .
Fanny could remember when she was a child Lincoln would hold her and her sister Nanny on his knees .
During the Civil War McCullough , a Black Hawk War veteran , enlisted in the Fourth Illinois Cavalry , and he was killed in a battle near Coffeeville , Mississippi , on December 5 , 1862 .
Mutual friends of Lincoln and McCullough informed the president of Fanny 's depression over her father 's death .
With the help of Lincoln 's letter , Fanny eventually recovered , married , and lived until 1920 .
More than 20 years earlier Lincoln gave similar advice to his best friend , Joshua Speed .
In a letter written on February 13 , 1842 , Lincoln said : Remember in the depth and even the agony of despondency , that very shortly you are to feel well again .
In a September 27 , 1841 , letter to Mary Speed , a half sister to Joshua , Lincoln noted : A tendency to melancholy .... let it be observed , is a misfortune , not a fault .
Without question Lincoln was subject to periods of melancholy throughout his life .
His own term for it was " the hypo " ( short for hypochondriasis ) .
Lincoln was probably a believer in the doctrine of fatalism .
Additionally , he was somewhat superstitious .
However , his ability to cope with whatever depression afflicted him , especially late in life , was enormous .
Using various means ... work , humor , fatalistic resignation , or even religious feelings ... he generally did not allow the depression or melancholy to interfere with his work as president .
He overcame this depressive aspect of his personality with a powerful inner strength and will .
Although most of Abraham Lincoln 's written references to depression were in a series of 1841 - 1842 letters to Joshua Speed , Lincoln 's most profound quote on his own personal depression comes from another source .
On January 1 , 1841 , Lincoln broke up with Mary Todd ( the woman he would marry in November of 1842 ) .
Afterwards , later in January of 1841 , he entered a period of depression .
He was absent from the Illinois state legislature from January 13th to 19th due to illness which was most likely due to some sort of melancholy ( which most likely was due to his ending his relationship with Mary ) .
On January 23 , 1841 , Lincoln wrote a letter to John T. Stuart , his first law partner .
In the letter , Lincoln stated : I am now the most miserable man living .
If what I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family , there would not be one cheerful face on the earth .
Whether I shall ever be better I can not tell ; I awfully forebode I shall not .
To remain as I am is impossible ; I must die or be better , it appears to me .
People who knew Lincoln noticed his gloominess .
William Herndon , Lincoln 's third law partner , described Lincoln as follows : " He was not a pretty man by any means , nor was he an ugly one ; he was a homely man , careless of his looks , plain - looking and plain - acting .
He had no pomp , display , or dignity , so - called .
He appeared simple in his carriage and bearing .
He was a sad - looking man ; his melancholy dripped from him as he walked .
His apparent gloom impressed his friends , and created sympathy for him - one means of his great success .
He was gloomy , abstracted , and joyous - rather humorous - by turns ; but I do not think he knew what real joy was for many years ...
The perpetual look of sadness was his most prominent feature . "
Francis B. Carpenter , an artist who lived in the White House for part of 1864 , said of Lincoln , " I have said repeatedly to friends that Mr. Lincoln had the saddest face I ever attempted to paint . "
Joshua Speed said of his first meeting Lincoln , " As I looked up at him I thought then , and think now , that I never saw a sadder face . "
Fellow lawyer , Henry C. Whitney , who traveled across the legal circuit in Illinois with Lincoln , thought " no element of Mr. Lincoln 's character was so marked , obvious , and ingrained as his mysterious and profound melancholy . "
Even as a boy growing up in Indiana , friend James Grigsby said Lincoln would " get fits of blues , then he would n't study for two or three days at a time . "
Robert L. Wilson served in the Illinois legislature with Lincoln .
Regarding Lincoln 's gloominess , Wilson wrote :
In a conversation with him about that time ( 1836 ) , he told me that although he appeared to enjoy life rapturously , still he was the victim of terrible melancholy .
He sought company , and indulged in fun and hilarity without restraint , or stint as to time .
Still when by himself , he told me that he was so overcome with mental depression , that he never dare carry a knife in his pocket .
As long as I was intimately acquainted with him , previous to the commencement of the practice of the law , he never carried a pocketknife , still he was not a misanthropic .
He was kind and tender in his treatment to others .
Those around him noticed that Lincoln could go from a happy state to a gloomy one very quickly .
Fellow attorney Jonathan Birch said of Lincoln in court , " His eyes would sparkle with fun , and when he had reached the point in his narrative which invariably evoked the laughter of the crowd , nobody 's enjoyment was greater than his .
An hour later he might be seen in the same place or in some law office near by , but , alas , how different !
His chair , no longer in the center of the room , would be leaning back against the wall ; his feet drawn up and resting on the front rounds so that his knees and chair were about on a level ; his hat tipped slightly forward as if to shield his face ; his eyes no longer sparkling with fun or merriment , but sad and downcast and his hands clasped around his knees .
There , drawn up within himself as it were , he would sit , the very picture of dejection and gloom .
Thus absorbed have I seen him sit for hours at a time defying the interruption of even his closest friends .
No one ever thought of breaking the spell by speech ; for by his moody silence and abstraction he had thrown about him a barrier so dense and impenetrable no one dared to break through .
It was a strange picture and one I have never forgotten . "
What were the roots of Lincoln 's depression ?
A definitive answer is impossible .
It could have been heredity .
Whitney said , " His melancholy was stamped on him while in the period of gestation .
It was part of his nature . "
Some of Lincoln 's cousins may have suffered from depression , and there are indications his parents suffered from bouts with the blues .
Others feel a lonely and depressive youth contributed to his later melancholy .
Growing up on the frontier young Lincoln was unique in his interests in politics , reading , etc. , and his intellectual power partially isolated him from his peers .
Additionally , he suffered through the deaths of his younger brother , mother , and older sister .
A few have speculated that his depression was rooted in his lowly upbringing and feelings of insecurity when he was around people from a richer social order .
Herndon felt Lincoln 's depression might have dated to Thomas Lincoln 's cold treatment of his son .
Father and son were indeed estranged .
Abraham did not visit Thomas when he was informed his father was dying .
He did not attend Thomas ' funeral in 1851 .
Thomas Lincoln died never having met Mary Todd Lincoln , seen his grandchildren , or even visited Springfield where his son's family lived .
Not only did Abraham Lincoln suffer from serious bouts of depression , but he also tried to give advice to others he knew were suffering .
Lincoln 's depressions , whether they lasted for hours , days , weeks , or months always came to an end .
Knowing this , he could encourage others .
It would seem his own experience led him to believe that depression was not a permanent condition .
For additional information on Abraham Lincoln and depression , two recent books attempt to create a psychological profile of the 16th president .
They are ( 1 ) The Inner World of Abraham Lincoln by Michael Burlingame and ( 2 ) Honor 's Voice : The Transformation of Abraham Lincoln by Douglas L. Wilson .
Chapter 5 entitled " Lincoln 's Depressions : Melancholy Dript From Him As He Walked " in Burlingame 's book is an especially well documented source of information .
Additionally , Lincoln 's law partner , William Herndon , gives a first hand account of Lincoln 's melancholy in his biography of Lincoln entitled Herndon 's Life of Lincoln .
Also , Mark E. Neely , Jr. , author of The Abraham Lincoln Encyclopedia discusses Lincoln 's depression within the topic ' Psychology . '
There are indications Lincoln took a medication for his hypochondriasis called blue mass .
This was a commonly prescribed medication in the 19th century for ailments such as apoplexy , worms , tuberculosis , toothaches , constipation , and hypochondriasis .
Blue mass contained mercury and can lead to the neurobehavioral consequences of mercury poisoning .
John Stuart said that Lincoln took blue mass " before he went to Washington and for five months while he was President . "

Feldman , and Ian A. Greaves in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine Volume 44 , Number 3 ( summer 2001 ) , pp. 315-332 ©2001 by the Johns Hopkins University Press .
Book - length treatment of Lincoln and depression was published in 2005 .

Crowds across Mumbai were jubilant on hearing of the sentence
The only gunman captured alive after the 2008 Mumbai attacks has been sentenced to death by an Indian court .
Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab , a Pakistani citizen aged 22 , was found guilty on Monday of many charges , including murder and waging war on India .
Sentencing Qasab , the judge said he could not be rehabilitated .
Qasab has the right to appeal .
The attacks left 174 people dead , nine of them gunmen .
Relations between India and Pakistan have still to recover .
India blamed Pakistan - based militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba for the attack .
After initial denials , Pakistan acknowledged the attacks had been partially planned on its territory and that Qasab was one of its citizens .
' Cruelty incarnate ' Judge ML Tahaliyani said " he should be hanged by the neck until he is dead " , adding he had lost his right to " humanitarian treatment " .
AT THE SCENE Prachi Pinglay
BBC News , Mumbai
The death sentence was a foregone conclusion .
The judge said that " leniency cannot be shown " because " he was more than keen to attack India " .
He was studiously deadpan when the verdict was handed down on Monday .
But today Qasab was emotional .
A police constable later said : " He asked for water .
He was upset and crying . "
Security to get into the court was extremely tight .
Afterwards , lawyers and policemen expressed relief that they would no longer have to attend this specially - built courtroom in a jail .
Outside the court , there were crowds of people celebrating the sentence .
Demonstrators held up placards saying , " hang him " , and people set off firecrackers in jubilation .
The BBC's Prachi Pinglay , in the courtroom in Mumbai ( Bombay ) , said Qasab shook his head when asked if he wanted to make a statement .
He was later seen wiping his face and talking to a policeman .
Prosecuter Ujjwal Nikam appeared in front of the court smiling and giving the victory sign .
" I 'm very happy with the judgement .
I have been successful in my attempt to put a balm on the wounds of the victims , " he said .
During the trial Qasab had been branded a " killing machine " and " cruelty incarnate " by the prosecution .
" Today 's sentencing sends the message that keeping Qasab alive would be a crime in itself , " Mr Nikam added as crowds outside the court chanted " victory to Hindustan " .
Qasab 's lawyer had called for leniency , saying his client had been brainwashed by a terrorist organisation and could be rehabilitated .

He said no decision had been made yet on whether to appeal against the sentence , the Associated Press news agency reported .
In India the death penalty is carried out by hanging , but it is rarely used and most death sentences are commuted to life imprisonment .
Only one person has been executed since 1995 .
A security guard was hanged in 2004 for the rape and murder of a schoolgirl .
The BBC's Soutik Biswas in Delhi said if Qasab decided to appeal , the legal process could take years .
Our correspondent said Qasab could , as a last resort , appeal to the president for clemency , which would take even more time .
' Mastermind ' in custody MOHAMMED AJMAL AMIR QASAB Pakistani citizen from Punjab province Reports say he received little education , and spent his youth alternating between labouring and petty crime India says he was trained for Mumbai operation by Lashkar - e - Taiba group in a remote camp Captured on camera at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus , a slight figure in combat trousers and a sweatshirt , clutching an assault rifle Prosecutors said he had confessed but his lawyers then said his statement had been coerced , and it was retracted
Deadlock over attack ' masterminds ' Profile of Ajmal Amir Qasab Biswas blog : Media bloodlust Qasab was the only attacker caught alive in the three - day assault by 10 gunmen on hotels , a railway station , a restaurant and a Jewish centre in Mumbai .
Late last year , Pakistan charged seven people in connection with the attacks , including the suspected mastermind Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi , who is alleged to head the Pakistan - based militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba .
But progress with those charges has been slow partly because of legal technicalities in Pakistan , correspondents say .
In the US , an American man of Pakistani origin has pleaded guilty to scouting targets in Mumbai for the attacks .
David Coleman
Headley is alleged to have made five extended trips to Mumbai between 2006 and 2008 .
India has said it will ask for access to Mr Headley in connection with the attacks .

Marquette University has pulled an offer to hire a new dean for the College of Arts and Sciences from a lesbian who has written scholarly works on gender and sexual orientation , a move that is sparking criticism from faculty and a protest by students .
A university spokeswoman said the decision to withdraw an offer to hire Seattle University professor Jodi O'Brien was n't about her sexual orientation or the quality of her scholarship .
It did have to do with some of O'Brien 's published writings " relating to Catholic mission and identity , " Marquette spokeswoman Mary Pat Pfeil said .
" This was a decision based on a totality of factors , specifically related to the fit for the candidate to the college , " she said in an interview .
In the end , the Jesuit school determined O'Brien was not an " acceptable candidate for permanent appointment , " Pfeil said in a statement released Thursday afternoon by the university .
" At this time , the only comment I can offer is to confirm that I was offered the position of Dean and I accepted it , but there was an intercession by the President before my appointment was announced officially , " O'Brien said in an e-mail Thursday evening .
" I 'm stunned and disappointed . "
Several faculty members said the decision raised concerns about academic freedom and the university leadership 's discomfort with the subject of O'Brien 's published work - including a sociological study of vignettes on lesbian sex - rather than any issues of quality .
Psychology professor Stephen Franzoi , who served on a search committee for the post , said faculty members forwarded two candidates to Marquette President Father Robert A. Wild and Provost John Pauly .
In their recommendation , committee members warned Wild and Pauly not to pick O'Brien if the university was not willing to support her if her sexual orientation or if her scholarship were criticized , Franzoi said .
Nancy E. Snow , a philosophy professor , helped O'Brien hunt for houses in Shorewood last month .
She said the discussion of O'Brien 's work is a smokescreen .
She sent an e-mail to several faculty members saying that she suspects donors criticized the hire and that Wild feared losing their support .
" This is a travesty that will have long - term impact for our ability to retain and hire high quality faculty , " Snow said .
" It 's a public disgrace and an embarrassment . "
Pfeil said she did n't know of a donor threatening to pull a donation from Marquette because of the hire .
About 100 students , some carrying signs , protested the decision in front of Marquette 's Alumni Memorial Union , blocking part of Wisconsin Ave. on Thursday afternoon just before an award dinner for Marquette faculty .
Some faculty members wore pink and lavender clothing and flowers in protest .
Margaret Steele , a doctoral student in philosophy department , said the decision " was made behind closed doors and very quietly " and seemed to be a " violation of MU values . "
Nationwide search
Marquette has been searching for an arts and sciences dean since December 2007 , when then - dean Michael McKinney retired .
Three finalists for the post were brought to campus in 2009 , but the search was called off .
Pauly said the university wanted to wait for better economic times that would attract a larger field of candidates .
This time , the committee of nine faculty , an alumnus and a staff member chose its two finalists in March .
O'Brien , who has a doctorate from the University of Washington , was hired as an assistant professor at Seattle University , a Jesuit school , in 1995 , and was named chair of the department of anthropology and sociology in 2002 .
She became a full professor of sociology in 2005 , according to her resume .
The committee also nominated Howard Brown , former chair of the history department at Binghamton University .
Wild and Pauly met with committee members Wednesday and said Marquette was considering pulling the offer to O'Brien .
Committee member Scott Reid , a chemistry professor , said the committee was told that members did n't scrutinize O'Brien 's scholarly works .
" We had people who were very familiar with her work , " Reid said , and the others read her writings before recommendations were made , Reid said .
He said criticism about O'Brien 's writings were n't raised earlier .
" To say now that we were not careful enough is ludicrous , " Franzoi said .
" They should have been prepared to defend their choice . "
Pfeil maintained that Wild has a well - deserved reputation of being inclusive of gays and lesbians , and that Marquette has made notable strides in the area of diversity in the past decade .
" We have on our faculty and staff individuals of various faiths , ages , ethnicity and sexual orientation , " she said .
" These differences help us to promote a culture of learning , appreciation and understanding . "
This weekend I was asked to contribute to The New York Times ‘ Room for Debate .
I was kind of under the impression that the question was , “ Is the Kerry - Graham - Lieberman bill worth passing ? ”
Apparently , though , it was , “ Does the climate bill stand a chance ? ”
Obviously those questions have different answers !
Mine was geared to the former , everybody else ’s the latter , but oh well .
Other answers were provided by :
Here ’s mine , with some additional comments at bottom :
The climate and energy bill being developed by John Kerry , Joe Lieberman , and ( depending on the hour ) Lindsey Graham is n’t very popular on the green left .
Climate campaigners lament that the senators have capitulated to fossil fuel companies , proposing to subsidize the very industries that are polluting the atmosphere and , as we speak , more or less destroying the Gulf of Mexico .
They say the bill wo n’t come close to solving the problem .
And they ’re right .
That makes those of us who still believe the bill is worth passing somewhat unpopular — sellouts , corrupt insiders and so on .
Why would someone who recognizes the scope and severity of the problem support a bill that wo n’t solve it ?
There ’s a complicated answer to that question , but there ’s also a simple one , and it ’s this : I am optimistic about decarbonization .
Despite conventional wisdom to the contrary , reducing emissions will be relatively fast and inexpensive .
There are huge opportunities for low - cost ( or negative - cost ) emission reductions just waiting to be exploited .
Right now , policy is being made out of fear : fear by the private sector that decarbonization will be a crushing burden ; fear by consumers that their energy prices will skyrocket ; fear by politicians that the project will prove electorally unpopular .
Campaigners can organize marches , think tanks can put out reports , scientists can issue dire warnings , but ultimately , that fear simply ca n’t be overcome in advance .
The only way to overcome it is through experience .
Because the bill contains two crucial elements — a declining cap on emissions and a floor on the price of carbon — here ’s what will happen : the price for carbon will sit on the floor and , despite that , the U.S. will sail past its ( tepid , cautious ) short - term target .
In 2020 , buoyed by success , backed by newly powerful clean energy constituencies , the political system will revisit the issue and pass more ambitious targets .
The same thing will happen in 2030 .
And in 2040 .
And 2050 .
Success will breed success .
Oil and coal wo n’t be able to compete and eventually politicians will get sick of subsidizing them .
If you do n’t share that optimism — if you think decarbonization is going to be a grinding , difficult , expensive process — then you have every right to be horrified by the bill ’s inadequacy .
But then , you do n’t have much to be optimistic about , since the likelihood of a substantially stronger bill is vanishingly small any time in the foreseeable future .
But if you do share that optimism , you ’ll agree that putting a system in place and getting started is more important , in the grand scheme of things , than getting this iteration of the legislation just right .
There ’s been more than enough talking ; let ’s let action make the argument for us .
Now , I only had 300 words .
Obviously things are more complicated than this .
For one thing , we ’d be way better off , and move way faster , if the declining cap and carbon price floor were accompanied by a strong renewable energy standard , a strong energy efficiency standard , and a massive program of public investment in clean energy RD&D .
Those elements of the KGL bill are probably going to be severely lacking , and I ’m sure I will do plenty of wailing and garment - rending when I see it .
What it comes down to , though , is that lots of greens have been hoping , striving , and pushing for a long time for a Big Bill — the one , true bill that has scientifically legitimate targets and tight , loophole - free policy mechanisms .
The one that can solve the problem .
But for many reasons , some valid , some not , Congress rarely passes Big Bills .
They almost never solve problems in a single , grand stroke .
Congress works incrementally .
Ultimately we ’re going to have to accept some increment , some partial solution , just to get underway .
There is n’t another choice .

" end end a = A . new ( " hello world " , 5 ) b = B . new ( 7 , a ) c = C . new ( b , a ) puts c ``` Since we created a to_s , method , we can see the string representation of our object tree : < pre >
In C : In A : hello world , 5 In B : 7 In A : hello world , 5</ pre >
To serialize our object tree we simply do the following : ``` ruby serialized_object = YAML :: dump ( c ) puts serialized_object ```
Our serialized object looks like this : < pre >--- !ruby / object :C a_object : &id001 !ruby / object : A number : 5 string : hello world b_object : !ruby / object : B a_object : *id001 number : 7</ pre>
If we now want to get it back : ``` ruby puts YAML :: load ( serialized_object ) ```
This produces output which is exactly the same as what we had above , which means our object tree was reproduced correctly : < pre >
In C : In A : hello world , 5 In B : 7 In A : hello world , 5</ pre >
Of course ** you almost never want to serialize just one object ** , it is usually an array or a hash .
In this case you have two options , either you serialize the whole array / hash in one go , or you serialize each value separately .
The rule here is simple , if you always need to work with the whole set of data and never parts of it , just write out the whole array / hash , otherwise , iterate over it and write out each object .
The reason you do this is almost always to share the data with someone else .
If you just write out the whole array / hash in one fell swoop then it is as simple as what we did above .
When you do it one object at a time , it is a little more complicated , since we do n't want to write it out to a whole bunch of files , but rather all of them to one file .
It is a little more complicated since you want to be able to easily read your objects back in again which can be tricky as < span style = " font - style : italic ; " ></ span>_YAML_
serialization creates multiple lines per object .
Here is a trick you can use , when you write the objects out , separate them with two newlines e.g. : ``` ruby File .
open ( " /home/alan/tmp/blah.yaml " , " w " ) do | file | ( 1 .. 10 ) . each do | index | file .
puts YAML :: dump ( A . new ( " hello world " , index ) ) file .
puts " " end end ```
The file will look like this : < pre >--- !ruby / object : A number : 1 string : hello world --- !ruby / object : A number : 2 string : hello world ...</ pre>
Then when you want to read all the objects back , simply set the input record separator to be two newlines e.g. : ``` ruby array = [ ] $ / = "
" File . open ( " /home/alan/tmp/blah.yaml " , " r " ) . each do | object | array & lt ; & lt ; YAML :: load ( object ) end puts array ```
The output is : < pre >
In A : hello world , 1 In A : hello world , 2 In A : hello world , 3 ...</ pre>
Which is exactly what we expect – handy .
By the way , I will be covering things like the input record separator in an upcoming series of posts I am planning to do about Ruby one - liners , so do n't forget to subscribe if you do n't want to miss it .
## A 3rd Party Alternative
Of course , if we do n't want to resort to tricks like that , but still keep our serialized objects human - readable , we have another alternative which is basically as common as the Ruby built in serialization methods – < a href = " http://www.json.org/ " target= " _blank " > JSON </a >.
The JSON support in Ruby is < a href = " http://flori.github.com/json/ " target = " _blank " > provided by a 3rd party library < / a > , all you need to do is : < pre>gem install json </ pre > or < pre>gem install json- pure </ pre >
The second one is if you want a pure Ruby implementation ( _no native extensions_ ) .
** The good thing about JSON , is the fact that it is even more human readable than YAML **.
It is also a " _low - fat_ " alternative to XML and can be used to transport data over the wire by AJAX calls that require data from the server ( _that 's the simple one sentence explanation :) _ ) .
The other good news when it comes to serializing objects to JSON using Ruby is that if you save the object to a file , it saves it on one line , so we do n't have to resort to tricks when saving multiple objects and reading them back again .
There is bad news of course , in that your objects wo n't automagically be converted to JSON , unless all you 're using is hashes , arrays and primitives .
You need to do a little bit of work to make sure your custom object is serializable .
Let ’s make one of the classes we introduced previously serializable using JSON .
``` ruby require " json " class A def initialize ( string , number ) @string = string @number = number end def to_s " In A :
#{ @string } , #{ @number }
" end def to_json ( * a ) { " json_class " =& gt ; self .
class .
name , " data " =& gt ; { " string " =& gt ; @string , " number " =& gt ; @number } } . to_json ( * a ) end def self .
json_create ( o ) new ( o [ " data " ] [ " string " ] , o [ " data " ] [ " number " ] ) end end ``` Make sure to not forget to ' _require_ ' json , otherwise you 'll get funny behaviour .
Now you can simply do the following : ``` ruby a = A . new ( " hello world " , 5 ) json_string = a .
to_json puts json_string puts JSON .
parse ( json_string ) ```
Which produces output like this : < pre > {" json_class " : " A " , " data " : {" string " : " hello world " , " number " : 5}}
In A : hello world , 5</ pre >
The first string is our serialized JSON string , and the second is the result of outputting our deserialized object , which gives the output that we expect .
As you can see , we implement two methods : * _** to_json**_ – called on the object instance and allows us to convert an object into a JSON string .
* _** json_create **_ – allows us to call _JSON .
parse_ passing in a JSON string which will convert the string into an instance of our object
You can also see that , when converting our object into a JSON string we need to make sure , that we end up with a hash and that contains the ' _json_class_ ' key .
We also need to make sure that we only use hashes , arrays , primitives ( _i.e. integers , floats etc. , not really primitives in Ruby but you get the picture_ ) and strings .
So , JSON has some advantages and some disadvantages .
I like it because it is widely supported so you can send data around and have it be recognised by other apps .
I do n't like it because you need to do work to make sure your objects are easily serializable , so if you do n't need to send your data anywhere but simply want to share it locally , it is a bit of a pain .

The other serialization mechanism built into Ruby is binary serialization using < a href = " http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Marshal.html " target = " _blank " >< em > Marshal</em ></a>.
** It is very similar to _YAML_ and just as easy to use , the only difference is it 's not human readable as it stores your objects in a binary format **.
You use Marshal exactly the same way you use YAML , but replace the word YAML with Marshal :) ``` ruby a = A . new ( " hello world " , 5 ) puts a serialized_object = Marshal :: dump ( a ) puts Marshal :: load ( serialized_object )
In Marion County , Florida , sheriff ’s deputies noticed a car swerving on the road .
They pulled the car over and found Dana Seaman was driving the car .
Seaman admitted that he had been drinking and agreed to take a breathalyzer test .
While the cops were busy setting that up , he decided to finish his drink .
A deputy said he saw Seaman drink from a cup , then throw the cup under his passenger seat .
When the cup was retrieved , of course , it smelled like alcohol .
After the cup was found , Seaman decided not to take the breathalyzer test after all and was charged with DUI .

Mike Duckett ’s tiny office is , rather endearingly , jammed with piles of paper .
‘ I ’m not very good at filing , ’ he apologises , while riffling through them in search of an old menu to show me .
Anyone entering this nondescript windowless room off a hospital kitchen could be forgiven for thinking that nothing much of significance ever happens here .
It looks just the sort of place to which , in times past , employees might have slunk off for a quiet puff .
However , it is from here that a quiet insurgency is taking place , and if I were part of the status quo I ’d be mighty worried .
If Mike has his way , hospital food will not only be transformed from the pauper to the prince of the culinary world , but also will be a darned sight greener too ( and , for the sceptics out there , that ’s not soggy - cabbage green ) .
The targets in his sights include wastage , food miles , additives , idiocy , supermarkets and anything that is not top quality .
We have to go back to 1964 and the unlikely surroundings of the Brompton Sanatorium in Surrey to witness the sowing of the seeds of this uprising .
Dodging between recuperating patients taking their endless prescriptive walks around the grounds , the sanatorium ’s kitchen gardeners would come to the back door and ask Mike what vegetables he would like to use for meals that day .
Pesticides and artificial fertilisers were yet to come into use , so , without really trying , Mike found himself taking delivery of organic vegetables whose food miles could be counted in yards and whose freshness depended solely on how long it took the gardeners to walk up the path .
He cannot have known then that he would never again have it so good .
The nadir came in 2001 when he was the catering manager at King ’s College Hospital , in London .
In a bid to become meaner and leaner , the hospital got rid of its kitchen and started shipping in ready - cooked meals from a factory .
A factory in south Wales .
Mike left .
‘ I started at the Royal Brompton the same year … on 5 November , ’ Mike says with a mischievous air , making sure I ’ve picked up the date ’s significance .
Happily , whatever other revolt he might have ignited , he did n’t have to put dynamite under the hospital ’s management .
They not only had no intention of scrapping their kitchen , but also , just as importantly , were open to Mike ’s radicalism .
And this is radicalism on a grand scale .
Take his campaign to get in more locally produced food , for example .
His milk now comes from an organic herd in Bedford ( to reduce food miles still further he ’s cut deliveries from five or six days a week to three ) .
His bread hails from north London .
Organic oats for the morning porridge arrive from east London ( Mike ’s impressed too by the supplier ’s use of solar power to generate heat ) .
His kitchen ’s cucumbers , tomatoes , potatoes , leeks , carrots , onions and asparagus are grown in south - east England .
His pears are all English , while eating apples are supplied in season from an orchard in Kent .
I make a mental note to sneak a peek at the apples on my way out , just to remind myself of what a homegrown example looks like .
And do n’t get Mike going on what the NHS does with fish .
Apparently , they are hauled all the way from Grimsby to a depot in Somerset , whence they are distributed to hospitals around the country , including , of course , to those around Grimsby .
‘ How stupid is that ? ’ he asks .
So the Royal Brompton buys its fish direct from a chap in London who gets them straight from Great Yarmouth .
Mike ’s ‘ buy local ’ policy has not been brought in without a struggle , however .
There are the government procurement regulations for a start .
‘ I told them that no catering manager has the time to read through a 50 - page booklet – we have to take a commonsense approach to this . ’
It took him five years of wrangling with NHS executives to be released from national contracts so that he could set ones up on a regional or local basis .
Although sometimes even these go by the bye .
‘ With a farm you do n’t need contracts , ’ he explains .
‘ You just pick up the phone and say , “ Send me an extra case of free range eggs , please ” , and it ’s done just like that .
With all these things it ’s not rocket science ’ – unless he ’s procuring local rocket , of course .
As for organics , they already account for 5 per cent of his purchases , but his intention is to raise this to 25 - 30 per cent .
There was also the time , not so long ago , when Mike and a representative of the Soil Association spoke at a meeting in front of 250 NHS caterers and dieticians and were booed – 'we were actually booed .
They thought we were off our heads .
Of course , the same people who were booing me then are now coming round to ask me what I ’m doing . ’
As a result of his measures , he ’s now spending 24 per cent of his food budget locally ( ‘ that ’s within a triangle from Bedford to Dover to Salisbury ’ ) and he ’s hoping to increase that to 30 per cent next year .
Compare that to the low single - digit percentages achieved by most hospitals in Britain and you begin to see it for the feat it is .
And the quality of the food is not in question , either – one of Mike ’s farm suppliers also has The Ivy and Buckingham Palace on its books .
The road to rouxing
It ’s all a far cry from Bath University , and the Catering Management course Mike took in the early 1960s .
On graduating , he spent time as a chef in a Taunton hotel , before embarking on a catering management career that took him to Kensington ’s St Mary Abbots Hospital ( ‘ it ’s a housing estate now ’ ) , Greenwich District Hospital ( ‘ that ’s closed too ’ ) and three others in south - east England .
His worst experience during this time came at Greenwich , where a state - of - the - art conveyor belt meal system went awry .
‘ The first day we opened all the sewage flowed up into the kitchen . ’
Understandably , there came a point when Mike felt it was a good idea to get some catering experience outside the health service .
This included stints at Grand Metropolitan , Barclays Bank directors ’ dining room ( ‘ the waste of food was absolutely frightening ’ ) , London Transport ( ‘ if the drivers did n’t get their cup of tea they brought the buses off the roads ’ ) and the Royal Mail , before returning to the fold at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital .
Back at the Royal Brompton , it ’s the sheer range of innovations that Mike has introduced that is so impressive .
There ’s the installation of a ‘ healthy ’ vending machine ; the ousting of all bottled water ; monthly meetings to find out what patients want on the menus ; a switch from small bottles of milk to three gallon boxes ; and as little frozen food as possible .
Local farmers have their invoices prioritised to improve their cash flow , and as much washable crockery and cutlery has been reintroduced as possible ( he ’s even brought back the teapot ) .
Meanwhile , Mike ’s way with suppliers is demonstrated in my presence .
A patient had recently pointed out that one of his sandwiches contained 25 per cent of the recommended daily salt intake .
Mike is just telling me this when his sandwich supplier pops his head around the door to announce that he ’s found some low - salt breads locally and that they are going to switch over to them as of Monday .
Previously , Mike had politely asked the same supplier to make its packaging compostable .
They duly did so .
Cooking the books
This is all well and good , but how does Mike balance the books ?
One way is by gently persuading his suppliers that they should make their money from their corporate clients while giving him a discount .
He might also pay for a switch from non-organic to organic beef by offering it with slightly less frequency .
It ’s a quality versus quantity thing .
Although Mike ’s conversation is peppered with wry asides , he ’s equally happy to rage against the machine ( albeit in a soft Wiltshire accent ) .
He blames supermarkets for the nation ’s love affair with ready - made meals – ‘ high in sugar , high in salt , high in fat ’ – and is less than keen on greenwash .
One supplier – an award - winning organic bacon producer – was shown the door when Mike discovered it was sending its pigs to Germany to be killed and having the meat shipped back to Britain .
But it ’s Mike ’s love of giving people high quality food that pervades everything he does .
‘ If a patient is happy after having a meal they will be more receptive to treatment , ’ he says .
‘ Furthermore , food is part of their recovery – for a start , I know that if you were given fresh fruit and bananas you would n’t want vitamin C tablets and potassium . ’
Once he manages to find it , Mike passes me the menu that was in use when he arrived at the Royal Brompton .
It reads like an uninspiring list of school - dinner fodder circa 1975 , right up to the jam roly - poly .
The new one , by contrast , sports in - season vegetables and even exotica such as baked navarin of lamb .
The kitchen also prepares its own soups which contain 50 - 60 per cent food content ( ‘ Heinz Chicken Soup is only 4 per cent chicken ’ ) .
The Patient Environment Team Audit has duly awarded the menu three stars , its highest rating .
Not bad considering it ’s all done on a budget of £ 3 to £ 3.50 per person per day , and that ’s including mid-afternoon tea and cake and even the occasional ‘ naughty ’ portion of chips ( ‘ lets not forget that food should be fun sometimes , too ’ ) .
Unsurprisingly , patients have reacted very positively .
In a national survey , the Royal Brompton scored 71 per cent for its meals ( the national average is 52 per cent ) rising to a ripping 94 per cent when patients were asked whether they were offered a choice of meal they liked .
The staff seem pretty happy too , with retention up and absenteeism down – both of which have been attributed in some measure to the excellent staff canteen .
Mike Duckett ’s influence has long since spread beyond the confines of his hospital , however .
In 2004 , he was involved with Sustain ( the alliance for better food and farming ) and the Soil Association in running the two - year Hospital Food Project , in which four London hospitals took part .
At its close , the project – aimed at increasing hospital take - up of local and organic food – broadened into a scheme called Good Food on the Public Plate , which encompassed schools , care homes and yet more hospitals .
Organisations flocking to his door to profit from his expertise include the Hospital Caterers Association , the Royal College of Nursing , the Greater London Authority , the Royal Mail , the Institute of Hospitality and , naturally , other hospitals .
As for the future , it ’s no surprise to find that Mike is buzzing with ideas .
He wants menus printed on recycled paper , more low - calorie and organic food , and more ways of integrating the hospital into the local community .
‘ When it comes down to it , I was just fed up with people saying hospital food was rubbish , ’ he says .
‘ When I can influence it , as I can now , I feel as though I have a moral responsibility .
If I can do it here in a 300 - bed hospital , imagine what the other 600 hospitals can do . ’
Best of all , you do n’t even need to come down with a serious disease to enjoy Mike ’s food – the Royal Brompton ’s street - front cafeteria is open every day to the public .

San Francisco , California ( CNN ) --
Facebook announced some changes on Wednesday that are intended to make the Internet more social .
Essentially , Facebook is stretching out into the rest of the Web .
But what do these new features actually mean for everyday people who use the Internet ?
And when you see these Facebook - looking features popping up on other Web sites , how do you know what to do with them ?
Here 's a quick guide , based on a comments by Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook 's founder and CEO , and interviews with developers who create applications for the massively popular social - networking site :
" Like " buttons
Buttons with the word " like " and a thumbs - up icon on them are going to start popping up all over the Internet .
By clicking one , you indicate that you find the content interesting , relevant or helpful .
Basically , you would recommend it to a friend .
Before Wednesday , " like " buttons only were on Facebook .
Now , they 'll be all over the place , including on this site .
When you click one , you post the item -- whether it's a blog post , photo or celebrity web page -- to your Facebook news feed .
Read about how the feature will work on CNN.com .
The " liked " content may also become part of your Facebook profile , and visible to your friends or to everyone , depending on how your privacy settings are configured on Facebook .
Hey Facebook :
What about a ' dislike ' button ?
Friends ' faces
A consequence of these " like " buttons will be that your friends '
Facebook profile photos will start showing up all over the web .
If you see your friends ' smiling faces online , it 's an indication that they have clicked a " like " button on the Web site you 're visiting .
In a way , they 're recommending it to you .
Facebook users will be able to share interests across the web
Facebook says these recommendations and social connections are the basis for the future of the Internet .
Boring old hyperlinks are becoming something of the past , the company says .
No log-ins
These new Facebook features will show up regardless of whether or not you have entered a user name and password on a particular Web site .
So , say you go to Pandora to listen to music .
If you have logged in to Facebook recently , you wo n't have to do anything on Pandora to see suggestions about music .
Recommendations from your Facebook friends will automatically show up .
Toolbars
Facebook announced new toolbars that other Web sites can add to the bottom of their pages .
The toolbar lets you " like " a particular web page or item , and gives you information about what your friends think of the page you 're viewing .
You can also chat with friends who are currently logged in to Facebook without visiting the site .
Privacy issues
Some Internet users might worry about the fact that their Facebook profile photos , as well as their likes and dislikes , are going to show up all over the web .
At least for now , a person 's likes and dislikes are only as visible as they want them to be .
But , if nothing else , that means you should probably double - check your privacy settings .
Go to Facebook , look at the top right of the screen and click the " Account " tab .
Choose " Privacy settings " and then navigate to " Profile information . "
Check the " likes and interests " setting .
If you have that set to " everyone , " then anyone on the Internet could see which Web pages you have liked .
Some users might only want their Facebook friends to see that information .
Facebook everywhere
One overarching thing you might notice is that Facebook is going to be all over the Internet with these changes .
This puts the social network at odds with Google , which also is trying to organize the world 's information by interests and preferences .
Another potential side effect :
The web you see is the web your friends like .
Without some effort , you might end up browsing based on your friends preferences , rather than exploring new territory .
Your activity can influence them , too .
As you navigate the web and start to play around with these new features , let us know what you think by posting a comment below .
Do you think this will make Facebook the dominant player on the Internet ?
Do you find the features and recommendations useful , or do they clutter up your online experience ?
Tokyo , Japan ( CNN ) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama went back on a campaign promise and announced Sunday that a U.S. military base would remain in Okinawa .
He called his decision " heartbreaking . "
" It is true that I said I wanted to relocate the facility outside of Okinawa , " he said .
" However , I 'd like to apologize that the conclusion is not what the Okinawans wanted . "
The U.S. Marine Corps Futenma base will be relocated to the Henoko area of the island , which is less densely populated , Hatoyama said .
Okinawa Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima demanded a better explanation from the government .
" I must say the situation is extremely disappointing and severe , " he said .
The issue is an emotional one for Okinawans , who currently give up 10 to 20 percent of the island to the U.S. military .
While campaigning for Japan 's top job last year , Hatoyama promised to move the base off of Okinawa altogether .
The island 's residents , energized by an anti-U.S. campaign pledge in the last election , voted overwhelmingly for Hatoyama .
But as prime minister , Hatoyama found the promise difficult to keep , prompting residents to demand that he fulfill his pledge .
Earlier this month Hatoyama visited the island and said it would be challenging to move a U.S. base off Okinawa .
The Futenma relocation is part of a 2006 agreement between Japan and the United States .
Japan 's delay in moving the base strained the 50 - year alliance between the two nations .
The U.S. has said its military presence in Japan plays an important role in maintaining stability in the region .
And the issue of relocating the base was high on U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's agenda during her visit to Japan last week .
Okinawans say the U.S. military has been responsible for a number of blights in Okinawa , from serious crimes like rape and drunken driving , to environmental and noise pollution .
Nearly 100,000 residents held rallies in April to demand that the base be moved off the island .
A recent Nikkei newspaper poll said that 59 percent of Japanese believe the prime minister should resign if he can't resolve the fight over the future of the Futenma military base .
CNN 's Kyung Lah contributed to this report .
The former political rivals will enjoy a des res timeshare
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Foreign Secretary William
Hague will have to share an official country residence , Downing Street has said .
The Lib Dem and the Tory , brought together in the coalition government , will each live part - time at the 3,500 - acre Chevening House estate , in Kent .
Meanwhile , David Cameron retains the traditional prime minister 's residence of Chequers , Buckinghamshire .
And Chancellor George Osborne will have use of Dorneywood , in the same county .
The official residences , which are not owned by the government but held in trust , are for personal use and to host visiting dignitaries .
At the weekend , Mr Cameron held talks at Chequers with Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
Personal space
Prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown often used the 17th - century house for dinner parties , with celebrities including DJ Chris Evans , footballer David Beckham and author JK Rowling attending .
Mr Cameron and his family will mainly visit the 1,000 - acre estate at weekends .
Mr Hague and Mr Clegg are unlikely to spend much time together at Chevening House , although the 115 - room main house would be more than large enough .
The two men , who sit side by side at the cabinet table , are expected to use the property on alternate weekends , with Mr Hague 's duties meaning he has to travel abroad frequently .
Dorneywood , to be used by the chancellor , was built in 1920 , and came to public notice recently when former Deputy Prime Minister was photographed playing croquet there with aides .
A Downing Street spokesman said : " We can confirm that the chancellor of the exchequer will use Dorneywood and both the foreign secretary and the deputy prime minister will have use of Chevening .
" Successive governments have used official residences for government business such as key meetings and hosting international leaders . "
No new resident has been named for the much - desired government flat in Admiralty Arch , central London .
The defense appropriations bill currently moving through the House of Representatives includes a measure which directs the Defense Department ’s inspector general to investigate attorneys who may have “ interfered with operations of the Department of Defense ” while representing detainees at Guantanamo Bay and report back to Congress .
That measure has civil libertarians up in arms .
Salon ’s Glenn Greenwald , for example , described the “ truly vile provision ” as a “ McCarthyite attack on detainee lawyers ” and identified it as “ the brainchild of GOP Rep .
Jeff Miller of Florida , who has labeled efforts to represent detainees … a ‘ treacherous enterprise ” and smeared those lawyers as ‘ disloyal . ' ”
ADVERTISEMENT
According to ABC News , Rep. Miller “ proposed the language to the bill because he was outraged by the allegations behind the Department of Justice investigation that is being led by U. S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald .
Miller said it ’s important to subject detainee defense lawyers to greater scrutiny in order to ‘ identify any policy violations , ’ that , he said , could compromise national security . ”
The allegations cited by Miller became public knowledge last March , when it was revealed that the Justice Department had secretly been investigating whether lawyers involved with the ACLU ’s John Adams Project had broken any laws in their attempts to to have detainees identify CIA interrogators who might have been involved in torture .
When it appeared that the Justice Department was about to conclude that no crimes had been committed , the CIA complained and the department brought Fitzgerald in to resolve the dispute .
Since Fitzgerald ’s investigation remains ongoing , Miller ’s measure would seem to be intended primarily to drag the issue into the political arena and make it the subject of Congressional hearings during the period immediately prior to next fall ’s elections .
The measure also substantially broadens the scope of the current investigations .
According to law professor Steve Vladeck , it would mandate an investigation of any lawyer who might be suspected of having “ interfered with the operations of the Department of Defense ” with regard to Guantanamo detainees or of having “ generated any material risk to a member of the Armed Forces of the United States . ”
“ Virtually every lawyer that has represented a detainee at GuantÃ ƒÂ¡namo has Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ interfered with the operations of the Department of DefenseÃ¢â‚ ¬Â at GuantÃ ƒÂ¡namo , ” Vladeck observes .
“ This language would basically require the DoD IG to report to Congress on every lawyer who has represented a GuantÃ ƒÂ¡namo detainee at any time in the past eight years , including me . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ One can only imagine the kind of chilling effect it might have on lawyers , ” Vladeck adds .
“ The hard question , it seems to me , is whether these provisions would survive constitutional challenge . …
It is the separation of powers itself that is implicated when Congress so directly interferes with constitutionally - protected legal representation . ”
At the center of the dispute are photographs of CIA officers provided to certain detainees by ACLU lawyers .
“ Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. has tapped the Justice Department ’s most feared prosecutor , Patrick Fitzgerald , to lead a sensitive investigation into whether defense lawyers at GuantÃ ƒÂ¡namo Bay compromised the identities of covert CIA officers , ” Newsweek ’s Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball wrote last March .
“ The probe was triggered by the discovery last year of about 20 color photographs of CIA officials in the cell of Mustafa Ahmed al - Hawsawi , an alleged financier of the 9/11 attacks . ”
According to Isikoff and Hosenball , “ The photos included ‘ paparazzi style ’ snapshots of covert CIA officers on the street and in other public places . …
The photos in al - Hawsawi ’s cell were not captioned with the agents ’ identities .
But ‘ there was real concern ’ that the pictures could be used to identify covert officers , resulting in agents becoming the targets of Qaeda revenge plots . ”

Marcy Wheeler of FireDogLake quickly labeled these claims a “ witch hunt ” and explained , “ The CIA , of course , is apoplectic that its interrogators might be tied to what they did to these detainees .
So , in a brief to longtime CIA guy and now top Homeland Security advisor to Obama , John Brennan , they appear to be trying to suggest the John Adams project be investigated for IIPA violations .
… DOJ has apparently brought in Patrick Fitzgerald ( who knows a thing or two about IIPA violations ) to try to resolve the dispute . ”
The ACLU confirmed that it had hired private investigators to take the photographs but noted that “ it would be an essential part of any defense to cross -examine the perpetrators of torture . ”
It also argued that laws against revealing the identities of covert CIA agents had not been broken because “ the 9/11 defendants were not told the identities of the CIA officers . ”
PRAGUE  A popular online video here called “ Convince Granny ” urges young Czechs to withhold visits to their grandparents unless the old folks agree not to vote for leftist parties like the Communists in Saturday ’s elections .
Modeled on the American comic Sarah Silverman ’s video “ The Great Schlep , ” which in 2008 appealed to young Jewish voters to persuade their grandparents to support Barack Obama in the swing state of Florida , the Czech video is a testament to the Communist Party ’s enduring influence here .
The creators of “ Convince Granny ” say they conceived the video , which has had more than 600,000 hits since it was posted on YouTube about a month ago , as a necessary weapon against the ascent of the unreconstructed Communist Party , which recent polls indicate could win up to 15 percent of the vote .
In addition to the jokes about Grandma ’s selective memory , the video implores young viewers not to forget the insidious transgressions of the former Communist government , from the exile of the country ’s leading intellectuals and artists to the execution of its political enemies .
Do policing and punishment deter crime ?
Maybe not .
Here 's Joel Waldfogel in Slate :
The Irrational 18 - Year - Old , by Joel Waldfogel , Slate : Crime control is one of the oldest problems facing social science ...
Two basic tools for controlling crime are policing and imprisonment ...
Both the prospect of getting caught and the prospect of spending time in prison are supposed to deter forward - looking , rational potential offenders from criminal activity , encouraging more - constructive pursuits like staying in school or at least making French fries .
More mechanically , prison also prevents crime by simply caging dangerous people .
Deterrence has long been an article of faith among economic theorists and , more recently , economists who do empirical work , too .
But now a series of careful studies by economists at Columbia and the University of Michigan are calling into question whether either policing or punishment successfully deters crime .
With the traditional tools of social science , the deterrent effect of policing and punishment is hard to measure .
Usually , empiricists infer an effect if crime is lower in circumstances with stiffer punishments or more policing .
The problem is that tougher policies do n't occur randomly .
Cities and states add police or lengthen sentences as a frustrated response to crime waves .
So , crime affects policing and punishment as much as the other way around .
This is one of the classic conundrums of empirical social science .
If social scientists ran the criminal justice system , it would be easy for them to measure the deterrent effect of longer sentences .
They 'd find a group of potential offenders and lengthen prison sentences the group would face if convicted .
The scientists would make sure ... likely delinquents knew about the change , and then ... track whether they committed fewer offenses following the date their criminal penalties would increase .
...
David S. Lee of Columbia and Justin McCrary of Michigan ... noted that when kids turn 18 , they suddenly face much stiffer adult sanctions .
Then they got access to data on all felony arrests in Florida between 1989 and 2002 .
Each arrest links to an individual , whose birth date is included in the data .
...
How does the tendency to commit crimes vary around the 18th birthday , when the odds of a prison - sentence punishment jump ?
The answer is , hardly at all .
... [ T] here is no sizeable decrease in the arrest rate that corresponds to the bump up to an adult penalty in the weeks before and after people turn 18 .
To an economist , this is odd .
At the grocery store , in weeks that Coke is on sale and Pepsi is not , consumers respond immediately .
Coke sells out while Pepsi languishes on the shelf .
If the prospect of longer prison sentences does not deter young Floridians from committing crimes , prison still prevents some crime via the more mundane channel of locking them up — incapacitating rather than deterring them ...
Lee and McCrary see this in the re-arrest data ...
One - fifth of the people arrested the week before their 18th birthday were rearrested within a month .
By contrast , only a tenth of the people arrested a week after their 18th birthday were rearrested within the same time period .
The reason ?
The 18 - year - old offenders spent more of the month behind bars ( because they received longer sentences , on average ) ...
The conclusion that prison time prevents crime through incapacitation rather than deterrence raises questions about the effect of policing .
What benefit do cities and states get from putting more cops on the street ?
In earlier work , McCrary ... concluded that existing data do not allow us to " learn about the causal effect of police on crime . "
It would be premature to discard literally decades of scientific research based on one or two studies .
Still , these studies should keep the debate going .

For the last several months , Fox host Glenn Beck has been promoting what he calls “ the Plan , ” described as a hundred - year scheme for the “ Refounding ” of America .
But as MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann pointed out on Tuesday , there is more — or perhaps less — to “ the Plan ” that meets the eye .
Beck recently told his audience about a conversation he had with his co-host , Pat Gray .
“ I said , ‘ I can feel it coming , ” Beck began .
“ It ’s darkness , and I can just feel it coming . ’
And I al– I started to say — I said , ‘ The problem is , is that –‘ and I stopped , because I do n’t want to utter something like this without really thinking it through .
But I was about to say , ‘ the problem is , is that God is giving a plan , I think , to me that is not really a plan . ' ”

“ Okay , so the plan is n’t really a plan , ” Olbermann remarked after showing this clip .
“ Does it at least tell us where to go and who to follow ? ’
“ The plan that He would have me articulate , I think , to you , ” Beck continued , “ is get behind Me — and I do n’t mean ‘ me , ’ I mean Him .
Get behind Me. Stand behind Me . ”
“ I ’m confused , ” Olbermann commented cheerfully .
“ Behind you ?
Behind Him ?
You ’re left behind ? …
Oh , wait , here ’s the big payoff in which the plan is accidentally revealed . ”
“ Pat and I both went home and prayed , ” Beck went on portentously .
“ We both opened our Bibles , and we found something the next day that I think is important for you today to understand .
He found one thing .
He found the first piece , I found the second piece .
The message was the same , but I think the message is for you today . ”
But instead of actually revealing his message from God , Beck glanced to one side and quickly switched gears , saying , “ I ’ll give that to you in one second .
First I have to break for our sponsor , Goldline . ”

Goldline International is a precious metals vendor that Beck has previously gotten into trouble for promoting on - air .
“ That ’s the plan ! ” Olbermann laughed .
“ Buy more gold over the Internet .
Hallelujah !
We ’re saved ! ”

Your Office Suite with 1Map
Better interoperability
Go-oo has built in OpenXML import filters and it will import your Microsoft Works files .
Compared with up - stream OO.o , it has better Microsoft binary file support ( with eg. fields support ) , and it will import WordPerfect graphics beautifully .
If you are reliant on Excel VBA macros - then Go-oo offers the best macro fidelity too .
If you expect your spreadsheets to calculate compatibly , or you get embedded Visio diagrams in your documents , you 'll want Go-oo .
Better functionality
Go -oo 's user interface is more familiar , with lots of small pieces of polish .
We have built - in ( working ) multimedia integration on Linux , a beautiful solver component , and your Chinese should look sane .
We also integrate with your system better by default : eg. enabling native file - selectors on Linux .
A Faster application
From first - time startup , where we sort I/ O to reduce seek cost , to a highly optimised second start application and a systray quick - starter on Linux we are faster .
We use less memory than up - stream , we link faster , use better system allocators , and do n't waste so much time & memory in the registry .
Go -oo performance is hard to beat .
Faster code integration
Contributing code to go - oo is simple , and fast , following the traditional hackers ' process of peer code review : just mail patches to the mailing list , or when we get used to your code - commit your patch immediately to HEAD ooo - build : no CWS , no hours of tagging , paperwork , no specification , no hassle .
Of course - if your patch sucks - expect to hear how it can be improved .
Freer licensing
For the code to live , grow and improve , to encourage participation and compete with the other office suite - we need sensible licensing : ie .
weak copy - left .
While in general we think LGPLv3 is a great & sufficient license for our code , others eg .
Sun & IBM appear reluctant to include LGPL code into their products , and prefer other licenses such as the CDDL ( a weak copy - left derived from Mozilla 's MPL ) .
Luckily dual licensing under the LGPLv3 / CDDL can help here - and we recommend this for the majority of our code .
We believe that copyright assignment to a single corporate entity opens the door for substantial abuse of the best - interests of the codebase and developer community .
As such , we prefer either eclectic ownership ( cf. Mozilla , GNOME , KDE , Linux ) , or an independent , meritocratic foundation ( cf. Eclipse , Apache ) to own the rights .
Having said that we recognise and applaud Sun 's technical contribution to OpenOffice and recommend that small patches & fixes to existing Sun code should be assigned to them under the SCA , and up - streamed .
Canadians bound for Cuba will soon have a choice for travel health insurance .
They may buy an openly capitalist policy here , or face having to buy a sneaky communist policy there .
Proof of medical coverage will become mandatory for all visitors to Cuba starting May 1 .
The Cuba Tourist Bureau in Canada notified tour operators recently , and promises a general announcement with more details shortly .
About 914,000 Canadians visited the land of Fidel Castro last year , according to the bureau .
In future , if Canadians arrive without coverage , a Cuban company will sell them medical coverage at an airport , port or marina .
A government announcement said about 20 per cent of visitors now arrive without coverage .
Tourist Bureau employees assure callers that Cuba will not force its insurance policies on anyone with individual or group travel health insurance coverage from Canada .
Tourism is a major source of Cuba ’s foreign exchange earnings .
Bruce Cappon , a broker who runs First Rate Insurance Inc. , hoped at first that Cuba would offer his older clients coverage they could not find or afford in Canada because of pre-existing medical conditions .
“ I thought Cuba would help keep a lid on runaway capitalist prices , by doing do a mass pooling of risk , ” he says .
“ But I was shocked to discover highly selective exclusions , worse than in this country . ”
Cuba is a country known for its long , warm beaches and its low - cost , high - quality medical personnel .
Hospitals do not necessarily have the most modern equipment thanks to America ’s embargo on trade with Cuba .
But some of Cuba ’s 2.4 million annual visitors travel there to get medical care .
The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States reports that Cuba helps pay for oil imports by supplying about 30,000 medical personnel to Venezuela .
Surely , thought Cappon , Cuba could apply its collective values to design a low - cost medical plan for tourists .
Many of Canada ’s snowbird tourists have complained that most , though not all , emergency medical coverage is priced as though everyone is going to the United States , with its high - cost medical care .
But Mónica Aguirre , a marketing coordinator at Ingle International in Toronto , says the bare - bones medical policies offered by Cubalinda.com , the online travel agency founded by the late former CIA agent Philip Agee , would be no match for Canadian policies .
At current exchange rates , Cubalinda will charge $ 2.70 .
a day for up to $ 7,558 of medical emergency insurance , plus assorted other types of coverage .
It will charge about $ 3.24 a day for $ 27,000 of medical coverage and $ 7,558 for transportation of deceased , injured or sick persons .
That compares with as little as $ 1.81 a day or a minimum of $ 16 a week for a young Canadian to get $ 5 million of medical coverage from a Canadian insurer , says Aguirre .
Meanwhile , a reasonably healthy senior , age 70 to 74 , would pay $ 6.36 a day for a short trip to a non-U.S. destination , says Cappon .
Aguirre ’s company ’s president , Robin Ingle , concedes the skimpy Cuban policies would provide enough coverage for the vast majority of illnesses or injuries travelers might experience in Cuba .
But the transportation and medical coverage would be too limited for someone who suffered such a serious injury or illness that they required care in the United States before returning to Canada , he said .
Cappon became extremely concerned when he found a scary exclusion in the Cuban policies .
“ The Cubalinda.com website says ‘ the insurer will not assume payment for treatment of pre-existing medical condition ( sic ) , known or unknown to the insured person ’ . ”

You could pay the modest premium and discover later you have no coverage when you need it .
So proceed with caution .
Do n’t leave home without adequate coverage .

How to adjust your mirrors PROPERLY
To adjust your mirrors properly , put your head against the left side door glass , then adjust your left mirror OUT until you just barely can ( or barely can not ) see the side of your car .
THEN , move your head to the center of your car and adjust your right mirror out until you can barely ( or barely can not ) see the side of your car .
The goal is to set it up so that once a car leaves your REAR view mirror , it appears in your SIDE view mirror - and once it leaves your SIDE view mirror , it appears in your side window / peripheral vision .
Unfortunately , some American cars do n't let you adjust the mirrors out far enough to completely accomplish this .
I recommend experimenting in a parking lot until you get the ideal angle .
With mirrors in their new position , you have to turn your head less and you can see more while essentially eliminating your blind spots .
It does take some getting used to - but give it a shot !
You 've been driving for many years .
Youhow to adjust your mirrors .
Who do I take you for , some idiot ?
Yes .
Ok , so you may not be an idiot , but chances are , you do n't have your side mirrors adjusted properly .
Lets take a look .
Sitting in the driver 's seat , looking at my passenger side mirror , this is what I see :
This is probably close to what you see / how you have your mirrors adjusted .
About 1/3rd of the mirror looks down the side of the car , the other 2 /3rds shows you what is beside you .
Now , lets take a look in your rear - view mirror :
Finally , lets take a look out your side window :
What 's wrong with this picture ?
Let me show you .
Take a look at the pink squares .
What your side mirrors is showing you is NOT what 's beside you - it 's what 's behind you !
It 's information that is COMPLETELY DUPLICATED by your rear view mirror !
Lets take a look at the results of adjusting the right mirror correctly :
This car was completely invisible to me prior , unless I looked over my shoulder and through the rear quarter window .
In Fara 's Honda S2000 with the top up , this car would have been completely invisible .
Now , to further illistrate my point , I will drive forwards about 10 feet until the car appears in my rear view mirror :
Here , you 'll see that it 's visible from approximately the rear of the car to the front of the front doors .
Now , lets take a look in my side mirror :
Here , you can see the entire front of the car , including down most of the quarter panel .
Essentially , very little ( to no ) part of the car is invisible .
Now , I will drive backwards 20 feet ( 10 feet behind my original position ) and take a look in my side mirror :
Here , the rear 1 /3rd of the car is visible .
When you look out the side window , this is what you see :
You can see the car .
At this point it will be visible in your peripheral vision without even turning your head .

Abstract
Each week , more blog posts are redacted , more videos deleted , and more web pages removed from Internet search results based on private claims of copyright infringement .
Under the safe harbors of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , Internet service providers are encouraged to respond to copyright complaints with content takedowns , assuring their immunity from liability while diminishing the rights of their subscribers and users .
Paradoxically , the law 's shield for service providers becomes a sword against the public who depend upon these providers as platforms for speech .
Under the DMCA , process for an accused infringer is limited .
The law offers Internet service providers ( ISPs ) protection from copyright liability if they remove material expeditiously in response to unverified complaints of infringement .
Even if the accused poster responds with counter - notification of non-infringement , DMCA requires the service provider to keep the post offline for more than a week .
If this takedown procedure took place through the courts , it would trigger First Amendment scrutiny as a prior restraint , silencing speech before an adjudication of lawfulness .
Because DMCA takedowns are privately administered through ISPs , however , they have not received such constitutional scrutiny , despite their high risk of error .
I add to prior scholarly analysis of the conflict between copyright and the First Amendment by showing how the copyright notice - and - takedown regime operates in the shadow of the law , doing through private intermediaries what government could not to silence speech .
In the wake of Citizens United v. FEC , why can copyright remove political videos when campaign finance law must not ?
This Article argues for greater constitutional scrutiny .
The public is harmed by the loss of speech via indirect chilling effect no less than if the government had wrongly ordered removal of lawful postings directly .
Indeed , because DMCA takedown costs less to copyright claimants than a federal complaint and exposes claimants to few risks , it invites more frequent abuse or error than standard copyright law .
I describe several of the error cases in detail .
The indirect nature of the chill on speech should not shield the legal regime from challenge .
When non-infringing speech is taken down , not only does its poster lose an opportunity to reach an audience , the public loses the benefit of hearing that lawful speech in the marketplace of ideas .
Yet under the DMCA 's pressure , the poster 's private incentive to counter - notify and the host 's incentives to support challenged speech are often insufficient to support an optimal communication environment for the public .
Instead , this set of incentives produces a blander , but not significantly less copyright infringing , information space .
Copyright claimants assert that the expedited process of the DMCA is critical to suppress infringement in the highly networked digital world .
While many instances of infringement are properly targeted for takedown under the DMCA , I argue that the accuracy of some takedowns does not excuse a careful examination of the rate and costs of error .
I therefore recommend changes to the law to reduce the error , balancing speech protection and copyright .
Part I surveys the legal , economic , and architectural sources of the DMCA 's chilling effects on speech .
Part II then examines the First Amendment doctrines that should guide lawmaking , with critique of copyright 's place in speech law .
Part III reviews the history and mechanics of the DMCA and provides examples of chilled speech and a few instances of limited warming .
Finally , Part IV engages current policy debates and proposes reform to protect online speech better .
Mass Migration , the Modern Version of Invasion
In the ancient days , such as prior to 1945 , politics , that is territorial acquisition , was much more honest .
If I wanted your province , I invaded , if I could , took it , if I could and annexed it , if I could .
That was prior to 1946 .
Mass Migration , the Modern Version of Invasion
Since 1946 and the UN , things have gotten more complicated and much more bloody .
Human migration , integration and annexation of property is something that is age old .
One group moves into the territory of another , they either agree to settle or fight and then the outcome to one degree or another settles the issue .
The conquered , and it usually was a fast event , either gets exterminated , assimilated or pushed out .
More often it was the later two and quite often it was direct assimilation into the new state and culture , to one degree or another .
Often times , the speed of the event precluded a high level of hatred and sped up assimilation .
Not so , in the modern world .
In the modern world , states conquer each other through a slow , grinding process of migration and assimilation and forced cultural change .
Since this does not involve a clear cut battle or series of military engagements , the victim does not feel defeated and resists with everything he has , thus instead of a short sharp act of mass violence , followed by first oppression and then integration , something that usually lasts a generation or less , we have multi-generational , degeneration , murder , oppression and counter oppression .
In other words , slow attrition that further grinds down both societies , especially those at the center of it .
Now , the local populations resist in different measures .
Often , the state , for what ever reason : corruption , ideology , or simple plain ignorance , does not actively support its own population on its own territory , against the aggressor state that is sending its population over .
Some times the people take action to defend their lands and some times they roll over and " die " .
Ignorance is the simplest matter to deal with , as the situation will become critical sooner than later and will force the attention of the government and population .
Corruption is a much more difficult issue , as usually there are special interests involved at the highest levels .
Ideology , such as that in the West , is a death knell , as there is no curing it , short of radical revolution , and the outcome is the destruction of the target culture and in the end a large section of the resistant population .
This is most obvious in places such as East Asia , Russia , Europe and America .
In East Asia , the invasions come both at the back end of the military , such as the occupation of Tibet by China and the so far failed cultural , racial assimilation or the invasions by Chinese into south eastern Russia ( Siberia ) .
As we have seen , recently , the Tibetans , based on religion , first and foremost , have resisted assimilation but due to the strict control of the government , that is Beijing , violent outbursts have been few and quickly suppressed .
But most nations are very homogeneous , such as the Koreans or Japanese , are as such , make it very difficult for legal immigrants and basically impossible for illegals .
This is a concerted effort , coordinated by both the government and society , as a whole .
In Russia , Chinese migration and that of Chinese Koreans , fleeing China , has been much more visible .
Russia 's Siberia is heavily underpopulated , with about 20 % of the Russia population located in the area .
While the government 's border controls are all but non-existent in the thousands of miles of wilderness , the enforcement in the cities and more populated areas , has also been very patchy , driven by corruption .
Of course , unlike in many other areas of the world , the migrants do not bring drugs with them , but cheap Chinese merchandise , without authorization , taxes paid and used to dominate the local markets .
Of course , this also is their downfall amongst the
Population .
Simply put , the Chinese move into a village or town , start to dominate the market , bringing in more illegals to work it and force out the local population .
In cases such as these , where the local population is not actively supported by the government , the people have , on more than one occasion , taken the matters directly into their own hands , quite literally with torches and pitchforks .
This often enough , forces the Moscow government to take notice of the lackings in the oblast governments and force the oblasts to rectify the situation , along nationalist , pro-Russian lines .
In other words , enforce the law .
Enforced migration checks , even deep in Russia , on trains , has netted thousands of Chinese who had no right to be in Russia .
Unfortunately , until recently , the same could not be said about Moscow itself and many of the other major cities , where building booms allowed local companies to quietly import illegal workers , some even from Mexico , but most from Central Asia .
Now , unlike the Chinese , these are your classic , dirt poor , unskilled labour that floods in , along with drugs , guns and violence .
This quickly became evident when the building boom left many tens of thousands without work and turning quickly to crime .
A galvanizing incident was the murder of a 36 year old , 8 month pregnant , mother of 1 other child , who was strangled to death by a Tajik illegal , for nothing more than her wallet .
Public outcry was deafening and Moscow city government was forced to at least start to address the issue with sweeps and deportations .
The issue is far from settled and these third worlders are less than welcome .
Then there is the case of the West , especially that of the Anglos .
Entire cultures are being radically changed by the mass importation , and what else can it be possibly called , of third world Islamics in Europe and Latin Americans , specifically Mexicans , as well as Islamics , in America .
This has caused radical shifts toward oppressive Shari , calls for Islamic Caliphates and Raza Reconquesta , depending on which nation is talked about .
However , Europe is not all equal and outside of the mostly Anglo sheep , though to be fair , there are small groups fighting to over come their cultural and physical enslavement and destruction , there is a quickly growing back lash .
In Austria , Switzerland and Netherlands , right parties have come to power , advocating expelling the Islamic threat .
These parties join the already in power Italian right .
Behind them , clamoring for power and gaining it , are similar parties in the Netherlands , Germany , Sweden , France and Spain .
It would seem that the radical Islamics are over staying their welcome and over playing their Jihadist hand .
Their drive for Shari has awoken a sleeping public that still out numbers them some 10 to 1 .
If the will of the people is not carried out peacefully , by the government , the people will more than take matters into their own hands , as have Italians , first burning out gypsy shanty towns , then forming mobs to attack rioting Africans in Sicily .
However , the English and American Anglos do not seem phased .
Never mind that Islamics in England can stand on the street corners and scream death to the queen , while England itself is now a terrorist state , exporting Jihad .
Of course , England has been joined by the US in that distinction .
Both are coming more and more to resemble the very states they define as evil : Iran : authoritarian and Islamic , though of the Sunni , Saudi , variety .
Weak cultures are often over whelmed by more powerful , but rarely more civilized , cultures , as is happening in America and the UK , both led by self - loathing elites who are more than happy to see the very cultures that gave them prosperity destroyed , in some masochistic cleansing ritual .
They use this to rid themselves of their own white - Christian guilt , regardless of the very real blood toll it is taking upon their very own people .
Self obsession and self loathing is the way of the man-gods of the Anglo world .
That the majority of the citizenry is rolling over for this , shows the very depth of that prevalent self - loathing and guilt and the desire for self - destruction .
The void can be a very alluring thing and it has already pulled in much of the corrupt and dieing West .

" Palmitos , sí ; jamón crudo español , no . "
Esa es la nueva consigna de Guillermo Moreno .
El secretario de Comercio Interior informó en los últimos días a las principales cadenas de supermercados la decisión de impedir el ingreso de alimentos importados que tengan un equivalente de producción nacional .
La orden de Moreno fue clara : a partir del 1° de junio las góndolas de los supermercados argentinos sólo ofrecerán productos fabricados en el país .
La restricción regirá para una larga lista de artículos , desde las pastas italianas hasta las cervezas alemanas , pasando por el aceite de oliva español o el chocolate suizo .
" Mientras haya un fabricante nacional , no hay razón para trabajar con un producto importado .
El que quiera seguir trayendo palmitos o ananá no va a tener problemas , pero no vamos a permitir que se sigan importando jamón crudo italiano o chocolates desde Europa " , fue la frase que Moreno repitió , con pequeñas variaciones , en su mensaje a las distintas cadenas de supermercados .
Como una política habitual de Moreno , la orden fue impartida en forma verbal y no quedó expresada por escrito .
Y para asegurarse de que las cadenas de supermercados cumplan con el mandato oficial , el secretario de Comercio Interior también habría sugerido a la Administración Nacional de Medicamentos , Alimentos y Tecnología Médica ( Anmat ) que trabe el ingreso de los productos importados .
Este organismo es el encargado de emitir un certificado de libre circulación que es indispensable para el ingreso de un alimento importado en el país .
En teoría , Moreno no tiene jurisdicción sobre la Anmat , que depende del Ministerio de Salud , aunque ésta no sería la primera vez en la que el secretario de Comercio le imparte una orden a un funcionario de otra área .
Los supermercados se quejan de que la prohibición para importar alimentos significa un cambio en las reglas de juego , ya que hasta el año pasado la política que impulsaba Moreno era que las cadenas podían traer del exterior los artículos que quisieran siempre que mantuvieron un balance entre importaciones y exportaciones .
De esta manera , algunas cadenas que eran grandes exportadoras de carnes y artículos de cuero , como Coto o La Anónima , contaban con un margen mayor para abastecerse de productos importados .
Ahora , las más afectadas son las cadenas de hipermercados que trabajan con una oferta mayor de artículos de origen extranjero , como Carrefour , Walmart y Jumbo , aunque igualmente en ningún caso los alimentos importados representan más del 3 % del surtido .
Freno al choclo brasileño
Los primeros problemas con la importación de alimentos se registraron hace un par de semanas cuando algunas cadenas de supermercados encontraron trabas para traer choclos desde Brasil .
En este caso , la producción nacional no alcanza a cubrir toda la demanda interna , con lo que tradicionalmente las firmas locales se abastecen de choclo brasileño .
" Cuando le explicamos la situación a Moreno , nos dijo que no era problema de él y que había que apoyar a la industria nacional " , explicó un importador .
La restricción a las importaciones no sólo afecta a los importadores de productos delicatessen ; también la sufrirán algunas multinacionales que trabajan con un sistema de complementación de su producción a nivel regional .
" En nuestro caso , estamos trabajando con algunas líneas de productos que se fabrican en Brasil y otras diferentes que hacemos en la Argentina " , señaló el gerente de una compañía extranjera con presencia en toda la región .
A la hora de explicar las razones para este freno a la importación , Moreno se amparó en el argumento de que había que proteger la industria nacional , ante una eventual invasión de alimentos importados gracias a la debilidad del euro .
La preocupación oficial está puesta especialmente en lo que pueda suceder en algunos países como España y Grecia , que hoy enfrentan una fuerte caída en la demanda interna de alimentos .
Sin embargo , el proteccionismo de Moreno podría convertirse en un arma de doble filo , ya que los supermercadistas alertan sobre que una restricción a la oferta provocaría una nueva ola de aumentos de precios , como ya sucedió en el pasado cada vez que se cerró la economía .
" Si no puedo importar más pastas italianas , los fabricantes nacionales me van a querer cobrar más sus productos " , graficó el director de una cadena líder .
The left and the media knee - capped the Bush presidency for not making Hurricane Katrina go away fast enough .
So now , like a village feud in ancient Sicily , the right and its media are knee - capping the Obama presidency for not making the Gulf 's spilled oil go away fast enough .
Boo hoo .
The answer of course to ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) is that you will get blamed for days on end , no matter what the facts are .
If under some ancient compulsion of honor you admit some culpability , the plaintiffs lawyers will pillage your assets , and a political - media bonfire will burn down what 's left of your reputation .
Why go there ?
In the pin - the - tale - on - the - donkey world we occupy now , the political and legal price of taking ownership is too high .
The answer to ( 2 ) — can we help ? — is a more interesting case , especially if we limit it to the idea that when a big disaster strikes the government should come forward .
[ Editor ’s note :
This is the second part in a four - part series on two new studies examining the negation of windpower emissions savings from fossil - fuel firming .
The Netherlands study below , which is found to be consistent to Mr. Hawkins ’s calculator approach , indicates a total negation of emissions savings from fossil - fuel fill - in . ]
Windpower has traditionally been considered a substitute for carbon - based energy and thus a strategy for reducing related emissions , including that of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
However , reality is more complicated .
Either natural gas - fired or coal - fired power must rescue wind from its intermittency problem , a role that creates incremental fuel usage and emissions compared to a situation where the conventional capacity could operate on a steadier basis .
Previous studies have highlighted this unsettling tradeoff for proponents of windpower .
And a new study by C. le Pair and K. de Groot based on actual experience in the Netherlands finds :
The use of wind energy for electricity generation in combination with the requirement for fossil fuel powered stations to compensate for wind fluctuations can easily lead to loss of the expected saving in fuel use and CO2 emission .
In addition , the conventional stations will be subject to accelerated wear and tear .
It is recommended to get an accurate and quantitative insight into these extra effects before society sets out to apply wind energy on a large scale .
All producers must be required to publish data on the efficiency effects and fuel use when wind energy is added on .
This post reviews their study and compares its results with that produced by my fossil fuel and CO 2 emissionscalculator , both of which show how quickly any claimed saving from wind can become negative given the reality of fossil - fuel backup to firm - up intermittent power .
Le Pair and de Groot analyze the published information on fossil fuel consumption and produced electricity for the generation plants in the Netherlands to determine the associated decrease in efficiency of fossil fuel plants in a wind mirroring role–and hence its effect on claimed reductions on CO 2 emissions .
However , their mathematical model is also generally applicable and will be used in subsequent parts of this series for actual experience with wind power in Colorado and Texas .
Technical Analysis
In the absence of specific information on the efficiency loss of individual fossil - fuel plants operating in a wind balancing role , they determine the effect in the efficiency loss in the total fossil - fuel fleet for the amount of wind generation present in the Netherlands in 2007 .
These calculations are possible due to the availability of published data on fuel input and electricity output for the total amounts of the various types of the power stations .
The logic and associated algebra are challenging , but it is possible to reproduce their results .
Their analysis determines that the overall efficiency loss of the power station fleet due to the presence of wind plants at ?
F=0 is : [ note that ?
means delta or “ change in ” .
It appears WordPress does not recognize the Greek letter delta ]
? R = ( E w / E ) x R
Where :
? R = the overall efficiency loss due to the presence of wind plants of the power station fleet
E w = the electricity production of the wind plants
E = The total electricity production of the wind plants and the power plant fleet
R = The efficiency of the these power plants without wind present
R is not known .
The observed efficiencies in their Table 1 are the effect of the presence of wind plants and reported as R i .
This is solved by substituting ( R i + ?R ) for R .
The resulting efficiency loss for the Netherlands central fossil fuel fleet is 2.11 % as is shown in their Table 2 .
Policy makers take note that this corresponds to a wind penetration in terms of electricity produced of about only 3 % and this results in no fossil fuel or C0 2 emissions savings .
The underlying assumptions are that ( 1 ) there is efficiency loss due to the presence of wind , and ( 2 ) the losses since the introduction of wind in the Netherlands are attributable to wind .
These are reasonable because :
There are sufficient indications of loss of efficiency from many studies including those provided in their paper and those listed here .
Many fossil fuel and CO 2 emissions saving projected by wind proponents ignore this essential consideration .
The factors affecting fleet plant efficiency over time will be : deterioration with age , offset by effective maintenance and upgrades ; replacement of plants with more efficient types ; and parasitic loads of pollution reduction technologies .
A study by the National Petroleum Council indicates that the overall trend is to improved efficiencies and a level efficiency profile for existing plants .
Translating this into the efficiency loss for the fossil fuel plants that are operating in the wind balancing role requires the determination of the electricity that must be produced by these , as all fossil - fuel plants are not being cycled to balance wind .
Assuming le Pair and de Groot ’s capacity factor for wind of 25 % , the amount of electricity generation that is needed for wind mirroring can be calculated as 100 % - 25 % or 75 % .
This is what must be produced on average over , say one year , to accommodate wind variations from 0 - 100 % of wind capacity ( which has an annual average of 25 % of capacity ) .
The efficiency loss for the fossil - fuel plants in the wind mirroring role can then be calculated by attributing the total loss to this subset .
The results are shown in le Pair and de Groot ’s Table 3 , which is reproduced here as Table 1 .
In this case they have chosen to start from an assumed efficiency in normal operations of 45 % .
Table 1 – Le Pair and de Groot ’s Table 3 Showing Efficiency Loss of Fossil Fuel Plants
In Table 1 , column one is the effect on the fossil - fuel fleet as a whole as wind production is increased from zero .
Column two ( R bu ) shows the resulting efficiency of the backup ( wind mirroring ) plants .
Column three provides the equivalent values for twice the wind presence , which shows that for a wind mirroring plant efficiency loss of 34.12 % , the expected efficiency reduction across the fossil - fuel fleet would be about 4 % .
Le Pair and de Groot calculate that the threshold for no savings in fossil fuel consumed at the wind penetration rate for the Netherlands of 3.2 % is about 2 % ( ?R ) for the central fleet of fossil fuel plants , or about their calculated actual value of 2.11 % .
The associated percentage reduction in the efficiency ( heat rate penalty ) of backup plants is calculated as follows from Table 1 :
Backup plant efficiency is derived from the interpolated value between a ? R of 2.00 % and 2.50 % for 0.11 percentage points , or ( 0.11/0.5 ) x ( 34.10-32.05 ) = 0.45
Subtracting the interpolated value for ?
R yields a backup plant efficiency of 34.10 - 0.45 ( percentage points ) = 33.65 %
This means there is an efficiency loss ( heat rate penalty ) of ( 45.00-33.65 )/45.00 = 25.2 % .
Changing the starting point of 45.0 does not affect the percentage calculation .
Comparison to Calculator Results
Table 2 shows the calculator results , setting the wind input at the Netherlands production of 0.39 GWy , their assumed 25 % wind capacity factor and using the heat rate penalty of 25.2 % .
This calculator run assumes gas plants alone are used for wind balancing ( shown with and without the need for OCGT ) and Table 3 assumes that the proportion of gas and coal used for wind balancing is that of the overall installed mix .
Table 2 – Calculator Results for Wind Balancing Plants ( Gas Alone ) in the Netherlands
Wind proponents will typically assume the saving in fossil fuel will be the same as the wind capacity factor ( in this case a wind capacity of 25 % is used by le Pair and de Groot ) .
This ignores the effects of wind on the efficiency of the fossil fuel plants in the wind mirroring role .
When this efficiency loss is taken into account the calculator shows between 0.5 % saving and 1.7 % increase in fossil fuel consumption across the total fossil fuel fleet compared to the le Pair and de Groot level of 0 % .
Note also that the CO 2 emissions are in proportion to fossil fuel consumption .
A second calculator run , now including coal plants in the wind mirroring role , was performed assuming that the fossil fuel plants in wind backup are in proportion to the overall ratio .
A proxy for the combination , CO 2 emissions , is shown .
Table 3 – Calculator Results for Wind Balancing Plants ( Using Gas and Coal ) in the Netherlands
Conclusion
The study under review found that 100 percent of the claimed emissions savings from windpower was negated by fossil fuel backup to firm up wind ’s intermittency .
The calculator finds roughly similar results to that of le Pair and de Groot for the level of wind penetration in the Netherlands .

In the last few days Joe Hewitt has been lamenting the state of client side web development technologies on twitter .
TechCrunch covered the progress in their The State Of Web Development Ripped Apart In 25 Tweets By One Man .
Today Joe followed up with a brilliant point :
joehewitt :
If CLI was the ECMA standard baked into browsers instead of ECMAScript we'd have a much more flexible web : http://bit.ly/sLILI
ECMA CLI would have given the web both strongly typed and loosely typed programming languages .
It would have given developers a choice between performance and scriptability .
A programming language choice ( use the right tool for the right job ) and would have in general made web pages faster just by moving performance sensitive code to strongly typed languages .
A wide variety of languages would have become first - class citizens on the web client .
Today those languages can run , but they can run in plugin islands .
They can run inside Flash or they can run inside Silverlight , but they are second class citizens : they run on separate VMs , and they are constrained on how they talk to the browser with very limited APIs ( only some 20 or so entry points exist to integrate the browser with a plugin , and most advance interoperability scenarios require extensive hacks and knowing about a browser internal ) .
Perhaps the time has come to experiment embedding the ECMA CLI inside the browser .
Not as a separate plugin , and not as a plugin island , but as a first - class VM inside the browser .
Running side - by - side to the Javascript engine .
Such an effort would have two goals :
Access to new languages inside the browser , optionally statically typed for major performance boosts .
A new platform for innovating on the browser by providing a safe mechanism to extend the browser APIs .
We could do this by linking Mono directly into the browser .
This would allow developers to write code like this :
< script language = " csharp " > from email in documents .
ElementsByTag ( " email " ) email .
Style .
Font = " bold " ; </ script >
Or pulling the source from the server :
< script language = " csharp " source = " ImageGallery.cs " ></ script >
We could replace `csharp ' with any of the existing open sourced compilers ( C# , IronPython , IronRuby and others ) .
Or alternatively , if users did not want to distribute their source and instead ship a compact binary to the end users , they could embed the binary CIL directly :
< script language = " cil " source = " MailApp.dll " ></ script >
Pre-emptive answer to the " view - source " crowd : you can use .
NET Reflector to look at the source code of a compiled binary .
If it is obfuscated , you will enjoy reading that as much as you would enjoy reading any Javascript in the real web .
Embedding the CIL on the browser would create isolated execution environments for each page ( AppDomain in ECMA parlance ) and sandbox the execution system .
The security model exposed by Silverlight exposes exactly what is needed to go beyond a language - neutral runtime .
The security model distinguishes between untrusted code which is subject to verification , strict requirements on what it can do and limits what they can do from " platform " code that is trusted .
Trusted platform code is granted special permissions that untrusted code is not given .
The runtime enforces that no untrusted code can call into any security sensitive and protected areas .
This would allow browser vendor to expose new APIs that get full access to the underlying operating system ( for example getting direct access to special hardware on the system like microphones and camera ) while enforcing that the user code accesses them only through safe gateways .
This is very important to allow developers to try out new trusted APIs : new UI models , rendering systems and APIs built entirely on the same core .
I am absolutely fascinated by the idea and I only regret not having come up with it .
We have been too focused on the Moonlight - as - a - plugin to take a step back and think in more general terms : how can we use the ECMA CIL engine for * all * applications without a browser plugin .
Joe like many of us is conflicted between the power of reach that the web has versus the polish and speed that native GUI toolkits deliver .
Althought Silverlight provides a nice UI system inside the plugin , Joe 's point is that we need a platform in which we can more quickly innovate new UI ideas , and probably completely different new ideas quickly .
And with the ECMA sandbox model we can start testing new ideas without waiting for browser vendors to add the features themselves and we can make the integration between these plugins and the browser stronger than they have ever been .
The plugin model does not provide the necessary tools to drive more innovation in the web .
We need a new model , and I am ready to start prototyping Joe 's idea .
The only question is what browser to target first Firefox or Chrome .
Gestalt
Gestalt allows developers to use the CLI inside the browser and it shows what can be done with other languages in the browsers .
It requires Silverlight to run and the interaction between the code and the browser is limited in the level of integration that can be achieved via the browser - plugin interface .
This solves only the half the problem : multi-languages and does it in a limited way .

The rocket men are returning from their mission , seven of them in matching blue jumpsuits , mission patches on their sleeves .
Riding on a massive flatbed truck , they bounce down the road cut through an open field , their rocket still hot from its launch .
One has a badge of duct tape over a gash on his cheek , but it 's big grins and waves all around as their families stream out to meet them in the road .
A kid in a spacesuit runs out for a hug , rows of fans hang back to snap photos and the boys from NASA stroll up to offer hearty handshakes .
With this kind of welcome , they might as well have returned from landing on the moon .
They have n't , of course — have n't even gone into space .
On this rainy mid-September day in 2009 , the men of Armadillo Aerospace , a private spaceflight company , have just completed the highest level of the X Prize Foundation 's Lunar Lander Challenge , putting them in line for a million - dollar prize from NASA .
So what if the moon rocks are fake ?
The thrill is real and so is the rocket they 've built , a 10 - foot monster named Scorpius that runs on liquid oxygen and ethanol in two stacked round tanks , balanced on four legs and topped by a box of electronics .
Hours earlier , Scorpius had taken off from a launch pad in a field , landed on a simulated moonscape , refueled and flown back .
Now , with the rocket raised to stand on the truck bed behind them , the jumpsuited heroes pose in front of it , allowing their fans — and their egos — a little post - flight indulgence .
The lunar challenge had kept the best of the country 's spaceflight startups occupied for years , and now with this successful launch 40 miles east of Dallas , Armadillo has become the first to complete its second and final level , cementing its place at the pinnacle of the NewSpace movement , a cluster of private companies making spaceflight more efficient , more affordable and more accessible than it 's ever been .
Nobody else had even made it to level one .
The team 's president , John Carmack , strolls out in a more typical Armadillo uniform : white team T - shirt , khaki cargo shorts and one hand around a Diet Coke , looking and sounding every bit the video game guru he is , the visionary behind games such as Doom and Quake .
He recounts last - second adjustments he'd made to get Scorpius flying again after its touchdown on the moon , racing to correct his launch code before the rocket 's liquid oxygen evaporated .
" It 's boiling off something like three pounds a minute .
If we lost 30 pounds on there , we'd be really marginal , " Carmack says .
" That was rather stressful . "
Also in the crowd is Peter Diamandis , the New Space movement 's biggest booster , who jumpstarted a generation of small aerospace companies 15 years ago by dreaming up and helping fund the original X Prize .
Earlier he told reporters he was simply an Armadillo fan , and there are plenty of those filling out the crowd too — rocket buffs , gamers out to meet the legendary Carmack , even a guy who had n't cared about rockets until the day he heard an explosion near his office and could n't believe it when he learned it was a rocket going off in North Dallas .
The duct - taped Russ Blink , an Armadillo co-founder , shouts over the crowd to Diamandis , asking in mock seriousness , " You got that big check for us ? "
Diamandis grins and shouts back , " Soon . "
It sure looked that way at the time , but no .
Three weeks later , the X Prize judges made the controversial choice to give Masten Space Systems an extra day to fly to the simulated moon and back , because its Xombie rocket had been damaged by fire on the first day and needed more time for repairs .
Not only did they complete the flight , but their landings were 68 centimeters more accurate than Armadillo's .
Carmack 's group took home the $ 500,000 second prize .
Although Carmack remains bitter about Masten 's deadline extension , Armadillo co-founder Phil Eaton takes a more circumspect approach .
" We have a goal to build an industry , and obviously that requires more than one company , " he says .
For those in " the industry , " alternately called " NewSpace " or " Alt Space " or , to be more precise , " alt.space , " their timing could n't be better .
In February , President Obama announced that he'd cut from this year 's NASA budget the Constellation program , the space shuttle 's replacement , putting an end to its slow progress and ballooning costs .
Last month at the Kennedy Space Center , Obama spoke about the space program 's new direction : Send Americans to Mars by the mid-2030s , land on an asteroid and turn to private industry to " make getting to space easier and more affordable . "
Scrapping the program that would have taken the U.S. back to the moon is not without its critics , including former astronaut Neil Armstrong , who worries that we are simply handing Russia and China the keys to space .
After Obama 's April speech about NASA , Alabama Senator Richard Shelby criticized the plan as " a welfare program for the commercial space industry ... where the taxpayer subsidizes billionaires to build rockets that NASA hopes will one day allow millionaires , and our own astronauts , to travel in space . "
Obama 's NASA plans are spelled out in the agency 's budget , which faces plenty more opposition in Congress .
Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is gathering support for a compromise that would keep the shuttle flying two missions a year , to ensure the U.S. has a secure , proven way to keep the International Space Station stocked and running .
Far from giving up the space race , Eaton says the country 's space startup community represents America 's best chance at reclaiming a lead it ceded long ago .
" We all thought that it had to be done at a national level , and when we realized that it did n't , now you have companies like Armadillo Aerospace , Masten Space Systems , XCOR or Virgin Galactic , and they 're all saying , ' We can do this . ' "
Already in 2004 , Diamandis awarded Virgin Galactic $ 10 million for making the first privately funded manned set of flights into space .
Since that time , other X Prize suitors like Armadillo and Masten have matured into players for the millions NASA wo n't be spending on the shuttle after this year .
Aerospace giants such as Boeing and Lockheed are looking forward to NASA 's money as much as anyone , but like IBM or Microsoft in the golden age of computer startups , they are the established , bureaucratic dinosaurs , with noses so deep in government business it hardly matters where one ends and the other begins .
As NASA grows into a sponsor of new technology , it 's looking to entrepreneurs , down where there 's still room to make the decisions that look flat - out crazy until you realize they make perfect sense .
In 2009 , Carmack says his company completed 20 launches with its rockets flying loose , and too many flights to count with a rocket tethered to a crane .
Armadillo has won new contracts from NASA and its engines have powered rocket - racing planes through 50 flights last year .
Last month they inked a deal with Space Adventures — the same space tourism agency that brokered Dennis Tito's $ 20 million seat on the Russian Soyuz in 2001 — to book rides aboard future Armadillo flights to space for the low price of $ 102,000 .
That 's half of what Virgin Galactic plans to charge .
Despite his competitive and creative zeal , Carmack is a pragmatist at heart , and Armadillo 's core strategy reflects it .
" Let 's not take things that are so at the limit of what we can afford that we 're too scared to fail .
Because then you 'll never try , " he says .
In other words : fly a lot , learn from your crashes .
For the rocket boys who grew up with Mercury , Gemini and Apollo , space has n't been this exciting since 1969 .
Phil Eaton was four years old when Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon — that 's when he decided he wanted to be an astronaut too .
He built model rockets as a kid , but would give up his dream to become an electrical engineer .
Only in the mid-'90s did he return to rocketry , but more as a hobby he could share with his own children .
His rekindled interest led him to the Dallas Area Rocket Society , surrounded by plenty of other " born - again rocketeers . "
" I still had the passion for the model rockets , and started getting bigger ones , " Eaton recalls .
" Pretty soon you could n't buy a big enough rocket motor off the shelf that had the performance you wanted , and you had to make your own . "
Through a mutual friend , Eaton met Russ Blink , a former Texas Instruments engineer who built rocket engines in his spare time .
In the late '90s , they worked together on big projects , six - and seven - footers they 'd light up at big rocket meets .
Eaton and Blink combined their talents flying a 60 - pound miniature of the X - 30 National Aero - Space Plane , a Reagan - era craft that was never produced , but was designed to fly at 25 times the speed of sound .
They flew a rocket with seven motors , which they named " Atomic Balls . "
" We decided that we needed to get more serious about building some liquid rocket engines together , " Eaton recalls , but that was tough because they worked on opposite sides of Dallas — Eaton in Duncanville and Blink near Richardson .
Eaton took a job at the company Blink had co-founded in the early '90s , Long Range Systems , which makes the light - up , vibrating pagers that let you know your table 's ready at restaurants .
After work , they built rockets on the back loading dock .
They spent $ 50 to $ 100 a month on supplies and distilled highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide rocket fuel overnight in Blink 's garage .
For a young Neil Milburn growing up in Middlesbrough , England , it was Sputnik rather than Apollo 11 that caused him to fantasize about space travel .
In 1958 , he watched from the distance of his smoggy , industrial hometown as the U.S. began developing its own space program , playing catch - up with the Russians .
Kept out of the Royal Air Force because of his eyesight , he went to Leeds to study chemical engineering in the early ' 70s , and amassed experience doing engineering work with startup companies .
He took his career to the U.S. in 1982 , and by the late '90s was living in Plano , nearing retirement , when he found the rocket society , then found the loading dock behind Blink 's warehouse .
They built rockets together for a few months , Eaton recalls , before he got an e-mail from Carmack , introducing himself and asking if Eaton would be interested in meeting to discuss a possible collaboration .
Blink recalls thinking Carmack 's name sounded familiar at first , but he could n't place it .
" Then it just clicked the next day , " Blink remembers .
" It was like , ' Do you know who John Carmack is ?
Holy cow , he 's got money . ' "
Carmack was n't lured to spaceflight by any childhood dreams of taming the final frontier .
Growing up in suburban Kansas City , he read some science fiction in the course of what he recalls was his " typical geek childhood , " but instead he got hooked on computer programming .
At 14 , he was arrested for trying to steal an Apple II and spent a year in a juvenile home , during which time he invented a giant role - playing game called Wraith .
He dropped out of college to code full - time , eventually creating Wolfenstein 3D , the seminal first - person shooter game with a dungeon labyrinth filled with Nazis , attack dogs and ammo .
More intense shoot - 'em- ups like Doom and Quake turned his Mesquite - based company id Software into one of the most buzz - worthy players in the gaming world .
Carmack ran his company with a kind of ideological purity that gamers could relate to , becoming an outspoken supporter of open - source programs — letting users see and modify the code .
He turned up in person at an impromptu gathering of id Software fans at a motel in Garland in 1996 , holding court with fans one night in a scene that replays itself in the keynote speech he delivers at the annual happening now called QuakeCon .
Last year more than 7,000 gamers packed the Gaylord Texan Resort 's convention space for the three - day tournament , each traveling with a custom - built gaming computer tucked under one arm and , maybe , a suitcase in the other .
QuakeCon is for gaming , not sleep .
At first , Carmack 's video game fortune went to custom Ferraris , but in 2000 , after a series of stories about private spaceflight on the tech blog Slashdot caught his eye , Carmack began looking at custom vehicles more extreme than any of his cars .
Compared to the cutthroat gaming industry , he saw gross inefficiency in the aerospace business , he says , and approached the industry like it was something to fix .
Back in the '50s and '60s , space technology development was fast and costly , and after the space race was over , aerospace companies discovered a long - term market for big - ticket products such as missiles and other weaponry .
Chasing a budget space market just never became worthwhile , Carmack says .
" For me it really was just the sense of untapped opportunity . "
He met engineers competing in the Cheap Access to Space competition — a race to take an unmanned craft to suborbital space — and eventually bankrolled a few of them .
Carmack practiced with some model rockets , and after the competition ended without a winner , he decided he wanted to join up with people who had hands - on rocket experience .
" I thought it would be a better strategy to take people who are actually out there and doing things on some level , " he says , " even if they 're just essentially large bottle rockets . "
He called the president of the Dallas Area Rocket Society and asked if there were any gung - ho rocketeers in the club working with big , liquid - fueled rockets , and the president mentioned Eaton , Blink and Milburn .
At their meeting in 2000 , Carmack told the three men he wanted to be involved in the team , not just write the checks .
They agreed , and decided their rockets should be computer - guided , and Carmack would write the code for them .
Their ultimate goal : a reusable vehicle that would carry humans to orbit .
Of course , they all still had their day jobs .
" We made the commitment to meet twice a week , " Eaton says .
" We were consistent .
We always showed up on Tuesday , always showed up on Saturday . "
Carmack 's weekly recaps of their progress are still archived on Armadillo 's website ; they documented all their tests , enlisting Matthew Ross , who does video work for id Software , to shoot footage of the launches .
Throughout the company 's wins and crashes over the years , the posts are matter - of - fact , even when they touch on personal matters :
Detailing the team 's work on a " two - module dual - gimballed configuration "
Carmack followed with this news : " For my birthday this year , my wife got me a crane truck . "
James Bauer , a welder living in Oak Cliff , was a longtime id Software fan who had hoped to join the company and help develop three - dimensional scenes for the games .
He realized , though , that he was better suited to working with his hands , and after following Armadillo 's progress online for a year , he e-mailed Carmack in mid-2004 to see if his rocket team could use a welder .
Carmack wrote back the next day , inviting him for a tryout .
Bauer became Armadillo 's first full - time employee , making the precise welds that hold Armadillo 's fuel tanks together .
" For a month or so it was really uncomfortable for me , " he recalls , " Because these guys were working on rockets , and I thought of myself as just a regular Joe . "
Bauer handles the welding , but like Ross , who shoots video , or Joseph LaGrave , who drives the truck , it 's a small team and building rockets quickly becomes everyone 's job .
Tommy Bishop , a rocket club friend who'd joined Blink 's company , eventually joined them on the back dock .
" We all showed up and we just worked , " Bishop remembers .
" There were no real specific assignments .
Now , it 's different . "
" The first vehicles were really tiny things .
It was like , ' What 's the minimum thing we can put together that a computer can control ? ' "
Blink recalls .
From there , though , they progressed quickly , through traditional - looking rockets like the orange - tipped Flying Crayon to a rocket - powered table carried by four engines .
Starting from scratch , they developed a broad knowledge base as they tested out new engines and propellants , test - launching their designs in open fields .
The space next door to Blink 's company became vacant , and they turned it into Armadillo headquarters .
" When the X Prize came about , things changed a little bit , " Blink says .
The prize — for making the first two privately funded manned flights to space within a two - week period — had been around since 1996 , but interest around the country picked up as the 2004 deadline approached , and Armadillo chased it .
Besides , if Armadillo wanted to put a man in space , they'd have to scale up their rockets someday anyway .
Blink , the smallest of the team members , fit best inside the aluminum tube for the " payload , " and became the guinea pig , strapping himself against the bulkhead and sitting on a pile of foam for drop - tests to gauge G - forces in a landing on a crushable nose cone .
Eaton says they spent a year testing and adjusting a peroxide - powered chair they 'd designed before they made three successful flights in a row and decided it was safe for Blink to ride .
" We had an ambulance on site , just in case , " the post - flight journal reads .
Video of the September 2002 flight shows
Blink in a yellow hooded hazmat suit in the parking lot behind a warehouse , strapping into the chair between two big tanks like Marty McFly into a DeLorean .
The rockets fire and Blink , hands neatly in his lap , lifts a few feet off the ground .
The chair flies forward , then back a few feet before landing hard after six seconds in the air .
Blink became the first and only team member to fly an Armadillo rocket — even if it was just five feet off the ground .
With extensive online video documenting their flights and failures , and growing interest in all 26 of the X Prize competitors , Armadillo quickly developed a global fan following , fed by the fact that team members , usually Carmack or Milburn , regularly answered questions about their progress in Armadillo 's online forum .
Carmack 's star power in the gaming world may have helped their popularity too , as suggested by a June 2004 question from one " faithful disciple " : " Are you the second coming JC ?
Come to take those who believe up into the sky ?
In the beginning , you brought us Doom , now conversely Rapture . "
Along with sales pitches from people hawking antigravity or perpetual motion devices , Milburn told an interviewer on the " Space Show " podcast in 2008 that at least 50 fans write in each week hoping to volunteer .
Ahead of the X Prize deadline , the team 's mystique only grew , as news reports that handicapped the competition focused on Armadillo 's hobbyist pedigree .
" There 's a mystique and mythology about it , but it 's completely out of proportion with its level of difficulty , " Carmack said in an October 2003 interview with the Dallas Business Journal .
" A computer is radically more advanced than a rocket ship . "
Ultimately , the X Prize challenge proved too complex to tackle before the 2004 deadline , for Armadillo and all but one of its competitors .
The team that won the X Prize was , in many ways , the ultimate insider , led by the mutton - chopped engineer and aviation evangelist Burt Rutan and his Mojave , California - based company , Scaled Composites .
Their manned plane SpaceShipOne flew to an altitude of more than 62 miles , beating the prize 's deadline by less than two weeks .
It was a high point in private spaceflight that other companies will be hard pressed to beat .
The deaths of three Scaled Composites employees in 2007 , during early fuel tests for SpaceShipTwo , which was being developed for Virgin Galactic , marked a corresponding low point for the company and a reminder of the dangers in any space startup business .
Stories around the X Prize focused on the garage - startup side of the industry , but that 's an image Armadillo shies away from , preferring to focus on its decade of expertise and safety precautions .
These safety measures got a test in October 2007 when Armadillo flew its " quad " rocket Texel , with four tanks arranged around a single engine , in an attempt to win the new Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge .
After landing hard on the runway , the engine failed to shut down and Texel bounced back up in the air until Carmack , watching with team members at a distance , triggered the hard cut - off .
Texel fell back down onto the pad and unleashed an enormous fireball .
The neighbors were getting restless after years of rocket tests at the North Dallas warehouse .
In 2008 , with plans for even bigger rockets and their lease about to expire , Armadillo decided it was time to move .
They tried a few other locations , launching for a while in a field outside Rockwall , where their first launch spooked a rancher 's horses , sending them bounding over his fence .
Eaton began looking even farther out , driving east of Dallas in search of airports marked on his GPS .
In Caddo Mills , he found a quiet runway and a hangar left behind by a sailplane business .
Eaton went before the Caddo Mills City Council to discuss moving in , and discovered he'd been scheduled right after a Texas Department of Transportation group told the council it should find some new uses for the airport .
The timing was perfect .
Armadillo moved into the hangar that May .
It 's a cool spring morning in Caddo Mills , with rows of kids and parents lining a two - block stretch of downtown .
The Armadillo team is back on the flatbed , jumpsuited and waving , throwing candy along the parade route during the town 's annual Fox Fest celebration .
Armadillo's old X Prize banner is hanging from the side , with a green sign taped to the corner that says " Go Foxes , " for the town 's high school mascot .
LaGrave is driving the big crane truck , with Ross in back waving and taking pictures and Milburn , the grandfather and high school physics teacher , smiling broadly as the truck makes a wide right turn on Main Street .
Surrounded by " moon rocks " from last fall 's Lunar Lander Challenge , holding up a big American flag , Blink sits at the back of the trailer , in an old Russian cosmonaut suit one of the guys bought on eBay .
Pixel , their four - tanked rocket , sits on the trailer behind Blink , resting on the NASA landing gear that Armadillo 's been contracted to test .
A boy in the crowd casually points up and tells his mom , " It 's cool how they build that . "
After the parade the Armadillo team collects a tall green trophy from the judges — second place — and heads back to the hangar .
" I do n't know , maybe we needed more green on there , " LaGrave jokes .
The new home is 45 minutes from Dallas , and shortly after the company set up shop at the airport , Eaton found a house on the outskirts of Caddo Mills and moved his wife , daughters and baby son to be near the rockets .
Now the white board covered in rocket schematics also has good - luck notes from Eaton 's kids .
It 's been good to be a part of the small town , Eaton says , good that the fire department knew where to find him , for instance , the night there was a methane leak back at the hangar .
In fall 2008 , Armadillo claimed the Level One X Prize Lunar Lander Challenge in New Mexico , flying its rocket for two 90 - second flights and winning $ 350,000 .
They became the first team to tackle the Level Two challenge that year too — lighting up Pixel on the pad the very next day .
An uneven mixture of liquid oxygen and fuel overheated the engine , burning through the engine nozzle and flipping Pixel upside down as it launched .
They made their plans for next year 's competition — the one Masten would come from behind to win , thanks to a last - minute rule change — but around this time , Eaton says , they also decided to begin focusing on sustained business over one - off wins like the X Prize .
" You ca n't support a long - term business plan on prizes , " Eaton says .
Earlier in 2008 , they 'd signed on to supply rocket engines for Diamandis ' Rocket Racing League , a scheme Wired once described as a " NASCAR in the clouds , " but the league struggled to gather the financial backing to get started .
It was steadier than prize money , and , as Carmack later wrote on Armadillo 's blog , he 'd warmed to the idea of airplanes powered by Armadillo 's rocket engines , running at 250 miles per hour .
After cashing NASA 's prize check , Armadillo took on paid work for NASA too , most recently testing out methane engines and landing gear for a potential lunar lander .
Eaton says he found it incredible that NASA 's representatives took one at look at Pixel , the rocket that flipped over during the lunar challenge , saw it lying on the ground in the hangar next to their rocket designs three generations further along , and decided that 's what they wanted to outfit a moon landing .
As far as he was concerned , Armadillo 's tests had already proven it was simpler and more stable to have a separate engine for each module ( Pixel has two modules and one engine ) .
Carmack says he poured nearly $ 4 million into Armadillo in its first eight years , and only in the last two has the rocket company turned a profit .
" I do have the fear that if we get stuck being a small - time contractor , we do a couple million dollars a year and just kind of get by on that .
There are little aerospace companies all over the place like that , and I desperately do n't want to be that , " Carmack says .
After selling id Software last year , he 's got more free cash , and says he 'll be using it to pump up Armadillo 's operations .
" We 're going to hire some more people on staff and we 're going to make things go faster , because now really is the time . "
NewSpace has been fairly quiet in the mainstream since the hype around the first X Prize in 2004 , but things are picking up .
Visit Masten 's website today and for just $ 250 , you can send a kilogram of whatever you like — science projects , grandpa 's ashes , you name it — aboard one of its rockets to space .
Bigelow Aerospace , makers of inflatable space hotels , has already launched a pair of prototypes in orbit .
The biggest player of all is a man who Carmack calls " the white knight " of NewSpace , Elon Musk .
In 2002 , Musk , a South African software wiz , founded Space Exploration Technologies , or SpaceX , with $ 100 million from the sale of his company , PayPal .
In 2008 , on its fourth attempt , SpaceX 's Falcon 1 became the first privately funded rocket to reach orbit running on liquid fuel .
After North Korea 's failed rocket launch in 2009 , Carmack sent an e-mail to Musk .
It read , " Elon > Kim Jong - Il . "
" The notion that a private American citizen is able to accomplish what a major national power is unable to , it 's a wonderful thing , " Carmack says .
Like others involved in New - Space , Armadillo has plans to launch commercial flights to the edge of the atmosphere this year .
And it intends to enter the adventure tourism business , offering space diving ( skydiving , only much higher ) , and building ships that carry paying , floating customers to space .
While Virgin has been marketing itself as the luxury carrier for suborbital flight , Armadillo 's prices will be low enough to meet a much larger market .
" Our stuff is definitely going to be a lot more Buck Rogers than Virgin Galactic , " Blink says .
" They spent a lot of time with a European designer to make it look really slick .
Ours is really , ' OK strap yourself onto the foam and we 're gonna light the candle and here you go . ' "
Adds Carmack , " You see over and over in business and in engineering , when costs come down for any given capability , it winds up being exploited in ways that people never even considered . "
That 's about as dreamy as he gets about the prospects for space — no poetry , no science fiction , just his faith in new markets to spark innovation .
" That 's a trap that people fall into , they put their eyes on the stars instead of where their next foot is landing , " he says .
" I want to stay pragmatically focused .
It 's going to happen that just one of these days we look around and we 're there . "

Time Warner Cable has no intention of complying with thousands of requests asking it to identify copyright infringers .
Remember the US Copyright Group ?
They 're the DC legal outfit that is turning P2P copyright infringement into cash , partnering with independent movie studios ( the big players are not involved ) to sue individual file - swappers in federal court — and ISPs are not pleased with the plan .
Too busy busting terrorists
Yesterday , Time Warner Cable told a federal court overseeing a massive 2,094 - person lawsuit targeting the poor folks who downloaded ( and , what 's worse , apparently watched )
Uwe Boll 's Far Cry that the US Copyright Group 's subpoenas were out of control .
" Copyright cases involving third - party discovery of Internet service providers have typically related to a plaintiff 's efforts to identify anonymous defendants whose numbers rank in the single or low double digits , " wrote the cable company .
" By contrast , plaintiff in this case alone seeks identifying information about 2,049 anonymous defendants , and seeks identifying information about 809 Internet Protocol addresses from TWC . "
Time Warner Cable does not have enough employees to respond to these requests .
In a typical month , the company receives an average of 567 IP lookup requests , nearly all of them coming from law enforcement .
These lookup requests involve everything from suicide threats to child abduction to terrorist activity , and the company says that such cases take " immediate priority . "
Once law enforcement is served , the four full - time workers ( and one temp ) who make up the ISP 's Subpoena Compliance team can turn to other matters , such as subpoenas in civil cases .
The company says that it has the capacity to handle 28 subpoenas from the US Copyright Group per month .
Instead , TWC was hit with a request for 809 names within 30 days .
In addition , the company has received two other subpoenas , both from the same law firm , asking for another 398 and 224 IP address lookups .
Each lookup costs TWC $ 45 .
" If the Court compels TWC to answer all of these lookup requests given its current staffing , it would take TWC nearly three months of full - time work by TWC's Subpoena Compliance group , and TWC would not be able to respond to any other request , emergency or otherwise , from law enforcement during this period , " said the filing .
" TWC has a six - month retention period for its IP lookup logs , and by the time TWC could turn to law enforcement requests , many of these requests could not be answered . "
A page of suspected IP addresses from the Far Cry case
Quash , baby , quash !
The ISP has now asked the court to quash the subpoena for three reasons .
First , because US Copyright Group lawyer Tom Dunlap " has now simply reneged " on an agreement that he worked out with TWC to manage the flow of subpoenas .
Second , the entire approach to these lawsuits may be invalid .
Filing lawsuits can be expensive ;
Most federal courts charge a $ 350 filing fee per case , along with a new set of paperwork .
Each case also creates another docket to keep track of , making thousands of cases an administrative nightmare .
Instead of going this route , plaintiffs have gone the RIAA route , simply filing mass lawsuits against groups of " John Does , " in some cases by the thousands .
But , says TWC , channeling its inner Ray Beckerman , " It is not evident from the complaint in this case that there is anything common to the 2,094 defendants that would justify joining them in a single litigation ...
Courts facing these identical circumstances have repeatedly held that a plaintiff may not join in a single action multiple defendants who have allegedly downloaded or facilitated the download of copyrighted material at different times and locations .
" Thus , if the plaintiff wants to sue these 2,094 defendants , it owes this court 2,094 separate filing fees , and it must file individual actions .
Plaintiff then would be unable to combine together a single , massive discovery request with which to burden non-party ISPs such as TWC . "
Third , plaintiff lawyers keep expanding the scope of their subpoenas .
The first complaint filed alleged 426 infringing IP addresses belonging to TWC subscribers .
But when the company finally received a subpoena , it found requests for 809 IP addresses .
Taken together , said TWC , these " discovery abuses " mean that the judge should quash the subpoena .
Alternately , the judge should limit the plaintiff to 28 TWC subpoenas each month .
According to the court docket , Comcast and Cablevision are trying to work out their own deal with the lawyers to keep the work to a minimum , though they could also ask the judge to quash the subpoenas if no agreement can be reached .
The power of self - interest
Time Warner Cable has not always had the reputation of a white knight when it comes to helping its subscribers — the company famously tried to squeeze more cash from broadband users by applying ridiculous data caps , an issue so sensitive to it eventually drew the wrath of senators and congressmen .
But in this case , with its own self - interest also on the line , TWC has made an argument that strikes not just at a single subpoena but also at the overarching legal strategy behind the US Copyright Group 's work .
Thanks to commenter Warty for discovering the musical stylings of Ayat , Lebanon's ( arguably ) first " Anti-Islamic Black Metal Band . "
Ayat ( Miracle ) has been opening Levantie eardrums for nine years , and in 2008 the duo signed with Moribund records to release their album Six Years of Dormant Hatred .
With songs like " Ilahiya Khinzir !
( All Hail Allah the Swine ) , " the band does not play down its opposition to the religion of peace .
In a merrily dyspeptic interview with MetalStorm.net , frontman Reverend Filthy Fuck takes issue with popular " First Anti-Islamic Black Metal " descriptor only because he wants other anti-Islamists to get some credit :
We received this reputation because we are against Islam as individuals .
Yet we are not the first and we are not only that .
In any case , this is the only thing people talk about when they mention Ayat and we 're sick of it .
So here it is again : AYAT IS AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT IN ALL ITS FORMS .
The band lives in and at least used to play in Beirut , so why has n't some pious Lester Bangs managed to cap a thumbs - down review by , you know , murdering them ?
The only negative response of any note has been the inevitable " Against the Lebanon Anti-Islamic black metal ' Ayat ' band " page on Facebook , which has a small number of followers ( many with seemingly Christian names ) and no content beyond the obvious : " Claimed to be the first ' Anti- Islamic Black Metal Band ' , they are not wanted in the Arab Islamic world . "
Filthy
Fuck says the band toils in such obscurity that its last live gig ( before its present stage of Beatlesque introspection ) attracted only about a hundred people :
As for the attempt to start up a political debate , Ayat has been here since 2001 and we always worked at an underground level , we have always been outcast and rejected , and we never complained and we never asked for help we would never get anyway .
We worked hard instead of making asses of ourselves in public .
And it 's not until we became " known " because of our work that our name and our beliefs started to become a problem .
Now people , especially Arab Metalheads , are stepping up and are voicing their opinions regarding our existence , discussing if we should be allowed .
Well , how grand .
Allowed where ?
In the tame , broken , bashed - with - boots , authority - obedient Muslim Metal Scene ?
We are giving Arab metalheads a bad name ?
NO .
We are the forefronts of Arab extreme Metal and that 's plain to see .
We 're giving them a hard time ?
Well fuck them , I 'm not the one who dictatored their asses to submission .
I am a member of that same society , and I chose to speak up and risked my life thereof , they need n't take the step with us , just refraining from stabbing our backs repeatedly would be enough .
Muslim Metalheads are personalizing all their fears and hatreds in us because they can escape authority by blaming us , making us in the process THE anti-islamic band par excellence .
We ruined the image they were trying to give to their local police .
I 'm sick of pampering those fuckers .
The Muslim world is in terrible shape , if that 's the best Muslims can do then I do n't see why my ranting is so out of place .
Ok , here goes :
Take our records as motivators .
When you get better we 'll stop playing music .
It 's a promise .
Does it make sense that a band located near the heart of the Islamic world would escape the decapitator 's veto just because it's an acquired taste ?
It 's not like Danish cartoons or long experimental novels are at the Top of the Pops in the House of Peace .
And Ayat is n't even all that obscure .
Metal reviewer Kris Yancey raves that they " seem like the kinda guys that would be willing to conjure up an evil spirit just to put a boot to its neck " and " do n't have any qualms dragging women into cold , dimly lit basements for hardcore sex while Wurdulak plays in the background . "
Two rules of thumb suggest themselves :
One is the old journalism phenomenon that a person will get angrier if you just make a funny comment about him or her in passing than if you devote 5,000 words to a heavily researched proof that the person is a complete son of a bitch .
The second is a corollary to the apparently true old saw that anti-Semitism tends to be strongest in areas where there are few or no Jews .
Is it possible that Ayat gets away with it because they 're located in reputedly cosmopolitan Beirut ?
Filthy
Fuck indicates that 's not the case in this Ginsbergian ( and to my eye completely accurate ) description of the Weekawken of the Middle East :
Six years went by and the hatred was being warmed and brewed at almost human temperature in the most violent brothel around , the clashing point between the East and the West : the violently epileptic city of Beirut .
Hell is right here .
Six infinite years , larded god - figured swines praised on every roof , a succession of annihilative relentless wars , conspiring whispers late at night , murderous toothless gangs of children , psychotic mass murderers madly in love , schizophrenic militias deprived of sleep , black - eyed hysterical prostitutes , fascist officers cheering with champagne and reeling belly dancers on crack , wooden cases of smuggled alcohol pulled to the tops of minarets with ropes , a suicide in every cheap hotel room , an endless stream of martyrs , aspiring prophets tied to hospital beds , Muslim heroin junkies stuttering on their prayer rugs , dried cum on the walls , and the veins of the marble bulges once the sun strikes too hard .
So yeah , this shit is not for everyone .
Hail Allah the swine :
More on the liberating effects of takfir music from Charles Paul Freund , the Alex Chilton of Reason .
She was young and wild , a bit of a rebel .
The 22 - year - old woman 's body art announced that message as subtly as a billboard on a highway .
No stranger to illegal drugs , she had inhaled or injected the worst of them , including and .
But recently she had turned a corner .
Last month she removed her new tongue piercing only two days after getting it , and she had n't injected any drugs for the last 5 months .
Ironic that after cleaning up her act she should now find herself stricken with a throbbing headache that was unfazed by aspirin .
Severe nausea , vomiting , and vertigo drove her to the hospital .
The results of an HIV test were negative .
A found mild ataxia ( un- coordination ) in her left leg , which she had already noticed .
This alerted her doctors to a potential problem in the right side of her brain in the region of motor co-ordination , called the cerebellum .
A CT scan and an MRI delivered the diagnoses with alarming clarity .
The woman was suffering from a festering brain abscess in her cerebellum .
Emergency brain surgery was scheduled to remove the diseased brain tissue and drain the infection .
Treatment with strong antibiotics was begun immediately .
Laboratory analysis revealed that the infected brain tissue was a harrowing cesspool of infectious bacteria that included Streptococcus , Peptostreptococcus , Actinomyces , and Eikenella .
If she had n't injected any drugs in 5 months , how did these flesh - eating bugs get into her brain ?
On the other side of the world from the New Haven , Connecticut hospital where the woman was treated , a 22 - year old Israeli man , who in outward appearance might have made a compatible match to the rebellious young woman , was suddenly stricken with a high fever and profound fatigue .
The young man had always been blessed with youthful vigor and unlike the woman , he never abused illegal drugs .
Without warning the man rapidly developed global aphasia ; that is , the inability to speak or write or understand written or spoken language .
His neurologists knew with certainty that his left cerebral cortex was impaired .
This part of the brain is where Broca 's and Wernicke 's areas are located , which control speech and language comprehension .
Soon the right side of his body became paralyzed .
A CT and MRI scan revealed 13 horrifying ring - shaped bleeding abscesses the size of ping - pong balls in the man 's brain .
Lab tests showed that he was negative for HIV and cystic fibrosis , but his blood count confirmed that his body was fighting a life - threatening infection .
There were too many abscesses to remove surgically .
A brain biopsy revealed the pus-filled brain tissue was swarming with the nasty bacteria Streptococcus intermedius .
This bacterium is part of the normal flora of the mouth and upper respiratory tract , but when the germ gets inside the body it forms life - threatening abscesses in the liver , brain or inner lining of the heart .
Streptococcus intermedius infections of the brain are usually the result of head or complications after brain surgery , but this man had been perfectly healthy until 22 days ago .
What had happened to this man two weeks earlier ?
A medical history revealed that nothing remarkable had occurred to the man recently , except that he had received a tongue piercing two weeks before .
A common thread tied the young man and woman 's fate together in the medical literature - a link through lingual baubles to brain infection .
The woman would survive , but after suffering three more weeks in the hospital , the young man would lose his life to the germs that entered through the piercing in his tongue .
They invaded without causing any local infection of the tongue or producing a fever , and they silently worked their way into his brain where they turned it to pus .
36 percent of college age males and 62 percent of college age females have body piercings ( not including earlobe piercings in women ) .
In women , 10 percent of these piercings are in the nose and 11 percent are through the tongue .
For college age men the rates are 1.2 and 4 percent for nose and tongue piercings .
70 percent of people with tongue piercings report complications , ranging from local infections , eroded gums , chipped teeth , and more serious systemic infections including hepatitis B and C .
When you think about it , this really should come as no surprise .
The mouth and nasal passages are a veritable incubator of nasty disease - causing bacteria .
We all suffer sore throats , respiratory and nasal infections as a result ; some of them quite serious .
The surprising thing is how resistant our vulnerable tongue is to infection - unless you poke a hole through it .
The tongue is shielded with a thick tough outer layer of skin and it is bathed continually with saliva containing antimicrobial proteins .
In contrast to earlobes , the tongue is richly supplied with blood , which provides an invading germ ready access to the blood stream , to spread infection throughout the body .
The veins that drain the tongue connect directly to the internal jugular vein , which is a direct route into the brain .
Earlobes are cleaned with surgical antiseptic before piercing them , but the tongue is not prepped before stabbing a hole through it .
Mouthwash usually precedes the needle , but that is more for the benefit of the person doing the piercing .
Disease attacking the brain is perhaps the most dreaded of all disorders for most people .
You can't avoid most of them , but some of them you can .

CNN has suffered a " precipitous decline in ratings " across the board , says the New York Times .
But the news is particularly bad for Larry King , the network 's longest running host , who suffered his worst quarter ever .
Ratings for Larry King Live dropped 43 percent in the first quarter , and 52 percent in March alone .
King 's rivals in the 9 pm slot all beat him during the past three months , with Fox 's Sean Hannity bringing in almost four times as many viewers .
After 25 years at the network , is it time to put the 76 - year - old out to pasture ?
The times demand more incisive interviews : King is " out of step with the times , " says Thomas Lifson at American Thinker .
He " never bothers to read an author 's book , and specializes in softball questions . "
But America's " aroused citizenry " demands " tough questions " with the federal government seemingly intent upon " downsizing America 's standing in the world . "
That 's why they 're switching to Fox .
" Liberal media death spiral intensifies "
His non-partisan approach still works : Viewers like King because of his traditional , no - nonsense approach , says Jon Klein , president of CNN , quoted at Daily Finance .
Competitors like Sean Hannity and Rachel Maddow have " moved to partisan extremes , " which gives them a short - term boost .
But the " big interviewers and the top newsmakers " still come to King 's studio first .
" We are proud of the work he does . "
" Will plunging ratings hasten his retirement ? "
King brings nothing to CNN , and he must go :
The simple fact is King is not attracting eyeballs , says Adrian Chen at Gawker .
" When will CNN realize this ? "
By refusing to do any research or ask penetrating questions , he exists simply as a " human wall " upon which " disgraced politicians and worthless celebrities " can project whatever they choose .
His time 's up .
" How long until CNN fires Larry King ?
GM says the affected cars are still safe to drive General Motors ( GM ) is recalling 1.3 million small cars in North America because of a power steering problem that has been linked to 14 crashes .
The firm said four models were affected - the Chevrolet Cobalt , Pontiac G5 , Pontiac Pursuit and Pontiac 4 .
It said the fault meant that at low speeds " greater steering effort may be required " , but that the cars could still be " safely controlled " .
GM blamed the fault on a supplier partially owned by Toyota .
GM vice - chairman Bob Lutz told the BBC at the Geneva Motor show : " This is a case where , yes , we would blame a partially Toyota - owned supplier . "
Recalling these vehicles is the right thing to do for our customers ' peace of mind
Jamie Hresko , GM vice president of quality Mr Lutz said the supplier had not met " all requirements for reliability and durability " .
" So we will have to see who takes financial responsibility , " he said .
" But this is a risk you sometimes take when you buy a complete system from a supplier . "
Complaints GM said it had told the US car safety regulator - the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) - about the recall on Monday when it finished an investigation that started last year .
ANALYSIS By Jorn Madslien , Business reporter , BBC News , Geneva Good news at the Geneva motor show is tempered by bad news out of the US .
GM hopes its investment of an additional 1.3bn euros in its European Opel / Vauxhall subsidiary will convince European governments to back its remaining funding requirements by guaranteeing loans .
But as GM recalls some 1.3 million models in the US , it seems reluctant to take responsibility for the faulty power steering , as the part in question was produced by a Toyota - owned subsidiary .
GM 's willingness to pass the buck could further damage Toyota 's image - or it could backfire as the affair turns into a mighty row that could involve the US and Japanese governments as well as their largest automotive groups .
New investment for Opel
The NHTSA itself had been investigating the problem since 27 January after receiving more than 1,100 complaints , including 14 crashes and one injury .
The recall covers the 2005 to 2010 model year Chevrolet Cobalt , and 2007 to 2010 Pontiac G5 sold in the US .
In addition , it includes the 2005 to 2006 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada , and the 2005 to 2006 Pontiac G4 sold in Mexico .
" After our in - depth investigation , we found that this is a condition that takes time to develop , " said GM vice president of quality , Jamie Hresko .
" It tends to occur in older models out of warranty .
Recalling these vehicles is the right thing to do for our customers ' peace of mind . "
Toyota recalls
The GM recall comes as Toyota is continuing to call back more than eight million cars around the world following accelerator and braking problems .
The Japanese carmaker also said on Tuesday that it is repairing another 1.6 million vehicles in the US and Japan over leaky oil hoses .
The Toyota recalls are still being investigated by US politicians , and three US Toyota bosses are due to appear later before the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation .
US Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has also been called to attend the hearing , as the committee continues to investigate the speed of the recalls and the response of the authorities .
Toyota president Akio Toyoda appeared before a separate congressional committee last week - the House Oversight Committee - to apologise and promise that lessons would be learned .

The Melody Of Change : Akira Yamaoka At Grasshopper
By Brandon Sheffield
Akira Yamaoka 's name has been synonymous with Konami's Silent Hill horror game series for years .
Serving as the games ' producer and composer , his creative stamp was all over the franchise -- unusually , even the Hollywood film adaptation made sure to use his compositions to retain the feel of the games which spawned it .
In recent years , development of the Silent Hill games shifted from Tokyo to Western studios , though Yamaoka was still reportedly involved in these projects .
However , in the wake of this change Yamaoka recently left Konami and moved to iconoclastic No More Heroes developer Grasshopper Manufacture .
Though Yamaoka will begin as a composer on the Shinji Mikami and Goichi Suda horror action project currently in development for EA Partners , he hopes to expand his role into production at the studio .
Gamasutra recently had a chance to speak to Yamaoka about his thoughts on the shift and his plans for the future .
What made you decide to go to Grasshopper Manufacture ?
Akira Yamaoka : Well , Grasshopper is one of those Japanese companies that make very original games , even by global standards -- games with a lot of originality .
Their games always have a very unique world view , and with the sort of toolset I had in the fields of music and audio , I thought I 'd be able to contribute to what they 're doing in a really constructive way .
That was what inspired me .
Recently , a lot of notable Japanese sound designers have gone freelance , like Michiru Yamane and Masashi Hamazu .
Yasunori Mitsuda and Norihiko Hibino are doing their own things .
What do you think about this situation ?
AY : Well , myself , I want to be more than just a musician -- not that freelancers can't be more than musicians , but they 're a step removed from the development process .
A client tells them to write a song for a space level , they do it , and that 's it .
I want to be more closely involved with game development , to use my audio skills as a tool to improve the whole project .
That 's what I 'm after .
I guess there really are n't many studios in Japan anymore with that sort of global mindset , or that really can sell games overseas .
AY : Right , and that 's something that makes me jibe well with Grasshopper , I think .
They have the sort of projects going on that I want to be involved with , and that was a big aspect behind the decision .
How do you think your personal style will fit into the Grasshopper style ?
There 's a lot of innovative sound work there -- will you be managing that as well , or will you only be composing ?
AY : I think I could do it either way .
Of course , when you 're talking about " style , " it 's not like I 'm going to demand this particular type of music or this kind of output in our games ' audio .
We think in terms of what the game requires ; it 's not a matter of me needlessly pushing my perspective into projects .
Grasshopper 's sound effects team is already quite good ; will you be making any changes there ?
Are you leading that team as well ?
AY : Well , there 's a lot in the field of audio that I want to accomplish .
There 's no way to be " perfect " in it , after all , but I do want to nurture my own originality , my own approach to solving problems .
I 'm curious to know what you think of [ No More Heroes composer ]
Masafumi Takada 's work , and are you at all concerned that people will compare you to him ?
AY : I have n't heard much of his stuff , really -- to be honest , I have n't had a chance to meet him yet , so I can't say a lot about him .
As for whether we 'll be compared , it 's not that I 'd mind it , but I doubt it would happen that much , would it ?
( laughs )
Well , you should definitely listen to his soundtracks , because they 're quite good .
Will you also wind up taking on a production or design role at Grasshopper as you had done at Konami in the past ?
AY : Well , not immediately , but if the opportunity comes along later , I think it'd be nice if I had a chance to seize upon it .
At some point , if you have a chance to be involved in production , I think that 'd be great .
AY : Certainly .
Maybe I should !
( laughs )
Now that you 've left the company , I 'm curious :
What do you think of the new Silent Hill ?
AY : The Wii one ?
Have n't played it !
( laughs ) I have n't touched it .
How is it ?
I did n't play it either , but I have heard it 's good .
AY : Oh , really ?
Well , great to hear .
It seems like game creators these days do n't play games all that much .
AY : Yeah .
It 's certainly the same case in Japan as well .
I think that 's a shame .
If you do n't play games , then you would n't be able to understand them , perhaps .
AY : You would n't , yeah .
You lose your creative edge that way .
So what style are you going for in your current composition work , perhaps compared to before ?
AY : Hmm ...
Compared to before , I do n't think I 've changed that much .
Some people say that my work is a fair bit more complex , featuring a lot more color than it used to , and I think I have noticed that myself as well .
In the past you did a lot of work involving calmer music in tense situations .
Is that something you 'll continue here , or will you go in a more abrasive musical direction ?
AY : I do like the more abrasive styles as well , but in tense situatons , I tend to prefer music that does n't play completely into what you 're seeing .
With situations like that , while I naturally do n't plan to stick slavishly to any one style , that type is what I personally like the best .
So I have that to go with while I 'm also simultaneously pursuing new styles in my work .
At Grasshopper they often do very interesting things with sound design , where there 'll be a big , loud , or unexpected sound at certain places in the game .
Have you studied this at all in Grasshopper 's games , and do you think it 'll continue ; do you have something to add to it ?
AY : Sound effects , right ?
Well , I 'd like to do that sort of thing , yes .
Like you put it , doing something unexpected or unanticipated .
There 's something very interesting about that from the gamer 's perspective , after all .
That 's the way I like to think as I approach a sound package , so that 's what I want to keep going with .
It seems like it could be a place for you to experiment more with the kind of thing you were talking about at GDC -- placing the footsteps ahead of what 's actually there onscreen .
It seems like Grasshopper is somewhere where you could push that even further .
AY : Certainly , I would like to pursue that sort of thing .
And some of the things I did n't discuss , I 'll be doing -- or I 'd like to be doing -- within the next year .
Can you think of ways to push that further ?
Is there anything you 're thinking about now ?
AY : Oh , I can't have them get out yet !
( laughs )
Once we show off something it 's involved in , I 'll show it off ; I 'll say " this is it " .
It 's easier explaining it that way , besides .
Based on that , I assume you can't talk about what project you 're working on , right ?
AY : Ahh , you overseas interviewers are always after secrets !
( laughs )
But , really , my current situation 's about what you 'd think it is -- the title that people have been talking about on the Internet is the one I 'm working on .
I also noticed that you do n't often use symphonies , or a lot of orchestration .
Why is that ?
Do you think that 'll change in the future ?
Or are you comfortable dealing with guitar and electronic instruments ?
AY : I do think that a change of pace in that respect could be a good thing .
I think that , but ... going back to the first question for a moment , whether you 're using a symphonic or heterophonic approach in Asian or Western music , first you have a rhythm -- beating out time in one way or another .
To that you add harmonies , the chords that are played at set times to this rhythm .
Melody is the thing that puts these chords together .
In heterophony , you think of each aspect as being on its own axis -- you come up with melodies , then you come up with the rhythm and harmonies to make them work .
Western music often begins with the composer thinking about harmonies first , but within music , there are only a limited number of harmonies -- about a hundred or so -- that are suitable to use .
It 's a matter of combining those together .
I thought about this for a bit once , and I 'm not saying that one is better than the other , but for example , the English alphabet has 26 letters , while there 's a practically infinite number of kanji characters -- not infinite , but quite a lot .
So in English , you take this small set of characters and form words like " god " and so on with them -- but playing with these same letters can give you very different results , like taking " god " and turning it into " dog " .
The Eastern line of thought simply has a character , kami , for god , and then creates a completely different and unrelated character to signify dog .
In much the same way , Western music often takes this given set of chords and comes up with new and novel ways to combine them together , while Japanese heterophony is more concentrated around melody .
So thinking symphonically is actually pretty difficult for me -- it 's not like I could n't do it if I studied a bit , but it 's tough .
I am interested in symphonic composition , though , definitely .
Your compositions are very melodic .
If there 's harmony , it 's in tune .
Have you thought about experimenting with dissonant sound ?
Like when , instead of harmony that flows together , the melody clashes .
AY : That 's actually one of the things I 'm working with right now -- music that does n't work by the book , so to speak .
Since most of the world 's music does work by the book , when something does n't , that has the effect of making it stand out .
It 's something that goes off the beaten path , and that 's why I like it .
In Western game soundtracks nowadays , composers are very afraid of using loops -- they 'll try to hide loop points so you do n't actually hear an original melody .
It 's all very flowing and in the background .
I feel that in Japan , people will still do a good job of introducing a real melody , so you can tell where a song 's beginning , middle and end are located .
I 'm wondering what you feel about that .
Western composers seem to be afraid of showing music structure and loop points , and in Japan it 's not so .
AY : You 're absolutely right there !
And it 's not just with music -- you could say that symbolizes the entire approach Japanese studios take with game development .
Their games have a distinct beginning and a distinct end -- they draw a straight line from start to finish .
They begin by coming up with field maps and so on , then figure out how to make a game out of it .
Western games , on the other hand , are getting more and more open in what they let you do .
The same applies to music , too .
Japanese composers string a bunch of melodies together , and that leads itself to a natural end at some point or another .
If you think in terms of harmonies , though , suddenly it does n't really matter where you are in the song at any given point .
That 's why you can't spot the loop point right off .
Vincent Diamante , who composed the music for Flower , feels that loop points are n't something to be afraid of and that melody should be embraced and used more ; that there are ways you can use melody in a large field map .
You can bring back in certain melodic themes that players can recognize , and it's a good thing to let players identify with melodies instead of just creating atmosphere .
What do you think about that ?
AY : Well , either way is fine , really , in the end .
I divided these two types of music into melody and heterophony , but it 's not a matter of fearing one method over another .
This is something I 'd like to work on myself , but since games are interactive entertainment , there 's no set standard for when the player will begin and where it 'll end , like there is with movies .
As a result , you , the composer , have no idea when a player will decide to move from one section of the game to another , something that 'd require a change in music .
That does n't mean loop points should be avoided , but at the same time , you have to keep that fact in mind when you 're composing .
One way of dealing with that is to just fade out the music , but what I 'd like to do is work on ways to always have the music come to a believable end whenever the game situation calls for it .
That would be a much more interactive and game - like approach than simply fading out the volume .
It also may be possible to do it without fading to black if you fade it into another piece .
You can tell that one piece is winding down as another ramps up , so there 's no real gap in the music .
AY : True , but if the two pieces have a different rhythm , then it 's going to sound off .
I 'd like to have the music come to a full and decent ending before the next piece begins , just like it would in other forms of media .
One thing I 've been thinking about is that , in the Famicom era , some music was actually written with the Japanese scale -- you can play it on a shamisen -- but nowadays that 's not done so much .
Do you think there 's any kind of opportunity to bring back that ?
AY : Oh , I know what you mean !
Of course , that may just be an age issue -- a lot of composers back then are pretty old now .
( laughs )
Maybe that way of thinking about it changed with the generations .
But sounds like that are pretty nostalgic , and there 's an opportunity there for Japanese composers .
AY : Well , people in Western studios should contract with me to make that sound , then .
( laughs )
I 'm not sure young people today would be able to understand the nuances of that sort of style -- it may be one of those things where you had to be composing on the Famicom at the time to get it .
You yourself like industrial music , but I have never heard you use it in games .
Will you at some point ?
AY : Well , I have n't created any straight industrial - genre music for games , but I have put in little pieces -- the essence of it , in other words -- in the past .
The clanging environmental sounds in Silent Hill , for example ...
AY : Yeah .
The essence .
Would you ever try to use it in a more melodic part as well ?
AY : I would like to , yes .

GLENDALE , Ariz . --
Adversity has brought out the best in the Detroit Red Wings this season .
That was the case during an injury - plagued regular season that required a last - quarter surge just to make the playoffs .
And that was the case during their Western Conference quarterfinal series against Phoenix , which boiled down to a Game 7 on Tuesday .
The Red Wings , when it mattered the most , exerted their will on the upstart Coyotes , peppering goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov with 50 shots in a dominant 6 - 1 victory at Jobing.com Arena .
The Red Wings do n't have much time to celebrate or catch their breath .
They play the San Jose Sharks in the conference semifinals starting Thursday at HP Pavilion .
Game 2 is Sunday .
" I expected us to be good , '' Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
" I know the group pretty good .
We played really well at times in this series and ( Bryzgalov ) hung in there .
We felt if we kept it going all game long , we'd have a chance to be successful .
RED WINGS 6 , COYOTES 1 Key play :
The Red Wings killed off consecutive power plays , including a two - man advantage that lasted 1:12 late in the second period , before Brad Stuart stepped out of the penalty box and scored with 4.6 seconds to play to give them a 4 - 1 lead .
Hero : Pavel Datsyuk scored the first two goals of the game 1:41 apart early in the second period , getting the team rolling after goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov stood on his head in the first period .
Goat : Lee Stempniak , who provided an offensive boost after arriving from Toronto at the trade deadline , again was a non-factor .
He finished the series with no goals , two assists and a minus - 4 rating .
Analysis : The Red Wings displayed quite the split personality in this series .
They unexpectedly lost a couple games at home , but desperate situations bring out the best in them .
When their high - end players perform like they did in this game , they will be tough for any team to beat .
The scrappy Coyotes played the Red Wings tough , showing them they can't afford to take their foot off the gas pedal in a league that is as competitive as ever .
" Our good players have been really good when we needed them in this series . ''
, had two power - play goals and an assist .
Pavel Datsyuk scored the first two goals of the game .
Henrik Zetterberg and Brian Rafalski contributed three assists each .
" That 's how it supposed to be , '' Babcock said .
" Our big guys were fantastic today .
They really came to play .
To be successful this time of year , that 's what you need . ''
Brad Stuart and Todd Bertuzzi also scored , and Valtteri Filppula chipped in a pair of assists .
Rookie goaltender Jimmy Howard was n't nearly as busy as Bryzgalov , but made some timely saves as the Red Wings won their first Game 7 on the road since 1964 .
They denied Phoenix an opportunity to win its first playoff series since 1987 when the franchise was in Winnipeg .
" Good for him .
A kid , your first year , you win a Game 7 , '' Babcock said .
" He had a lot of run support today , but still he was able to get the job done and he made some huge saves on the penalty kill . ''
The road team won five games in the series , three by Detroit .
" We got a solid team , a great road team that 's really mentally tough , really sticks to the game plan , '' Howard said .
" I think it stems from our captain ( Lidstrom ) .
He stays so calm .
When the game 's on the line and your leaders go after it and it allows every one else to raise their game , everything else falls into place . ''
The Red Wings scored three times on the power play after going 0 - for - 11 with the extra man in the previous two games .
Phoenix , which scored three power - play goals in its 5 - 2 win in Game 5 , went 0 - for - 5 on the man advantage .
" It is a great feeling to see the team respond the way we did in a Game 7 on the road , '' Lidstrom said .
" We played with a lot of confidence , even after the first period when ( it was scoreless ) .
We played with patience . ''
The Red Wings outscored the Coyotes 4 - 1 in the second period following a scoreless first period that Detroit dominated .
A key sequence came late in the period , when the Red Wings killed two Phoenix power plays , including a two - man advantage for 1:12 .
Brad Stuart then came out of the penalty box to score on a breakaway with 4.6 seconds remaining , giving his team a three - goal cushion .
" That 's the turning point in the game .
It 's either 3 - 2 or 4 - 1 , '' Stuart said .
" Guys did an awesome job ( on the penalty kill ) .
Come out of the box and an opportunity was sitting there . ''
Datsyuk got the ball rolling earlier in the period with a power - play goal at 2:01 , settling a bouncing puck in the slot before whipping in a shot .
Lidstrom 's pass from behind the net was intended for Tomas Holmstrom but took a fortuitous bounce onto Datsyuk 's stick .
Datsyuk scored again at 3:42 on a breakaway during four - on - four play .
He was sprung free on a pass from Zetterberg and made a great move to beat Bryzgalov , faking a backhand shot and whipping in a shot on his forehand .
" The puck bounced to me and I just shoot it .
I did n't see anything , just shoot it , saw ( teammates ) start cheering , '' Datsyuk said .
And on the second one , he said , " Our defenseman ( Rafalski ) and Hank ( Zetterberg ) did excellent job giving me pass . ''
The Coyotes scored at 8:23 when Vernon Fiddler swatted the puck past a surprised Howard right off a faceoff with Datsyuk .
Lidstrom , however , made the Coyotes pay for Adrian Aucoin 's holding penalty , scoring from the high slot with 2 seconds remaining on the power play at 13:52 to make it 3 - 1 .
Bertuzzi ( 6:35 ) scored his first goal of the playoffs and Lidstrom ( 12:14 ) notched his second goal of the game in the third period to break it wide open .
And now , a season that appeared on the brink on several occasions motors on .
Best Buy ( NYSE : BBY ) North America ’s largest electronics retailer has announced plans to begin selling electric cars from its stores across the United States .
The chain of retail outlets is already selling Brammo Enertia electric motorcycles along side its flat panel tvs , computers and other assorted electronic consumer goods and it will be interesting to see how the retail giant sets about adding electric cars sales to its
product line up .
The announcement was made during an interview with Leo Raudys , Best Buy ’s senior director of environmental affairs .
He was quoted as saying “ We are very serious about the business , electric cars are basically computers on wheels .
We expect to play a big part in it . ” .
Although we disagree with his assertion that electric cars are just computers on wheels , it ca n’t be a bad thing that such a retail giant is preparing to step up to the plate begin sales of as yet unannounced models of electric cars .
We ’ll keep you updated with further news as it comes in , in the meantime , what do you think of this announcement ?

We had a chance to play around with the handset a bit , and there 's quite a bit about it that 's an improvement over previous T - Mobile Android offerings .
For starters , the keyboard is actually quite good , and without having that annoying G1 chin to block your moves , typing seemed pretty natural .
The UI is a bit like a mashup of Sense and stock Android , with a little featurephone thrown in for good measure -- it 's clear the carrier wanted to make this welcoming to beginners , and it 's mostly succeeded .
One addition we liked was that your recent applications are now docked in the notification window , which makes getting back to business a little easier .
There are also a handful of Sense widgets here ( yay ) , and despite the lower resolution screen ( boo ) , it did feel like a roomier experience than the previous myTouch .
One other plus worth noting : the Genius Button and corresponding voice recognition ( powered by Dragon Dictation ) was some of the best we 've played with , nailing complex text message dictation ( including the word Engadget ) on the first try .
Honestly , it put Google 's stock voice recognition to shame .
On the downside , we 're not sold on the styling of this phone -- it 's a bit plasticky and over - styled -- and we suspect that the lack of a more modern CPU ( the Slide has an older generation Qualcomm chip ) is going to spell trouble just around the corner .
Still , we 're holding final judgment till we have a review unit in hand .

Despite the unbridled enthusiasm among bloggers for Google 's newly announced free WebM codec , a digital video expert has reviewed the new VP8 specification and delivered a severely deflating technical analysis , noting that it decodes video slowly , is buggy , and copies H.264 closely enough to all but guarantee patent issues .
What could possibly go wrong ?
The knee jerk reaction to Google 's announcement was to ask whether Microsoft and Apple would immediately jump to support the new codec , given that the two companies offer the default choice in web browsers to nearly all desktop users , and given Apple 's strong influence over mobile devices .
Speaking to journalists , Microsoft offered to " support " the new codec as long as users installed it themselves , leaving reporters to wonder aloud if Apple ( which has not commented on the issue ) would also allow its
Mac users to install their own codecs , as it always has for the last twenty years .
Mac users can already install Ogg Theora within QuickTime ; it 's just that Apple does n't do this for them because doing so would open the company up to patent assault .
Ars even wondered in print if Google would take the " nuclear option " and cut off support for viewing H.264 videos in YouTube to force the world to use its new VP8 , killing off all support for YouTube on existing mobile devices .
The site also suggested that Apple was a major intellectual property holder in the MPEG H.264 patent pool , and therefore that it gets royalties from the use of H.264 that would prevent the company from being interested in free , open alternatives .
Apple is not a codec vendor
However , Apple has never been a major codec developer .
While the ISO 's MPEG - 4 adopted Apple 's QuickTime container file format as the basis for the standard MP4 container in 1998 , that was a contribution by Apple , not something that could or has generated significant patent royalties .
If Apple had a bunch of proprietary codec technology to push , it would n't have made a splash about licensing the third party Sorenson codec for QuickTime 3.0 back in 1998 , when that codec was among the world 's most advanced .
Apple continued to license subsequent Sorenson Video codecs through QuickTime 5 in 2001 , in an effort to distinguish its media platform as the best way to present and view video .
But Apple then began to focus its resources on supporting the open development of the ISO 's MPEG - 4 codecs , leaving Sorenson to licenses its proprietary codecs to Macromedia 's Flash .
Macromedia also licensed On2's VP6 , which became the preferred codec for Flash starting with version 8 in 2005 .
In contrast , Apple relegated the Sorenson codecs into a bin of legacy codecs within QuickTime , pushing MPEG - 4's H.263 codec and later the more advanced H.264 in QuickTime 7 .
The commercial development of video codecs was moving so quickly that Apple saw value in pooling the top technology company 's video expertise together and licensing it all in one place from the ISO 's MPEG LA , an independent entity with no bias toward any particular company .
With digital video playback standards having moved beyond the desktop computer and into embedded and mobile devices , video games , disc players and other applications , it was no longer in Apple 's best interests to have an exclusive proprietary codec in QuickTime anymore .
Instead ,
Apple prefers open standards in video codec technology , just as prefers open standards on the web , where proprietary encroachments like Adobe 's Flash can only complicate its efforts to build its hardware products .
That means that while Apple is listed as a patent owner by the MPEG Licensing Authority , it is not primarily Apple 's technology that is being licensed by any stretch of the imagination .
The actual video technology comes from the hardware component and software makers that have always been part of MPEG , including Bosch , Dolby , Ericsson , Frauenhofer , Fujitsu , Hitachi , Philips , JVC , LG , Mitsubishi , Panasonic , Samsung , Sharp , Siemens , Sony , and Toshiba .
Even Microsoft , which has developed far more technology in the area of video encoding and decoding than Apple , says it earns about half as much from H.264 royalties compared to how much it pays to the MPEG LA in order to use the pool 's technology .
Apple is clearly not supporting H.264 because it is getting rich doing so .
If there were some openly available , free alternative to the advanced video technology being collaboratively developed by all the world 's advanced video experts , Apple would happily use that .
The problem is that the patents are already filed , and there is n't any acceptable , free technology that can be used that is not subject to respecting those patents .
The only way to get the world 's most advanced video technology is to pay for it .
Or you can steal it
After Apple began shifting its desktop computers and mobile devices toward the open ( but not free ) H.264 specification , it started to become apparent that alternative proprietary codecs were often simply open MPEG - 4 specifications with some improvements made to them .
Sorenson Video 3 was revealed by an anonymous developer 's reverse engineering to simply be a tweaked version of H.264 , while Microsoft 's competing Windows Media Codec , once published by the SMTPE under the name VC - 1 , was also revealed to be largely derived from MPEG standards , a revelation that limited Microsoft from substantially profiting from VC - 1 royalties .
Now , Jason Garrett - Glaser ( also known as Dark Shikari ) an independent developer working on the x264 open source project ( which encodes H.264 video ) has discovered the same thing about Google 's new VP8 , branded as WebM. Garrett - Glaser says he " was able to acquire access to the VP8 spec , software , and source a good few days before the official release and so was able to perform a detailed technical analysis in time for the official release . "
At issue are three points : how good is the VP8 specification ( the published explanation how its technology is supposed to work ) , how good its its implementation ( the code provided to actually do the work ) and how likely is it that VP8 is really safe from patent issues .
On page 2 of 2 : VP8 is a mess .
The VP8 specification is a mess
" The spec , " Garrett - Glaser says , " consists largely of C code copy - pasted from the VP8 source code â up to and including TODOs , ' optimizations , ' and even C - specific hacks , such as workarounds for the undefined behavior of signed right shift on negative numbers .
In many places it is simply outright opaque .
Copy - pasted C code is not a spec .
" I may have complained about the H.264 spec being overly verbose , but at least itâs precise .
The VP8 spec , by comparison , is imprecise , unclear , and overly short , leaving many portions of the format very vaguely explained .
Some parts even explicitly refuse to fully explain a particular feature , pointing to highly - optimized , nigh - impossible - to - understand reference code for an explanation .
Thereâs no way in hell anyone could write a decoder solely with this spec alone . "
Garrett - Glaser noted that " On2 claimed [ its VP8 encoder was ] 50 % better than H.264 , but On2 has always made absurd claims that they were never able to back up with results , so such a number is almost surely wrong .
VP7 , for example , was claimed to be 15 % better than H.264 while being much faster , but was in reality neither faster nor higher quality . "
The VP8 implementation is a mess
" Irrespective of how good the spec is , is the implementation good , " Garrett - Glaser asked , " or is this going to be just like VP3 , where On2 releases an unusably bad implementation with the hope that the community will fix it for them ?
Letâs hope not ; it took 6 years to fix Theora ! "
Other commentators have also noted that Google is largely just releasing code that it obtained without doing the work to actually make it high quality or easy to use , assuming that once the code is available , developers in the community will fix it .
But that strategy has rarely worked .
Mozilla 's failure to fix and release anything functional other than portions of the Netscape web browser over the last decade is a notable example .
The majority of Netscape 's code , including Communicator , collapsed along with its big plans to deliver XUL as a platform and brand out into mail viewers and media players .
Garrett - Glaser launches into an in - depth technical analysis of VP8 , describing the limitations in the design of VP8 while noting many similarities with H.264 .
Among his conclusions :
" VP8 , as a spec , should be a bit better than H.264 Baseline Profile and VC - 1 . Itâs not even close to competitive with H.264 Main or High Profile . "
( H.264 has multiple profiles , each acting as a a separate encoder , making the " standard " really a broad family of related encoding standards , each suited to a particular task .
Baseline is for web or mobile applications , Main is targeted at standard definition TV , and High applies to high definition applications such as Blu - Ray . )
" VP8 , as an encoder , is somewhere between Xvid and Microsoftâs VC - 1 in terms of visual quality .
This can definitely be improved a lot , but not via conventional means .
" VP8 , as a decoder , decodes even slower than ffmpegâs H.264 .
This probably canât be improved that much .
" VP8 copies way too much from H.264 for anyone sane to be comfortable with it , no matter whose word is behind the claim of being patent - free .
" VP8 is not ready for prime - time ; the spec is a pile of copy - pasted C code and the encoderâs interface is lacking in features and buggy .
They arenât even ready to finalize the bitstream format , let alone switch the world over to VP8 . "
Outlook not so good
If Google can rapidly improve upon the VP8 codebase and specification , and can push chip makers to incorporate support for the new codec immediately , it is possible that Apple will eventually support the new codec in its products .
However , the similarities with H.264 suggest that the real technology licensees behind the world 's advanced video processing technology are n't likely to give Google a free pass at erasing their revenue streams .
While Apple is largely neutral in this issue as a minor player in the codec business , there are many major players who are going to test the new codec before anyone in the industry with deep pockets is likely to buy into Google 's new plans .
A Toronto woman is suing cellphone provider Rogers Wireless for a breach of privacy that led to the end of her marriage .
Gabriella Nagy is asking for $ 600,000 in damages for invasion of privacy , breach of confidence , breach of contract and negligence .
Nagy 's problems began in 2007 when her husband signed a contract with Rogers to provide home phone and internet service at the couple 's home .
The woman , whose last name is different from her husband 's , had a Rogers cellphone under her own name that was not supposed to be included in the services her husband had ordered .
But unbeknownst to Nagy , Rogers included her personal cellphone statement with the family 's invoice , which was mailed to her husband .
Nagy was having an extramarital affair at the time and the bill revealed frequent long calls to her lover .
According to a statement of claim filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice , " The husband used the previously private and confidential information that the defendant ( Rogers ) unilaterally disclosed to the husband to inquire about the people that the plaintiff ( Nagy ) was telephoning and the nature of such calls . "
The husband left Nagy and their two children , aged 6 and 7 , a month after making the discovery .
After the breakup , Nagy was emotionally distraught and eventually lost her job and her ability to work .
She also broke off the affair shortly after her husband left .
According to the statement of claim , Nagy continues to suffer emotional and psychological distress , has been prescribed antidepressants and is under the care of a psychologist and psychiatrist .
The statements made in the court document have not been proven .
Rogers says it cannot be held responsible for the condition of the marriage , the affair or the subsequent breakup .

Pakistan , a country with over 2.3 million Facebook users , has banned the use of Facebook temporarily due to a Facebook group called “ Everybody Draw Mohammed Day ! ”
It ’s an issue which clearly highlights the difficulties in managing and monitoring content that is n’t offensive in various cultures .
The group ’s details states “ Hopefully this page will spark seroius debates in international forums . ”
It ’s pretty clear the group of more than 44,000 members has accomplished its goals .
Facebook has a history of allowing controversial groups to develop a presence on the site .
From Holocaust denial groups , to groups that call on the death of Obama ( found here ) , Facebook is consistently filled with groups that can be considered offensive by most .
Facebook has erred in the direction of “ free speech ” , however where that line should be drawn has not been very clear .
For a long period of time , Facebook allowed Holocaust denial groups and comments , before the company eventually caved and banned the groups .
The extent to which “ drawing a Mohammed ” can result in massive backlash in Middle Eastern countries is significant .
As the BBC points out , “ Publications of similar cartoons in Danish newspapers in 2005 sparked angry protests in Muslim countries – five people were killed in Pakistan . ”
For this latest group , a High Court Justice ordered Facebook to be blocked until May 31st .
According to the BCC , the ban was eventually lifted , however it ’s pretty clear that tension still exists , given that the group still exists .
Do you think this is similar to Facebook ’s Holocaust denial groups ?
One of the pleasures that comes from following the triumph of candidates who were n't selected by members of their party 's establishment is the slow mainstreaming of wacky ideas .
Call it the victory of the heckler 's vetoers or attribute it to the dynamics of the way groups are formed , but more and more outre ideas are finding their way into politics these days .
And that 's OK .
American politics ought to encompass more than a narrow range of ideologies and orthodoxies .
Two recent Tea Party - backed candidates who had success in beating Washington - designated candidates are quite taken with the idea of repealing the 17th amendment .
Ratified in 1913 , it provides for the direct election of U.S. senators .
Previously , state legislatures chose the senators .
Lots of logistical problems resulted , but you could fairly attribute the popular constitutional amendment to the Progressive movement and to political entrepreneurs in the press .
Well , newly - minted Republican nominee for Idaho 's first congressional district Raul Labrador wants to repeal the amendment .
As TalkingPoints Memo notes , " Supporters of the plan say that ending the public vote for Senators would give the states more power to protect their own interests in Washington ( and of course , give all of us " more liberty " in the process . )
As their process of ' vetting ' candidates , some tea party groups have required candidates to weigh in on the idea of repeal in questionnaires . "
Holder Also Reasserts Commitment To Using Federal Criminal Courts In Terrorism Prosecutions
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
WASHINGTON – While testifying today before the House Judiciary Committee , Attorney General Eric Holder reiterated the Obama administration ’s request to “ modernize and clarify ” Miranda warnings for terrorism suspects .
Miranda warnings , ruled by the U.S. Supreme Court to be a constitutional right , are used to inform suspects of their rights during interrogation .
Holder had previously mentioned his desire to weaken Miranda on network news shows Sunday morning .
Also during his testimony , Holder again defended his November decision to try the 9/11 suspects in federal criminal court , but acknowledged that the administration may still consider using the fatally flawed military commissions .
The American Civil Liberties Union strongly believes that the appropriate place to prosecute these and all terrorism cases is in federal criminal court , and that the military commissions are unable to deliver effective and certain justice and should be shut down for good .
Since 9/11 , the military commissions have completed only three terrorism - related cases , with two of three convicted defendants already released .
Federal courts , on the other hand , have successfully completed hundreds of terrorism - related cases .
The following can be attributed to Laura W. Murphy , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
“ As even Attorney General Holder himself has testified several times , there is no evidence that Miranda has obstructed the government ’s ability to gain valuable information from terrorism suspects .
Weakening Miranda would not make us safer , but it would make it harder to use evidence against terrorism suspects in court .
“ Asking Congress to weaken Miranda protections during an election year is especially concerning because Congress , as a result of political pressure , is more likely to do even more damage to Miranda ’s constitutional protections than the administration itself might propose .
“ Moreover , even if the administration proposes broadening Miranda exceptions only in terrorism cases , the change is sure to bleed into non-terrorism cases as there is no way for an arresting officer to know up front whether or not an arrestee will be charged with terrorism - related crimes .
“ Attorney General Holder remains , however , correct in his position that we should use our federal criminal courts for prosecution of the 9/11 suspects .
Our federal criminal courts have the track record to assure reliable and constitutional outcomes .
We urge the attorney general to remain resilient in his advocacy for federal trials despite any political pressure he may receive . ”
Atlanta , Georgia ( CNN ) --
The curious faces scrutinize the classroom kitchen , where pots and pans dangle from the ceiling and sharp knives glisten on the counter next to heaps of spinach and ripe green peppers .
The one - night , hands - on course , called Food 101 , is meant for them .
They are the cooking inept , who can't properly to chop an onion , let alone sauté a medley of vegetables .
First - time student Jessica Clark , 33 , of Atlanta , is attending the course offered by Cook 's Warehouse because she is dubious of her kitchen abilities .
She only knows how to prepare grilled chicken and steamed broccoli ( and on some nights canned black beans and rice ) .
Her boyfriend is sick of eating the same thing at home .
She is sick of eating out .
" I usually make whatever is easy , and I guess that 's not much , " says Clark , dressed in an apron with her fingers still wet from fumbling through the tomato dicing activity .
" I 've avoided the kitchen for 33 years . "
Cooking dinner ?
There 's an app for that
From British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to First Lady Michelle Obama , a food revolution is brewing in America , a push to return to the bygone days when healthy home - cooked meals were much more frequent .
Despite the efforts to get Americans back into the kitchen , there still exists a group of adults in their 20s and 30s -- like Clark -- who are clueless in the kitchen .
Ironically , these 20 - and 30 - somethings may have stretched their palates while traveling the world and even spend hours watching the cooking shows and " Top Chef , " but they are defeated when they enter the kitchen .
They do n't own cooking utensils in their Tupperware - filled cabinets .
They rely on microwaves , restaurants and takeout menus to feed their empty stomachs .
Simply put , they cannot cook .
" Lots of people think , read and talk about food , but they do n't know how to do anything , " said Jennifer Berg , head of the Food Studies program at New York University .
" There is an incredible disconnect to actually knowing how to do something . "
I never learned to cook
No one tracks precisely how many young noncookers exist , but it 's easy to find them .
Just ask anyone between the ages of 20 and 40 , and they will shrug and say either they can't cook -- or point to a friend who can't make anything .
They come with plenty of excuses for their cooking incompetence : " My friends would rather eat out .
... I do n't like cleaning the mess afterwards .
...
Cooking for one person is impractical .
... I 'm too busy with my job to cook .
... I live in a city with plenty of affordable restaurant options .
... My New York City kitchen is too small . "
" I could n't tell if she wanted the big bubbles or little bubbles , " says Sharita Robertson of Baton Rouge , Louisiana , reflecting back on a time in her early 20s when a friend asked her to boil some eggs .
Robertson never had to boil anything before her friend asked her .
She admits her mother cooked meals for her growing up , but she does n't know why she never learned .
" I just never had to do any of it , " she says .
Robertson , now 30 , has a 7 - year - old daughter , but she rarely prepares anything more complicated than opening a jar of spaghetti sauce and boxed pasta .
One time , she tried to fry some chicken , but the attempt ended with a disastrous blister on her leg .
Most of the time , her mother cooks for her daughter .
Restaurants , processed foods take over
At all ages , there are individuals who cannot cook .
But NYU food studies expert Jennifer Berg theorizes the group of 20 - and 30 - somethings can't cook mainly because of a dependence on processed foods that took hold in the 1970s .
Greasy snacks , frozen dinners and instant soups flooded the marketplace , replacing traditional home cooking as mothers joined the workplace .
During this period , the feminist movement grew stronger , Berg explained .
A stigma formed around mothers who cooked meals from scratch .
They were labeled domesticated women tied to the household , Berg said .
Home economics classes were out , working mothers were in .
And so , Berg says a generation of children never learned from their mothers how to cook .
Another reason why some people cannot cook , some food experts believe , is that the restaurant culture took hold of the American family .
Dual incomes made restaurants more affordable to the growing middle class .
In particular , fast food chains such as McDonald , Pizza Hut and Burger King began invading almost every community in America .
Nearly half of spending on food in the American family went to " food away from home " in 2008 , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Economic Research Service .
In 1970 , about 30 percent of food dollars were spent away from home .
" If you have a great food scene and so many affordable options , then you do n't need to necessarily be in your own kitchen , " said Amy Cao , 26 , a food writer who created the AmyBlogsChow.com .
" Cooking is no longer a survival tactic . "
Cao 26 , admits on her blog that she cannot cook even though her job is to dine and review restaurants across New York City .
Her inability to cook inspired her video series called " Stupidly Simple Snacks " on her blog , where she helps young noncookers learn how to prepare a quick snack .
In one of her fast - paced , three - minute online videos , she looks uncomfortable in the kitchen as she teaches her viewers how to make a Greek salad that only requires putting chopped tomatoes , cucumbers , olives and feta cheese in a large mixing bowl .
She struggles to use the pepper grinder , and then casually tops the salad with balsamic vinegar and a few pinches of salt .
Cao hopes the simple recipe can make cooking less daunting for young folks like herself .
The great obesity war
Studies have shown that eating out usually consumes more calories than cooking at home , which has complicated the obesity epidemic .
About 34 percent of adults in the United States are considered obese , defined as having a BMI 30 or higher , according to the CDC .
The obesity epidemic has motivated the food reform efforts by Jamie Oliver and Michelle Obama .
" If you do n't know how to cook , then you have no options , " writes Oliver to CNN .
" You 're forced into a series of bad choices and a diet of mostly processed foods ... cooking skills are life skills and just as important as knowing how to manage your money . "
In the March edition of Newsweek , first lady Michelle Obama , who has embarked on the fight against child obesity , wrote about the lack of healthy home cooking .
" Back when many of us were growing up , we led lives that kept most of us at a pretty healthy weight , " she wrote .
" We walked to school every day , ran around at recess and gym and for hours before dinner , and ate home - cooked meals that always seemed to have a vegetable on the plate . "
A cooking comeback ?
Some food experts argue a revival of cooking has emerged among the young adults , both male and female , over the last decade .
The Internet is loaded with young foodies , blogging and posting about their culinary adventures .
The popular Food Netwook will launch the Cooking Channel this month , a trendier sister channel that targets younger audiences .
Cao writes on her blog that she 's trying to learn to cook for the sake of her health and wallet .
Several weeks ago she learned to bake tarragon chicken .
It 's a recipe that took three times to get right .
She mashed the spices into the butter and then coated the chicken breast all by herself .
Barbara Fairchild , editor of Bon Appetit magazine , said she 's noticed subscriptions jumped among 20 - to 30 - year - olds over the past few years .
" Cooking is hip now , " she said .
" It 's not just for someone with a French accent who is 70 years old and lives in Paris .
It 's become much more inclusive . "
Back in the Cook's Warehouse classroom kitchen in Atlanta , there is only one bloody finger by the end of the night from a dicing and chopping exercise .
The steam from the freshly made vegetable stock is simmering in the pot .
A steak is being seared on a pan in a homemade sauce .
The students are eager to enjoy a home - cooked meal .
Clark says she is inspired by the course .
No more chicken and steamed broccoli .
With some basic cooking skills , she 's going to throw her friends a dinner party , all from scratch .
This coming Sunday , March 21 , thousands of immigrants and their allies from unions , community and faith based organizations will converge on the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. to call for the passage of comprehensive immigration reform .
A progressive immigration reform that protects the rights of both immigrant and U.S. born workers is an essential step towards the resolution of the economic crisis .
There are estimated to be between 10 and 11 million undocumented immigrants , at least 8 million of whom are in the labor force .
These immigrants want to join labor unions so that they can struggle alongside U.S. - born workers for justice on the job and in the community , yet they can not because their undocumented status gives them no rights .
Thus they have to accept lower pay and worse working conditions than would be the case if they had legal status .
This undercuts the position of all workers in the country , reduces the consumption power of the working class , and , even though undocumented immigrants do pay taxes , deprives federal , state and local governments of increased revenues that would come from higher earnings .
The lack of political rights of these immigrant workers also weakens the whole working class .
In addition , there are believed to be about 4 million U.S. citizen children with one or both parents undocumented , who , on a daily basis face the cruel possibility of the arrest and deportation of a mother and father .
The anti-immigrant lobby , rooted in the fascist far right , tells U.S. born workers that the undocumented are “ stealing their jobs ” and claims that their mass deportation would “ open up ” jobs for U.S. born workers .
They have convinced many , but this is fallacious reasoning .
Workers of every kind , immigrant and U.S. born , documented and undocumented , occupy jobs in the economy , but also create wealth by their toil and engage in other activities ( as consumers and taxpayers ) that create jobs for others .
Were that not the case , we could say that every worker in the country is potentially “ taking a job ” from some other potential worker .
The problem is not “ taking jobs ” but lack of rights , which weakens working - class solidarity .
A recent study by the Center for American Progress and the Immigration Policy Institute , “ Raising the Floor for American Workers : The Economic Benefits of Comprehensive Immigration Reform , ” concludes that the legalization of the undocumented would add $ 1.5 trillion to our country ’s Gross Domestic Product over a 10 year period , and generate billions in new tax revenues each year .
This translates into many thousands of desperately needed jobs .
Legalizing the undocumented will create jobs , not take them away .
This , and basic justice , is more than enough reason to fight for comprehensive immigration reform now .

The prolonged wait for updated MacBook Pros continue without any major hints at when they might arrive .
A report last week suggested that a shortage of Intel notebook chips could be contributing to the delay .
MacRumors has heard that the MacBook Pro supplies to retailers have abruptly become constrained , possibly suggesting that updates could be imminent .
Meanwhile , one MacRumors reader emailed Steve Jobs directly about concerns about how long he's had to wait for the new MacBook Pro updates and Apple 's recent focus on the iPad .
He wrote " I recognise the need for secrecy etc but I am really losing heart in the lack of vision for the MBP and Mac Pros .
Not expecting a response but as someone who has personally switched dozens of people onto the mac way this is a sad email for me to compose . "
As he 's been occasionally known to do , Steve Jobs reportedly responded with a short reply that simply said " Not to worry . "
HAR to Page Speed
Here ’s the story behind this nifty tool I cranked out this weekend : HAR to Page Speed
HTTP Archive Specification
About a year ago I was on the weekly Firebug Working Group call when Jan ( “ Honza ” ) Odvarko said he was going to work on an export feature for Net Panel .
I love HttpWatch and had used its export feature many times , but always wished there was an industry standard for saving HTTP waterfall chart information .
In the hope of achieving this goal , I introduced Honza and Simon Perkins ( creator of HttpWatch ) and suggested that if they developed an open format it would likely evolve into an industry standard .
A few months later they published the HTTP Archive specification and had integrated it into their products .
My contribution ?
In addition to planting the idea with Honza and Simon , I chose the three character file extension : .HAR .
Support for HAR is growing .
In addition to being part of Firebug ( via Honza ’s NetExport add - on ) and HttpWatch , it ’s also in ShowSlow , DebugBar , Http Archive Rule Runner , and a few other tools and sites out there .
( I hear it ’s coming to Fiddler soon . )
The importance of an industry standard HTTP archive format is huge .
Adoption of HAR allows companies and data gathering institutions ( such as the Internet Archive ) to record the web page experience and pull it up later for further review .
It provides a way to exchange information across tools .
And it provides an open standard for sharing web loading information between individuals – developer to developer as well as customer to customer support .
Page Speed SDK
In their last few releases the Page Speed team has mentioned porting their performance analysis logic from JavaScript to C++.
The resulting library is called “ native library ” – not too jazzy .
But last week they released the Page Speed SDK .
The documentation is slim , but I noticed a commandline tool called har_to_pagespeed .
Hmmm , that sounds interesting .
I downloaded the SDK .
It built fine on my Dreamhost shared server .
Then I wrapped it with a file upload PHP page and created HAR to Page Speed .
You start by uploading a HAR file .
If you do n’t have any or simply want a quick test drive , you can use one of the examples .
But it ’s easy to create your own HAR files using Firebug and NetExport .
The latter adds the “ Export ” item to Firebug ’s Net Panel .
Now comes the fun part .
After uploading a HAR file you get the output from Page Speed .
( Note that this is a subset of rules .
Some rules still need to be ported . )
I also threw in a rendering of the waterfall chart based on Honza ’s HarViewer :
Compellingness
My HAR to Page Speed page is handy .
If you ’re generating HAR files in something other than Firefox , you now have a way to get a Page Speed analysis .
If you ’ve got an archive of HAR files , you can analyze them with Page Speed at any time in the future .
But the big excitement I get from this page is to see these pieces coming together , especially in the area of performance analysis .
Another industry initiative I ’ve been advocating is a common performance analysis standard .
Right now we have multiple performance analysis tools : Page Speed , YSlow , AOL Pagetest , MSFast , VRTA , and neXpert to name a few .
There ’s some commonality across these tools , but the differences are what ’s noticeable .
Web developers really need to run multiple tools if they want their web site to be evaluated against the most important performance best practices .
With the adoption of HAR and Page Speed SDK , we ’re moving to having a record of the page load experience that can be saved and shared , and performance analysis that is consistent regardless of what browser and development environment you work in .
We ’re not quite there .
We need more tools to adopt HAR import / export .
And we need more rules to be added to the Page Speed SDK .
But I can see the handwriting on the wall – and it ’s spelling F - A - S - T .
I ’ll be talking about these and other movements in the performance industry this Wednesday at Web 2.0 Expo SF .
Overview
This site presents an independent scientific study about the security of the electronic voting machines ( EVMs ) used in India .
Contrary to claims by Indian election authorities , these paperless electronic voting systems suffer from significant vulnerabilities .
Even brief access to the machines could allow dishonest election insiders or other criminals to alter election results .
In the video above , we demonstrate two kinds of attacks against a real Indian EVM .
One attack involves replacing a small part of the machine with a look - alike component that can be silently instructed to steal a percentage of the votes in favour of a chosen candidate .
These instructions can be sent wirelessly from a mobile phone .
Another attack uses a pocket - sized device to change the votes stored in the EVM between the election and the public counting session , which in India can be weeks later .
These attacks are neither complicated nor difficult to perform , but they would be hard to detect or defend against .
The best way to prevent them is to count votes using paper ballots that voters can see .

The board of St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers voted on Tuesday night to close its flagship hospital in Greenwich Village , ending its long struggle to stay afloat despite millions of dollars of debt .
The exact timing for the closing of St. Vincent ’s Hospital Manhattan , which has about 400 inpatient beds , was not immediately clear , but the process of shutting down has already begun , and the State Department of Health will become involved to ensure an orderly closing .
Elective surgeries are to end by April 14 .
“ The decision to close St. Vincent ’s Hospital Manhattan inpatient services was made only after the board , management and our advisers exhausted every possible alternative , ” Alfred E. Smith IV , chairman of St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers , said in a statement .
They were unable to come up with a plan , he said , “ to save the inpatient services at the hospital that has proudly served Manhattan ’s West Side and downtown for 160 years . ”

Paterson said Tuesday that he would work with the board and the Department of Health to preserve some of the hospital ’s most important community functions , perhaps by scaling it down to an urgent care center that could take patients with conditions ranging from ankle sprains to heart attacks .
That plan would also try to maintain some outpatient services , like those that provide H.I.V. treatment and primary care , but it remains at a conceptual stage and would require finding a partner , people close to the process said .

Secular NGOs :
The Aristide Foundation for Democracy ( AFD ) was created in 1996 by former President Jean - Bertrand Aristide ( the first democratically elected president of Haiti ) with a simple principle in mind : " The promise of democracy can only be fulfilled if all sectors of Haitian society are able to actively participate in the democratic life of the nation . "
Healing Hands for Haiti ( a physical rehab and prosthetics organization based in Port au Prince ) , Lamp for Haiti , and a group that umbrellas several projects called Healing Haiti .
parryander has personal experience with these groups , so I suggest checking out their comments .
Another organization , The Honor and Respect Foundation , was described in a story on Narconews called Getting Help to Haiti .
The foundation was created by journalist Reed Lindsay , who is now Telsur 's D.C. Bureau Chief , for children who could n't get into other schools .
Their website says that it " seeks to establish funds in support of several specific programs carried out by grassroots groups in the poorest neighborhoods of Port - au - Prince . "
I have a phone number for a contact there and will get direct information tonight .
Partners in Health (****/ A+ ) has now started a BLOG about its efforts called Stand with Haiti .
It has very useful information .
Partners in Health is also putting out a call for health volunteers , in case you are a medical professional who can help out that way :
We are deeply grateful for the multitude of people who have contacted us wanting to provide medical assistance .
As patients flood to our sites from Port - au - Prince , we 're finding ourselves in need of both medical personnel and supplies .
In particular , we need surgeons ( especially trauma / orthopedic surgeons ) , ER doctors and nurses , and full surgical teams ( including anesthesiologists , scrub and post - op nurses , and nurse anesthetists ) .
If you are a health professional interested in volunteering , please send an email to volunteer@pih.org with information on :
• Your credentials
• Language capabilities ( Haitian Creole or French desired )
• Overseas experience ( if any )
• Any prior experience in emergency / post - disaster relief efforts
• Availability
• Contact information
As phone lines in Haiti remain down and transportation and communication are difficult , PIH is still in the process of determining where we can set up operations in Port - au - Prince , and how we can transport patients and volunteers to our sites .
We will be able to offer more concrete information after these logistical matters are resolved .
Once again – thank you for your support .

The Dallas Morning News contacted Dallasdoc : Tonight I had a conversation with a reporter from the Dallas Morning News , who noted our efforts to raise money for the victims in Haiti and emailed me because of my screenname .
I had a long chat with him in which I extolled the good heart and caring nature of the people in this community .
" We are liberals and progressives , we are interested in politics because we care about people , " I told him .
I described how this community responded to a simple appeal with incredible energy and self - sacrificing generosity , and that after five years here I had expected no less of us .

Road tolls , gas taxes and parking surcharges could generate $ 1 billion each annually toward transit improvements in the Toronto region , according to a report issued by the Toronto Board of Trade on Wednesday .
Aimed at raising the issue in this fall ’s municipal election , the report outlines but does n’t recommend any of 16 potential money - makers .
One or a combination could help pay for the $ 2 billion annual transit investment Metrolinx has recommended in each of the next 25 years , said board of trade president Carol Wilding .
“ It ’s time we recognize the real debate and start getting realistic about how we are going to pay for it , ” she said .
“ It ’s a difficult conversation , it ’s not a politically easy one , … ( but ) the public is ready to have that dialogue . ”
The report was issued hours before the board of Metrolinx unanimously approved a scaled down version of Toronto ’s Transit City plan , revised after the province delayed $ 4 billion in funding .
Even before that , the TTC and Metrolinx had discussed delaying building about 23 kilometres of track because the cost estimates were $ 2.5 billion higher than the $ 8.15 billion the province had budgeted .
The new plan suggests deferring those sections until after Metrolinx introduces an Investment Strategy for raising transit cash , by June 2013 .
“ There is growing , broad public support for making sure we do n’t come in at the last month on that assignment , ” said Metrolinx CEO Rob Prichard , acknowledging the board of trade report .
Mayor David Miller again expressed his opposition to the revised plan because the current government may not be in office 10 years from now .
“ I think this is a sad loss for Toronto , ” he told reporters .
“ What we heard today is basically they ’re going to build Eglinton and Sheppard .
And one of the sad things is , Metrolinx wo n’t take public input .
. . .
But this is n’t their decision .
It ’s the premier ’s decision . ”

Finding cash for transit
Ideas and their potential revenue :
$ 1 billion : Road tolls of 10 cents / km on 400 - series highways , the QEW , Gardiner and DVP ; parking surcharge on non-residential spots ; a 1 per cent regional sales tax ; gas tax of 10 cents / litre ; congestion pricing using a cordon system similar to London , England
$ 500 million to $ 1 billion : National transit strategy by which Ottawa contributes more ; predictable long - term government funding ; infrastructure bonds tied to specific projects ; employer payroll tax ; land - value enhancement , to capture the value of land that will be improved by transit investment
$ 500 million or less : Tolls on HOV lanes ; vehicle registration fee based on emission levels ; utility levy

( via Making Light )
Readers of my articles will know that I am extremely pessimistic about the prospects for peace in the Middle East .
I do not believe for a second that the leaders of Israel actually consider Iran to be an " existential " threat but the fact that they have cried wolf so often has convinced the Israeli public that it is so .
Worse still , Israel ’s friends in the US have convinced the American public of the same thing even though Iran does not threaten the United States at all .
Relying on a complaisant media that has fully embraced the fabricated narrative of fanatical Mullahs brandishing nuclear weapons shortly before handing them over to al - Qaeda , a majority of Americans now believes that Iran must be dealt with by force and that it already has a nuclear weapon .
As in the case in the lead up to the invasion of Iraq , the fictitious threat has taken on an ominous reality because the lie has been repeated often enough to appear to be truth .
I believe several things must be understood in relationship to the likely formula for initiation of such a conflict .
First , in spite of the increasingly bellicose language coming from Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton , I do not believe that the Obama Administration wants a war .
On the contrary , I believe that the language is designed to convince Tel Aviv that the US is getting tough with Iran to preempt any possible military action .
The principal advocates of war in the United States are not in the White House .
They continue to belong to the Israeli lobby as given voice through its acolytes in Congress and the media .
Second , the Israeli government having sold the " existential threat " fiction does want a war , but its options are limited .
It knows it can only do temporary damage to Iran and wants the United States to do the heavy lifting .
That will require contriving a situation that will bring about US entry into the conflict , otherwise an Israeli attack will have only limited value , possibly slowing down Iran ’s nuclear program but not stopping it while also guaranteeing that the Mullahs will make the political decision to develop a weapon .
Third , Washington has no real ability to put pressure on Israel as the White House has already made clear that it will not cut aid to Tel Aviv and will continue to use its veto to protect Israel in international fora like the United Nations .
Fourth , once the shooting begins , even if Israel starts it , both Congress and the media will demand that Washington intervene to support brave little democracy Israel .
One can be sure that on the day after Tel Aviv starts a conflict Congress will overwhelmingly pass a motion approving the Israeli action and also calling on the White House to have American forces join in .
The Washington Post , FOX news , and The New York Times will be beside themselves with joy .
Putting the four premises together , what does it all mean ?
It means that Israel will seek to start a conflict with Iran and pull the United States in .
It will ignore any US calls for restraint and will attack the Mullahs with or without a pretext , whether or not Iran remains in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regime ( which I believe it will ) , and whether or not Tehran does anything aggressive .
In the lead - up to such an attack , Israel will intensify its propaganda efforts and is quite prepared to lie to make a case against Iran and its friends in the Middle East region .
The recent total fabrication of a case that Syria had given Scud missiles to Hezbollah is a case in point .
Israel sees everyone in the region as an enemy or a potential enemy and it works very hard to make Washington see things the same way .
Once the fighting starts , Washington will inevitably be drawn in with Congress and the mainstream media cheerleading the process .
So let us assume that Israel will attack Iran .
After all , it is a win - win situation for them in that they will demonstrate once again to the Muslim world that they are not to be trifled with and will leave the serious fighting to the United States .
I believe they will attack Iran by the shortest route , which is over Iraqi airspace .
Iraqi airspace is controlled by the United States Air Force , which would undoubtedly be under orders not to shoot down the Israeli planes lest Obama find himself facing a furious AIPAC , Congress , and the press immediately thereafter .
A shoot down order is just not possible given Congressional democrats ’ fear of how Jewish political donors would react , not to mention the danger that the usual voices in the media would turn against the Obama administration on the eve of the midterm elections .
Unless the Iranians were to react in an extremely restrained fashion , they would consider the US complicit in the attack due to the passage over Iraq and their retaliation would bring Washington into the war , which is precisely what Israel expects to happen .
The only joker in the deck for Israel is the possible unintended consequences .
If the war were to go badly , with Iran , for example , using its Chinese supplied cruise missiles to sink a US aircraft carrier , the role of Israel in starting the conflict might well be challenged by many in the US , so many that even the media and Congress would have to take notice .
But Israel probably considers that a remote possibility given the huge military advantage that the United States enjoys over Iran so they likely believe it to be it a risk worth taking .
Also , one must consider that the hard right Israeli government of Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu is not necessarily a rational player that will weigh up all the pluses and minuses .
Netanyahu is driven by racism , intellectual arrogance , and a belief that he can control events in the United States , all of which will be part of his decision making .
Which leads to the question of timing .
There has been some talk in the media that Israel would likely " do something " by November .
Why that date is being selected is not completely clear , but I believe it will be sooner and this is why : as noted above , the United States controls Iraqi airspace currently .
But that control will be ceded to the Iraqi government in August when the US presence in Iraq is due to be reduced to a " garrison non-combatant " level of 60,000 soldiers and airmen .
At that point , the US Air Force will no longer have autonomous authority to engage in Iraqi airspace , but the Iraqi government will be empowered to request US assistance to do so .
Imagine for a moment what it would do to US credibility in the Arab world if Baghdad were to ask the US to help defend its airspace against an Israeli incursion and the US were to refuse to do so .
So I think the Israelis will make their move before August .
They want to entangle the United States into fighting on their behalf but they will not necessarily want to humiliate Obama while doing so .
So what can Obama do to stop this ?
There has been some speculation that he might send a private emissary to Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu with the message that the United States does not support an Israeli attack and that Washington will both denounce the action and not back Tel Aviv .
I believe that Obama has already told Netanyahu both privately and through diplomatic channels that the US opposes military action but the Israeli government no doubt regards such a warning as toothless , particularly as both Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton have asserted that Israel has a right to make its own security decisions .
Any move to punish or pressure the Israelis would be blocked by Congress , so the Obama warning can be brushed off .
The only option that I believe would actually work is for Obama to go public preemptively on the issue and proclaim that there is no casus belli with Iran , that any Israeli attack will not be supported by the United States and that furthermore the United States will take the lead in condemning such an act in the United Nations and in all other appropriate international fora .
Is that likely to happen ?
I think not .
And that is precisely the reason why I think a new war in the Middle East is inevitable and will take place this year , probably by August .
If the concept of religion did n't exist , would the world be better or worse ?
Better
Worse

Please , check out polls and Husky 's " State of Battle. net 2.0 " video after reading interview .
The video has kittens !
I thought this was interesting as earlier Blizzard interviews had made it seem like this was right on the docket .
And I know it wasnt just me that arrived at this conclusion .
In many of the BNET threads their are usually several people talking about how Blizzard is going to add things like chat and cross realm soon .
Hopefully the people will see that the full interview has a lot of new info .
Especially if you pay attention to just what Blizzard is ... and isnt saying .
Also note that if you dont want Blizzard to share your info with third parties you have to email them .
Excerpt of the Frank Pearce Interview
A special thanks to Incgamer for this incredibly indepth and revealing interview .
I thought this was interesting as earlier Blizzard interviews had made it seem like this was right on the docket .
And I know it wasnt just me that arrived at this conclusion .
In many of the BNET threads their are usually several people talking about how Blizzard is going to add things like chat and cross realm soon .
Hopefully the people will see that the full interview has a lot of new info .
Especially if you pay attention to just what Blizzard is ... and isnt saying .
There are many Europeans that have loads of American friends , and have a problem finding matches with Americans .
I know you 've already promised to bridge this divide ...
[ Bob Colayco :
That 's not the case . ]
No , it 'll be structured very similarly to World of Warcraft , where you 've got the European region and players matched against the other players within their region .
[ BC : We have n't promised anything like that .
That 's something we 'll look into , but I just wanted to jump in and clarify that . ]
But you 're not excluding the possibility – you 're just saying there are no current plans for it ?
There are no current plans for it , and if you 're a European player and you 've got friends that are in another region that you want to be able to connect with , we definitely want to support that .
It might mean that you have to access it through the US client , but those facilities will definitely be available in terms of , if you want the US client , go to the US website , download the US client .
So I can use my same account ?
No .
So I need to buy two clients , that 's what you 're saying ?
Yeah .
But I can have two of them in my Battle . net account ?
You 'd have an EU Battle .
net account , and a US Battle . net account .
And that would n't be against the Terms of Service or End User License Agreement ?
No .
I 'm pretty sure that 's not against the TOS or EULA , but you'd be subject to the terms of the EULA for the region in which you 're playing .
Another thing I thought you 'd promised was chat rooms within Battle .
net ...
Nope .
No plans for specific chat rooms at this time .
You 'll be able to open up chats direct with your friends , and when we add clans and groups there 'll be chats for your clans and groups , but no specific plans for chat rooms right now .
Do you really want chat rooms ?
Loads of people within the community are wanting Looking For Group chat rooms , and that sort of thing .
Well , if we 've done our job right in terms of the matchmaking service , then hopefully they wo n't feel like they 'll need it for that service .
With the whole divide thing , though , Australians have ended up with the south - east Asia region .
They 've been wondering why you 'd choose to do that , as obviously there 'll be primarily non-English people playing with them .
That 's an interesting challenge for us , because we want to make sure that the connectivity to the servers is such that the game experience is not impacted by a high - latency connection , and the latency between Australia and New Zealand to the servers in the US was such that we felt we would be able to deliver a better gaming experience by using their servers in south - east Asia .
You guys are n't the first people to do this , as this has happened recently with another game .
Generally , this seems to be the problem with the Australasian reason .
Is that across the board ?
Do you think that 's the reason ?
I can't speak on behalf of any other game developers , but definitely for us .
A high - latency connection to the servers for StarCraft 2 is going to impact the game experience .
Is there going to be any kind of work to resolve that issue , to get them onto an English - speaking server of some description ?
You know , it depends on the technology infrastructure provided by the telecommunications providers .
It 's something that we 'll be constantly evaluating and looking at .
In an ideal world , the Blizzard gaming community would be unified in one global region , but the technology 's just not there yet .
Ten years ago , we were n't making 3D games .
Hopefully , in the same way that we 're making 3D games today and we were n't ten years ago , down the road the connectivity in terms of the internet will be such that we can bring everyone together in a unified community , but it 's just not possible right now .
That 's the ideal world .
[ BC :
The other thing is that the Asian players are playing on an English client , so they should be able to speak enough English to communicate a " gg " or " attack now , " " help . "
Singapore is an English speaking country , the Philippines is an English - speaking country ... ]
Hong Kong .
[ BC : It 's not like it 's going to be one Australian surrounded by 500,000 Thai people .
There 's going to be plain English spoken . ]
Plus , is n't StarCraft 2 the universal language of RTSes ?
How much English do you need to speak to communicate with your opponent and kick his ass ?

Introduction
Rarely , in a world constantly consumed by change , does something merely " good " manage to transcend the life expectancy of its parts and become something great .
The existence of three perfectly balanced races , an accessible , yet difficult to master , gameplay experience , a strong hardcore community , a thriving e-sports presence , and a host of other factors have led to the creation of a legend among video games .
StarCraft is considered by many to be the pinnacle of RTS gaming perfection .
By other , less hardcore fans , who played it if even for a short while , it is remembered fondly ; yet everyone agrees that its success and vitality was an unintended fluke .
Somehow , over the course of a decade , an abundantly flawed game found the correct mix of elements ( not all of which were Blizzard 's creations ) and evolved into a masterpiece .
Now , twelve years after StarCraft 's intial release , its sequel is about to be unleashed .
There are immense expectations .
Most popular games have a hardcore fan base , and StarCraft fans take this dedication to a whole new level .
Even before the announcement of StarCraft II , StarCraft fans devoted huge portions of their lives to this game .
Understandably , we have a stake in the depth , development , and quality of the sequel .
However , StarCraft II will be released under a radically different set of circumstances than its predecessor .

Bashiok on the D3 Forums May 28th
This should probably be in the SC2 forums , but ... eh... here ya go !
Me shouting down your hyperbole once again .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
1 ) No LAN Support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Correct .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
2 ) No chat rooms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There will be chat rooms , they 're just not making launch .
Probably .
[ ed ]
So Frank was out for interviews in EU it seems (? ) and said something to the effect of " no chat rooms " but there would be chat for guilds and groups .
Which is more or less what was said before .
That it would be more about getting people into focused discussions instead of just having free for all chat systems .
In any case , I do n't know a lot about it .
Personally , chat rooms are soooooo 2002 .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
3 ) Paid DLC
It seems that maps and " expansion packs that are really part of the base game " are bumping the total price of SC2 to over $ 100 quite easily .
I have no plans to buy the game , but I find that a little alarming .
I hate to imagine how much D3 will cost in total - combined with the next factor :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alarming !
How much was Lord of Destruction ?
Expansion packs are sold for skrilla .
If , however , you want to argue that StarCraft 2 : Wings of Liberty is not a full sized and full - featured stand - alone release then ... well you 're not going to buy it anyway so ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
4 ) Pay - to - play
It has turned out that SC2 is indeed Pay - to - Play , despite all the promises we 've had otherwise , in regions outside of the US .
For example , Russian and South American players must subscribe to battle .
net and get a set amount of " game hours " that expire and need to be renewed .
Will such a system exist for D3 ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We tailor our business models for each country / region based on many factors .
Here in the US I can walk into a game store , buy a boxed product for about $ 60 , take it home , and I generally expect that to include free multiplayer ( unless I know it 's a subscription MMO or whatever ) .
That 's not something you can do in all other countries , most do n't have game stores , and so it 's not something they generally work with .
The exact same tailoring has been used for World of Warcraft .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
5 ) Region Locking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here 's the last thing that was said on region locking ( this was Sigaty btw ) :
Q : How far in the ' long term ' are those plans which allow for swapping to U.S. servers on an E.U. account - or a global account ?
A : Jumping to the region you want is definitely in the long term plan for Battle .net , although we do have some concerns about communicating properly to the player what 's happening if they choose this because it WILL affect the latency of the game .
As far as a date on when , I do n't have one yet .
There are a number of features that we want to make sure get out their first and jumping to different servers is lower on the priority list at the moment .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
6 ) Statistical Balance Design
The developers for SC2 have been strictly using a statistical approach to balancing their game , ignoring player feedback and instead using only data harvested from the beta gameplay to balance their units .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hahaha .
You 're hilarious .
We all play .
All the designers and developers play .
Some on semi- pro levels .
We 're in contact with many pro players , our friends and family that are playing , we read the forums , we read fansites , etc. etc .
What I see as the main issue here is that a lot of the time people want balance changes based on flavor of the minute strategies without understanding that it 's constantly evolving .
So much so that from day to day the matchups could change dramatically .
Not seeing the balance changes you think should be made implemented is not the same as us ignoring the community and making arbitrary changes based on nothing but statistics .
They 're definitely a tool , but by no means are the sole or even biggest factor for balance changes .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
7 ) Privacy Issues
Like Facebook and Google , Blizzard has been suffering its own acute privacy debacle - email addresses have been leaked
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well now you 're just making stuff up .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
and SC2 requires questionable privacy details with an unsafe EULA - being able to share details like your Facebook account , and not allowing you to ' friend ' users unless you 're willing to show them your " Real Name " and Facebook , etc .
I hate to imagine this spilling over to D3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything stated here is vaguely incorrect to flat out wrong .
You can add people to your friends list without being a RealID friend with them .
The choice to ask for friend invites with Facebook friends is your choice .
I do n't even know what ' questionable privacy details with an unsafe EULA ' is supposed to mean , but it SOUNDS like I should be pretty scared now .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
8 ) Complete Lack of Innovation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well that 's just , like , your opinion , man .
Seriously though , game play first .
We 're not going to try all sorts of crazy things just to try to be different .
Our interest is in putting out a fun game , not one that exists to try out unproven mechanics , or push graphics / computing boundaries .
This has been a fairly regular trait amongst Blizzard games .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q u o t e :
9 ) The switch to voice chat is horrendous .
It leaves nothing to the imagination and makes you hate the people your playing with because of their ridiculous voices / accents ( they all sound the same ) and the breathing noises .
Voice chat is horrible .
I have n't played bnet voichat but every other voicechat i've ever played , counterstrike , xbx , ps3 is horrendous .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
???
You can chat in - game through text , same as always .
If you want though :
Menu ->
Options -> Voice -> Uncheck " Enable Voice Chat "
Then there 's no chance you 'll ever hear anyone .
But it 's a great tool for quick communication between teammates if you have a regular two 's partner .
Or whatever .
Oh Clan - Iraq ... you say things that are so Clan - Iraq .
This should probably be in the SC2 forums , but ... eh... here ya go !

Worcaw responds on German forum ( google translate ) May 31st
To my knowledge , our thoughts are behind all that we do not want any unguided chat rooms , the sink quickly into chaos .
There should be chat features for focused discussions , but advanced functionality to it will most likely not until the start creating the game .
...
We currently can not go into more detail and give definitive answers to specific questions such as these .
Everything else would degenerate into more speculation on my side , what really helps you not continue .
I can assure you , however , that it is not our intention to take you to the fun on Battle .
net by limiting social interaction .
We want you can always be with the community and your friends in contact .
This should , however , be regulated through lanes and putting all the players together in a chat room is not my opinion , this vision needs .

Xordiah responds to " angry " posts May 5th
I have been watching these threads quite a bit over the week - end and I have to agree more with some of the replies than with the OP of this thread .
Rage is not good .
Rage makes the forums look like a spam - fest and rage makes us want to ignore players or even ban them , because their tone just gets out of hand .
Rage makes players create 50 different threads on the same subject , whereas we prefer to have feedback bundled in one place .
What we do want to see and keep seeing from you is your feedback .
We want to know if you do not agree with something , this never changes .
What we do not want is players raging and just making unfounded accusations and crying doomsday because at the moment there is something missing that they feel is vital .
Please do take a step back before raging - is this something that can be fixed ?
Do you still enjoy the game itself ?
Please give your feedback and give us the benefit of the doubt that we do want your game experience to be fun .
Please always continue to give us your feedback , when you feel that there is something that you just can not live without .
Please always continue to do so without rage and in a civil manner .
...
Not on topic though .
If there is a hot topic on something , we definitely want players to post and to discuss it .
For sure , if there is a thread about a topic that reaches thousands of views and posts it catches our attention faster .
This is in fact a signal , that a lot of players are concerned about this topic - it catches the attention and it is very likely to be passed on in our feedback reports .
What I wanted to bring up though was , that while having a lot of players have a very strong opinion about something is a good thing , it is a very bad thing if they are not able to communicate this in a constructive manner .
Yes , post about things you do n't like but help us change them and tell us why you do n't like it or how you would like it .
This does not mean that everything can be implemented exactly the way you wish for and it does not mean that we will definitely be able to implement it for launch or even shortly after launch - but a lot of players giving us their point of view on a subject gives us the possibility of bringing this up in an informed manner and also giving us the possibility of taking some good quotes out of these threads .
If we have 50 threads on the same topic , 80 % of these are just one - liners saying that this is so terrible and we are a bad company ( btw .. 77,2 % of statistics are made up on the spot - thanks for the laugh Carighan ) , then it is hard to find the constructive ones that actually give us the information that we need and just makes us waste a lot of our time for moderation of forums that we could have used a lot better in compiling the feedback .
Just one thing I want to keep pointing out , it has been said before and I always keep saying it - we are on your side .
We want to make a game we enjoy and you enjoy .
There are timelines that need to be kept , there might be priorities that you do n't understand , but in the end , if there is something that is important to you be sure that we will be passing it on .
If you rage - you will lose your voice on these forums and you will be one less person fighting for what you want , if you post in a mannered way , we get a lot more out of you as a beta tester .
/ end wall of text !
....
Remember , Battle.net 2.0 is work in progress .
What a lot of players do n't read in the rage is the part where Frank Pearce is talking about Clan chat and Groups chat .
That is definitely being worked on .
If you check back to our last Twitter dev chat , there was the same question ( http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=23767157319&sid=3000):
" We do have plans for chat channels .
Specifically , we want to organize chat channels around users ' interests so you know what types of conversations you are going to get into when you join a channel .
This feature is not something that will be in for beta .
Currently we plan to do this feature in a patch after the game launches . "
...
Hehe .. we do ask for your opinion .
That is what this forum is for , that is what the beta test if for and we have pulled quite a few things out of these forums .
Sometimes getting involved in discussions does change the course of the discussion though .
Just now we just wanted to jump in , because it just turned too emotional and this usually leads to a lot of flaming and insulting which is something we do n't want to see on the forums .
...
You mean the thread where you were just talking about how you wo n't use it but it does n't hurt you either and you 're just mad because of the priorities ?
That feedback was passed on , but just please note that the Facebook integration in its current form , is a lot simpler to implement than most of you would believe .
....
By the way , something that might have come off wrong when explaining this .
We do n't want / need a wall of text from every single player .
If you just want to show your support , than posting just a small confirmation that this is what you feel as well is totally valid .
But please make sure that this is not posted in an insulting manner .
...
To be honest , the kittens distracted me tons while watching that video . ^^

Kapeselus responds to a Cross - realm thread June 1st
You copied the first sentence , while the rest of the paragraph answers your question for the most part .
StarCraft was made in the 28k - 56 k modem era and because the game is not that demanding , today ( many years later ) it is possible to play against American and ( some ) Korean players ( still not Chinese for example , because of latency ) .
Even in Warcraft III if you wanted to play against someone from the USA being in Europe it would mean ~ 250 ms and possibly some spikes .
In case of players from Asia or Australia for that matter it would be much higher and rarely stable .
How many times have you played on the Lordaeron ( US ) or Kalimdor ( Asia ) gateway in e.g. WC3 or any newer games than BW for that matter ?
What was the percentage of players you could play against without lag issues ?
Would you like to jump from game to game constantly and leave , discouraged by huge latency ?
Also think about your opponents - would n't it affect them as well ?
I personally just cannot see players not getting frustrated by lags given how many discussions we have had that 125 ms in - built latency is way too high .
I do n't even mention the matchmaking , because it would be unplayable and with proper filters it would match you against European players only anyway .
Please reconsider and do n't rage without thinking it over .
I am sure it will be possible in the future , but for now “ the technology 's just not there yet ” .

Kapeselus on Crossrealms June 3rd
When you read the Frank Pearce interview you will notice that he did n't answer the cross - realm question the way you try to picture it .
He was asked directly about a possibility of playing in different regions .
We do n't encourage it , it is not meant to be a " money grab " and it is only a possible workaround , as while we do n't want you to do it , we also are not going to prevent it from happening .
It 's not like Frank Pearce said " yes , we give you this amazing opportunity and we have a special promotion for you : when you buy copies for all 3 regions , you will get a 2 % discount " .
In our opinion it is not a good way of experiencing the game , but we are going to pass on your feedback .

Thanks for the collection of feedback and the constructive tone .
Always appreciated .

Zhydaris comments on Blizzards Commitment to Quality and BNET June 9th
The game still needs to be balanced in some areas ( and when these get balanced , new issues will arise of course , so it 'll be a looooong way before it 's perfect )
Absolutely .
The game is n't perfect , Battle .
Net is n't perfect .
But you know what ?
We 'll try to get there .
And yes , we definitely need you all to get there , with all the feedback you can provide .
We 'll do our best because we do n't want to let you down .
This is an amazing company and it keeps surprising me .
Several months ago I tried an unfinished version of one of the localized clients .
It was good , indeed .
But that was it .
Just good .
I recently tried a more polished version of the same client and all I could think was " ...
Wow , this is amazing " .
Just when I thought that the localized version was good , I was blown away by the attention to details that was put in that version .
And I 'm confident that the same thing will happen again and again , at release , at every content patch , and so on .
Just bear with us , because we definitely did n't forget our " Commit to quality " core value .

Bashiok on ETA for " comprehensive address " June 10th
SC2GDF
I think , just so we do n't fragment discussion across multiple forums in case the reset happens soon after .
Also while we obviously wanted to let everyone know before hand we were aware and working on something to address the major concerns , plans have kind of changed .
We came to the conclusion that just throwing out a huge post that goes over everything would really dilute the conversation and make it difficult to hold a dialogue on any one concern .
Everyone would just be replying to whatever issue they felt was most important , or detailing out a response to every thing in one reply .
( And then good luck to me to try to reply to any of it . )
So we 'll be taking a more natural forum response approach to keep all the various concerns focused so we can discuss each more easily .
Anyway .
Soon. ish .
Hopefully .

Bashiok further discusses chat channels June 15th
Do the community managers actually manage the community and tell the big man upstairs that the community is pissed or do they just maximize a browser with the forums on it every thirty minutes and delete / ban half the forum ?
More importantly , do they notice the same people they have banned so many times its not even funny anymore , keep coming back ?
Did Karune get hit by a bus ?
Has Xorbediah been destroyed by Kotick Private Security ?
Was Cavez put in a closet and told he can't come out until starcraft 2 ships ?
We 're painfully aware .
I wo n't make any excuses as to why forum communication took a dive , but it seems that we 're starting to get our heads above water again and hopefully we can get our activity in all of our forums back up ( SC2 is n't the only place that has suffered ) .
I do n't know .

This is a valid question , I 've seen this pop up on TL and other sites .
Not answering equals admitting Activision is making all the decisions for you .
Haha , is that what it means ?
Logical .
Yeah , that 's on our list of things we need to provide more info on .
HAI BASHIOK ~
BUT YOU SAID !
You know , instead of making a list of when and how to " deal with an information problem " , you could answer the damn question .
Think globally !
Heh .
Well , we have to make sure what we 're saying is what we want to say , there 's enough misinformation out there that guessing what the answer is probably is n't a good idea .
Also , we do have to create documents and make sure they 're approved by the designers / producers in charge , and then sent out for localization or at least so we 're prepared with the proper info in all languages .
Gone are the days of posting ad - hoc .
They will be missed .
" Can I say this ? " " No "
" But this ? " " No "
" What about this ? " " No . . "
" But . . "
" Just shut yer mouth and wait for your orders ! "
What ?
I 've been at Blizzard 6.5 years .
I 've been a community manager ... 4 , or so ?
Things work now like they 've worked since World of Warcraft got big and we became a large global company .
We have to coordinate communication .
It 's how it 's worked for many years .
Bashiok why was the main reason for no chat due to spam ?
Would n't the whole " One account one cd key " eliminate the possibility of people spamming ?
simply permaban and force them to buy a new one if they want to spam .
Who is banning them , and what is generating their pay to patrol / moderate millions of users ?
You could make it automated , I recall wc3 cd keys getting muted for countlessly flooding channels .
That 's one specific type of channel abuse that could maybe be automated for a second until someone figures out the requirements to avoid it , and then continues to do it anyway .
The idea that viewing occasional spam is so horrifying that all forms of chat channels ( including private channels which were the ones players actually used and were never spammed ) needed to be removed insults my intelligence and service to this country .
We 'll have private chat channels , they just are n't making it in for the release date .
In fact , the only thing I can think of that is more offensive is the idea that Blizzard cannot afford to pay someone $ 10 an hour to moderate the 10 - 15 public chat channels that Battle .
net 2.0 would theoretically have .
So 10 - 15 channels would serve the millions that will inevitably purchase the game ?
Those are some busy channels .
And one person would be able to moderate all those people by their lonesome ?
I 've worked in consumer product development , and it's been obvious from the beginning that the reason for not implementing chat channels is avoiding the ( substantial ) support cost associated with enforcing guidelines on their use .
Yes , WC3 and SC1 had chat channels , and yes , both were very popular games .
However , World of Warcraft has both grown Blizzard 's audience substantially , and has also set a particular standard of support that 's been based on having a continuous revenue stream from the game .
It 's quite likely that the choice with respect to chat channels came out of a realization that providing the level of support people expect today to deal with rule - breakers would require Blizzard to charge a monthly fee , and that the way it fell out was that not having chat channels was seen as preferable to charging a monthly fee to play the game , particularly since Blizzard 's competitors in the RTS market do not charge such fees .
Also , it 's quite possible that Blizzard 's leadership are unhappy , in retrospect , with the level of support they were able to provide WC3 and earlier games , given their WoW experience .
Now , in the long run it may be that Blizzard encounters such pushback on the chat channel issue that they basically have to eat the cost of that support .
If this happens , I 'm not entirely sure that the long - term result is what the community would want .
That long - term result might be that the NEXT game simply includes a fee to play to ensure that the game remains profitable to support .
Blizzard is a very successful company , but they 're already plowing the bulk of their profits back into new development and rapid growth .
Their resources are not unlimited , and saying " Try to tell us you can't afford this ! " does n't make them so .
Enlightened , thanks !
Bashiok , Teamliquid moderates thousands of posters .... for free .
Really ?
really .
These are the quotes that make me want to go lay down .
Teamliquid can get away with it because they 're supporting the community with no profit incentive , so people volunteer to help out .
If Blizzard tried that , here 's how the conversation would go :
Them : " Hey , would you like to be a chat moderator , responsible for strictly adhering to our set of requirements for banning people from chat channels , with no flexibility to make your own decisions about what 's acceptable ? "
Me : " How much does it pay ? "
Them : " How about $ 0 / hr , with time and a half for overtime ? "
Me : " No . "

Bashiok says that cross realm play will be avalible " within the first few months of Starcraft II 's release " June 16th
Getting people online , playing and interacting is obviously the overall goal for the Battle .
net platform , and that includes allowing people to play across regional boundaries as they have in the past .
Unfortunately , there are a multitude of challenges we have to overcome due to the unique regional account and billing options that did n't exist in the past .
But those hurdles are n't insurmountable , and we are looking into solutions that will allow interested players to obtain access to other regional versions without having to buy another full copy of the game .
Those solutions are something we 're currently planning to have available through Battle .
net Account Management within the first few months of StarCraft II 's release .
Before that solution is implemented though , you 're correct in that you 'd need to purchase a US copy of the game on launch day to play in the US region .

Kapeselus and Zhydaris respond to Core Issues June 17th
Player - based " core " issues , in no certain order :
1 . Are chat channels predicted to be coming sooner than later ?
1.5 . Will we have private channels much like the B.net 1 structure , even without the presence of public default channels ?
2 . Is LAN play restricted solely to tournaments , given the information provided about " Premium " edition ?
2.5 . Will LAN see a future in retail versions of SC2 ?
3a . Will identifiers return ?
3a.5 .
Will there be a search structure to find friends if they do ?
3b . Will the final naming system allow for non-unique names ?
3b.5 .
If names are unique , will we be allowed more characters / numerals / symbols ?
I 'll pause with that .
There will definitely be " chat channels " coming in one of the patches after the release .
The system will be based around groups , where you will be able to join public channels that are based around your interests , which can be virtually anything .
Also the system will include private chat channels ( in plans for release in the first few months after the release ) , where you will be able to meet with your friends .
As for identifiers they are returning for the second phase of the beta .
The previous system did not work as intended to some degree and based on feedback received the developers decided to implement a variation of this , which is going to attach character codes .
These will be three digit numbers added to your nickname and they will be seen in the UI screens .
Thanks to this you will be able to add friends manually , just like previously with identifiers .
On top of that you can still add friends using all other methods ( using the score screen or RealID ) .
I 'll pause with that .

Thanks for putting out some of the flames , to bad 90 % of the posters who want to " know " will miss this post .

We 'll just post the answer again and again , we 're kinda used to it - Zhydaris
Ahem , I think they where asking Bashiok ... / sarcasm
Oh ...
You did n't know we were all Bashiok ?
Or rather Bashiok is all of us ?
Erm ... I mean Bashiok is one person posting with all those accounts ?
Maybe all those accounts are one Bashiok ?
Which would imply that one account or all accounts posess all the Bashioks .
Just noticed the post in the other thread .
I hope I / he / we / they wo n't mind .
- Kapeselus
The post is much appreciated .
Can you provide an additional piece of info on the 3 - digit identifiers : is the identifier number selected by the player , or automatically assigned ?
i.e. I 'm the first to create the name CheezDip so I am CheezDip.001 ?
The number will be automatically generated .
Please keep in mind that you wo n't be able to see this code everywhere , but only on certain screens .
( i.e. it wo n't get in the way and it wo n't ruin the " look " of your nickname , do n't worry ! )
- Zhydaris
What is the point with identifiers ?
Just let us use numbers and symbols like in war3 and sc1 so we can have unique names .
Do you really want people to be called ESPORTS001 ESPORTS002 ESPORTS003 ESPORTS004 ESPORTS005 and so on ?
Noone wants the identifiers !
Please listen to the community .
Why should you pick " esports " as a nickname exactly ?
Just pick the nickname that you prefer .
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=128032
This is why .
Just so you know why you have 999 players named " Esports " at the next beta reset .
Well , I 'll be honest : I can't actually see the usefulness of such initiative and I do n't see how it even fits this discussion .
These people are naming themselves " ESPORTS " to protest against :
- Lack of Chat Channels
... and we just announced that Chat Channels are going to be in the game a few months after release .
- No Cross-region play
... and we just announced that cross-region play is definitely in our plans .
- No Unique ID
...
And we just announced that every combination of nickname +
3 digit code will be unique and you will be able to add friends by using this combination .
- You need to give out your email address
...
Which is not the case anymore , as adding Nickname.007 will be enough .
I can understand the reasons behind such initiative , but I do n't think that they chose the best method to explain their concerns , they will just end up sharing the same nickname with a different 3 digit code .
I do n't see how this will contribute to voice their concerns , let alone solve them .
We listen to the community , we do n't listen to ... flocks of nicknames .
We need useful feedback , opinions , suggestions , concerns , questions and so on , ending up with hundreds of people sharing part of their identifier ( aka only the nickname part ) is not going to help at all .
You all are more than welcome to post in these forums and share your concerns , I believe that we just addressed the main concerns that were brought up on these boards and we would like your feedback based on what we disclosed today .
This is the only way we 're going to make Battle .
net 2.0 better .

all of this sounds very excellent Mr. Blue , but what about custom game interface ?
there is definitely a problem with the " popularity " system as well as having unique names for custom games and even the lobbies themselves are lacking substance ...
Any clarification on this issue Mr. Blue ?
We do n't have any update to share regarding this topic at the moment .
As we move closer to Phase Two / Release we will have more information about this .

Well then Mr. Blue can you at least say something is going to change or still going to stay the same : )

( CNN ) --
To most people , the literary debate over who wrote the works of William Shakespeare would appear to be much ado about nothing .
After all , the play 's the thing , right ?
What does it matter who wrote it ?
To James Shapiro , however , it matters a great deal .
The Columbia University professor and Shakespeare scholar spent 15 years working on his 2005 book , " A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare : 1599 . "
The work exhaustively details a key year in the Bard 's career , when he wrote " Henry V " and " Julius Caesar " and became the man thought of as history 's greatest English - language dramatist .
And yet he could n't convince the doubters , who believe that the name " William Shakespeare " is a front for the real author .
" I thought I did a damned good job showing that it could only have been Shakespeare who wrote the plays we attributed to him , " he said .
" And I naively thought , that will slow people down who think that Shakespeare did n't write Shakespeare .
And they kind of stepped around it .
" And I thought , I have to stop and really address this . "
The result is Shapiro 's new book , " Contested Will . "
In it , Shapiro chronicles the history of the anti-Stratfordian movement , which has believed that any number of people -- the essayist Francis Bacon , the nobleman the Earl of Oxford , Walter Raleigh , Christopher Marlowe -- wrote the plays ascribed to the glovemaker 's son from Stratford - upon - Avon , born 446 years ago .
It 's a theory that has attracted some famous minds -- including Mark Twain and Sigmund Freud -- and will soon be coming to the screen as Roland ( " 2012 " )
Emmerich 's latest film , " Anonymous . "
To the anti-Stratfordians , Shakespeare -- who left behind , by modern standards , relatively little in the way of personal records -- was too unworldly , too unromantic ( in his will , he famously left his widow his " second best bed " ) , too ordinary to have written some of the greatest plays and poems known to man .
It 's a theory Shapiro roundly rejects .
He says that modern audiences are reading Shakespeare through modern sensibilities , believing that the author 's work is autobiographical -- which was not the case in Shakespeare 's day .
" We read today anachronistically -- we expect to find things in books that were written 400 years ago that people writing 400 years ago would not have put in those books , " he says .
" But the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries were not [ autobiographical ] .
...
They made stuff up based on stories they read . "
The distinction is important , he adds .
" Part of the authorship question is about trying to find whose life you can line up with the life of the author of the plays .
Oxfordians will say , hey , our guy had three daughters and was captured by pirates .
Your guy had two daughters and was never captured by pirates .
Therefore , our guy has a greater likelihood to have written the plays .
And that way madness lies , because then you end up with 50 or 60 contenders . "
Naturally , Oxfordians disagree .
Shapiro's book has been wounded in its Amazon rankings by reviewers who do n't believe Shapiro 's thesis and criticized by anti-Stratfordian websites .
" I do think there is an authorship question , " says Michael Egan , a retired English professor who edits the Oxfordian , the journal of the Shakespeare Oxford Society .
Though he considers himself a Stratfordian , he says he's " open- minded " about the issue and criticizes Shapiro for some of the arguments in " Contested Will . "
" The case for Oxford derives from the fact that almost everything we know about Shakespeare of Stratford does n't seem connectible to the author of the plays , " he says .
" It 's that gap between what we could infer about the author , and what we know about Shakespeare of Stratford , which has raised the questions . "
It 's a battle that has , as Shapiro records , been filled with partisan rhetoric and bad blood since it began a little more than 200 years ago .
Twain , for example , wrote a short book on the subject ; his contemporary , Henry James , also questioned Shakespeare 's authorship .
Others have created elaborate codes or sought biographical parallels .
The Stratfordians stand by their proof ; the anti-Stratfordians fill in the gaps .
In that respect , the battle over Shakespeare has much in common with other disputes .
Kathy Olmsted , a history professor at the University of California - Davis and the author of " Real Enemies : Conspiracy Theories and American Democracy , " observes that , in American history , conspiracy theories have often arisen from a perceived lack of information .
" When people do n't have that information or can't get it , they like to sort of speculate on what the real story is , " she says .
" People see those blank spots and they want to fill them in . "
And in for a penny , in for a pound , she adds : " It becomes like a religion .
People who believe in these theories really get invested in them , and they do n't want to account for evidence that does n't fit their thesis . "
Which is why , for Shapiro , it 's so important to establish that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare .
" So much is at stake in Shakespeare .
In the great game of capture the literary flag , this is it , " he says .
" If you can say something about Shakespeare , you can say something about how English literature and literature in general works . "
He 's particularly leery about Emmerich 's film , which is in production and stars Vanessa Redgrave , Rhys Ifans and Derek Jacobi -- the latter a noted Shakespeare doubter .
" It 's going to be a disaster movie for people who teach Shakespeare , " he says .
" In the great rock - paper - scissor of movie and book , movie beats book . "
Still , he 's hopeful that " Contested Will " will have an impact .
" You can't win that battle .
But I can wage it , at any rate . "
Nevertheless , he 's ready to put the Baconians , Oxfordians , Marlovians and other anti-Stratfordians behind him .
" I can't wait to get back to Shakespeare and writing a book .
I actually get smarter wrestling with Shakespeare 's words -- it 's very thrilling , " he says .
" But spending five years thinking about people 's fantasies did not make me smarter at all .
...
Was it worth it ?
Probably .
As long as the next book goes well . "
Earlier today , a company known as Blink Media announced that it is working on a project known as “ Game Nation ” .

BOSTON — Nashira Muniz was sending a text message on her cellphone the other day when the phone rang .
“ I just texted you ! ” she said to the caller .
Nothing unusual about that , except Ms. Muniz , 25 , was deep underground , riding the subway .
She then checked on her child at home , made a banking transaction , received a few Facebook notices and arranged to meet another friend — all from the subterranean depths .
Last month , Boston completed installation of cellphone service — at least for T - Mobile subscribers — along all 11 miles of the Orange line , the first of its four subway lines to have end - to - end coverage .
But the service has highlighted a problem , and it is not the expected one of fellow passengers yakking loudly .
The bigger problem , transit officials said , is cellphone theft , a growing concern throughout the country .
Thefts occur even in subway systems that do not have cellular coverage because passengers display their phones as they read or listen to music and hope to catch the occasional signal that leaks through a street grate or when the train goes above ground .

But for Jordan Romero , it is unfolding in an attempt to become the youngest person to reach the summit of Mount Everest .
On Saturday he departed base camp with his father , Paul Romero , and Paul ’s companion and professional adventure racing teammate , Karen Lundgren .
“ This was not my idea ; he ’s provided the inspiration and motivation to keep it going , ” Paul Romero wrote recently in an e-mail message from base camp .
“ Jordan is taking us on the Seven Summits quest and we are merely facilitating his wishes . ”
Jordan ’s attempt to climb the highest mountains in all seven continents , and particularly his attempt of Everest during the narrow window of the spring climbing season , has stimulated a rousing dialogue in the climbing community and beyond .
How young is too young , and does a 13 - year - old have the physical and emotional maturity to take on this extreme altitude endeavor ?
And yet , Team Jordan , from Big Bear , Calif. , has already climbed five of the Seven Summits over the last three years , starting with Kilimanjaro ( 19,340 ) in Africa , Elbrus ( 18,510 ) in Europe and Kosciusko ( 7,310 ) in Australia .
If Jordan , who is 5 feet 10 inches and 160 pounds , crests Everest ( 29,035 feet ) , climbing Vinson Massif ( 16,067 ) in Antarctica would complete an achievement accomplished by about 200 people .
What is " Orion 's Arm " you might ask ?
That is an excellent question , and in a nutshell here is your answer :
Orion 's Arm is :
The next step in the evolution of science - fiction
A collective hard science fiction world building endeavor
A space opera
A communal background for science fiction stories
A universe ready to be brought to life through illustration
A forum for cutting edge science
A roleplaying setting
A transhumanist projection of what the future might look like
A bunch of semi- sane sentients having fun together
Why are we here ?
The answer to that question can be found in our Statement of Purpose :
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE :
Our purpose is to inspire writers , artists and thinkers .
To create a vision of the future that is plausible at every level , internally consistent and abides by the accepted facts and theories in the physical , biological , and social sciences .
We embrace speculative ideas like Drexlerian assemblers , mind uploading , posthuman intelligence , magnetic monopoles , wormholes and the technologies , and developments that will make all this possible .
To quote Arthur C. Clarke 's Second Law :
The only way to explore the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible .
Our task is to create an ever evolving universe that is interesting , inspiring and provocative - to theorize on a future that may , or may not , come to be .
In order to meet this goal we have established certain ground rules :
Matter cannot travel faster than light
Matter and energy are conserved
No evolved humanoid aliens have been discovered
Technology will change the nature of social issues
A logical explanation for even the most fantastic elements within the setting must be provided .
Space is vast - expect the same challenges to have many different solutions , or as we say at Orion 's Arm - Diversity !
Diversity !
Diversity !
Orion 's
Arm is a work in progress , a space opera setting like no other .
It spans the next ten thousand years of galactic history , from the near future interplanetary colonization to the far future where the galaxy is ruled by vast ascended intelligences .
It incorporates hard science , and the " soft " or social sciences , as well as the mythological , archetypal themes , as the gods of the collective psyche incarnate in unforeseen new forms .
The Orion 's Arm project ( OA for short ) is a big place with more than a decade of history , and hundreds of contributors .
Most likely you will encounter new concepts and terminology throughout the site .
We have provided links on this page to a number of helpful resources to get you acquainted with all of them .
The Illustrated Backstory and Orion 's Arm Primer are specially written to provide an introduction to the setting .
You may also want to peruse the FAQ pages for answers to various commonly ( and not so commonly ) asked questions .
There is of course the Encyclopaedia Galactica , where you can find anything in the Orion 's Arm universe .
Enjoy the stories , art and ideas you find here , and should you find during your journey that something is missing , or you have something to contribute , please join us at one of our many discussion groups .
When that time comes we highly recommend going over the How to Contribute and Netiquette pages .
Like all good art , this project is ever growing , and will therefore never be complete .
We invite you to join us on this journey of imagination ; after all it looks like we 've barely gotten started , and there are still many worlds left to explore .
Above all else we would like to ask you to remember to have fun while you 're here .

JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - A major earthquake of 7.8 magnitude struck off the coast of Aceh on the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday , but there were no immediate reports of a tsunami or casualties .
A Reuters photographer on Simeulue island , south of Aceh , said there was panic and electricity was cut off after the quake .
Metro TV reported that people rushed to higher ground in some areas .
The quake was centered 204 km ( 127 miles ) west - northwest of the coastal town of Sibolga and was at a depth of 46 km ( 28.6 miles ) , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
It had initially reported the quake ’s magnitude at 7.6 .
The Reuters witness said there were at least three aftershocks .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no threat of a destructive widespread tsunami .
However , it added : “ There is the possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts ” no more than 100 km ( 62 miles ) from the epicenter of the quake .
In December 2004 , a magnitude 9.15 quake off the coast of Sumatra ’s Aceh province triggered an Indian Ocean tsunami that killed about 226,000 people in Indonesia , Sri Lanka , India , Thailand and nine other countries .
The Law Enforcement Technology Advancement Centre ( LETAC ) has developed SID version 6.7 : a Sadistic , Intelligent , and Dangerous virtual reality entity which is synthesized from the personalities of more than 150 serial killers .
LETAC would like to train police officers by putting them in VR with SID , but they must prove the concept by using prisoners as test subjects .
One such prisoner is ex-cop Parker Barnes .

Body lay under sofa for 10 years in shared Bristol flat
Alan Derrick was worried about being evicted A body lay undiscovered under a sofa in a sheltered flat in Bristol for nearly 10 years , an inquest has heard .
The dead man , Dennis Pring , had been living with city council tenant Alan Derrick , who has learning difficulties .
The inquest heard Mr Derrick did not want to tell the authorities that Mr Pring , 73 , had died because he was worried he would be evicted .
The coroner recorded an open verdict into Mr Pring 's death at the hearing in Flax Bourton , near Bristol .
Mr Pring is believed to have died at some point between April and June 1998 .
The inquest heard that he had been living in the flat unofficially .
Mr Derrick , the dead man 's friend and drinking partner , had invited him to stay there because he had nowhere else to go .
But when he died suddenly , Mr Derrick panicked and worried that he might be evicted .
A year after the death , a mobile council warden was called to inspect the flat after complaints of a terrible smell .
Neighbours complained about the smell from the flat Sandra Wedlock told the court that she had walked by an overturned sofa at the property in the Bedminster area of the city without noticing the body underneath it .
She put the source of the smell that neighbours had complained about down to an overflowing toilet and no further action was taken by the council .
Mr Pring 's skeleton was finally discovered by council cleaning staff in 2008 after Mr Derrick moved out of the property , the inquest heard .
No criminal charges were brought against Mr Derrick .
Residents groups said the case proves there is a need for more live - in wardens to supervise sheltered accommodation .
Jon House , Bristol City Council 's deputy chief executive , expressed his condolences and ' apologised unreservedly ' to Mr Pring 's family and the neighbours for the distress they suffered .
New protocols have been put in place to support vulnerable people , and large numbers of our staff have been trained accordingly
Jon House , Bristol City Council
" I want to acknowledge that a more active intervention nine or 10 years ago , and a healthier dose of common sense , might have stopped Mr Pring lying undiscovered , " he said .
" Although , as was acknowledged in court , his body was actively concealed by the tenant .
" What I think is most important now is that we demonstrate that we have long since learned from this experience .
" New protocols have been put in place to support vulnerable people , and large numbers of our staff have been trained accordingly .
" Although we 'll continue to respect people 's right to the quiet enjoyment of their home , where they are vulnerable and cannot cope ( and in some cases cause a nuisance or health hazard to their neighbours ) , we will intervene as necessary to stop things spiralling out of control . "

There was no familiar thump on Toronto front porches and or in apartment building lobbies this spring .
No pile of thick books by the building ’s mailboxes .
No youngsters thumbing through to find their families ’ names .
The telephone book white pages — a household icon started in 1879 that not only enabled Torontonians to find each other , but also propped open doors , kindled fires and boosted small fry — was not delivered .
“ Geez , I did n’t even notice , ” said Heather Missouri , a customs consultant .
There you have it .
Not many did .
The publisher got 1,000 requests for the absent 2010 directory — that ’s out of more than a million households that would have received it .
While once upon a time newspapers heralded the book ’s annual arrival , marvelling at its expanding girth , a measure of a city ’s growth and wealth , today Toronto ’s home telephone book may well be out of service , as passé as rotary dial .
The Yellow Pages Group , Canada ’s leading provider of print and online directories , has asked the Canadian Radio - television Telecommunications Commission to no longer require mass distribution of the residential listings phone book in seven big cities , including Toronto .
In those cities , home and business listings are in separate directories .
The phone book for businesses , the yellow pages , is still slated for door - to - door delivery .
The requested change would save 3,500 metric tons of paper every year , says Annie Marsolais , communications director for Yellow Pages Group .
The CRTC is still reviewing the matter .
More consumers are letting their fingers do the scrolling , searching online for home phone numbers or storing them on their cellphones , she explains .
Some cellphone users no longer bother with a land line and are n’t listed in any directory .
“ Our industry is evolving and we have to adapt , ” says Marsolais .
About two to five per cent of the normal run of home phone books will be printed .
But those who want them need to request them .
Consumers can ask for the 2010 ones by calling 1-800-268-5637 or by visiting ypg.com / delivery .
More than 35,000 printed copies are presently in storage .
This is a long - distance trend .
Earlier in May , Verizon , the largest phone company in New York State , also asked regulators for permission to end mass delivery .
Such approval has already been granted to distributors in four states .
Starting in 2006 , Marsolais points out , delivery went from yearly to every other year , with little consumer outcry .
Less than 2 per cent of customers requested a directory in the off years .
Sitting in a downtown food court with a BlackBerry and an Internet tablet in front of him , Jarek Piorkowski , 22 , looks momentarily baffled when asked about his use of the telephone book .
“ The last time was maybe four or five years ago , ” he says .
“ All that printed stuff just goes to waste .
People just chuck it into recycling . ”
Not so fast .
Others not only use the phone book , they ’re actually nostalgic about it .
“ Who does n’t look up their name ? ” laughs Christine Elias , a communications director at the University of Toronto .
“ One of my happiest moments was when I got my first apartment and there in the phone book was my name in print . ”
The last delivered Toronto white pages , 2008 - 2010 , weighed in with 1,413 pages of residential listings .
Toronto ’s first in 1879 , a mere three years after the invention of the telephone , had 56 business and residential names and addresses , including George Brown and Oliver Mowat , on six pages .
With a keen eye for self - promotion , Bingham & Taylor , “ fine printers , 11 Leader Lane , ” issued the directory with large ads on each page .
The telephone directory of 1904 , the oldest hard copy at the Toronto Reference Library , had grown to 276 pages with 11,627 home and business listings .
Back then , a name in the phone book was a tangible sign of prestige , of being wealthy enough to afford a telephone .
A breezy , “ Call me — I ’m in the book ” had a certain ring to it .
“ There was a bit of class snobbery , ” says Alan Middleton , marketing professor at York University ’s Schulich School of Business .
“ ‘ Oh , they ’re not listed .
They must not have a phone . ’
The unwashed immigrants did n’t have phones . ”
The new phone book was eagerly awaited each year .
In 1911 , the Daily Star ran a Saturday front page story announcing the new Adelaide exchange and the Monday distribution of the up - to - date books “ with the greatest possible speed . ”

The story merited front - page space next to photos of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Sir Frederick Borden in London and a story about the upcoming coronation of King George V , “ the most splendid pageant on which the modern world has looked . ”
The phone book was that important ?
“ Think of it as the start of the information age , ” explains Middleton .
“ The phone directory was an early database that allowed you to access people . ”
The social media of its time .
“ We ’ve always been fascinated with technology that enables us to connect with people , ” he says .
The thickness of the phone book mirrored the city ’s growth and prosperity , or lack thereof .
In 1935 , during the Depression , the Daily Star wrote on page 1 that 3,000 more names would be in the new phone directory , “ carrying the torch for the return of good times . ”
By 1950 , as the postwar economy recovered , the directory was a hefty 1,721 pages .
Star readers were advised to get in training before the new book arrived .
Through the years , the phone book , of course , had its practical uses , door jam , table leg support , even toilet paper .
Some people stashed birth certificates , bank notes , leases in its many pages .
“ Some books look like safety deposit boxes when they reach us , ” said a phone company manager in 1938 .
Old books were collected and given to the Veterans Association , which sold the paper .
Today old phone books are recycled into coffee trays , egg cartons , cereal boxes .
Again , practical uses .
But the Star found little sympathy for ye ole phone book .
“ Look , we loved the Eaton ’s catalogue but that ’s gone , ” says Middleton .
“ I ’m afraid certain icons do disappear .
They become outdated . ”
Even Elias , who enjoyed seeing her name in tiny print , admits that she has at times bypassed a phone book pile in her condo building lobby without bothering to take one .
“ It seemed like a pain to lug it upstairs , ” she says .
“ But I did feel sad . ”

VENICE , Louisiana -- BP 's chairman defended his company 's safety record and said Sunday that " a failed piece of equipment " was to blame for a massive oil spill along the Gulf Coast , where President Barack Obama was headed for a firsthand update on the slick creeping toward American shores .
BP PLC chairman Lamar McKay told ABC's " This Week " that he can't say when the well a mile ( 1.6 kilometers ) beneath the sea might be plugged .
But he said he believes a dome that could be placed over the well is expected to be deployed in six to eight days .
The dome has been made and workers are finishing the plan to get it deployed , McKay said .
He said BP officials are still working to activate a " blowout preventer " mechanism meant to seal off the geyser of oil .
" And as you can imagine , this is like doing open - heart surgery at 5,000 feet ( 1,500 meters ) , with -- in the dark , with robot - controlled submarines , " McKay said .
BP spokesman Bill Salvin said McKay was talking about the blowout preventer as the failed equipment that caused the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 people .
The blowout preventer typically activates after a blast or other event to cut off any oil that may spill .
The cause of the blast remains undetermined , and Salvin said " we 're not ruling anything out . "
Crews have had little success stemming the flow from the ruptured well on the sea floor off Louisiana or removing oil from the surface by skimming it , burning it or dispersing it with chemicals .
The churning slick of dense , rust - colored oil is now roughly the size of Puerto Rico .
Adding to the gloomy outlook were warnings from experts that an uncontrolled gusher could create a nightmare scenario if the Gulf Stream current carries it toward the Atlantic .
Long tendrils of oil sheen made their way into South Pass , a major channel through the salt marshes of Louisiana 's southeastern bootheel that is a breeding ground for crab , oysters , shrimp , redfish and other seafood .
Venice charter boat captain Bob Kenney lamented that there was no boom in the water to corral the oil , and said BP was " pretty much over their head in the deep water . "
" If they were n't , they would have cut the oil off by now , " he said .
" It 's like a slow version of Katrina , " he added .
" My kids will be talking about the effect of this when they 're my age . "
About a half - dozen fishing vessels sailed Sunday morning through the marshes of coastal St. Bernard Parish in eastern Louisiana , headed for the Biloxi Wildlife Management area .
The oyster and shrimp boats , laden with boom , hoped to seal off inlets , bayous and bays .
There is growing criticism that the government and oil company BP PLC should have done more to stave off the disaster , which cast a pall over the region 's economy and fragile environment .
Moving to blunt criticism that the Obama administration has been slow in reacting to the largest U.S. crude oil spill in decades , the White House dispatched two Cabinet members to make the rounds on the Sunday television talk shows .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on " Fox News Sunday " that the government has taken an " all hands on deck " approach to the spill since the BP oil well ruptured .
Napolitano said that as BP officials realized more oil was spewing than first thought , the government has coordinated federal , state and local resources with the oil company 's response .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told NBC's " Meet the Press " that it could take three months before workers attain what he calls the " ultimate solution " to stopping the leak -- drilling a relief well more than 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) below the ocean floor .
However , as the spill surged toward disastrous proportions , critical questions lingered :
Who created the conditions that caused the gusher ?
Did BP and the government react robustly enough in its early days ?
And , most important , how can it be stopped before the damage gets worse ?
The Coast Guard and BP have said it 's nearly impossible to know exactly how much oil has gushed since the blast , though it has been roughly estimated the well was spewing at least 200,000 gallons ( 757,000 liters ) a day .
Even at that rate , the spill should eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history in a matter of weeks .
But a growing number of experts warned that the situation may already be much worse .
The oil slick over the water 's surface appeared to triple in size over the past two days , which could indicate an increase in the rate oil is pouring from the well , according to one analysis of images collected from satellites and reviewed by the University of Miami .
While it's hard to judge the volume of oil by satellite because of depth , images do indicate growth , experts said .
" The spill and the spreading is getting so much faster and expanding much quicker than they estimated , " said Hans Graber , executive director of the university 's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing .
In an exploration plan and environmental impact analysis filed with the federal government in February 2009 , BP said it had the capability to handle a " worst - case scenario " at the site , which the document described as a leak of 162,000 barrels per day from an uncontrolled blowout -- 6.8 million gallons ( 26 million liters ) each day .
Oil industry experts and officials are reluctant to describe what , exactly , a worst - case scenario would look like .
But if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and carries it to the beaches of Florida -- and potentially loops around the state 's southern tip and up the eastern seaboard -- several experts said it stands to be an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions .
" It will be on the East Coast of Florida in almost no time , " Graber said .
" I do n't think we can prevent that .
It 's more of a question of when rather than if . "
The concerns are both environmental and economic .
The fishing industry is worried marine life will die -- and that no one will want to buy products from contaminated water anyway .
Tourism officials are worried vacationers wo n't want to visit oil - tainted beaches .
And environmentalists are worried about how the oil will affect the countless birds , coral and mammals in and near the Gulf .
" We know they are out there , " said Meghan Calhoun , a spokeswoman from the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans .
" Unfortunately , the weather has been too bad for the Coast Guard and NOAA to get out there and look for animals for us . "
Fishermen and boaters want to help but have been hampered by high winds and rough waves that render oil - catching booms largely ineffective .
Some coastal Louisiana residents complained that BP was hampering mitigation efforts .
" No , I 'm not happy with the protection , but I 'm sure the oil company is saving money , " said 57 - year - old Raymond Schmitt , in Venice preparing his boat to take a French television crew on a tour .
And the oil on the surface is just part of the problem .
Louisiana State University professor Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills , worries about a total collapse of the pipe inserted into the well .
If that happens , there would be no warning and the resulting gusher could be even more devastating .
" When these things go , they go KABOOM , " he said .
" If this thing does collapse , we 've got a big , big blow . "
BP has not said how much oil is beneath the seabed Deepwater Horizon was tapping .
A company official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the volume of reserves , confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels .
Obama has halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster .
As if to cut off mounting criticism , on Saturday White House spokesman Robert Gibbs posted a blog entitled " The Response to the Oil Spill , " laying out the administration 's day - by - day response since the explosion , using words like " immediately " and " quickly , " and emphasizing that Obama " early on " directed responding agencies to devote every resource to the incident and determining its cause .

The reform bill is a joke .
It reforms nothing , it fixes nothing , and it will not prevent the next much bigger crash from happening ( with or without Goldman 's Supplemental Lack of Liquidity Provider assistance ) - just two items that need to be pointed out : $ 6 + trillion in GSE debt - untouched , $ 400 trillion in IR swaps : untouched .
This is reform ?
However , if you care enough to know what a bribed and corrupt Congress and Senate have " reformed " here is a useful cheat sheet courtesy of the New York Times .
Also , here is a legal and restructuring perspective on the reform , with a focus on Bill 3217 , targetting " too big to fail " courtesy of former " too big to fail " Goldman Sachs managing director and current Kirkland and Ellis partner Jamie Sprayregen , via The Deal .
Failing to be Too Big To Fail
Congress is considering a wide - ranging package of financial industry reforms intended to preclude any future taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street .
A key component of this legislation , Senate bill 3217 , targets the " too big to fail " dilemma ; i.e. , that some financial companies are so large and integral to the economy that a threat of their imminent demise effectively requires the federal government to commit or spend massive amounts of public funding toward emergency recapitalization ( e.g. , Bear , Stearns & Co. ; American International Group Inc. ; Citigroup Inc. ) -- or suffer the destabilizing systemic consequences of a free - fall bankruptcy filing ( e.g. , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ) .
Congress ' solution is to provide federal regulators with the discretion to " liquidate financial companies that pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the United States in a manner that mitigates such risk and minimizes moral hazard . "
Whether this so - called orderly liquidation authority -- notably , the bill does not also include new provisions for " orderly reorganization authority " -- employs the most effective possible tools to achieve its stated goals has been and will continue to be the focus of intense debate .
Assuming Congress passes ( and President Obama signs ) the liquidation powers of S. 3217 in their present form , which appears likely , certain distressed financial firms could find themselves in very foreign territory : forced to wind down in proceedings initiated and administered by the U.S. government , entirely outside the established auspices of a bankruptcy court applying the Bankruptcy Code .
Which financial companies are " covered " ?
The threshold issue , of course , is defining which firms are subject to this alternate liquidation regime .
The touchstone concept of S. 3217 is " covered financial companies , " which means U.S. - incorporated bank holding companies , nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors , any company predominantly engaged in activities the Fed has determined are financial in nature or the subsidiaries of any of these ( but not including insured depository institutions ) for which the Treasury secretary ( in consultation with the president ) has made a number of specific determinations .
These include :
The financial company is in default or danger of default on its obligations , with no viable private sector remedy , and its failure and resolution under otherwise applicable state or federal law ( namely , the U.S. Bankruptcy Code ) would have " serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States " -- whereas liquidation under S. 3217 would avoid or mitigate detrimental impact on " the financial system , the cost to the general fund of the U.S.
Treasury and the potential to increase excessive risk - taking on the part of creditors , counterparties , and shareholders in the financial company . "
In other words , unlike conventional bankruptcies , which may be commenced ( voluntarily or involuntarily ) by a relatively limited universe of parties in interest ( a debtor and its creditors ) for the relatively limited purpose of enforcing their respective rights , liquidations under S. 3217 may be justified by the government 's desire to defend the greater good of nonparties in interest or to influence the economic behavior of market actors .
It 's not difficult to imagine how this discretion could be used unevenly .
Will the government be equally inclined to liquidate a covered financial company if the " excessive risk taking " investors exposed to major losses are union pension funds or public university endowments instead of other Wall Street counterparties or foreign sovereign wealth funds ?
Or what if the covered financial company is Citigroup or AIG , and among the major shareholders to be wiped out is the U.S. government itself ?
Treasury : Wall Street , meet the FDIC .
A liquidation proceeding under S. 3217 would begin as follows .
Upon a determination by the Treasury secretary that a firm qualifies as a covered financial company , the firm and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are notified .
If the firm consents , the FDIC is appointed as receiver .
If not , the Treasury secretary shall petition the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for an order authorizing the FDIC 's appointment .
Within only 24 hours after receipt of the petition , filed under seal , there will be a hearing at which the company may object ( but not creditors , who will not have received notice ) , the District Court shall rule or the petition is automatically granted , with rights of further expedited appeal to the D.C. Court of Appeals and Supreme Court .
Importantly , once the FDIC 's appointment as receiver is final , liquidation of the covered financial company shall proceed exclusively under S. 3217 , and no provision of the Bankruptcy Code shall apply .
Conversely , for financial companies that are not " covered " financial companies , the Bankruptcy Code , and not the provisions of S. 3217 , shall continue to govern .
Once installed as receiver , the FDIC assumes complete financial and operational control of the covered financial company , including the authority to manage , sell , transfer or merge all assets .
The FDIC also has the ability to provide funds needed for orderly liquidation , including for direct loans to the covered financial company or its subsidiaries , the purchase or guarantee of debt obligations , and payments to creditors .
This assistance shall come from a separate fund to be established in the U.S. Treasury and populated initially by assessments on creditors of the covered financial company , to the extent they received more than the liquidation value of their claims , and then , if needed , by assessments on other financial companies with at least $ 50 billion in total assets .
( The Federal Reserve also may lend to covered financial companies , but only if they are solvent and have collateral sufficient to secure the loans -- an unlikely source of help for firms already found to be distressed enough to require liquidation . )
In other words , the FDIC has broad discretion to deploy capital to facilitate liquidation , but all costs ultimately will be paid by counterparties of the liquidating firm , and possibly by other major financial companies as well .
Everything must go ( but not necessarily in order ) .
The process of liquidating under S. 3217 to some extent resembles doing so under the Bankruptcy Code , with key distinctions .
Within only 60 days after its appointment as receiver , the FDIC must file a report with Congress detailing its plan for winding down the covered financial company .
The FDIC shall administer a claims process that includes publication and mail notice to creditors , a bar date and guidelines for the allowance and disallowance of claims .
Although S. 3217 is less than precise about whether and how FDIC determinations may be appealed , it does provide that holders of disallowed claims may file suit on their claim in the federal district court where the covered financial company 's principal place of business is located .
Properly perfected secured claims , proven to the satisfaction of the FDIC , shall be allowed in full , except for any undersecured portion that exceeds the fair market value of the collateral securing the claim , which will be treated as unsecured .
Unsecured claims shall have priority in the following order : ( i ) administrative claims , ( ii ) amounts owed to the United States , ( iii ) unpaid wages or benefits owed to non-executive employees earned in the six months prior to the date the receiver is appointed ( up to $ 11,275 ) , ( iv ) contributions owed to employee benefits plans , ( v ) other general unsecured claims , ( vi ) subordinated claims , ( vii ) any wages or benefits owed to senior executives and directors and ( vii ) equity interests .
Here as well , a significant grant of discretion and corresponding potential for selective application is evident .
The Bankruptcy Code generally requires that claims with rights of a similar legal nature be placed in the same class , and that no class of junior creditors may receive any recovery unless and until each class of senior creditors receives payment in full ( but no more than that ) of its claims .
In contrast , S. 3217 expressly provides that similarly situated creditors may receive dissimilar treatment , without regard for seniority .
Specifically , the FDIC " may take any action " that " does not comply " with the above distribution priorities , including making payments , if it determines doing so is necessary to maximize value and minimize loss -- provided that similarly situated unsecured creditors receive " not less than " they would have in a Chapter 7 or state law liquidation .
So long as that minimum threshold is satisfied for all coequal claimants , the FDIC may favor certain creditors over others .
Otherwise , S. 3217 confers on the FDIC at least analogous versions of many of the rights and protections provided to debtors in possession by the Bankruptcy Code .
For instance , the FDIC may repudiate ( i.e. , reject ) pre-appointment contracts , debt obligations , and leases ; litigation against the covered financial company may be stayed , but only upon request by the FDIC and only for up to 90 days ; and the FDIC has robust avoidance powers to claw back fraudulent or preferential transfers .
Management in the crosshairs .
Lastly , S. 3217 's treatment of management deserves special note .
Although unsurprising , given the prevailing public and political animus towards Wall Street , to say S. 3217 is especially tough on executives is an understatement .
The bill specifies " there shall be a strong presumption " that the FDIC will fire management .
The FDIC and other agencies " will take all steps necessary and appropriate " to ensure that management ( and third parties ) " bear losses consistent with their responsibility " for the failure of the covered financial company , including via " actions for damages , restitution , and recoupment of compensation and other gains not compatible with such responsibility . "
More specifically , the FDIC may recover from any culpable senior executive or director " any compensation " received within two years of the receiver appointment date , or without time limitation in the case of fraud .
Also , compensation is to be construed as broadly as possible " to mean any financial remuneration , including salary , bonuses , incentives , benefits , severance , deferred compensation , or golden parachute benefits , and any profits realized from the sale of the securities of the covered financial company . "
The FDIC also may seek to ban senior executives or directors from participating in the " affairs of any financial company " for a period of no less than two years for violating laws or regulations , engaging in " unsafe or unsound " practices or breaching their fiduciary duties .
In sum , perhaps just having the " orderly liquidation authority " set forth in S. 3217 will result in the government never actually exercising this discretion , as the largest financial firms may moderate their risk taking to safeguard against default , or regulators may opt to allow a failing covered financial company simply to file for bankruptcy .
Then again , no less a free marketeer than Bush administration Treasury Secretary and former Goldman , Sachs & Co. head Henry Paulson once told Congress , while requesting the ability ( but disclaiming the need ) to shore up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , that " if you have got a bazooka [ in your pocket ] and people know you 've got it , you may not have to take it out " -- and then nationalized both companies soon after .
So as S. 3217 wends its way towards enactment and implementation , major Wall Street firms and everyone involved with them would be well advised to understand , and be prepared for , the coming implications of being considered " too big to fail " by Washington .

“ I held up my local convenience store to get a bus ticket , ” Johnny says with a smirk as he and a pal head out of town .
“ Actually I stole the money from my mom ’s dresser . ”
Beat .
“ Actually she lent me the cash . ”
Such is the sheepish fate of a would - be rebel today .
But at least Johnny and his buddy Tunny ( Stark Sands ) do manage to escape deadly suburbia for the lively city , bringing along just their guitars and the anomie and apathy that are the bread and butter of teenage attitudinizing the world over .
( “ I do n’t care if you do n’t care , ” a telling lyric , could be their motto . )
The friend they meant to bring along , Will ( Michael Esper ) , was forced to stay home when he discovered that his girlfriend ( Mary Faber ) was pregnant .
Lost and lonely , and far from ready for the responsibilities of fatherhood , he sinks into the couch , beer in one hand and bong in the other , as his friends set off for adventure .
Beneath the swagger of indifference , of course , are anxiety , fear and insecurity , which Mr. Gallagher , Mr. Esper and Mr. Sands transmit with aching clarity in the show ’s more reflective songs , like the hit “ Boulevard of Broken Dreams ” or the lilting anthem “ Are We the Waiting . ”
The city turns out to be just a bigger version of the place Johnny and Tunny left behind , a “ land of make believe that do n’t believe in me . ”
The boys discover that while a fractious 21st - century America may not offer any easy paths to fulfillment , the deeper problem is that they do n’t know how to believe in themselves .

Johnny strolls the lonely streets with his guitar , vaguely yearning for love and achievement .
He eventually hooks up with a girl ( a vivid Rebecca Naomi Jones ) but falls more powerfully under the spell of an androgynous goth drug pusher , St. Jimmy , played with mesmerizing vitality and piercing vocalism by Tony Vincent .
Tunny mostly stays in bed , clicker affixed to his right hand , dangerously susceptible to a pageant of propaganda about military heroism on the tube , set to the song “ Favorite Son . ”
By the time the song ’s over , he ’s enlisted and off to Iraq .
In both plotting and its emotional palette , “ American Idiot ” is drawn in brash , primary - colored strokes , maybe too crudely for those looking for specifics of character rather than cultural archetypes .
But operas  rock or classical  often trade in archetypes , and the actors flesh out their characters ’ journeys through their heartfelt interpretations of the songs , with the help of Mr. Mayer ’s poetic direction and the restless , convulsive choreography of Steven Hoggett ( “ Black Watch ” ) , which exults in both the grace and the awkwardness of energy - generating young metabolisms .

This is a very , very close matchup .
Both teams have a deep group of forwards that attack in waves .
There is no relief .
Both teams finished in the top - 10 in league scoring , however , Chicago finished third , while Philadelphia finished eighth .
Both captains , Toews and Richards , are currently 1 - 2 in the playoff scoring race .
These are two of the most complete players in the entire league and two of my favourite non-Leafs ( yes , I like a Flyer ) .
After Richards and Toews the lineups match - up very well .
Carter is back from injury and Gagne and Briere are back from mediocre regular seasons .
Claude Giroux has probably been the Flyers ' best forward aside from Richards and he plays on the third line .
Scott Hartnell provides the physical presence on the scoring lines and he has managed to chip in eight points .
Chicago is able to counter these players with Patrick Kane , Patrick Sharp , Marian Hossa , and Kris Versteeg .
Those players are all pretty evenly matched .
Kane and Hossa might give the edge to the Hawks , but Hossa has n’t been great in these playoffs and Briere and Giroux are playing tremendously .
The Hawks also have Dustin Byfuglien , who will stand in front of the net and cause massive traffic .
He scored 8 goals in the past two series and looks unstoppable so far .
Even the checking lines of both teams match up well , especially now that Ian Laperriere has returned from his second shot block to the face .
The Flyers remind me of the Detroit Red Wings a few years ago .
The Red Wings were able to slowly integrate Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk into the offense without overwhelming them because they still had Steve Yzerman , Sergei Fedorov , and Brendan Shanahan to carry the offensive load .
Zetterberg and Datsyuk were able to slowly become the superstars they are today without the expectations and pressure that someone like John Tavares faces with the Islanders .
The Flyers are doing this with both Claude Giroux and James Van Riemsdyk .
Both are able to play on the third and fourth line and slowly develop ( actually rapidly in Giroux ’s case ) into front line players because Richards , Carter , Gagne , and Briere take the offensive load for the team .
The Philadelphia defence is layered .
Chris Pronger and Matt Carle were a combined +41 in the regular season ; Kimmo Timonen and Brayden Coburn a combined - 8 ; and Lucas Krajicek and Ryan Parent a combined - 28 .
It ’s clear there is a drop off after Pronger and Carle and then an even greater drop off after Timonen and Coburn .
The Flyers understand this drop off and in the playoffs play Parent and Krajicek no more than 10 minutes a game .
It helps when you are able to play Chris Pronger 30 minutes a game .
Carle , Timonen , and Coburn play about 25 minutes a game .
Coburn and Timonen have elevated their game in the post - season and are a formidable second pairing .
This will be extremely advantageous because the Hawks have depth up front and if the only defencemen playing well are Pronger and Carle then the Hawks will have a relatively easy time scoring .
It will also be up to Chris Pronger to neutralize Dustin Byfuglien , who has wreaked havoc the past two rounds .
Vancouver and San Jose ’s strategy for Byfuglien was to leave him alone in front of the net .
It did n’t really work considering he scored 8 goals .
But Pronger is a beast himself , so this will be a fun matchup to keep an eye on .
Chicago ’s defence is almost as good as their forwards , which is saying a lot .
The top-pair of Keith and Seabrook are easily the best defensive pairing in the game and they shut down the Sedins and San Jose 's Big Three .
They played so effectively against Marleau , Heatley , and Thornton that Todd McLellan had to break up the power trio .
Behind Keith and Seabrook are Brian Campbell , Niklas Hjalmarsson , Brent Sopel , and Jordan Hendry .
Each of these players were plus players in the regular season and only Hendry is a minus in these playoffs – but the Hawks make sure he plays less than 10 minutes a night .
Campbell , Hjalmarsson , and Sopel all play around 20 minutes a night , which takes some pressure off Keith and Seabrook , so they both do n’t have to push 30 minutes a night .
Philadelphia basically roll four quality defencemen , while the Hawks are able to play five quality defencemen without fear of being burned .
I think at the beginning of the playoffs the biggest knock on both the Flyers and the Blackhawks was that neither had a goalie capable of winning them a Stanley Cup .
They needed a goalie like Martin Brodeur , Ryan Miller , or Roberto Luongo – even though none of these goalies could take their teams past the second round .
However , both Chicago and Philadelphia followed the Detroit theory of goaltending which states that if your team is good enough then your goalie does n’t need to win you any games , they just ca n’t lose them for you .
Although , this post - season both teams have also had the pleasure of having their unheralded goalies win games for them .
That ’s one of the reasons they defeated San Jose and Montreal so swiftly ( that and the clock struck midnight for Montreal and Jaroslav Halak turned into a pumpkin ) .
This matchup is very even ( noticing a trend here ? ) .
Michael Leighton has been tremendous after Brian Boucher was injured and has posted a 1.45 GAA and .948 % over seven games in the playoffs .
He shut out Montreal three times and has only lost once .
The level of competition he has faced is lower than Niemi considering Montreal and Boston both finished in the bottom five in goals scored during the regular season .
Niemi is 12 - 4 in the playoffs with a 2.33 GAA and .921 % .
He is hot coming into this series as well .
Over his last five games he is 5 - 0 with a 1.54 GAA and .952 % .
The competition he has faced exceeds that of the Flyers as well .
Both Vancouver and San Jose finished in the top five in goals scored during the regular season and had five players in the top - 15 in league scoring .
The Flyers penalty kill is second in the playoffs at 87 % , while the Blackhawks are third with a penalty kill running at 86.6 % .
Both teams take penalties at about the same rate as well .
Chicago takes 10.2 minutes of penalties a game , compared to 11.9 minutes by the Flyers .
If Carcillo is a healthy scratch you can bet that total is n’t as high either .
The Chicago power - play scores 22.6 % of the time and the Flyers score 20.7 % of the time .
Peter Laviolette has a Stanley Cup ring , but he did so with that sham 2006 Carolina Hurricanes team .
Ya , that ’s right , I do n’t truly acknowledge their Stanley Cup victory .
The ‘ Canes only get by the Canadiens after being down 2 - 0 because they clip Saku Koivu in the face and he ’s out for the series ; in the Conference Final they only beat Buffalo because half of the Sabres ’ defence is injured ; and then they beat Edmonton because they run Roloston in the first game and injure him for the playoffs .
Fake championship !
However , Joel Quenneville does n’t even have a fake championship .
Laviolette was also able to rally his team from a 3 - 0 deficit against the Bruins to advance to the Conference Final .
That ’s impressive .
It helped that both Sturm and Krejci were injured for the playoffs , but winning four games in a row is still very , very impressive .
Quenneville did n’t allow any of the off - ice distractions get to his young team this year .
For those keeping score those off - ice distractions ranged from the harmless ( the NSP in the limo ) to the potentially damaging ( Pat Kane punching out a cabby ) .
Philadelphia overcame a 3 - 0 series deficit to the Boston Bruins to advance to the Conference Final then shut - out Montreal three times in a five game series win .
Those two teams were also two of the weakest teams to make the playoffs out of either conference .
The Blackhawks once again psychologically destroyed the Vancouver Canucks and then followed it up with a sweep of the Western Conference ’s number one seed .
Their sweep of the Sharks was n’t even a classic San Jose choke job , but was more attributable to Chicago playing really , really well .
That ’s the number one and number three seed that Chicago eliminated .
Their first round opponent , Nashville , actually finished the season with 100 points .
The West is a better conference than the East and the Blackhawks beat some of the better teams in that conference .
At this point both teams are unflappable .
Philly came back from 3 - 0 in the second round and the Hawks have only lost two of their last ten games .
Will this year make the Marian Hossa curse official ?
This will be his third year in the Finals on different teams and each of the past two seasons his team lost .
If the Blackhawks lose , Marian Hossa is either a curse or just the least clutch player in the league .
The Blackhawks have three players who have won a Stanley Cup – John Madden , Andrew Ladd , and Tomas Kopecky .
The only player on the Flyers to win is Chris Pronger and that was in 2007 .
Both captains , Toews and Richards , will be known as the two definitive captains of this generation ( Crosby is way too polarizing ) .
They both play the game the way it should be played and exude a quiet confidence in everything they do .
It ’s hard to pick between either of them in terms of leadership qualities .
Kane , Toews , Keith , and Seabrook for the Hawks and Richards for the Flyers made huge developmental leaps this season by playing in the Olympic Gold medal game .
Toews specifically seemed to hyper - mature into a Steve Yzerman clone .
I think more Hawks being a part of this epic final will be a major reason why the Hawks are able to beat the Flyers .
They entered that tournament as the league ’s future and emerged as the league ’s present .
You can't discount the big game reps these players learned in Vancouver . : Chicago in 6
Roman Polanski has finally spoken out about his rape trial , posting a statement on an online magazine run by his friend Bernard - Henri Lévy .
The statement purports to include new information about the case , but what 's really interesting is what 's missing .
Polanski's statement is available in full on Deadline Hollywood .
Below , we break down some of the highlights :
I have had my share of dramas and joys , as we all have , and I am not going to try to ask you to pity my lot in life .
I ask only to be treated fairly like anyone else .
Advertisement
Since Polanski's celebrity has helped as well as hurt him in the years since he raped a 13 - year - old girl , it 's a little disingenuous for him to ask to be treated " like anyone else . "
If he'd been treated like anyone else , he might have received a stiffer sentence in the first place .
It is true : 33 years ago I pleaded guilty , and I served time at the prison for common law crimes at Chino , not in a VIP prison .
That period was to have covered the totality of my sentence .
By the time I left prison , the judge had changed his mind and claimed that the time served at Chino did not fulfil te entire sentence , and it is this reversal that justified my leaving the United States .
Advertisement
The first sentence is the closest Polanski gets to acknowledging his crime .
He notes that he " pleaded guilty , " but does n't say to what .
He may have made a calculated decision to avoid the words " rape " or " unlawful sex with a minor . "
What he is explicit about : his " justification " for fleeing the US .
Though he previously said he did n't want pity , here Polanski clearly casts himself as the victim , and the judge as the villain .
After this Polanski goes on to describe the entire reopening of his case as a vendetta by LA authorities angry at their portrayal in the film Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired .
Then he writes ,
I can remain silent no longer because the California court has dismissed the victim 's numerous requests that proceedings against me be dropped , once and for all , to spare her from further harassment every time this affair is raised once more .
Advertisement
For Polanski to speak as an advocate of his own rape victim at this late date is , frankly , disturbing .
He then adds ,
I can remain silent no longer because there has just been a new development of immense significance .
On February 26 last , Roger Gunson , the deputy district attorney in charge of the case in 1977 , now retired , testified under oath before Judge Mary Lou Villar in the presence of David Walgren , the present deputy district attorney in charge of the case , who was at liberty to contradict and question him , that on September 16 , 1977 , Judge Rittenband stated to all the parties concerned that my term of imprisonment in Chino constituted the totality of the sentence I would have to serve .
I can remain silent no longer because the request for my extradition addressed to the Swiss authorities is founded on a lie .
In the same statement , retired deputy district attorney Roger Gunson added that it was false to claim , as the present district attorney 's office does in their request for my extradition , that the time I spent in Chino was for the purpose of a diagnostic study .
Advertisement
Polanski's initial 1977 trial was riddled with problems , and Judge Rittenband may indeed have committed misconduct .
This is what muddied the waters of the case so upsettingly , making a convicted rapist into a cause celebre .
If Rittenband had behaved honestly , we might not today see so many celebrities defending a man who raped a child .
Later Polanski enumerates a few more reasons why he " can remain silent no longer . "
He concludes with a statement of his current hardships ( " I have been placed under house arrest in Gstaad and bailed in very large sum of money which I have managed to raise only by mortgaging the apartment that has been my home for over 30 years , and because I am far from my family and unable to work " ) and the wish " that Switzerland will recognize that there are no grounds for extradition , and that I shall be able to find peace , be reunited with my family , and live in freedom in my native land . "
What 's missing from the entire statement , however , is any sort of apology for the crime that got him in this mess in the first place .
Perhaps Polanski feels that the time he served in Chino is apology enough , or perhaps he thinks no apology is necessary because , as his wife once said , it was a " crazy time . "
Whatever the case , too many people fail to remember that all of Polanski's legal troubles started when he raped a young girl — and he seems only too eager to let them forget .

In recent years , there has been a trend away from overly processed foods , and a movement toward more organic and natural options .
The trend has also led many to re-examine their health remedies .
Is there something in the idea that chicken soup is good for you if you are sick ?
Can ginger calm your upset stomach or cure a headache ?
Here are 5 natural health remedies that may improve your well - being .
1. Chicken Soup
Back in the 12th century , an Egyptian ( and Jewish ) physician , Moshe ben Mainmon , recommended chicken soup as a remedy for the symptoms associated with colds .
Through the years , chicken soup has sometimes been referred to as the “ Jewish penicillin . ”
Grandmothers and mothers , no matter their ethnicity or religion , have been prescribing chicken soup for cold and flu symptoms over the hundreds of years since .
More recently , science has found that there are reasons that chicken soup has stood the test of time :
It really does help ease cold and flu symptoms .
The chicken in the soup releases an anti-inflammatory amino acid during the cooking process .
The liquid in the soup hydrates the body , and the heat from the soup helps to loosen congestion .
And , common chicken soup spices like garlic and pepper , have been used since ancient times to help thin mucus to ease breathing .
Even some canned , store bought , chicken soups can be effective .
But if you want a healthier option , you can make it at home .
Make a big batch , and freeze it in single - serving portions ; the soup will keep for a few of months , and you can easily reheat it as needed .
2. Ginger
For thousands of years ginger , which comes from the underground stem of the Zingiber officinale plant , has been used to treat a number of ailments , and to enhance general health .
It has been used in some of the oldest cultures , including those in Asia , India and the Middle East .
Even today , health care professionals recognize that ginger can help some of the symptoms associated with upset stomach brought on by pregnancy , menstruation , motion sickness and nausea brought on by chemotherapy .
Ginger can also help reduce inflammation , which can help reduce some symptoms associated with muscle pain , osteoarthritis , and even headaches .
Ginger should not be given to children under the age of two .
3. Honey ( and Lemon )
Honey has long been considered useful and even sacred .
Ancient cultures , from Egypt to Greece , used honey in a variety of ways to sweeten food , soothe health concerns and even help the dead on their journey .
The prophet Muhammad recommended honey for healing purposes .
Today , a recent study asserts that honey may actually work better than cough medicine .
Combine one tablespoon of honey with one tablespoon of lemon juice and microwave for 20 seconds until it is warm — but not hot .
Honey mixed in teas can help further soothe a sore throat .
Just realize that honey should not be given to children under the age of one .
4. Cayenne Pepper
For hundreds of years , cayenne pepper has been used by various cultures for its medicinal properties , including , some scholars think , in the Mayan and Aztec civilizations .
One of the things that modern science has discovered about cayenne pepper is that it actually helps encourage blood clotting .
You can use cayenne pepper with good results on nose bleeds .
After holding the nose closed for several minutes , use a q-tip to dab cayenne pepper up the nose to help stop the flow .
Cayenne pepper contains capsacin , which has been tested and found to help reduce feelings of pain , and it is also currently being explored for its usefulness in fighting some types of cancer , as well as helping with some heart conditions .
5. Chamomile
You are probably familiar with the idea of using a tea made from chamomile to help with some ailments .
Ancient Egyptians thought chamomile , with its benefits , was a gift from the sun god .
Greeks and Romans used it extensively as well .
Chamomile has a calming effect , and can help you with sleep problems and mild anxiety issues .
Additionally , some of the naturally occurring chemicals in chamomile might be able to aid your digestive health .
However , it is important not to get too carried away with the health claims made for chamomile .
While doctors say chamomile tea can help with colicky babies , and help soothe you , claims that chamomile can help with heart problems , serious digestive issues and other health concerns , have not been substantiated .
Before you begin any mode of treatment , it is a good idea to consult your health care provider , and make sure that you are using correct dosages , and following correct usages .
Even natural remedies can be harmful if used in the wrong way .

SALT LAKE CITY , May 27 , 2010 - A Nobel Prize - winning University of Utah geneticist discovered that bone marrow transplants cure mutant mice who pull out their hair compulsively .
The study provides the first cause - and - effect link between immune system cells and mental illness , and points toward eventual new psychiatric treatments .
" We 're showing there is a direct relationship between a psychiatric disorder and the immune system , specifically cells named microglia that are derived from bone marrow " and are found in the brain , says Mario Capecchi , a distinguished professor of human genetics at the University of Utah School of Medicine .
" There 's been an inference .
But nobody has previously made a direct connection between the two . "
The findings - published in the Friday , May 28 issue of the journal Cell - should inspire researchers " to think about potential new immune - based therapies for psychiatric disorders , " says Capecchi , a 2007 Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine .
Capecchi and colleagues showed that pathological grooming and hair - pulling in mice - a disorder similar to trichotillomania ( trick - o - til - o - MAY - nee - ah ) in humans - is caused by a mutant Hoxb8 gene that results in defective microglia , which are immune system cells that originate in bone marrow and migrate from blood to the brain .
Microglia defend the brain and spinal cord , attacking and engulfing infectious agents .
Mice with pathological grooming appear to groom normally , but do so too often and for too long , leading to hair removal and self - inflicted skin wounds .
The disease of pulling out head or body hair is common in humans ; studies in seven international communities found trichotillomania affecting 1.9 to 2.5 of every 100 people .
In the key experiment , geneticist Shau - Kwaun Chen , Capecchi and colleagues transplanted bone marrow from normal mice into 10 mice that had a mutant Hoxb8 gene and compulsively pulled out their own chest , stomach and side fur .
As the transplant took hold during ensuing months , grooming behavior became normal , four mice recovered completely and the other six showed extensive hair growth and healing of wounds .
" A lot of people are going to find it amazing , " says Capecchi .
" That 's the surprise : bone marrow can correct a behavioral defect . "
Nevertheless , " I 'm not proposing we should do bone marrow transplants for any psychiatric disorder " in humans , he says .
Bone marrow transplants are expensive , and the risks and complications are so severe they generally are used only to treat life - threatening illnesses , including certain cancers and disabling autoimmune diseases such as lupus .
Capecchi says that mice with the mutant gene that causes pathological grooming now can be used to study the surprising connections between the immune system 's microglia cells and mental illness - and ultimately to produce new treatments .
" We think it 's a very good model for obsessive - compulsive disorder , " he says .
The researchers also transplanted bone marrow into normal mice from Hoxb8 mutant , hair - pulling mice .
The normal mice started pulling out their hair compulsively .
Normal mice transplanted with normal bone marrow kept grooming normally , while mutant mice implanted with mutant bone marrow exhibited severe grooming and self - mutilation .
Half died , probably due to difficulty re-establishing mutant bone marrow .
Capecchi and colleagues also proved that reduced sensitivity to pain among mutant Hoxb8 mice is not the cause of the animals ' compulsive grooming and hair removal , as some researchers had believed .
Mutant Microglia from Marrow Link Immunity and Mental Disorder
Capecchi says previous studies have linked the immune system and psychiatric disorders , but not in a cause - and - effect manner .
" If you look at people who are depressed , often you find their immune system is n't working normally , " Capecchi says .
And studies have shown that genes that confer a higher rate of depression , schizophrenia , obsessive - compulsive disorder , bipolar disorder and autism also " have something to do with the immune system , " he adds .
The new findings " provide direct evidence for an association between neuropsychiatric diseases and dysfunction of the immune system or of the blood - forming system , " says Capecchi .
Hox genes orchestrate embryo development .
Hoxb8 is responsible for maintaining " myeloid progenitor cells , " including those that give rise to monocytes , which are white blood cells that move from the circulatory system to the brain and become microglia .
It was surprising that the new study identified mutant microglia cells that originate in bone marrow as the cause of compulsive hair - pulling in mice .
Researchers expected to find the mutant Hoxb8 in brain nerve cells that control grooming .
It is the first study to suggest " there is a connection between microglia and behavior - and a direct connection , " Capecchi says .
Capecchi says nerve cells or neurons represent only about 10 percent of the brain , and the rest is made of various glial cells , including microglia .
There are two kinds of microglia in the brain .
Sixty percent are " resident " microglia that form in an embryo's brain even before the blood circulation system develops .
The second kind of microglia in the brain - 40 percent of the total - originates in bone marrow , and then moves to the brain , circumventing the blood - brain barrier .
The geneticists believed the mutant microglia originated in bone marrow because they did not find them among the resident microglia present in the mouse brain at birth , but instead saw microglia with mutant Hoxb8 first migrate into the mouse brain two days after birth .
To identify the cells in the brain with active mutant Hoxb8 genes , the researchers used a method that attached a fluorescent yellow - green label to such cells .
Pathological Grooming is Different than Scratching an Itchy Rump
Capecchi first reported in 2002 that mice with mutant Hoxb8 genes displayed compulsive grooming and pulling out the hair on their chest , stomach and sides .
Over the years , some researchers attributed this to reduced pain sensitivity also observed in mutant Hoxb8 mice , apparently due to nerve damage in the spinal cord .
The idea was that reduced sensitivity to pain would make mice scratch more in response to an itch .
In the new study , the Utah geneticists concluded that compulsive grooming and reduced sensitivity to pain were due to separate malfunctions of the Hoxb8 gene ; the bone marrow transplants that cured hair - pulling did not restore the loss of pain sensitivity .
Also , mutating Hoxb8 genes in microglia from bone marrow made the mice groom pathologically but did n't make them insensitive to pain .
Mutating Hoxb8 in the spinal cord resulted in reduced sensitivity to pain , but not compulsive grooming .
Finally , in earlier studies of mice insensitive to pain due to mutant Hoxb8 , the mice used paws to scratch too much and cause hair loss and wounds on their rumps , near the tail .
But mice in the Utah study used their teeth to remove hair on their chest , stomach and sides .
They followed a normal head - to - rear grooming pattern , but did it excessively .
To be Determined : How Mutant Microglia Cause Hair - Pulling
How do mutant immune cells from bone marrow cause pathological grooming ?
All we know now is that there are 15 percent fewer microglia in the brain when Hoxb8 is mutant , Capecchi says .
" In the next wave of experiments , we can ask how microglia affect behavior .
We anticipate it has to affect neural circuitry in some way . "
He speculates ways mutant microglia might trigger pathological grooming :
The microglia could make cytokines that activate or inhibit nerve activity , and thus influence behavior .
Because microglia have long extensions that " feel " the synapses that connect nerve cells , they might be involved in controlling nerve - signal transmissions , he says .
For now , " we have no idea which will be right , " Capecchi says .
In Capecchi's 2002 study of mice with compulsive grooming , the researchers recorded the number and duration of each mouse 's grooming sessions using a video recorder , which was very labor intensive to analyze .
So in the new study , the mouse cages were placed on sensitive vibration - detecting platforms capable of distinguishing mouse vibration from different activities such as eating , drinking , grooming , climbing , sitting still , walking and scratching .
They tested the method 's accuracy by using a video camera to double check what the mice were doing at times .
The result : Mice with the mutant Hoxb8 gene spent about twice as much time grooming as their normal littermates .
The new study was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Institutes of Health .
Capecchi is senior author .
The first author is Chen , who recently completed a Ph.D. in human genetics .
They conducted the study with human genetics postdoctoral fellows Petr Tvrdik , Erik Peden and Sen Wu ; Gerald Spangrude , an internal medicine professor ; and Scott Cho , a graduate student in Spangrude 's lab .
Capecchi shared the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for developing " gene targeting " in mice , a method of knocking genes out of action to see what goes wrong and thus learn each gene 's normal function .

Abstract
Fabrik is a visual programming environment - a kit of computational and user - interface components that can be " wired " together to build new components and useful applications .
Fabrik diagrams utilize bidirectional dataflow connections as a shorthand for multiple paths of flow .
Built on object - oriented foundations , Fabrik components can compute arbitrary objects as outputs .
Music and animation can be programmed in this way and the user interface can even be extended by generating graphical structures that depend on other data .
An interactive type system guards against meaningless connections .
As with simple dataflow , each Fabrik component can be compiled into an object with access methods corresponding to each of the possible paths of data propagation .
1 Kits and Concrete Manipulation
A kit is a set of primitive components , together with a framework for connecting the components to do new and interesting things .
If objects built with the kit can in turn be used to augment the original set of components , then the range of application becomes very large , limited only by the capability of the primitive components and the manner of their interconnection .
The kit approach has been around for a long time , manifest in the subroutine libraries of the last three decades .
However , the ability to browse through , and experiment with the available components was extremely primitive , owing to the textual orientation of underlying computing environments during those early years .
With the advent of iconic user interfaces , nontechnical users -- those not trained to appreciate invisible objects and connections -- are able to work concretely ( by pointing at an image ) with data and functional components .
While iconic interfaces have had little effect on conventional programming practice , they have the potential to greatly facilitate programming with kits .
A box with connectors can represent a function and its parameter list .
The insides of a box can be descriptive of a function or it can be an active piece of the user interface .
A connecting line connotes both the passage of a value and sequential dependence .
A single intuitive visual metaphor thus encompasses the acts of browsing , testing , connecting , and finally using the components in the library and those built from them .
We feel that concrete manipulation can offer users untrained in programming the kind of control that has previously been available only to professional programmers .
2 Programming with a Kit
The Fabrik library includes computational elements found in most programming libraries , such as arithmetic and string manipulation , file access , and logic .
These appear as boxes with connectors which can be wired together to build new functions .
This concrete access to functional composition is important , but it is only part of what is needed to build a complete application .
A look at a modern application program reveals many idiomatic components which make up its user interface .
Windows , panels with editable text , lists of selectable items , choice buttons , scroll bars , and menus are a few that appear frequently .
As with simple computational elements , the Fabrik library provides equally immediate access to components which provide such high - level capability and which support concrete user interaction .
The remainder of this section presents an example which illustrates the support for browsing , construction , testing and packaging of a complete application in Fabrik .
Many details relating to the user interface have been postponed to a later section to preserve the flow of what is an extremely simple and immediate process .
Goal :
To build a simple file browser with the following capability ( see figure 1f ) :
User can type a name pattern in one panel ,
Second panel shows file names that match ,
A third panel shows the text of a file if the user selects its name .
The application in figure 1a , though trivial , is already usable .
One can type and edit text within the String Viewer , with full support for font changes and justification .
Upon typing < enter > , the current text appears as output at the pin on the top , but nothing else happens because the output pin is not connected to anything .
If another text component were wired to the one shown , then the text would appear in that one as well .
Figure 1a .
A String Viewer has been dragged from the Parts Bin to a new Construction Window .
In figure 1b , the author has typed the word ' memo ' in the String Viewer , in order to prepare the example to search for files with those letters in their names .
He then selected the File Access category of the parts bin , dragged a File Name Pattern Matcher to the Construction Window , and hooked that component to the String Viewer .
He also slid the top pin of the String Viewer to one side for neatness .
Figure 1b .
The String Viewer has been hooked to a File Name Matcher .
The resulting list of file names is waiting at the output pin .
In figure 1c , the author has obtained a List Viewer from the Front Panel category of the Parts Bin to view the list of file names matching the string , ' memo ' .
As soon as the File Name Matcher output is connected to the List Viewer input , the list of names appears as shown .
Figure 1 c .
A List Viewer has been installed and attached to view the list of file names .
In figure 1d , the desired functionality of our sample application is completed by installing a File Data Contents extractor and a second String Viewer .
These are hooked up in the obvious manner to view the text when a file name is selected .
The connection appears dashed at this point in the construction because , with no file name selected , the value is nil .
Fabrik takes care in this situation to track invalidity so that no component is triggered with invalid data .
Figure 1d .
The selected file name output is now hooked up via a File Contents extractor to a String Viewer .
Figure 1e shows that after a file name has been selected , it propagates through the File Data Contents module , turning the connecting lines solid , and finally displaying the text of the selected file as desired .
In roughly five simple steps , the desired application has been programmed , and is ready for use .
The only problem is that it is still surrounded by a small scaffold of computational components and their connections .
Figure 1e .
The left three panels have been selected as the " user frame " , and a menu command lets one " enter " that frame .
Fabrik allows a subregion of each diagram to be designated as the user frame .
This has been done with the left three panels in figure 1e , as can be seen from the heavy border around their periphery .
Once the user frame has been designated , a menu command is available to enter that frame as shown in the figure .
This command instructs Fabrik to restrict its view to only the designated components , and to make the result available as a normal window in the environment , capable of reframing , multiple instances , and all the other comforts of the supporting environment .
Figure 1f .
The construction scaffold is now hidden and the application can be launched as a reframable window ready for normal use .
Figure 1f shows our file browser application after entering the user frame .
An application such as this can easily be assembled in less than five minutes .
Moreover all of the original scaffolding can later be retrieved for documentation or as the basis for a revision .
This ease of " opening the hood " adds to the potential reusability of Fabrik software .
3 About the User Interface
As shown in the preceding example , an author defines his application by directly manipulating its visual representation .
He selects appropriate components from the library , places them in a Fabrik window , and connects them up to achieve the desired functionality and appearance .
A Fabrik component appears as a rectangle , usually with one or more connectors , called " pins " , on its periphery .
Some components are purely computational .
Others provide user interface functions within their rectangles .
Some pins are used to gather input for the component , others to channel output , and others ( bidirectional pins ) are able to pass data in either direction .
The pins can be moved about the periphery to simplify wiring .
The Fabrik Parts Bin is organized as a file drawer with index tabs as shown in figures 1a and 1b .
Components in the library appear here in miniature to save space .
The file drawer idiom used for the Parts Bin was chosen for its rapid access to many categories without the complexity of generally nested windows .
To use a component , the author uses the mouse to " grab " it from the Parts Bin , to drag it over the desired layout window , and to place it at the desired location by releasing the mouse button .
The " part " being laid out grows to actual size as it leaves the Parts Bin , to facilitate layout in the destination window .
Components are connected using a concrete " wiring " interface , which serves to connect pins of different components .
To wire from a to b , the author clicks on a , and then clicks again on b .
It is not necessary to wire directly from one pin to another .
Each click down establishes a " vertex " in the wiring diagram , a point where the wire can be bent or additional wires attached , making it easier to produce readable diagrams .
Numerous features in the user interface allow this wiring to be changed for either aesthetic or logical reasons .
As a Fabrik author lays out his components , the tableau he is creating is always ' alive ' .
The appearance and behavior of the application being built are always directly manifest .
This is in contrast to the conventional cycle of editing source code , compiling , fixing syntax errors , recompiling , linking , loading , then test - running an application .
If the author is building a new component , as opposed to a stand - alone application , he will need to add pins to the window border that serve as gateways for data to flow into and out of the component .
Internal dataflow semantics of the component are expressed by wiring between gateways and the pins of the sub-components .
The gateways later appear as the pins on the periphery of the component when it is used to build other components and applications .
The direct manipulation of components to assert relationships virtually eliminates syntax errors from the development process .
The only error possible in building a Fabrik application is to connect two pins that should n't be connected .
Fabrik checks for incompatible modality ( output to output or input to input ) , as well as for type mismatch ( see section 8 ) before allowing a wire to be connected .
Permission to connect is communicated to the user through apparent attraction and repulsion during the wiring process .
The attentive reader will notice that the bidirectional pin on the String Viewer in figure 1a was coerced to output - only as a result of being connected to the input of the file component in figure 1b .
Such directional coercions are handled by Fabrik automatically .
Fabrik 's user interface , browsing , programming and debugging support are discussed in full detail in a companion paper [ Ludolph ] .
4 Bidirectionality
In Fabrik we have chosen dataflow as the underlying model of computation .
It is presented to the user in a loop - free and therefore timeless and declarative model .
Dataflow is often considered to be incompatible with bidirectionality because bidirectional diagrams appear to have loops in them .
However , with some care , most of the benefits of bidirectionality can be achieved in a system based on dataflow .
The key observation about most uses of bidirectionality is that they are simply a shorthand for multiple paths of dataflow .
Except in complex situations with subtle constraints , the different paths may be treated completely independently .
Figure 2a .

two Slider controls to achieve a
Fahrenheit - to - Centigrade converter .
Figure 2b .
Internal diagram for the
F/C component used in the diagram
at left .
Figure 2 above shows Fabrik diagrams for a bidirectional temperature converter , an example borrowed from Thinglab [ Borning ] .
Both the outer application and the numerical conversion resolve simply into a left - to - right flow for input on the left , and vice - versa for input on the right .
Bidirectionality enhances the intuitive aspect of Fabrik 's concrete constructions by reducing the amount of wiring as well as by reducing the number of components needed in the library .
We consider support for bidirectional behavior to be crucial in any system used to build user interfaces , since most visual metaphors used for output have a natural interpretation for input as well .
It is , of course , possible to construct confusing or ambiguous diagrams with bidirectional components .
For instance , if the Times / Divide component in figure 2 b were bidirectional at all three pins , there would be abiguity as to whether a change in one temperature caused a change in the other temperature or a change in the conversion constant !
We have chosen to leave Fabrik users exposed to such possible confusion since the benefits are so compelling .
Possible solutions range from simple restrictions , such as allowing no more than two bidirectional pins per component , to employing more powerful techniques as in Thinglab .
5 Synthetic graphics
We have seen in the foregoing examples how existing components can be combined to make new applications and how , through the use of external connectors , the new applications can act as components themselves , thus augmenting the Fabrik library and increasing the power of the system as a whole .
It is obvious that , given a reasonable basic set of arithmetic and string - handling components , most simple programming functions can be built up on Fabrik .
What is less apparent at first is that , by including a basic set of components capable of producing images , Fabrik assumes the ability to synthesize any computable image .
In this way , Fabrik applications are as extensible in their user interfaces as they are in their numerical and textual manipulations , thus enabling simple construction of applications and components such as a bar - chart , a scroll - bar , or an animation sequence .
Fabrik 's graphical capabilities center around graphemes , objects that represent images .
Graphemes can be simple , such as lines , circles or bitmaps , or they may be transformed or combined with other graphemes through overlays , clipping , rotation and so on .
The ability to carry a variety of different graphical objects on a wire relies critically on the polymorphism of the underlying object - oriented programming language ( Smalltalk ) in which Fabrik is implemented .
Some Fabrik components take in non-graphical data ( such as magnitudes , points , vectors , style specifications ) and generate graphemes as output .
Thus , a rectangle creator component takes in two points for its opposite corners and an optional style ( border color , border width , interior color ) , and produces a grapheme representing the image of a rectangle satisfying the input parameters .
Various other such components create lines , ovals , bitmaps , display text , etc .
A second group of graphical components provide graphical transformations of general applicability .
These include components to scale , translate , rotate , hide , and invert a grapheme , and to merge multiple graphemes in various ways .
Graphemes are viewed with graphic viewers .
Each viewer defines its own local coordinate space .
The coordinates carried by the grapheme define its location in that local space .
Whenever the input changes , the grapheme is redisplayed .
Different graphic viewers offer such features as automatically scaling their contents , emitting the final bitmap resulting from the incoming ( complex ) grapheme , allowing their contents to " pop up " on top of the current screen layer , and so on .
Finally , interaction is supported in this world of synthetic graphics by sensor components that sensitize a grapheme or collection of graphemes to user input , such as mouse clicks and location within the bounding box of the grapheme .
The Mouse component has one output pin ( on the right in figures 3 and 4 ) which emits a sensitized version of the input grapheme whenever it changes .
The output on the bottom is activated when a grapheme viewer detects user input , at which time it emits the cursor location .
Various sensors support tracking of different button states , keyboard input , and so on .
Figure 3 . A Fabrik diagram computes the image for the slider in figure 2 .
The Mouse component sensitizes the slider image to support input as well as output .
Figure 3 shows the complete Fabrik diagram for the slider component used in the Fahrenheit - to - Centigrade example of figure 2a .
Several labels have been made visible , using an option available in the Fabrik interface .
To the right , the slider is visible in a graphic viewer that automatically scales the incoming grapheme to fit .
The slider is composed of two rectangular graphemes , a tall slender one generated by the rectangle creator grapheme with input points 15@0 and 22@118 ( its top - left and lower - right corners ) , and a horizontal , mouse - sensitized rectangular grapheme with the size 26@6 whose location is determined by the program .
Below the slider is a small number component that displays the current value , 13 .
When the user positions the cursor over the horizontal rectangle in the graphic viewer and presses the mouse button , the mouse component emits the viewer - relative location of the cursor out the bottom pin .
The new cursor location causes two components , NumToPoint and Default , to fire .
Default passes non-nil inputs through to its output unchanged .
If the input is nil here , the value , 6@50 is output .
ConstrainPoint is a user - built component that limits the Y value of the point to the range 0 - 112 and replaces the X value with 6 .
The resulting point is fed unchanged to the origin pin ( upper - left corner ) of the rectange creator , and , after adding 26@6 , to the corner point ( lower - right corner ) .
The apparent loop through the Mouse component is not really a violation of dataflow , since the cursor output is not triggered by incoming data , but only by user input .
The new rectangle grapheme created as a result is sensitized to the mouse , merged with the vertical rectangle , scaled and displayed .
Sensitization to the mouse means that clicking the mouse button in the area of the slide will cause the mouse coordinate to be emitted from the bottom pin of the Mouse component .
NumToPoint is a user - built component that converts the Y value of the input point to an integer which is both displayed in the small number component below the graphic viewer and passed through the gateway on the right wall of the window to anything wired to it .
As the user moves the mouse with the button still pressed , the cycle is repeated .
Bidirectionality permits the slider to be used as an output indicator as well as an input control .
If the user types into the small number component or a value flows in through the external gateway , it is displayed in the number component , flows through NumToPoint which changes the integer value into a point , through Default ( no change ) , through ConstrainPoint , etc. , and causes the small horizontal rectangle to be repositioned and redisplayed at the appropriate location in the graphic viewer .
The use of a general algebra of images in Fabrik 's synthetic graphics adds considerable leverage to each application .
For instance , the scrollbar example in figure 4 produces either a vertical or a horizontal image , depending upon the aspect ratio of its framed image .
Figure 4a .
A simple scrollbar diagram .
Logic is provided for rotating when the image is wider than high .
Figure 4b .
Demonstrating the rotational logic .
All display and mouse - tracking operations are properly scaled and rotated .
In this case , the background image , another Fabrik diagram , is scaled and rotated as well as the slider .
Mouse - tracking coordinates are automatically transformed through this logic , leaving the scrollbar diagram relatively uncluttered .
From these examples of synthetic graphics it is apparent how Fabrik deals with other dynamic media .
A musical score or an animation sequence can equally well be synthesized as a set of primitive elements combined and transformed by other higher - level functions .
6 The Draw component
As shown above , images can be generated by connecting various grapheme creators and viewers .
A step toward more direct manipulation of graphical material is the Draw component .
Currently a primitive component , it allows the user to draw graphic objects as in a normal drawing program , while the corresponding Fabrik diagram is automatically laid down and connected .
The user can further adjust the location and size of the graphic objects right in the Draw component .
These changes are immediately shown as updated point values that are inputs to the grapheme creators .
The Fabrik diagram generated is exactly the same as one assembled from scratch , and hence it can be edited to place additional constraints on the image .
Figure 5a .
The Draw component automatically lays out diagrams as the user creates a drawing .
Figure 5 b .
By editing the generative diagram , the top - left of the oval is tied to the bottom - right of the triangle .
In the example of figure 5a , the only component the user actually laid out was the the one marked " Draw " ; the rest of the diagram was automatically constructed as consequences of the user drawing within that component .
By tying vertices A and B together in figure 5b , the top - left corner of the oval is constrained to have the same location as the bottom - right corner of the rectangle .
Moving either the oval or the rectangle will cause the other to resize and maintain the constraint .
7 Iteration
Fabrik components that wish to communicate with the outside world do so by means of gateways , pins that provide the link between data outside the component and data within the component .
Most often , these gateways provide a simple handoff of data from the outside to the inside ( inbound gateways ) or from inside the component to the outside world ( outbound gateways ) .
Certain kinds of gateways can provide iterative functionality , however .
For example , in figure 6 , the inner component expects a collection of numbers to be fed to it .
Its inbound collection gateway on the left disaggregates the collection into its elements , and the interior of the iterator is fired once in turn for each element .
Figure 6 . Streaming gateways provide iterative capability .
Here numbers are converted to rectangles , resulting in a simple bar chart .
On the right of the iterator , a similar outbound gateway collects up the values it receives from each firing of the iterator , and when the last iteration is done , it aggregates the data it has received into a new collection .
In the example above , the collected rectangle graphemes appear as the bar chart image in the viewer at the bottom .
In Fabrik , every component fires to completion when instructed to , and iterators are no exception .
The firing of an iterator may involve many complete passes through it .
The number of passes is determined by both the component topology and the actual data values arriving .
Global state within the iterator between passes is preserved by the semantics of the gateways , and a particular kind of gateway structure allows mutable values global to the iteration process to be used .
Within any particular pass through an iterator , strict rules of dataflow scoping prevail so that predictability and system integrity are assured .
Fabrik 's approach to iteration in a dataflow context was inspired by Kimura 's Show And Tell Language [ Kimura ] .
The library includes a full repertoire of iterative control gateways , such as conditional terminators and the iteration count used for horizontal spreading in the above example .
The bar chart example illustrates the use of iteration to produce graphical aggregates .
This same approach is the key to Fabrik 's handling of music and animation .
8 Type System
In order to validate ( or prohibit ) wiring attempts in Fabrik , a type is associated with each component pin .
Fabrik currently supports primitive ( record ) types , bundled types , array types , and enumerated types .
Primitive types are defined by the primitive data operations in the system , e.g. , Number , Boolean , Character , Grapheme , etc .
Bundled types are defined via bundler components that allow non-homogeneous element types .
Each element type can in turn be any of the above types .
The order is defined by the connections to the prong pins of the bundler component .
Array types must have homogeneous element types , although their size does not matter for compatibility .
An enumerated type defines a set of actual values allowed .
Each primitive component assigns a type for each of its pins restricting input and output to specified types .
When a user places the mouse over a pin , the pin name and type are shown to assist connection of the correct pin .
When a pin is about to be connected to another pin , type checking is performed .
If the two types match , the connection is allowed ; otherwise , a message is displayed in a status panel and the connection is not made .
A primitive type can only match with other similar primitive types .
A bundled type can match with another bundled type or array type .
Two bundled types are compatible if their sizes are the same and each of the element types matches in order .
A bundled type can match with an array type only if all the element types of the bundled type are the same and match with that of the array type .
The result type is the array type .
An enumerated type can match with a primitive type if the primitive type is the same as the type of the data allowed in the enumerated type , and data is actually checked if the primitive typed data is available .
Some components have unspecified types , i.e. , their pins can be connected to any typed pins .
The result type of such a connection is the specified type or remains unspecified if both types are unspecified .
User - built components can have their pins designated with types which are either implicitly inferred from the connections to the corresponding gateways or explicitly assigned to be some known types .
Components with unspecified type also have the ability to propagate types to other pins once a connection is made to a typed pin .
For example , the selector component that selects from a set of inputs has all pins designated to be unspecified but of the same type ( except the selection pin which is of Number type ) .
Therefore when one of these pins is connected to a typed pin , that type is propagated to all the other unspecified pins of the selector , so that other connections to the selector will only be allowed if they carry that same type .
Similarly when a wire to the selector is cut , its pin type reverts to unspecified or is inferred from other pins if there are still other connections .
Thus even with the flexibility of unspecified types , every pin in the complete Fabrik diagrams will be inferred to have a type .
This makes the diagrams simple and easy to understand .
9 Compilation
Compaction of representation and speed of execution are the reasons for undertaking compilation in Fabrik .
The task of compilation here is to map the semantics of a diagram , as embodied in its interpretive behaviour when manipulated in the Fabrik layout editor , into the definition of a new class whose instances behave as specified by the diagram .
The current version of Fabrik uses the ability of Smalltalk to compile new classes and methods dynamically , and hence the code generated , as illustrated below , consists of Smalltalk methods .
Every Fabrik diagram contains a particular set of subparts ( themselves all Fabrik components ) and a particular set of what may be thought of as data slots , where each data slot corresponds to the datum beneath the " copper " of one particular wire .
Instances of a compiled class representing a Fabrik diagram hold , in instance storage , the subparts and the data slots .
Compiled methods mostly read from and store to these instance variables , making for efficient code .
The consequences of any data perturbation in a Fabrik diagram can be mapped , after a topological sort , into a linear dataflow path -- a sequence of subparts to be traversed in a specified order and in specified manners .
The compiled method representing any particular path carries out the corresponding series of traversals .
Compilation example 1 : The FtoC
Looking at the internal structure of the FtoC component shown in section 4 , we notice that the diagram has four subcomponents -- the two bidirectional arithmetical components TimesDivide and PlusMinus ( both of them in turn being components built with Fabrik ) and the two boxes that generate the conversion constants 9/5 and 32 .
Additionally , there can be seen to be five different pieces of data flowing in the wires , starting with , at center left , the datum that represents the Centigrade value , and including two invariant data constants , one intermediate result , and the Farenheit value .
After compilation , the FtoC would be represented by an object with the instance structure shown in figure 7a .
Note that there is one instance variable for each constituent subcomponent , and one instance variable for each data slot in the component 's scope .

Compilation example 2 : The FCConverter
Turning to the FCConverter , we have an even simpler diagram , and hence an even simpler instance structure .
In this case there are no traversal methods , since no data arrives from external components connected to the edge of this one .
Instead , one needs " radiation " methods , which propagate data originating spontaneously from within nested subcomponents .
Note that in this example , either of the sliders can generate new dataflow by being stimulated .
via the user interface , from either keyboard input or mouse actions .

Compilation example 3 : The Slider
The Slider , shown in figure 3 , combines elements of the two preceding compilation examples , in that it must respond both to traversal ( new value arriving on an external input pin ) and to internal change from the user interface ( user drags the slider 's bar , or types in a new value in the slider 's numeric readout panel ) .
Since it has a considerably more complex internal structure , we shall only illustrate the instance structure ( figure 9a ) , one traversal method , and one radiation method ( figure 9 b ) .
Note that there is a common subsequence of six instructions between the two illustrated methods .
Combining such common subsequences into separate methods is just one of a number of possibilities for codesize compression and code optimization arising from the basic scheme illustrated .

Compilation example 4 : Iteration
Compilation of components that iterate requires extra mechanism .
Iterating traversals are decomposed into three processing phases : pre-iterative processing , actual iteration , and post - iterative processing .
The compiled code for the actual iteration features invocation of " self iterate : " with a block as its argument .
The block describes a single traversal , and its contents are similar to other traversal code , with special code added to carry out the functions of the iterating gateways .
For example , here is the code compiled for firing the iterator illustrated in the BarChart example in Section 7 , with " x " representing the new array to be charted :
p1 : x " Pre-iteration processing " c6 import : x. " import the new collection and set up " c7 prepare to Iterate .
" initialize the collection - out gateway " " Actual iteration " self iterate : " repeat the following block until done ... " [ c6 fireOnce .
" inject the next collection element " c5 fireOnce .
" inject the current tick - count " c8 p2 : v10 p3 : v9 . " fire the bundler component " c3 p1 : v4 p2 : v3 p3 : v7 . " create a new rectangle " c4 p1 : v1 p2 : v8 .

10 History and Status
Experience with Fabrik suggests that a successful visual programming kit requires only three things :
Specification of an effective visual and computational interface for each component , interactive access to an interesting ( network ) library of existing components , and the ability to use and combine these components interactively to build new library components and finished applications .
The examples and discussion above detail Fabrik 's contribution in the areas of bidirectionality , synthetic graphics , iteration , type checking and compilation .
Fabrik began with an attempt to mix arbitrary layout and cell types in an object - oriented spreadsheet .
The spreadsheet approach broke down with the complex expressions needed for synthetic graphics and other generative structures .
The wiring approach addressed this problem and also opened the way for bidirectional constructions .
The initial Fabrik prototype was developed in Smalltalk within the Advanced Technology Group of Apple in 1985 , and was demonstrated widely within Apple in Spring of 1986 .
The type system was added during the Winter of 1987 and compilation was completed in the Spring of 1988 .
An important next step in this investigation is one of scale : to assemble a library sufficient to accomodate a large class of applications , and to support networking of this library so that many people can borrow from and experiment with each other 's work .

My iPhone - savvy 2.5 year - old daughter held an iPad for the very first time last night , and it turned out to be an interesting user - interface experiment .
As you can see , after geeking out on my Sutro Tower homescreen , she took right to it — including figuring out how to enlarge some of her favorite iPhone - legacy apps to 2 x to display full - size on the iPad screen .
If you ’re good at understanding kid -speak , you ’ll also notice that she immediately saw its potential as a video - display device .
She lamented the lack of a camera , and wondered about its potential for playing games .
On the downside , she had the same frustration as many adults , where touching the screen - edge with your thumb while holding the iPad blocks input to all home screen icons .
Notice also that she was confused by the splash page for FirstWords Animals , her favorite spelling game :
Because the start button looked like a graphic , rather than a conventional button , she could n’t figure out how to start the game .
Most of all , though , it ’s cool to consider that as one of the new Children of Cyberspace , her expectations about computing will be shaped by the fact that she ’s growing up in a touchscreen world .

Illegally built homes in east Jerusalem will be demolished in the coming days , Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch announced on Wednesday .
Aharonovitch made the comments in response to a question from MK Yariv Levin ( Likud ) , who said the Jerusalem Municipality was not carrying out orders issued against Arab homes .
The minister said there had been delays in carrying out the orders due to diplomatic concerns , but that the concerns no longer applied and that the demolitions would go ahead .
“ Police have no instructions to refrain from carrying out the demolitions .
They will be carried in the coming days , ” Aharonovitch said .
“ There were times when the political echelon thought the timing for implementing the orders was inappropriate , because of diplomatic processes .
The orders were not canceled , but were delayed .
If there were such delays , they are no longer in effect .
” The minister stressed that the Israel Police was not responsible for “ activating ” the demolition orders , and that the police ’s mission was to assist in their implementation .
Activists who oppose such demolitions , however , cried foul at the minister ’s remarks , claiming that such demolitions were a continuation of the status quo and would harm the proximity talks with the Palestinian Authority .
“ Essentially , the resumption of house demolitions goes to show that Israel really is n’t serious about negotiations , ” Jeff Halper , director of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions told The Jerusalem Post on Wednesday .
“ Aharonovitch says that there are no legal impediments to carrying out demolitions , but that ’s not true , ” Halper continued .
“ The first phase of the road map , which is officially still in effect , calls for the cessation of house demolitions and other steps thatundermine trust between the two sides .
“ That said , this is obviously not a legal or technical issue , but apolitical one , ” he added .
“ It ’s always been political .
This is a way of Israel asserting that it ’s the owner of Jerusalem , it will do what itwants to do here , and that the city is outside of negotiations .
“ It has nothing to do with the police and certainly has nothing towith ... urban [ planning ] , ” Halper said .
“ It ’s simply a continuation ofthe same thing . ”
Think rising gas prices are going crimp American driving patterns ?
Think again .
Here 's the latest from MasterCard , via Platts :
The Mastercard data , which we 've written about before , is one of many imperfect ways of trying to measure US gasoline demand .
It 's based on credit card swipes , and it comes out weekly .
The weekly information is subject to so many variables that it should probably be overlooked .
But the four - week average is probably more accurate , since it smooths out some of the variables , such as a moveable holiday like Easter , or a big weather event that keeps everyone home .
And what the report the last few weeks has been showing is that Americans have been driving a lot .
The most recent estimate of the total weekly demand , based on the four - week average , put US gasoline consumption at 67.122 million barrels .
That 's for the week ending April 2 .
It 's the second week in a row where the rolling four - week average topped 67 million barrels of total gasoline demand in the US .
Pretty impressive .
The last time we hit this level was last July .
The time before that was in August 2008 .
Here 's the really remarkable part :
Notice something ?
All those other times when the numbers exceeded 67 million barrels occurred during the summer driving season .
So despite almost 10 % unemployment , despite gasoline prices that are edging toward the $ 3/ gal mark , despite the dumping of SUVs and the love affair with hybirds , the MasterCard data suggests that Americans consumed more gasoline in March than at any time in US history .
The MasterCard data only goes back to 2004 , but gasoline consumption in the US was higher in the middle part of this decade than at any other time in history , so these MasterCard numbers for last month are revealing something that is very surprising .
About the Oil Slick and Landfall Locations
The “ estimated extent ” of the oil slick is an estimate by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of where oil is mostly likely to go based on wind and ocean current forecasts , as well as analysis of aerial photography and satellite imagery .
The “ surveyed extent ” shows areas where oil was visible on the water surface during aerial and satellite surveys of the Gulf .
The surveyed extents are not available every day and may be incomplete on occasion because poor weather conditions prevented observation in some areas .
The extents may vary widely from day to day because of changes in wind patterns and ocean currents .
The loop currents are from NOAA and from Roffer ’s Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service .
The locations where oil has made landfall are based on reports from federal , state and local officials .
They are placed on the map on the day of the earliest report , and may change as better reports become available .
( CNN ) -- Sandra
Herold , the owner of a chimpanzee that was involved in a vicious attack on her friend last year , has died , her attorney said Tuesday .
She was 72 .
Herold suffered a ruptured aortic aneurysm Monday night , Roger Golger said .
Herold " had suffered a series of heartbreaking losses over the last several years , beginning with the death of her only child , then her husband , then her beloved chimp Travis , as well as the tragic maiming of friend and employee Charla Nash , " Golger said .
Nash lost her nose , upper and lower lips , eyelids and both her hands in the attack in February 2009 , as well as the " bony structures in her mid-face , " according to doctors .
More than a year later , numerous surgeries and therapy sessions have helped Nash regain some mobility .
Her family filed a lawsuit against Herold shortly after the attack , seeking $ 50 million in damages .
Criminal charges were not filed , however , because authorities ruled Herold was not aware of the risk her pet posed .
" This past year was particularly difficult for Sandy , " Golger said .
" She hated living alone in a house where she faced constant reminders of the vibrant and happy life she once led with her family and friends .
The stress of defending a multimillion - dollar lawsuit and all that it entailed also weighed heavy on Sandy .
In the end , her heart , which had been broken so many times before , could take no more . "
The attack occurred February 16 , 2009 , when Herold called Nash for help in getting Travis back inside her house after he used a key to escape .
When Nash arrived at the Stamford , Connecticut , home , the chimp , who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca - Cola and Old Navy , jumped on her and began biting and mauling her .
Police shot Travis to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds .
The mauling has raised questions about whether exotic animals should be kept as pets .
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has said that primates and crocodiles should be added to a state list of animals that citizens are not allowed to own .
Nash was discharged from the famed Cleveland Clinic , where doctors performed the nation 's first face transplant , earlier this month .
She is continuing her recovery at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , Massachusetts , where doctors have said she is a candidate for a face transplant .
CNN 's Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report .

Clean - up operations in Gulf of Mexico
Around the world , scientists have turned their ingenuity toward looking for ways to stop the ever - expanding oil slick spreading through the Gulf of Mexico , and one answer keeps popping up : explosives .
Both in Russia and in the U.S. , some scientists are suggesting nuclear blasts to bury the oil rig and send molten rock down to seal the leak .
Other scientists say smaller , controlled explosions can stop the flow with shock waves .
Regardless of what causes the boom , however , BP would have to consent to the destruction of its leaking Deepwater Horizon well with explosives , something the company seems hesitant to do .
In a telephone conference call with reporters yesterday , Doug Suttles , the chief operating officer for BP exploration and production , said blasting around the well was " not an option we believe we would ever use , " because once done , " we would have denied ourselves all other options . "
TRENDING : The Bidens avoided paying more than $ 500,000 in payroll taxes by exploiting S corporations
A former senior analyst with the White House Office of Science and Technology , Rich Pryor , favors using multiple , simultaneous explosions to pinch the leaking pipe closed rather than a nuke to bury it .
The nuclear physicist told WND there are several good ideas available to BP , but they include sacrificing the Deepwater Horizon .
" That may be the reason [ for BP's hesitation ] , " Pryor told WND .
" Once you pinch the pipe , it 's done ; it will shut down the well . "
BP , however , has insisted its resistance is based on the use of explosives , not a desire to salvage the well .
Suttles told reporters earlier this month BP has conceded the need to " permanently plug " the gushing well and has " absolutely no intent to ever , ever produce this well . "
The nuclear option
Reports in a pair of Russian newspapers have been pushing the idea that a nuclear blast could stop the leaking oil and that the former Soviet nation has done it before successfully .
" It sounds terrible and incredible – an idiotic joke , " writes Valdimir Lagowski in the Russian daily Komsomoloskaya Pravda .
" But in fact there were several cases where catastrophes in the fields were fought this way in the former USSR – five times – when nothing else has helped . "
According to the report , the first attempt was in 1966 , when a 30 - kiloton explosion ( the Hiroshima bomb was about 20 kilotons ) extinguished a burning gas well six kilometers beneath the surface .
Lagowski reports that the nuclear solution has only failed once , when a four - kiloton explosion failed to penetrate the ground far enough .
RELATED : BP employees may face criminal charges
" Of course , we used a civilian nuclear program on the ground , and the Americans [ are working ] in the sea , " Lagowski concedes , but then claims the scientific principle is no different and " the U.S. is full of smart scientists and powerful computers . "
The Moscow Times further reported that Alexander Moskalenko , head of GCE , a St. Petersburg - based group that advises oil companies , is also suggesting the nuclear option .
The Russians , however , are n't the only ones talking nukes .
Christopher Brownfield , a former nuclear submarine officer and a visiting scholar on nuclear policy at Columbia University , wrote a piece in The Daily Beast echoing the Russian solution .
" This was not simply an aggressive urge to brandish the most beastly of weapons in our mighty American arsenal , but a serious way to snuff out an enormous problem that grows worse by the day , " Brownfield writes .
" For more than 100 years , explosives have been used to break the necks of runaway oil wells , snapping the long , narrow columns and sealing them shut with tons and tons of rock . "
Brownfield also cited the 1966 Russian experiment : " The practice was well documented by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , one of our nuclear - weapons facilities . "
But would the White House even consider a nuke ?
Earlier this month , the London Telegraph reports , President Obama 's Energy Secretary Steven Chu sent a team of nuclear physicists to BP 's main crisis center in Houston , Texas .
Included on the team was 82 - year - old Richard Garwin , who designed the first hydrogen bomb , and Tom Hunter , head of the U.S. Department of Energy 's Sandia National Labs in Albuquerque , N.M .
Still , Pryor told WND , Obama 's allies in the environmentalist movement would make it difficult for the White House to approve a nuke .
" I think there might be a lot of resistance to that , " Pryor said .
Brownfield also conceded , " Using nuclear weapons , even for peaceful purposes , would be problematic for a president who stood in Prague and declared that the world should rid itself of such devices . …
The dilemma seems clear : Either Obama leaves BP in charge of managing its own short - term interests , or he can take charge and stop this spill immediately by pulling the trigger on a nuclear option with severe political and environmental aftershocks . "
The non-nuclear option
Even Brownfield , however , has suggested BP also consider putting America 's supercomputers – instead of its super explosives – to work at solving the problem .
" Our military could potentially use a carefully placed combination of conventional explosives to collapse the well , " Brownfield suggested .
" Our technology is much better than that of the Soviet Union in 1966 , so we should be able to make this work without having to go nuclear . "
Rich Pryor
Pryor told WND of a similar plan that would n't be as haphazard as burying the well in rubble but would still use explosives to stop the flow .
Pryor 's plan involves using supercomputer - timed explosions that would send shock waves through the water to crimp closed the leaking pipe .
" The explosions I have in mind are contained in pipes sent down near the Deepwater Horizon , and you set off an explosion in each of the pipes simultaneously , " Pryor explained .
" A good friend of mine at Sandia Labs has done preliminary analysis , and it shows that it does in fact close the pipe .
" The plan does need some analysis , for you have to factor in displacing the fluid in the pipe itself .
When you try to pinch the pipe off , you have to stop the flow of oil , " Pryor said .
" The bottom line is they need to do some parameter studies : how close can they get ( BP would have to tell us ) , how deep can we make it , lots of issues that need to be addressed .
Long , running calculations are needed to determine this sort of stuff , so you would need funds to go into these labs and go do analysis and review . "
Pryor said he could n't explain in more detail because of the classified nature of his former work at Sandia Labs , but assured WND , " I know this kind of things works from experience . "
BP 's Doug Suttles , however , told reporters the company " does n't see it as a viable option . "
" The reason we would n't use explosives is we could n't control the damage .
If it failed to stop the flow , we would have denied ourselves all other options .
In addition to that , if it failed , it could also cause the flow rate to go up substantially , " Suttles said .
" We believe quite strongly .
In fact , none of the experts involved in this believe explosives should be used as a vehicle to stop the flow . "
Instead , BP has announced plans to begin its next attempt at stopping the leak tomorrow , a " top - kill operation " that pumps drilling mud at a very high rate into the pipes to overcome the flow of oil .
If it the top - kill operation is unsuccessful , Suttles announced , BP plans to attempt an " LMRP cap , " which would cut away the current pipe and refit it to pump the oil to the surface , rather than allowing it to flow freely into the water .

Once Israel ’s closest ally in the region , the Turkish government has reacted with fury at last night ’s Gaza aid ship massacre , condemning it as ‘ inhuman state terror . ’
Turkey 's Navy will reportedly protect future aid ships
The attacked ship was Turkish in origin and at least two of the slain aid workers were Turkish citizens .
Turkey says future aid ships will be dispatched with a military escort so as to prevent future Israeli attacks .
Turko - Israeli relations have been on the decline in recent months , including a staged photo - op by the Israeli Foreign Ministry designed to shame Turkey ’s ambassador .
Israel also reportedly arrested a Turkish citizen weeks ago for being a member of a humanitarian group involved with the aid ship .
Israeli officials have defended the killings as “ self defense , ” claiming the aid workers were secretly in league with al - Qaeda .
A top Israeli investment house has also called for a divestment from Turkey to protest Turkey ’s criticism of the massacre .
Where talent thrives ( Image : RESO / Rex Features )
AT EINSTEIN ’s autopsy in 1955 , his brain was something of a disappointment : it turned out to be a tad smaller than the average Joe’s .
Indeed , later studies have suggested a minimal link between brain size and intelligence .
It seems brain quality rather than quantity is key .
One important factor seems to be how well our neurons can talk to each other .
Martijn van den Heuvel , a neuroscientist at Utrecht University Medical Center in the Netherlands , found that smarter brains seem to have more efficient networks between neurons – in other words , it takes fewer steps to relay a message between different regions of the brain .
That could explain about a third of the variation in a population ’s IQ , he says .
Another key factor is the insulating fatty sheath encasing neuron fibres , which affects the speed of electrical signals .
Paul Thompson at the University of California , Los Angeles , has found a correlation between IQ and the quality of the sheaths ( The Journal of Neuroscience , vol 29 , p 2212 ) .
We still do n’t know exactly how much genes contribute to intelligence , with various studies coming up with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 per cent .
This wide range of estimates might have arisen because genes contribute more to IQ as we get older , according to a study published last year .
By comparing the intelligence of 11,000 pairs of twins , Robert Plomin of King ’s College London found that at age 9 , genes explain 40 per cent of the variation , but by 17 they account for roughly two - thirds ( Molecular Psychiatry , DOI : 10.1038/mp.2009.55 ) .

Researchers at Draper Laboratory are developing a tattoo - like implant that senses glucose levels and fluoresce different colors in response .
Someday , it could negate the need for diabetes to frequently prick their fingers for blood samples .
From Draper Laboratory :
When embedded into skin – similar to a tattoo – these nanosensors can detect and signal changes in blood glucose .
Fluorescence is used due to increased sensitivity over color changes that can be viewed with the naked eye …
This concept offers the potential to enable a diabetic to monitor blood sugar without pain , and could be applied to spot other conditions such as depleted levels of sodium , potassium , and chloride , which could be used to catch signs of dehydration in athletes and troops .

Divorce & Family Law
Going through a divorce is one of the most stressful experiences you will ever experience in your lifetime .
It can impede your ability to make sound and rational decisions that will affect your entire life and the lives of your children .
Do not rush to enter into agreements in order to try to appease the other party without first consulting with an experienced Riverside divorce attorney .
Once you enter into an agreement , it may be very difficult to set it aside to make things right again .
An experienced family law attorney can help you navigate through all aspects of a divorce and help reduce the emotional volatility which leads to making the wrong choices .
Child Custody & Child Support
As you might know , the person who is awarded primary custody of the children usually ends up receiving the monetary rewards .
In the State of California , the courts must consider granting both parties equal custody of the children unless there is some clear detriment in not doing so .
It is important that good custody orders be made early on in the proceedings as they will generally end up being written into the final judgment making them very hard to change later .
Father ’s Rights
It is extremely important that dads continue to emotionally bond with their children throughout the child ’s lifetime .
The state has said “ it is in the children ’s best interest ” to have the love and affection of both parents . . . and each parent should have as much equal time as possible they may offer the child their own unique qualities and experiences .
While a step - parent may play a role in the child ’s life , they cannot replace the natural parents lifetime of bonding and continued nurturing in the same way a genetic parent can .
As a divorce lawyer in Riverside , I understand the importance of preserving that relationship .
Spousal Support
Alimony in a marriage of long duration can be awarded to the party that can prove a financial need .
However , it is not guaranteed and can be waived if the waiver is done properly .
Once support is established it may be modified or terminated based on circumstances at that time .
I can run calculations for support in my office and provide people in Riverside , San Bernardino , and Los Angeles Counties with a good understanding as to how support works and why it is important that support orders be properly written for the protection of each party .
Paternity Disputes
The legal relationship between a father and his biological or adopted children and the rights and obligations of the father and the child to each other , as the divorce attorney at our Riverside firm understands .
Paternity may become a Department of Child Support Services in Riverside and Rancho Cucamonga issue where a state is seeking repayment of welfare benefits , establishing new child support and / or collection of past due support or arrears .
However , paternity may also be brought to establish custody and visitation orders , prove legitimacy of a child , inheritance , or to add a putative father ’s title or surname to a birth certificate .
Modifications
While all orders are modifiable before entering a final judgment , post - judgment modifications may be much more difficult as the court will apply the significant change of circumstance rule as a prerequisite before even considering any changes .
However , no change of circumstances may be needed if the party is seeking only to alter a co-parenting schedule ( the amount of time the child spends in each parent ’s household ) under a joint custody order .
The only standard the moving parent must meet in such cases is the child ’s best interest standard .
It is advisable to set up a consultation with a Riverside Divorce Lawyer to review your judgment prior to applying to the court for a modification .
It may end up saving you time , money and frustration later .
Grandparents Rights
I have been fighting on behalf of grandparents for more than 20 years to ensure they remain a part of their grandchildren ’s life .
Children are already suffering when parents divorce and it is not right that they might not continue a relationship with their grandparents because one or both parents are denying them visits .
In some cases , one parent may be deceased , in prison , or found to be unfit to parent and has no custodial time to share with the grandparents .
Under the current law , the court ’s are mandated to consider “ best interest of the grandchildren ” after a pre-existing and beneficial relationship has been established .
As a divorce lawyer serving the Riverside area , I have helped many grandparents obtain visitation orders and very likely can help you .
Probate
Probating an estate is the legal process of transferring property upon a person ’s death to other person (s ) whom may have a legitimate interest in such property , by finding the intentions of the deceased person .
In many cases this involves proving the legitimacy of a Will and Last Testament of which is filed with the court .
In some cases there may be no Will documents and the estate might be divided by intestate succession .
I have litigated many cases where the Will was challenged by another interested person .
The process can be lengthy taking at least six months before the estate can be divided and will require a probate accounting .
However , there are three primary ways to avoid probate : joint ownership with the right of survivorship , gifts , and revocable trusts .
I am experienced in all areas of probate and the tools needed to avoid probate .
I am also experienced at will contests , trust contests , accountings , and negotiation with creditors .
It is recommended you not attempt to probate an estate without professional help .
Conservatorship
A conservatorship is a legal concept wherefrom a conservatee or guardian is appointed by a judge to manage the daily and / or financial affairs of another person whom is found to be incompetent due to some physical or mental limitation , or old age .
The court may grant different types of conservatorship including limited conservatorship where a responsible person gains orders and letters to assist an adult with developmental disabilities to assist with a person ’s personal and / or financial needs .
Conservators can be reimbursed for expenses , and paid for their services , from the assets of the person they are giving care .
This includes the costs of bringing the conservatorship to the courts including reimbursement for attorney fees and other expenses .
If you have been pre-nominated or if you believe a loved one is in need of a conservatorship , you may wish to call my office for a consultation and review before another person or even the public guardian gets involved with your loved ones life .
Guardianships
Guardianship is a proceeding where a court orders someone other than the child ’s parents to have custody of a child ( ren ) or to manage a child ’s property .
The person who gains letters and orders of guardianship over the child has legal authority to manage every aspect of the child ’s life including who can and cannot have contact with the child .
In some cases , the guardianship may be limited to financial affairs only or a person may be appointed temporary guardian for a period of time until a final determination may be made .
A guardian like a conservator may be “ nominated ” in advance by a child ’s parents in a legal document such as a will .
Please contact my office for a complete review of your specific need and detailed review .
Pre-nuptial Agreement
A pre-nuptial agreement is a binding contract and enforceable in the State of California and other states if it is drafted properly .
It becomes effective upon the marriage and continues in full force and effect for as long as the contract exists and can be drafted with limitations in how long it will remain in force , which property and / or rights will be affected , what remains community property , and can be drafted to eliminate all presumptions under state law .
A good pre-nuptial agreement should include marital law and presumptions under law and clearly define how the parties by the contract agree to have their estate divided in the event of a divorce .
It should be reviewed by a practicing divorce attorney in Riverside who is familiar with such agreements .
[ Family Code Sections 1610 - 1617 ] .
Wills & Trusts
A will is a legal document that basically does four things : ( 1 ) It gives instructions and wishes as to how you wish your estate to be divided after your death ; ( 2 ) it names the beneficiaries whom you wish to benefit from your assets at the time of your death ; ( 3 ) it allows you to choose an executor to manage and distribute your assets ; and ( 4 ) it allows you to nominate a guardian to care for your children if you die while they are still minors .
A trust goes even further as it allows you to transfer title of property you own now or will own in the future to a separate yet still owned and controlled legal entity called “ the trust of . . . ” which allows you to transfer property to and from that trust for an unlimited amount of time until the trust becomes irrevocable .
It avoids probate court if the documents are properly drafted and title of property is properly recorded .
It allows your successor trustee to directly transfer property to your beneficiary or to a guardian to hold the property until that beneficiary becomes of legal age .
I have experience in drafting a variety of trust documents including , but not limited to , second marriage trusts , family trusts , single person trusts , significant other trusts , and other special interest trusts based on your individual needs .

( CNN ) --
The American Academy of Pediatrics has rescinded a controversial policy statement raising the idea that doctors in some communities should be able to substitute demands for female genital cutting with a harmless clitoral " pricking " procedure .
" We retracted the policy because it is important that the world health community understands the AAP is totally opposed to all forms of female genital cutting , both here in the U.S. and anywhere else in the world , " said AAP President Judith S. Palfrey .
The contentious policy statement , issued in April , had condemned the practice of female genital cutting overall .
But a small portion of statement suggesting the pricking procedure riled U.S. advocacy groups and survivors of female genital cutting .
In the April statement , the group raised the idea that some physicians should be able to prick or nick a girl 's clitoral skin in order to " satisfy cultural requirements . "
The group likened the nick to an ear piercing .
On Thursday the AAP stated the group will not condone doctors to provide any kind of " clitoral nick . "
The AAP also clarified nicking a girl or woman 's genitals is forbidden under a 1996 federal law banning female genital mutilation .
" I cried and told them how grateful I am , " said Soraya Mire , a Somali filmmaker and survivor of female genital cutting .
" Thank you for understanding us survivors and hearing our voices . "
Equality Now , an international advocacy group fighting to end female genital cutting , echoed a similarly appreciative response .
" We welcome the AAP 's decision to withdraw its 2010 policy statement on FGM , " said Lakshmi Anantnarayan , a spokeswoman at Equality Now .
" This is a crucial step forward in the movement to raise awareness about female genital mutilation . "
Up to 140 million women and children worldwide have been affected by female genital cutting , according to the World Health Organization .
Any process that alters or injures female genitalia for non-medical purposes is considered to be female genital cutting , the group says .
Female genital cutting -- also referred to as female genital mutilation and female circumcision -- is a ritual dating back thousands of years .
It 's typically practiced in parts of Africa , Asia and the Middle East .
In some communities , it 's strongly believed that genital cutting marks a woman 's journey to adulthood .
The WHO reports that cutting typically occurs between infancy and 15 years of age .
Several types of female circumcision exist and may differ in each community , according to the WHO .
The most brutal type of cutting requires stitching together the inner or outer labia .
It 's a procedure notoriously performed in parts of Somalia and Egypt .
Other less - severe forms of genital cutting may require excising the entire clitoris or part of the clitoris .
Mire , the Somali filmmaker and survivor , received the most severe type of circumcision when she was 13 years old in her home country .
She now lives in Los Angeles , California , where she helps African immigrant families in the United States , who she believes may be subjected to the pressures of female genital cutting .
While the female circumcision is outlawed in the United States , Mire and other advocates believe there are American girls in immigrant communities at risk of being sent overseas to have the procedure completed .
The AAP 's original policy statement increased the threat of cutting among immigrant and refugee girls in the U.S. , advocacy efforts say , because the group suggested a " pricking " compromise was acceptable .
In the U.S. , an estimated 228,000 women have been cut -- or are at risk of being cut -- because they come from an ethnic community that practices female genital cutting , according an analysis of 2000 Census data conducted by the African Women 's Health Center at Brigham and Women 's Hospital .
Read about the pressures of female genital cutting in the U.S .
Last month , Rep. Joseph Crowley , D - New York , and Rep. Mary Bono Mack , R - California , addressed concerns of female genital cutting being planned on U.S. grounds .
The legislators proposed an amendment to the existing law that would imprison parents who send their daughters overseas for the procedure .
Mire said she was in disbelief when she first read the AAP 's original statement about six weeks ago .
She could n't sleep .
She could n't eat .
She 's dedicated her time to calling legislators , survivors and advocacy groups to pressure AAP to change its original policy statements .
Her efforts worked , she learned on Wednesday from a personal phone call from the academy .
" I slept so well last night , " she said .
" I woke up smiling . "
Party officials and the candidates themselves acknowledge that they still have uphill fights in both the primaries and the general elections , but they say that black Republicans are running with a confidence they have never had before .
They credit the marriage of two factors : dissatisfaction with the Obama administration , and the proof , as provided by Mr. Obama , that blacks can get elected .
Image Allen West , running in Florida , says the notion of racism in the Tea Party movement has been made up by the news media .

“ I ran in 2008 and raised half a million dollars , and the state party did n’t support me and the national party did n’t support me , ” said Allen West , who is running for Congress in Florida and is one of roughly five black candidates the party believes could win .
“ But we came back and we ’re running and things are looking great . ”
But interviews with many of the candidates suggest that they felt empowered by Mr. Obama ’s election , that it made them realize that what had once seemed impossible — for a black candidate to win election with substantial white support — was not .
“ There is no denying that one of the things that came out of the election of Obama was that you have a lot of African - Americans running in both parties now , ” said Vernon Parker , who is running for an open seat in Arizona ’s Third District .
His competition in the Aug. 24 primary includes the son of former Vice President Dan Quayle , Ben Quayle .
Princella Smith , who is running for an open seat in Arkansas , said she viewed the president ’s victory through both the lens of history and partisan politics .
“ Aside from the fact that I disagree fundamentally with all his views , I am proud of my nation for proving that we have the ability to do something like that , ” Ms. Smith said .
We all know that Ronald and Nancy Reagan consulted astrologers , but apparently the 40th president was also well - versed in the writings of occult scholar Manly P. Hall , most famous for his 1928 tome The Secret Teachings of All Ages .
Over at the Washington Post , former BB guestblogger Mitch Horowitz , author of the excellent " Occult America : The Secret History of How Mysticism Shaped Our Nation , " explores the Reagan - Hall connection .
From the Washington Post :
Hall 's concise volume ( " The Secret Destiny of America " ) described how America was the product of a " Great Plan " for religious liberty and self - governance , launched by a hidden order of ancient philosophers and secret societies .
In one chapter , Hall described a rousing speech delivered by a mysterious " unknown speaker " before the signing of the Declaration of Independence .
The " strange man , " wrote Hall , invisibly entered and exited the locked doors of the Philadelphia statehouse on July 4th , 1776 , delivering an oration that bolstered the wavering spirits of the delegates .
" God has given America to be free ! " commanded the mysterious speaker , urging the men to overcome their fears of the noose , axe , or gibbet , and to seal destiny by signing the great document .
Newly emboldened , the delegates rushed forward to add their names .
They looked to thank the stranger only to discover that he had vanished from the locked room .
Was this , Hall wondered , " one of the agents of the secret Order , guarding and directing the destiny of America ? "
At a 1957 commencement address at his alma mater Eureka College , Reagan , then a corporate spokesman for GE , sought to inspire students with this leaf from occult history .
" This is a land of destiny , " Reagan said , " and our forefathers found their way here by some Divine system of selective service gathered here to fulfill a mission to advance man a further step in his climb from the swamps . "
Reagan then retold ( without naming a source ) the tale of Hall 's unknown speaker .
" When they turned to thank the speaker for his timely words , " Reagan concluded , " he could n't be found and to this day no one knows who he was or how he entered or left the guarded room . "
Reagan revived the story in 1981 , when Parade magazine asked the president for a personal essay on what July 4th meant to him .
Presidential aide Michael Deaver delivered the piece with a note saying , " This Fourth of July message is the president 's own words and written initially in the president 's hand , " on a yellow pad at Camp David .
Reagan retold the legend of the unknown speaker – this time using language very close to Hall 's own : " When they turned to thank him for his timely oratory , he was not to be found , nor could any be found who knew who he was or how had come in or gone out through the locked and guarded doors . "
Sometimes , your bedroom is n’t enough .
When you want to get intimate with your significant other , somehow hanging out in your bedroom just wo n’t cut it .
Most especially if you live with other people .
Even though you ’re in the safety of your own room , does n’t it feel just weird thinking other people are walking about just on the opposite side of your door ?
And at any minute , they might barge in when you ’re at you ’re most vulnerable .
Yeah , that does n’t sound sexy or romantic at all !
Save yourself and your relationship the embarrassment by just doing it somewhere else .
But where ?
What ’s a good place to be intimate with an assurance that you wo n’t get disturbed ?
Well , if you have a home gazebo , you can do it there .
And if you turned your gazebo into one of those hot tub spa enclosures , even better !
It ’s a perfect place to be intimate !
But you will need other things to really set in the mood .
These might help .
A Fireplace
Okay , you might be thinking , “ You ’re already going to be warm with the hot tub , why put in a fireplace ? ”
Well , for one thing , just because you ’re in your hot tub enclosure does n’t mean you have to be dipping .
You can just be doing it in that extra space made even cozier with a fireplace .
And when winter comes , you ’ll feel even warmer with two things warming you up .
Finally , there ’s really something so romantic about sitting by the fire , do n’t you think ?
Scented Candles
In all honesty , this should have been on top of this list .
It ’s just that a fireplace required a lot more work incorporating into a hot tub spa enclosure .
But if you do n’t want to go that route , lighting scented candles might be better for you .
It wo n’t warm you up as nicely as a fireplace , but it will soften the mood inside with such scintillating scents .
The more it smells so good inside your backyard space , the more you ’ll both get into the mood .
Moody Music
Arguably , nothing gets one into the mood for intimacy than music .
Everyone has them , some even have quite unique choices .
Whatever floats their boat !
As long as the sounds will get them to loosen up and release their inhibitions , there ’s no judgment here .
So if you ever plan on using your hot tub gazebo for a little alone time with your significant other , do n’t forget your speakers .
Just playing tunes from your phone might not be enough to really change the atmosphere .
Wind Chimes
No speakers ?
No problem !
Sure , the right song can get you both in the mood , but weirdly enough , wind chimes often have the same effect as well .
For one thing , it ’s an entirely relaxing instrument .
As the evening breeze wafts its way into your hot tub spa enclosure , the gentle tones keep up a peaceful and soothing melody .
Couple that with the silence of serenity and you ’ll both feel that you ’re the only two people in the world .
Does n’t that sound just lovely ?
Dim Lights
Now for the lighting .
When you already have your scented candles , this wo n’t be a problem as much .
Those babies will get you in the mood faster than you can dip your whole body in your jacuzzi .
But what if you do n’t go for candles ?
Fairy lights are great alternatives .
They provide the right amount of light that you can still see your partner , but then it wo n’t be too bright that the whole thing will feel awkward .
Champagne and Ice
You ca n’t have a hot date in your hot tub enclosure and not have champagne dipped in a bucket full of ice .
You just can ’t !
A great date is nothing without a little alcohol and champagne provides the right tinge of a buzz without the risk of getting too drunk .
In fact , just a sip or two and you ’re guaranteed to get into the mood right away .
And here ’s to hoping it will have the same effect on your partner too !
Something Soft
Intimacy is all about the master of touch .
But before you start off touching each other , it ’s important to get you into the right mood first .
Why not start with something soft ?
Think pillows , blankets , and even plush toys !
When you ’re sitting by the fire in your hot tub gazebo , you can warm yourselves up with a delicate blanket made out of velvet .
Or when you ’re both enjoying the warm water in your hot tub , a nice pillow for your heads will work wonders !
Soft Curtains
Something soft that you would n’t need to feel yourself are curtains .
How can curtains get you into the mood , you ask ?
Firstly , they will make the hot tub spa enclosure a lot more private , without , however , keeping off all the moonlight from outside .
Secondly , seeing chiffon curtains waft against the evening breeze might make you feel some type of way .
A way that can better encourage your intimacy .
All in all , when decorating your hot tub gazebo for intimacy , do n’t forget your soft curtains !
Sweeties
You do n’t want to get intimate on an empty stomach , right ?
You ’re going to need a lot of energy to perform your best , why not get your stomach filled first before doing the deed ?
However , you do n’t want a full - course meal either .
That might get you to feel too full and bloated to do anything at all .
Meet halfway and just serve some sweet desserts .
A slice fo cheesecake might do , or even a bowl of strawberries and some whipped cream .
Handy Mints
But after munching on those sweets , remember to take a few mints before kissing .
There have been too many instances where one ’s bad breath will kill the mood instantly .
And to save you a trip of going back to your main house to brush your teeth , a few breath mints will do .
One gasp of that scintillating fresh scent and your partner will definitely swoon with delight .
And as another pro-tip , save those mints for after your intimate time as well .
You never know , you might need them again !
Every day can be Valentine ’s Day in your hot tub spa enclosure when you have any or all of these things .
They may not seem much now , but when the time is right , they ’ll definitely work their magic !
A VIDEO game addict clocked up a new high score on arcade classic " Asteroids " - smashing the previous record set 28 years ago .
Locksmith John McAllister , 41 , played the simple joystick - controlled shooting game for 58 hours straight to rack up 41,338,740 points , The Sun reported .
The marathon gaming session was even broadcast live over the internet from his pal 's basement in Portland , Oregon .
" The Asteroids high score record is considered a holy grail .
It 's a title that a lot of people would want , and I wanted it , " he told KGW - TV .
The previous high score of 41,336,440 was set by 15 - year - old Scott Safran in 1982 - the longest - held high score of all time .
McAllister went without sleep during his game , which could not be paused , and racked up enough extra lives to dash to the toilet without getting a game over .
His score needs to be verified by official referees before he is entered into the record books .
Asteroids was released in arcades in 1979 by computer giant Atari .
The player controls a spaceship and the goal is to shoot down asteroids and flying saucers .
Did you ever wonder what happened to the solar panels that Jimmy Carter put on the White House roof in 1979 ?
When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 he unceremoniously tore them down .
So where are they now ?
After being kept in storage ( maybe in the White House basement ? ) for about a decade , they were donated to Unity College in Maine and installed on the cafeteria roof .
They ’re still there today :
Creating a new provincial retailer , overseen by the LCBO , to ensure safe and socially responsible distribution of recreational cannabis through stand - alone stores and an online order service .
Approximately 150 stand - alone stores will open by 2020 , including 40 stores by July 2018 , rising to 80 by July 2019 ;
Setting a minimum age of 19 to use , buy , possess and cultivate cannabis ;
Banning the use of cannabis in public places , workplaces and motor vehicles
Regulating the smoking and vaping of medical cannabis under the SFOA 2017 .
After the June provincial election , the new PC government changed the cannabis retail model .
Instead of stand - alone LCBO - run storefronts , cannabis will only be available for purchase via an online retail platform provided by the Ontario Cannabis Store as of October 17th .
The government also announced that consultations would begin immediately for a private retail model that will launch by April 1 , 2019 .

Another area in which higher rates are likely to affect consumers is credit card use .
And last week , the Federal Reserve reported that the average interest rate on credit cards reached 14.26 percent in February , the highest since 2001 .
That is up from 12.03 percent when rates bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2008 — a jump that amounts to about $ 200 a year in additional interest payments for the typical American household .
With losses from credit card defaults rising and with capital to back credit cards harder to come by , issuers are likely to increase rates to 16 or 17 percent by the fall , according to Dennis Moroney , a research director at the TowerGroup , a financial research company .
“ The banks do n’t have a lot of pricing options , ” Mr. Moroney said .
“ They ’re targeting people who carry a balance from month to month . ”
Similarly , many car loans have already become significantly more expensive , with rates at auto finance companies rising to 4.72 percent in February from 3.26 percent in December , according to the Federal Reserve .
Washington , too , is expecting to have to pay more to borrow the money it needs for programs .
The Office of Management and Budget expects the rate on the benchmark 10 - year United States Treasury note to remain close to 3.9 percent for the rest of the year , but then rise to 4.5 percent in 2011 and 5 percent in 2012 .
The run-up in rates is quickening as investors steer more of their money away from bonds and as Washington unplugs the economic life support programs that kept rates low through the financial crisis .
Mortgage rates and car loans are linked to the yield on long - term bonds .
Besides the inflation fears set off by the strengthening economy , Mr. Gross said he was also wary of Treasury bonds because he feared the burgeoning supply of new debt issued to finance the government ’s huge budget deficits would overwhelm demand , driving interest rates higher .
Goldman knew it profited in crisis
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Internal Goldman
Sachs e-mails released on Capitol Hill Saturday show how the firm used bets on mortgage securities in a bid to profit as the housing market began to plummet several years ago .
A lawmaker set to grill company executives on Tuesday says the documents show that Goldman executives knew their bets would profit the firm .
But the firm said that all of the documents turned over to the panel reveal a different picture -- that the firm lost $ 1.2 billion in residential mortgage - backed securities in 2007 and 2008 .
" Of course we did n't dodge the mortgage mess , " Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein told company executives in an e-mail dated Nov. 18 , 2007 that was released by both the committee and Goldman .
" We lost money , then made more than we lost because of shorts , " or trading bets aimed at profiting when a bond drops in value .
But Blankfein added : " Also , it 's not over , so who knows how it will turn out ultimately . "
Four Goldman exhibits were released by Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , who chairs the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation of the Senate Homeland Security Committee .
The e-mails , Levin said , " show that , in fact , Goldman made a lot of money by betting against the mortgage market " and contradict the firm 's claim that it was merely buying and selling securities for clients .
The dispute previews an expected showdown on Tuesday when Blankfein and other Goldman executives appear before Levin 's committee .
For Goldman ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , one of Wall Street 's most profitable banks , the stakes are enormous .
The firm is staring down fraud charges filed April 16 by the Securities & Exchange Commission for failing to disclose conflicts in a 2007 sale of mortgage securities .
Among the other Goldman executives scheduled to testify Tuesday is Fabrice Tourre , the only individual named in the SEC lawsuit .
' We will be making some serious money '
The Blankfein e-mail was part of one of the exhibits released by the panel in advance of the hearing .
In a second exhibit , Goldman Sachs management committee member Donald Mullen , on hearing of a Moody 's mortgage downgrade that would cause losses for many investors , said of the company 's bets against those securities : " Sounds like we will be making some serious money . "
A third exhibit released by the panel describes the impact of a wipeout of a Long Beach Mortgage Securities Corp. security by saying the " bad news " of the loss costs the firm $ 2.5 million , but the " good news " is that " we own protection " against the loss .
" We make $ 5 mm , " meaning $ 5 million , the e-mail said .
The Senate committee said the fourth document , much of which has been redacted , describes a big loss in the mortgage market in July 2007 .
" Tells you what might be happening to people who do n't have the big short , " David Viniar , Goldman 's chief financial officer , said in an e-mail .
The SEC alleges that Goldman allowed Paulson & Co. , a New York - based hedge fund , to help select securities in a collateralized debt obligation known as Abacus 2007 - ACl , without telling other investors that Paulson was betting the CDO 's value would decline .
When the value of the CDO plunged shortly after it was issued , Paulson walked away with $ 1 billion , while investors lost the same amount , the SEC said .
In a response Saturday to CNNMoney.com , Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag said the firm has turned over documents showing that it did not make a significant amount of money in the mortgage market in 2007 and 2008 .
" In its statement , the U.S. Senate Subcommittee has cherry - picked just four e-mails from the almost 20 million pages of documents and e-mails provided to it by Goldman Sachs , " van Praag said .
" It is concerning that the subcommittee seems to have reached its conclusion even before holding a hearing . "
Among the documents released by Goldman was a 12 - page report on risk management and the residential mortgage market prepared for the Senate hearing .
Topics addressed included the accusation of dealing against some of the firm 's clients .
" Goldman Sachs did not engage in some sort of massive ' bet ' against our clients , " the report said .
" The risk management of the firm 's exposures and the activities of our clients dictated the firm 's overall actions , not any view of what might or might not happen to any security or market . "
Goldman also released several e-mails written by Tourre that show his belief that the mortgage market was in trouble .
" The summary of the US subprime business is that it is not too brilliant , " Tourre tells his French girlfriend in an e-mail dated March 7 , 2007 .
He says that , according to an associate , " that business is totally dead , and the poor little subprime borrowers will not last so long !!! "
The Senate - released documents also offer a rare behind - the - scenes glimpse into Goldman 's dealings with the media .
" Tomorrow 's story will , of course , have ' balance ' ( ie stuff we do n't like ) , " van Praag wrote in an e-mail to Blankfein and other top executives about a story due to appear in the New York Times .
" The article references the extraordinary influence GS alums have , " van Praag continued in the e-mail dated Nov. 18 , 2007 .
Several former Goldman
Sachs executives have held high - level government positions -- most notably then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , the former head of the firm .
Critics say that Goldman benefits from such connections to the government .
The Times story , van Praag wrote , would not go " as far as suggesting that there is a credible conspiracy theory .
[ It ] does , however , make the point that it feels like GS is running everything . "

‘ A Republican was here .
What gives you the right to propagandize impressionable kids ? ’
Teachers at a middle school in Portland , Maine , are upset with attendees of a Republican convention who rifled through teachers ’ materials in a classroom they were using and reportedly stole materials from the room , replacing it with GOP slogans .
Officials from the Maine Republican Party quickly apologized this week after local news sources reported on an incident at Portland ’s King Middle School .
Eighth - grade social studies teacher Paul Clifford returned to his classroom following a meeting of the Knox County Republican caucus there to find that his teachers ’ materials had been rifled through and a poster outlining the history of the US labor movement was missing , replaced with a bumper sticker that reads , “ Working People Vote Republican , ” reports the Portland Press - Herald .

What ’s more , according to the Bangor Daily News , the Republican operatives also rifled through a closed cardboard box containing copies of the US Constitution , donated by the American Civil Liberties Union .
And Clifford found a note nearby that stated , “ A Republican was here .
What gives you the right to propagandize impressionable kids ? ”
According to the Maine Public Broadcasting Network , the Republicans objected to ten years ’ worth of school projects showing what freedom of speech means to students :
[ Republicans ] were apparently displeased with artwork in the room — in particular , says Clifford , a series of collages that students had created over the last ten years as part of a recurring project on freedom of speech .
“ And one of the collages had a picture of George Bush standing at a podium , and he had no eyes , and it says ‘ I can see evil ’ and it shows him throwing all these different things into a trash can , like the word ‘ peace ’ and these types of things , ” Clifford says .
MPBN also reports that school officials received anonymous complaints about the nature of the materials found in the classroom .
“ We allowed them to use the space and I ’m appalled that they would go through a teacher ’s things , let alone remove something from a classroom , ” school committee member Sarah Thompson told the Press - Herald Wednesday .
“ We want the public to use school spaces , but they need to respect that it ’s a school and understand that they should leave it the way they find it . ”

The Daily News reports that the particular contingent of Maine Republicans that used Clifford ’s classroom were among the more radical participants in the state convention :
That same Knox County contingent later would lead a surprise campaign to replace the generic Republican Party platform with a new–and much more controversial –platform embodying many of the positions espoused by Tea Party activists ….
On Wednesday , Maine Republican Party Executive Director Christie - Lee McNally apologized to faculty and students at the school .
“ The King Middle School was kind enough to allow the Maine Republican Party to use their facilities , and we are deeply concerned about the lack of respect shown to the faculty , ” McNally said in a statement .
“ The Maine Republican Party does not condone the destruction of property nor does it encourage the lack of tolerance that these people demonstrated . ”
William Chapman , chairman of the Knox County Republicans , expressed regret over the incident .

“ The school administration was kind enough to let us use the facility , ” he told the Daily News .
“ We should have left it in the same condition that we found it . ”
T he records of the British Admiralty testify that James Bartley , an apprentice seaman on a whaler , was swallowed by a whale in February , 1891 , some two hundred miles east of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic .
He survived the ordeal and this is his amazing tale .
It was his first whaling voyage and he was aboard the whaling ship Star of the East .
The lookout spotted a huge sperm whale half a mile off the port bow and gave the cry ' There she blows ! '
The ship 's sails were slackened and soon her small boats were lowered .
A deadly race began between the Star of the East and the immense whale .
Young James BartIey was in the first longboat to reach the side of the prey .
They crept up from the rear , so near that the harpooner leaned over and rammed his weapon deep into the whale 's vitals .
As the stricken beast sought to free itself of the harpoon , Bartley and the other oarsmen rowed frantically to get out of reach of the massive flukes , the two - pronged tail which threshed the water to foam in the whale 's agony .
The whale sounded and eight hundred feet of heavy line streaked out of the line tub before he ended his dive .
Then an ominous slacking in the line signaled the monster was going to surface .
But where ?
The oarsmen readied themselves to pull for their lives .
Without warning there was a splintering crash which sent the longboat spinning into the air .
The whale thrashed about wildly , snapping at the men and the wreckage with its huge jaws as the water turned to a bloody froth before he sounded again .
Another longboat picked up the survivors of this encounter , but two men were missing - one of them the young apprentice , James Bartley .
The wind now deserted the Star of the East and for hours she lay becalmed , wallowing in a light swell .
Shortly before sunset , the now dead whale floated to the surface a few hundred yards from the ship .
In a longboat , the crew hastily fastened a line to the whale and the winch brought it to the ship 's side .
The hot weather climate made it imperative that the whale be cut up at once .
Having no means of raising it to the deck , the men took their flensing spades and peeled off the blubber as they slipped and slid along the immense back of this giant mammal .
Late that night , working by lantern - light , the tired crewmen removed the stomach of the whale and slowly winched it to the deck for flensing .
They were startled to notice movement inside the large sack , movement that looked like something living and breathing .
The captain called the ship 's doctor who made an incision in the tough flesh .
And out slid the doubled up missing sailor , James Bartley , as if he were suffering from severe stomach cramps .
He was alive , but unconscious .
The doctor ordered Bartley drenched with sea water , a treatment which restored his consciousness but not his reason , for he babbled incoherently .
Confined to a cabin for several weeks and bound so he could not injure himself in his wild flounderings , Bartley gradually regained his senses .
Within a month he was able to relate what had happened to him in his terrifying experience .
Bartley said that as he was cast into the water from the long boat he saw a tremendous mouth open over him and he screamed as he was engulfed by it .
He then felt sharp stabbing pains as he was swept across the teeth and then slid feet first down a slimy tube that carried him to the whale 's stomach .
He could breath , but the hot , fetid odor soon rendered him unconscious and the last thing he remembers was kicking as hard as he could at the soft , yielding stomach .
Finally , he lapsed into unconsciousness until he again came to his senses almost a month later .
As a result of his fifteen hours inside the whale 's stomach , Bartley lost all the hair on his body and was blind for the rest of his life .
His skin was bleached to an unnatural whiteness that gave the appearance of being bloodless , although he was healthy .
James
Bartley never made another trip to the sea and settled down to shore life as a cobbler in his native city of Gloucester , England .
He died eighteen years after his remarkable survival and terrifying adventure .
On his tombstone in the churchyard at Gloucester is a brief account of his experience at sea and a footnote , which says : James Bartley -1870-1909 - A Modem Jonah .

The mutation may have helped mammoths survive in the Ice Age Scientists have discovered genetic mutations that allowed woolly mammoths to survive freezing temperatures .
Nature Genetics reports that scientists " resurrected " a mammoth blood protein to come to their finding .
This protein , known as haemoglobin , is found in red blood cells , where it binds to and carries oxygen .
The team found that mammoths possessed a genetic adaptation allowing their haemoglobin to release oxygen into the body even at low temperatures .
The ability of haemoglobin to release oxygen to the body 's tissues is generally inhibited by the cold .
The resulting haemoglobin molecules are no different than ' going back in time ' and taking a blood sample from a real mammoth
Kevin Campbell
University of Manitoba
The researchers sequenced haemoglobin genes from the DNA of three Siberian mammoths , tens of thousands of years old , which were preserved in the permafrost .
The mammoth DNA sequences were converted into RNA ( a molecule similar to DNA which is central to the production of proteins ) and inserted into E. coli bacteria .
The bacteria faithfully manufactured the mammoth protein .
" The resulting haemoglobin molecules are no different than ' going back in time ' and taking a blood sample from a real mammoth , " said co-author Kevin Campbell , from the University of Manitoba in Canada .
Scientists then tested the " revived " mammoth proteins and found three distinctive changes in the haemoglobin sequence allowed mammoth blood to deliver oxygen to cells even at very low temperatures .
This is something the haemoglobin in living elephants cannot do .
" It has been remarkable to bring a complex protein from an extinct species back to life and discover important changes not found in any living species , " said co-author Alan Cooper , director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide .
Without their genetic adaptation , mammoths would have lost more energy in winter , forcing them to replace that energy by eating more .
The ancestors of woolly mammoths and modern - day elephants originated in equatorial Africa .
But between 1.2 and 2.0 million years ago , members of the mammoth lineage migrated to higher latitudes .
Writing in Nature Genetics , the scientists say that this genetic specialisation may have been crucial in allowing the ancestors of mammoths to exploit new , colder environments during Pleistocene times .

Before Fifty Shades of Grey there was Story of O , the notorious novel of dark obsession that introduced the world to erotic fiction .
How far will a woman go to express her love ?
In this exquisite and taboo novel of passion and desire , the answer emerges through a daring exploration of the deepest bonds of sensual domination .
" O " is a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer , determined to understand and prove her consuming devotion to her lover , René , through complete submission to his every whim , his every desire .
It is a journey of forbidden , dangerous choices that sweeps her through the secret gardens of the sexual underground .
From the inner sanctum of a private club where willing women are schooled in the art of subjugation to the excruciating embraces of René 's friend Sir Stephen , O tests the outermost limits of pleasure .
For as O discovers , true freedom lies in her pure and complete willingness to do anything for love .
( CNN ) --
There 's no way to stop oily water from reaching land along the Gulf Coast , but experts will use tools both massive and microscopic to clean it up .
Oil - soaked sand on beaches in the eastern Gulf Coast can be scooped up with heavy equipment , but the grassy marshes in the Mississippi Delta can't be handled that way , said Ralph Portier , a professor of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University .
Along the Louisiana and Mississippi coast , " you 're talking about a sea of grass , if you will , " similar to the Florida Everglades , Portier said .
" When it gets oiled , if you try and remove some of this stuff , you 're going to do more damage than good .
" In Gulf Shores , Alabama , and Destin , Florida , you can do that , but not here in what we like to call the Redneck Riviera , " the southern Louisiana native said .
i Report : Watch BP workers gear up for spill duty
Tides , wind and rain will drive the oil deeper into the marsh , down into the vegetative mat , making it impossible for humans to go in and clean manually , he said .
But once the flow of oil is stopped -- and no one knows when that will be -- scientists will spread fertilizer to boost several species of microscopic plants that degrade hydrocarbons such as oil .
In areas of especially heavy oiling , millions more of these microbes , grown in laboratories , could be brought in as reinforcements , Portier said .
In warm spring and summer weather , the light , sweet crude " will degrade in weeks to months , " he said .
Asphalt - like balls of petroleum embedded in the marshes " will be a little more complicated , " he said .
" The microbial community will have to bite off little pieces and degrade them a bit at a time , " he said .
There is no environmental concern with the technique because the microbes are not toxic and are native to the area , with different species thriving in fresh , brackish and salt water , Portier added .
" The question is what that long time frame will do to those plant species and what that will mean for habitat for seafood and migratory birds , " he said .
" Picture if the Everglades were being oiled , what a national tragedy that would be .
And this area is even more fragile and productive . "
The Gulf Coast is home to vast numbers of birds , animals and fish that need to be protected , said Tom MacKenzie of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
Endangered sea turtles are due to come in to shore soon and lay eggs in the coastal sand .
" A whole generation could be affected , " MacKenzie said .
Floating booms to block oil from coming in cannot protect the entire coast , he said , so crews are prioritizing sensitive wildlife areas , including nesting grounds for pelicans and butterfly migration areas .
" This has the potential to be truly devastating , " he said .
i Report : Watch booms being set up in Bay St. Louis , Mississippi
The oil spill response team has recovered 23,968 barrels ( 1,006,656 gallons ) of an oil - water mix , according to the Deepwater Horizon Joint Information Center .
Nearly 70 boats , including skimmers , tugs , barges and recovery vessels , are being used to deploy booms and chemical dispersant , which makes the oil evaporate more readily .
Another powerful tool being used to fight the oil slick is the Mississippi River itself , Portier said .
Engineers opened floodgates on Friday to divert Mississippi water through parts of the marshlands .
The force of the river water flowing toward the Gulf will help push back against the oily seawater , and later it will help flush the contamination out of the grasslands , he said .
The damage to the crawfish , shrimp and oyster populations -- and the economy that relies on them -- could be severe , Portier said .
Scientists can help rebuild the aquatic species , but many businesses could be ruined by then , he said .
" This whole economic fabric could be ripped , and that in turn will affect the cultural fabric " of the Delta region , he said .
Still , Portier remains optimistic .
" All of us Cajuns are tragically hopeful , " he said .
" My ancestors -- if you can survive yellow fever and all the other things that happened growing up in the swamps and bayous of southern Louisiana , you 'd better have a smile on your face , because that 's about all you have some days . "
There seems to be a few logical errors in the ideology and message work of the religious right , the same folks that want to force their views of God into your home and into your life .
The topic of church / state separation illustrates one of their more revealing double standards , and sources of embarrassment .
There 's a forehead slapping contradiction in their ideologies and their propaganda of how Washington is supposed to interact with their lives : when it comes to their health - care , they say ' hell no ' but when it comes to their personal beliefs about religion they resound with an approving ' hell yes ' !
So on one hand they tell us government is not the solution , but then they turn around and say how it most certainly and emphatically is the solution – to forcing their religion on others .
They want the gubment out of our homes , unless that gubment is pushing a goal that falls in line with the personal beliefs of the conservative movement – then they want the state in everyone 's house .
This is leftist thinking , is n't it ?
Are they not doing the very same thing they decry progressives and democrats for doing ?
If you 're paying attention the answer is obvious .
They actually mean to say they welcome that bumbling , idiotic , wasteful government ( they remind us of those qualities daily in their media do n't they ? ) into their highly personal beliefs about God ?
They trust those ' crooks ' in government with their God , but not their wallets , or their health - care ?
What does this observation say about their capriciousness in deciding what the state is allowed , or not allowed , to participate in ?
What can they offer against the argument that conservatives have a private agenda for the direction of government , just the same as progressives do , and are criticized by the right for having ?
So , when these hypocritical and ideologically misguided rightists beg for help and handouts from those of us they routinely patronize and denigrate as “ enemies of freedom in Washington ” – why should those ( now insulted ) people in Washington not reply by first addressing their insulter 's rude and contradictory behaviour ?
What kind of nonsense are religious conservatives trying to sell by pushing these shameful double standards on the rest of us ?
Are we supposed to accept that they should be the only ones to have access to the powers of the state ?
And thereby , would they not be usurping democracy as all of history has know it ?
What an embarrassingly stinky aroma to have to wear in public ; a stench that warns of the deeper corruption that 's reliably found in those people ( authoritarians ) who foolishly maintain double standards , and those that are also guilty of basic hypocrisy and special pleading .
I 'd instead suggest that those in favor of using the state to spread their personal religious views correct these positions and messages before demanding by force and violence ( read : using the powers of the state ) that others should have to follow their rules , or accept those conservative views as reality .
I submit that if you 're a small government conservative that also believes in establishing an official religion for our secular state , you have an ideological tenant that is n't paying its logical rent .
Have n’t had enough of Belgium yet ?
Here ’s a big golden ale in the style of a Belgian tripel , made with Belgian yeast , Belgian barley and Belgian brewing sugar .
It pours yellow - amber with a pale yellow , moderately persistent head .
The thing you notice is the dainty nose , with its suggestion of peaches and apricots .
There even seems to be a note of nutmeg and Mexican cinnamon — it ’s like pie in a glass .
Well , up to a point .
On the palate , it turns big and mouth - filling , creamy and malty , with the hops exercising a firm grip on your tongue .
The finish is long with a little kick of alcohol at the end ( the alcohol level is 9 % by volume ) .
This is a good - natured ale that would go with a lot of foods : fried chicken , grilled sausage , macaroni and cheese .

The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
With our latest “ story ” on Sarah Palin ’s voice being dubbed over for her new nature series on Discovery , a lot of people have been wondering if the animated squirrel part at the end will also happen .
In order to give Discovery as much feedback as possible , we thought a poll would be most appropriate .

Image caption China is the North 's closest ally
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is visiting South Korea amid continuing tension over the sinking - allegedly by North Korea - of a South Korean warship in March .
The issue is expected to dominate Mr Wen 's talks on Friday with the South Korean President , Lee Myung - bak .
International investigators have blamed North Korea for sinking the warship .
But China has so far refused to join in the widespread condemnation of its old ally , Pyongyang .
The Chinese state news agency Xinhua quoted the Chinese ambassador to South Korea , Zhang Xinsen , as saying the visit would " strongly boost " ties between the two countries .
The BBC 's correspondent in Seoul , John Sudworth , says however , that China is in an uncomfortable position .
Frustration
He says China 's refusal , so far , to join the strong , international condemnation of North Korea is causing frustration in Seoul .
ANALYSIS China has too much at stake to rush into any position on the sinking of the South Korean warship .
There is a chance that any instability in the region could lead to tens of thousands of North Korean refugees streaming across the long border that separates China and the North .
North Korea also acts as a buffer between China and the US - backed South .
It serves Beijing 's strategic interests to prop up Pyongyang 's current government .
China has also got its hands full managing its own developing society - the last thing it wants is trouble on its doorstep .
So China 's leaders might be privately furious at North - if indeed it did sink the Cheonan - but it will think long and hard before criticising its leaders .
There are calls for China to come off the fence and choose between its old , cold war alliance with Pyongyang and its new role as a modern , global power .
Some news reports suggest that Mr Wen will , albeit subtly and carefully , move closer to the South Korean position on this visit , choosing a form of words that at least placates some of the anger .
But , our correspondent adds , China 's priority is stability on its borders and it will be reluctant to sign up to anything it thinks will provoke its North Korean neighbour .
Meanwhile , Japan has said it is tightening its already stringent sanctions against North Korea .
It said it was lowering the amount of cash which individuals can send to North Korea without declaring it from 10 m yen ( £ 110,000 : £ 75,000 ) to 3 m yen .
The parliament in Tokyo also passed a bill to enable the Japanese coastguard to inspect vessels on the high seas suspected of carrying North Korean weapons or nuclear technology , in line with a 2009 UN Security Council resolution .
The Associated Press news agency quoted the head of the Public Security Intelligence Agency as saying he had ordered officials to keep a closer eye on the some one million North Koreans living in Japan .
SINKING OF CHEONAN - KEY DATES March 26 : Explosion hits naval corvette near disputed maritime border , killing 46 on board
May 20 : Independent investigators produce proof North Korean torpedo struck vessel
May 24 : South Korea declares trade with North frozen , demands apology
May 25 : North Korea announces it is severing all ties with South Korean propaganda fight Korean War armistice Q&A : Cheonan sinking Timeline : North Korean attacks
Since being accused of the torpedo strike on the South Korean ship , North Korea has said it will scrap an agreement aimed at preventing accidental naval clashes with South Korea .
It also warned of an immediate attack if the South 's navy violated the disputed Yellow Sea borderline .
On Tuesday , North Korea announced it would sever all ties with the South .
The Yellow Sea was the site of deadly naval skirmishes in 1999 and 2002 .
The two states are technically still at war after the Korean conflict ended without a peace treaty in 1953 .
As lockdown eases across the country , the engineering and manufacturing sectors are showing positive signs of the economy improving , with the PMI for manufacturing alone rising from 40.7 in May to 50.1 in June .
So , as the industry begins to make its way back to recovery , businesses may be asking themselves these questions :
​ How will you bounce back as a business ?
How as a business will you cope as the market continues to improve in the coming months ?
Are you nervous about increasing permanent headcount ?
How will you ensure that you can increase capability whilst there is still uncertainty ?
How will your recruitment strategy change ?
​How hiring an engineering contractor can help youHiring contractors is a great strategy to increase skills and grow teams especially when requirements are constantly changing .
Contractors can be extremely useful in times like these as businesses try to balance their headcount and changing productivity levels .
There are many benefits that contractors can provide to your organisation , and we ’ve outlined them all for you here : ​1 . There is a large pool of skilled engineering contractors availableWe have been supporting the manufacturing industry for decades , which means we have built up an extensive database of contractors for our clients .
We have contractors available across all types of roles , so whether its a hands - on manufacturing role or a senior appointment you need , we are able to deliver contractors suited to your exact requirements .
​2 . You can hire contractors quickly and safely through our Covid - 19 safe hiring processOur new innovative hiring technology ATA Connect , allows us to remotely record interviews which are instantly available to you through the ATA Connect portal .
This gives you a first look at the contractor prior to your interview with them , dramatically reducing the time to hire while operating safely during the pandemic .
​ Here is what one of our clients thinks of ATA Connect : " Our team at Terex found the ATA - Connect extremely helpful towards filling one of our recent vacant roles .
The video software gave us the opportunity to be involved right from the beginning and have increased visibility and control of the shortlisting process .
The video screening was not only super - fast and efficient but also made the whole experience a lot more personal and interactive .
I would definitely recommend it for any business and candidates who want to make the most out of the process . ” ​3 . End to end solutionATA Recruitment has an end to end portal solution to keep all of your contractor information in one place .
Whether that be live vacancies , CV submissions from various recruitment agencies , spend analysis , timesheet approvals and invoicing .
You can utilise this portal as a neutral vendor or as a managed service provider , making it a flexible and versatile solution .
​ 4 . Reduced time to hireATA Contract has an average time to hire of 4.5 days from vacancy brief to offer acceptance .
This shows that you can access those niche - skills quickly , making your business flexible and ready to cope with increases and decreases in demand .
​5. Contractors are a flexible resourceThe great benefit of using contractors is that you can engage with them quickly and release them quickly .
Usually , contractors have a very short notice period and the process to let them go is n’t complex , you are paying for a service and if you decide you no longer need that service , you can stop using it .
Contractors understand the nature of this and know they could one day be engaged on a contract and the next let go .
​ 6 . It is n’t as expensive as you think It ’s impossible to determine the cost of hiring an engineering contractor – this will completely depend on the experience they have , the work required , and the sector they ’ll be operating in .
You may panic when you see a daily contract rate , but keep in mind that there are no other costs involved , such as holiday pay or sick pay .
The contractor is only paid for the time they work , which is great value for money , considering how sickness pay alone can impact your annual salary bill .
​7 . Payroll is coveredContractors are typically paid weekly , and we have a fantastic back office team that manages this all for you .
All you have to do is , approve the timesheets and we ’ll do the rest .
We will make sure there are no issues with the contractors pay and any queries will be dealt with by the team directly with the contractor . ​ 8 .

Hi. Grandma Mary here .
Thanks Maureen for letting me do a guest post on this lovely blog .
It ’s nice to get out and about once in awhile !
For those of you who do n’t know me , I have a social media blog over at www.GrandmaMaryShow.com and I try to spice up my social media tutorials a little and make learning fun .
If your non -profit is not using social media yet – it ’s time to get on this train because it ’s leaving the station , people !
The cornucopia of benefits include fund raising , increased exposure , event buzz and recruiting volunteers .
Fundraising gets a lot of attention , and rightly so because you need funds !
But some of you also need an army of volunteers to make a difference .
Twitter and Facebook can help .
Here are four ways to start finding new volunteers .
1. Connect with local people on Twitter
Once you sign up for Twitter , use www.Twellow.com to search for people in your area to start following .
Once you follow them , talk to them !
Say Hi .
Before you invite them to volunteer , make sure you know a little about them and you ’ve talked to them .
Remember , Twitter is like a big cocktail party and the social rules still apply .
You would just come into a room full of people and walk up to someone and say “ Would you like to volunteer for our event ? ”
No , that ’s just rude !
Say hi , retweet them , reply to something funny they said .
Connect first .
2. Use Facebook to communicate with your volunteers
Every non-profit should have a Facebook Fan Page so people can “ Like ” you .
But you also may want to consider a Facebook Group specifically for your volunteers .
Groups are an effective way to communicate on Facebook because you can send a mass e-mail .
Your Fan Page posts go into your Fans Newsfeed but they may get missed if someone is n’t on Facebook in a couple days .
If you use a Group and send an e-mail that goes into people ’s Facebook e-mail and is a little more likely to be seen .
3. Use Twitter and Facebook to create buzz for your event
On Facebook , create an Event either in your Group for your volunteers or on your Fan Page .
Invite people and encourage them to invite their friends – go viral , baby !
On Twitter , create a special hashtag for your event .
A hashtag ( ie. #smss10 , which is Social Media Success Summit ’ 10 – you would create your own acronym ) allows people on Twitter to see everyone ’s tweets who have that hashtag in it .
You can use www.Tweetchat.com or just www.search.twitter.com to filter Twitter based on that hashtag .
Hashtags can create buzz , connect people and help you communicate during the event .
4 . Take advantage of the viral nature of social media to find more volunteers
I ’ve already alluded to using social media to go viral and there are things you can do to help it go viral .
Make sure you are educating your fans , followers , likers and people about how they can spread the word .
Tell them exactly how they can invite their friends to your Facebook event .
Ask people to retweet your special events .
Connect with influencers to get your message out in front of more people .
There you have it .
You need volunteers for your non-profit events and social media can help .
But it ’s going to take time and consistent participation .
You are building relationships .
Do n’t just try it for a couple days and give up .
Because you are gonna be big baby !
Less than a year ago , veteran strategy game designer ( Civilization II , Rise Of Nations ) Brian Reynolds left Big Huge Games for Zynga , developer and publisher of the most popular games on Facebook , like FarmVille and Mafia Wars .
It was a surprising move , since these games were largely perceived as being less - than - compelling from a design perspective -- and it seemed like a guy with a background in complicated strategy titles might not fit in with the casual , social bent of the company .
Since that time , it 's become more and more apparent that social games are on the rise ; major developers of console and PC games , on the other hand , have shut down and had layoffs .
Many people will be making the transition to the new market whether they want to or not .
The good news is that Reynolds , however , has a genuine enthusiasm and interest for the space .
Here , he details what he finds most fascinating , challenging , and exciting about his work at Zynga .
When you made the leap , were you anticipating the market transition , or did you just see an opportunity that you liked ?
BR : Well , the interesting thing for me and my sort of life story in general -- I mean , I 've been making games 19 and a half years , something like that -- is that usually , the kind of game I 'm making , I 'm making it because , partially , it 's the thing that I 'm addicted to right now .
( Laughs )
Like , I see new kinds of games , and I want to make 'em , and then I kind of learn about them and do them for awhile ... and whatever 's the next thing and so on .
There was also the sort of serendipitous timing of my company , after we had sold it ... to THQ and THQ resold it ; well , that let me off all my covenants and stuff .
It was like , " Hey !
I 'm a free man !
I can do what I want ! "
Facebook games were what I was playing .
I had gotten back in touch with an old friend from EA who was now a VC for Zynga , and I was playing Scramble and Mafia Wars and that kind of stuff .
So I wanted to make one , and at the same time , it was clear that Facebook was taking off .
I knew that Zynga was kind of right then starting to pull away as the biggest player in the space , so it seemed like this was a good chance to get onto something -- I did n't predict that FarmVille was going to go boom and all that stuff .
It was n't like I 'm some kind of financial investment genius ; no , I just kind of vote with my feet , of what I want to make and what 's cool and what 's exciting .
Electronic Arts , on one hand , closed Pandemic and acquired Playfish , so suddenly it seems like these are profound shakeups that are going to impact a lot of people .
A lot of people are going to have to make this transition , maybe -- unlike you -- whether they want to or not .
BR : Well , I hope everybody can keep working on games that they would like to work on .
I would like to -- as a message to my former compatriots in the traditional game industry -- say that it 's really fun making social games !
There are some skills that were important skills in the traditional industry that I do n't see anytime soon being all that important in the social game industry , of course , but it 's not like I think that there 's not going to be a traditional game industry .
I just think that social games are the big thing that 's happening , and I could see it coming to be that social games are the largest space in games .
If you look at games overall , that 's kind of what happened with console games and PC games , right ?
They used to just be PC games , and then consoles grew ; then suddenly they were so much bigger than just traditional PC games that you could n't get as much money to make a straight PC game .
I just think it 's a business change , but there 's still always going to be all that other stuff .
You said that you were really attracted to and were playing a lot of these games , but they are definitely different from what you 've worked on in the past .
What drew you and made you say , " This is a space that I want to be in " ?
BR : Mostly the fact that I was really enjoying playing them .
( Laughs ) I make games that I like to play , and I try to find ways to get involved in that ; but , to speak to the sort of deeper parts of that question , what do I think I have to offer is another way of asking it .
What I think I have to offer in this space is I 'm a game mechanic specialist .
Taking simple parts and fitting them together so that they work well and figuring out how you make a game more compelling or more fun , how you take something that 's already working and take it up to the next notch -- that 's the stuff I 'm good at , the stuff I 've done over the years .
The nice thing in the social space is that that 's almost like the entire thing that 's going on !
In the traditional space these days , when it 's a $ 30 million project with a hundred people , I would go for weeks without needing to do any game design or any game mechanics stuff .
I could even imagine these days going an entire year on a project and no new game mechanics get designed or no new substantial play -- because you 're all busy working on the technology and the art , just making content now that you 've designed the thing ; that kind of stuff .
In social games , where it 's just every week 's some new stuff and keeping it going and keeping it exciting and " How can we make it even better ? " and " We need a new feature over here ! " , it 's just really exciting for someone in my space because there 's not the friction of having to make a lot of art and having to make a lot of production value and having writers making story .
It 's just game mechanics ; straight game mechanics .
That 's cool !
It keeps me really , really busy .
Here ’s an odd fact : before the recent financial crisis , the last real bank run in the U.S. came in 2003 , at a community savings bank based in Chinatown .
The bank ’s name ?
Abacus .
It seems like a good idea to put a moratorium on the use of that name in the financial world .
The Mainstream Financial Media ( MFM ) is famously ( or infamously ) deficient in any context other than the day 's swirl of data , rumor and response .
Markets have been swinging wildly as players ( and manipulators ) attempt to predict the market 's response to " news " and the emotions that the " news " may spark .
Rather than play the pointless game of parsing what amounts to signal noise , we would be better served to establish a longer - term context within which " news " can be properly placed and understood .
1. The Eurozone is doomed .
Regardless of " investor relief " triggered by various bailouts , rescue plans and " fixes , " as I explained yesterday in Why the Eurozone Is Doomed , there is no way that any rescue plan , loan or bailout can paper over the structural abyss separating merchantilist Germany and its export - dependent neighbors from the import - and - credit - dependent , consumerist , deficit - spending nations within the Eurozone ( Greece , Portugal , Spain , et al. ) and Britain .
The euro will drop to parity with the U.S. dollar ( USD ) , with dire consequences for U.S. multinationals which have been feeding off the " cheap " dollar , reaping record profits when they transfer their sales in euros into dollars .
That foreign exchange arbitrage will reverse , and Euro - based global corporations will benefit on sales made in USD .
But those corporate profits will not be enough to bail out the eurozone 's profligate deficit spending or crushing debt burdens .
The " fear trade , " that is , risk aversion , will devastate all global trades which were based on low - perceived - risk and high valuations .
2. U.S. corporate profits will stall .
As their overseas sales lose the foreign exchange advantages of a cheap dollar , U.S. global companies will face the consequences of their slowing sales .
For the past six quarters , U.S. global corporations reaped vast profits by slashing headcount , inventories and expenses across the enterprise .
Even better from the view of a financial media desperate to generate the shameless propaganda of " good news , " the low level of profits in Q1 2009 have enabled apparently fantastic " growth " in profits via the " year over year " ( YOY ) comparisons favored by financial propagandists .
Meanwhile , behind the smoke screen of bogus " profit growth , " global sales are still falling when compared to 2005 - 2007 .
Indeed , even YOY comparisons have shown that global giants such as Caterpiller saw 11 % declines in sales even as their profits ( in U.S. dollars ) rose handsomely .
The obvious but rarely mentioned reality is that all these corporations have already plucked all the low - hanging fruit in terms of cost savings and reduced payroll .
From here on , they will have to grow earnings via growing revenues .
As the eurozone stumbles and China 's real estate / credit bubble finally implodes , that will become essentially impossible for global companies .
3. China 's real estate / credit bubble implodes .
You cannot inflate credit and real estate bubble forever .
China 's leadership knows this and as a result it is attempting to pop the bubble with a few modest pinpricks .
Alas , balloons inflated to high pressure do not develop slow leaks ; they pop with glorious violence .
While it is always possible the unprecedented diversion of resources and credit into empty malls , sports arenas , cities and highrises will somehow end without affecting the Chinese and global economies , the odds are not very good if you consider the history of bubbles and the success rate of central government management / manipulation of credit bubbles .
4 . The jobless " recovery " will slip back into a job - shedding recession .
If we subtract the bogus phantom jobs created by the " birth - death model " and the temporary Census Bureau jobs , the U.S. economy is staggering along the zero line , neither creating jobs nor losing them .
If that is the best that stupendous stimulation via Federal spending and zero- interest rates can do to " stimulate " organic ( non-government created ) growth in employment , it certainly suggests that any reduction in Federal stimulus - spending and flagrant pumping of money via the Federal Reserve " monetary easing " will result in a renewed decline in employment .
It does n't take much of a crystal ball to foresee massive layoffs as state and local governments are finally forced to face the music of reduced tax revenues and higher employee pension costs .
As usual , the media is touting a 3 % rise in tax revenues as " proof " the recession is over -- yet few note that tax revenues have dropped by 20 % or 30 % in many locales .
A 3 % rise is not enough to repair the damage done by two years of recession , and all the accounting tricks and gimmicks which the California Legislature and other states ' leaders have deployed to mask the true depth of their deficits are wearing thin .
An eerie silence has descended over Sacramento , as if the politicos and their media lackeys are hoping that keeping quiet will allow a $ 20 billion deficit to magically vanish without the public ( and voters ) becoming alarmed before the November elections .
Good luck , politicos ; sadly , you cannot print money nor force the Federal government to bail you out .
With costs of employment rising by the day -- healthcare , employment taxes , etc.-- very few private businesses have high enough gross margins to justify hiring anyone permanently .
Contract / temp workers are the solution , and any increase in free - lance headcounts does not presage a surge in permanent hiring .
If there is an army of unemployed willing to work for far less than a permanent employee costs , why bother increasing permanent headcount ?
Global companies are still pursuing the savings of global wage arbitrage , and every increase in structural costs here in the U.S. ( healthcare goes up 7 - 15 % every year , taxes are going up , etc. ) only increases the attractiveness of overseas employees and contract / free - lance workers in the U.S .
The recent past is no longer a model for the near future .
The more the MSM and government leaders tout " a return to growth " ( hey , if you borrow and spend $ 3 trillion in two years and nationalize the mortgage industry , you should get some kind of pulse in the comatose patient ) , the more tenuous and threadbare their shrill claims sound to an increasingly skeptical public .
Borrowing another $ 5 or $ 10 trillion to bail out weak Eurozone nations and " stimulate " a deflationary global economy may keep the patient alive a few months or years longer , but the past model of basing " growth " on serial credit bubbles and bailouts is no longer sustainable .
Giving Greece another $ 10 billion will not magically enable it to make it interest payments or roll over old debt .
That game is over , though the players are hoping we 'll buy into the charade one more time .
Nothing structural has been fixed , much less addressed .
The charade of " recovery " may run a few more months , but if we scrape away the noise , the underlying trends are not sustainable .

While I was at CES Unveiled , I managed to see a product that I probably would have missed on the showfloor called the Tri-Specs .
Tri-Specs are Bluetooth wireless headphones for an MP3 Player or cellular phone that are in the form of sunglasses .
At the ends of the Tri-Specs are two retractable earbuds that the user can put in his or her ears , which automatically turn the Tri-Specs on when extended .
The best part is that no one would ever know that you are wearing earbuds while you wear the Tri-Specs glasses .
You could be listening to MP3s while you ’re supposed to be listening to the human resources director talk about some needless thing .
Unless they look closely , your supervisors would never know .
The phone and volume controls are located conveniently on one side of the frame , and the MP3 controls are on the other side .
In addition to the manual controls , the Tri-Specs can also accept voice commands with the STEPvoice software that can recognize the user ’s voice from others , as well as outside noises .
I was amazed at the design of the shades , because fashion was not sacrificed for functionality .
In other words , the sunglasses look like actual sunglasses and not an MP3 Player pretending to be sunglasses .
The Tri-Specs should be available now for a price of $ 199.99 , in colors of black , white , silver , blue , black metallic , as well as black and white combo .
The Italians have a long history of innovation in the 2 , 3 and 4 wheeled vehicle arenas , if most people sit down and write a list of their top 10 cars and top 10 motorcycles you can guarantee there will badges from Ferrari , Lamborghini , Ducati , Aprilla and Alfa Romeo dotted amongst their choices .
The team working on the K - Way Motus are a friendly bunch , in that enviable , effortless way most Italians seem to be .
The project started life in 2006 at the Mechatronics Lab of the Politechnic University of Turin ( Politecnico di Torino ) and was moved over to Actua S.r.l. and TTW S.r.l. , spin -off companies of the Turin - based University hosted in the Incubatore di Imprese Innovative del Politecnico ( Politechnic University Incubator of Innovative Enterprises ) .
Now after 4 years of development the K - Way Motus team are set to take part in the 2010 Progressive Automotive X Prize which officially kicked off on April 26th with a “ shakedown ” event designed to eliminate teams that are insufficiently prepared for the further stages of the competition .
The K - Way Motus is a 3 - wheeled hybrid car designed to tilt into corners in a similar fashion to the Piaggio MP3 Hybrid scooter , however the aerodynamics and crash protection of the Progressive Automotive X Prize entrant is far superior to that offered by the Piaggio .
The K - Way Motus features a seating capacity for 2 people in a tandem configuration and with electric motors in both the front wheels which offers great road holding ability as well as full regenerative braking .
The hybrid drive train is designed to work in both electric only and a combination of electric and gasoline ( which offers more power ) .
The K - Way team have already passed the initial shakedown tests and are well on their way into the next rounds of the competition , you can keep up with developments on all teams here and of course we will keep you up to date on the goings on with both the K - Way Motus and the overall Progressive Automotive X Prize competition .

In the most sexually disturbing Wikipedia war since Editors vs. Biebettes , contributors are upset with site co-founder Jimmy Wales for deleting images he deemed “ pornographic ” and “ of little or no educational value but which appeal solely to prurient interests , ” according to the BBC .
Last month , Wales ’s former partner and current competitor , Larry Sanger , alerted the F.B.I. that Wikipedia was “ knowingly distributing child pornography . ”
Sanger took his case to Fox News , a sort of people ’s encyclopedia of dispassionate cynicism .
“ I was n’t shocked that it was online , but I was shocked that it was on a Wikimedia Foundation site that purports to be a reference site , ” he said , with zero to little self - interest .
Following
Fox ’s report ,
Wales removed the offending images — much to the chagrin of his fellow editors , some of whom thought he was enacting his counter - insurgency in a unilateral fashion .
The BBC reports that “ [ o ] n
Sunday , in response , Jimmy Wales voluntarily revoked many of the ‘ permissions ’ given to him as Wikipedia 's founder , to delete and edit ‘ protected ’ content on Wikimedia Commons . ”
As is the case with all events , we ’ll know nothing for sure until the corresponding Wikipedia page is updated .

A detailed personal account of the setting up of an occupied community garden in Reading in 2007 , which was later evicted by the council .
You ’re in the centre of Reading .
You walk south , past the shops , the chain pubs , the empty office blocks .
You reach the Oracle , a plastic , steel and glass cathedral built to praise the gods of shopping .
You cross the IDR – a massive dual carriageway built through the centre of the town as part of the most ill thought out experiment in traffic management – and enter London Street .
You walk past Reading International Solidarity Centre , the various solicitors , employment agencies and English as a foreign language schools .
You reach the cross roads .
To your right is a Tesco ’s , topped by student flats .
To your left are empty Tudor style houses .
Opposite is a six storey block of flats designed to be the ‘ model of luxury urban living ’ ; in reality a collection of rabbit hutch size apartments which will fall apart in a couple of years .
Opposite and to the right there is a rubble - strewn waste - ground .
The site of one of the most successful and militant direct - action campaigns in Reading for a long time .
Rewind to mid-2007 .
Standing on this site then you would have been greeted by a very different sight .
A row of Victorian houses stood on the corner , some occupied by squatters , some empty .
A green gateway between two of the buildings is open .
Walking through it you see a beautiful rockery packed with plants in full bloom .
The alley way opens out and around the corner a most unexpected sight greets you : Common Ground Community Garden .
A small patch of grass surrounded by loads of flowers and plants is separated from an area covered in woodchip by a hand - built path .
Homemade garden furniture ( two or three tables surrounded by benches ) sits in the shade of the Buddleia bushes next to the children ’s play area .
The sounds and stresses of Reading ’s urban jungle melt away .
Dirty Squatters .
Common Ground Community Garden came about when a group of activists squatted one of the buildings on the corner .
Reading Borough Council owned all the buildings and the land .
Two of the buildings had tenants in them – the Council for Racial Equality and the Women ’s Information Centre – but the council was trying to move them on .
In 2006 they cut all funding to the Women ’s Information Centre , forcing it to close , and found the Council for Racial Equality new premises .
This left the row of houses empty – prime land for redevelopment .
However , they were n’t the only people eyeing the properties up with grand designs for their future .
Reading Grassroots Action – at the time called Rage ( cheesy , yes we know ) – had members who needed a place to live .
Also , inspired by the Social Centre Network that was being set up in the UK at the time , we had the grand idea of setting up a social centre in Reading .
One day towards the end of summer 2006 , armed with a tool box and some new locks , we moved into our new home .
It quickly became apparent that there was no way we could effectively run a social centre .
The majority of the people living in the squat had jobs or university and problems were had finding enough people just to occupy the squat , let alone if we tried to start opening it to the community .
So the social centre idea was dropped , but a new idea was being cooked up .
Next door there were two houses which had been left derelict for years .
Behind these properties there was a large waste - ground which was a favourite haunt for drug addicts .
Looking over our wall at the derelict gardens next door , with the stories of New York ’s Community Gardens and Zapatista land occupations in mind ( check out http://www.weareeverywhere.org), we knew just what to do .
Hang on lads ; I ’ve got a great idea .
This idea – to transform this derelict junkyard into a squatted community garden – did not sit in isolation .
Instead , it was viewed as possibly the first stage in a long - term strategy .
For quite a while members of RGA had been feeling that most UK anti-capitalists – including ourselves – were doing things out of habit , without considering the effects or effectiveness of these things , and certainly without these things being part of any cohesive long term strategy .
Over a few months , two comrades developed what we considered to be a clear and concise strategy , which was accepted by the group .
Working backwards in their minds from the kind of world we would like to see , through what was considered to be the most likely way of this coming about , four main objectives were identified :
1. Recognise things in common between ourselves and others and facilitate the recognition of commonality between others .
2. Articulate and effectively communicate our analysis of society
3. Build collective confidence in ourselves and others .
4. Maintain our own organisations long - term .
It seemed that creating this community garden would be a ( relatively ) short / medium term activity that could fulfil these objectives to some extent .
For our own group morale ( and to fulfil objectives 3 and 4 ) we needed to do something where we would feel successful and this project seemed like it could n’t fail to achieve this .
If the garden lasted and was used by our community , it would be a great autonomous community project , self - organised and created through direct - action , and would hopefully be a positive way to introduce ourselves and our politics to our community .
On the other hand , if the authorities tried to stop us or destroy the garden at any point , it would be easy to articulate ourselves and portray our politics as ' good ' and the authorities as ' bad ' .
Either way , it was felt we were onto a winner .
At the same time , we anticipated that it would go some way to fulfilling objective 1 .
Firstly , creating a space like this allows normally atomised people to get together socially and chat , which in itself is a good thing .
However , because of the way the space has been created , it also meant that much of the conversation would focus on the politics involved .
Reading is already a highly developed town , with an economy centred on the retail / consumer and high - technology sectors .
In addition to this , development is rampant with new shopping centres , posh offices and luxury hotels and apartments seemingly appearing every day .
The resultant gentrification causes price increases and long - term working class residents are pushed further and further out of the town .
With shops , offices and luxury flats on one side , and Victorian working class housing and council estates on the other , our squat seemed to symbolise the border between the developed , gentrified and consumerist Reading and the Reading where ordinary people lived their lives .
As it was pretty obvious that the Council planned to sell our space to developers for yet more posh apartments , we felt this would be a perfect space and project to open up communication between ourselves and our neighbours about these issues .
So we started work .
Using free cycle and taking stuff others were throwing away ( we got some turf for free , all the fencing we needed from someone who was replacing theirs and a load of pallets that we used for decking for £ 1 ) we created a beautiful garden for a little over £ 150 .
We also relied on help from friends and family .
One of the things at the forefront of our minds was to make the garden look as professional as possible .
Just because we ’re doing this ourselves does n’t mean we should n’t care how it looks ; if anything it ’s got to be better than the parks created by the council – if we ’re saying we can run our communities better than those in power then we ’ve got to be able to back this up !
With this is mind , after cleaning away all the weeds , brambles and needles ( a whole bucketful ) , a few people got together and drew some specific plans of the garden .
The plan of the garden was accepted , and we decided early on that to get the work completed to some kind of schedule and standard we would have to appoint a foreman to check that work was actually getting done .
Although we were very slack appointing the foreman , this highlights a couple of problems that arose within the group during this project , which led to a number of people leaving , albeit only for a short while .
One of the major problems that arose was that some people were doing the majority of the work , and sometimes when work was done it was rushed and was not to a very high standard .
This led some people to feel they were doing all the work , and led others to feel that their input was neither wanted nor needed .
This fed into a bigger debate we ’d been having about informal hierarchies , what constitutes membership of a group , how decisions are made and ‘ ownership ’ of these decisions .
Emotions were running high and the feeling inside RGA was hard .
Eventually between 2 and 5 ( depending on how we classified membership at that point ) people left .
We continued to work together ( better than we had for a long time ) , and we also tried to address some of the problems that had arisen : we began to institute ‘ work days ’ , where everyone who could would come along and work on the garden .
We ’d agree beforehand what we were going to get done that day , and then we did it .
We ’d then go to the pub ( or , towards the end , have a little bonfire in the garden ) .
Person ’s Unknown
Eventually , our agreed opening day – Saturday 19th May 2007 – approached .
As the final sections of the garden were being finished , we produced over 600 leaflets which were delivered door - to - door , we put up posters and we hung a banner over the fence advertising the event .
Two days before , we received notice that an injunction had been served on ‘ persons unknown ’ in an attempt to stop the opening day , and that the Council were seeking a possession order for the land and the buildings .
Strange that they only took action against the squatters once we started to do something positive , even though they admitted they had known about us since October the previous year ( when we ’d told them we were squatting there ) .
Anyway , we quickly rushed out another 500 leaflets delivered door - to - door saying we ’d open the garden regardless , and inviting our neighbours to defend the garden against a council that had n’t given a damn about the area for over 5 years .
Several neighbours told us they had n’t planned to come , but definitely would now !
The same message was distributed around the local media with a clear explanation of our reasons for doing what we were doing .
Early Saturday morning some Pixies removed the front fence , opening the garden to the public .
About mid-day two Polish security guards turned up , presumably to serve the injunction .
They tried twice , then gave up retreating to their van where they sat and smoked ( we offered them some food , but they ’d brought their own ) .
The day itself was a massive success , with over 200 residents passing through the garden and signing our petition supporting the garden and demanding community control over the area .
That over 200 people ( including at least 1 cop ) were prepared to break the law in support of our garden and put their hands in their pockets ( we got around £ 100 in donations ) showed that we ’d really hit a popular nerve .
Throughout the day , discussions were had ; discussions about the lack of green space in Katesgrove , about the horrible unaffordable flats that were being built everywhere and about the fact that the garden was squatted .
In the evening , acoustic music was performed ranging from country and bluegrass to acoustic punk .
A barbeque was had , the drinks flowed and neighbours who would never have smiled at each other before sang the night away together .
The most striking thing was the diversity , and that it did n’t matter .
You had 18 year old punks in studs and leather jackets talking with 50 year old professionals , you had anarchist activists sharing a beer or two with ( off - duty ) coppers .
A picture is worth a thousand words
We had a fair few of both .
From the start we ’d decided to interact with the local media as much as possible .
For a long time we ’d considered that the anarchist fear of the media may not be the best policy .
Our experience of the media during this project was great .
They were desperate for stories , and as such if we gave them a story , they ’d print it .
This meant that for a long time , we controlled the media coverage and the public ’s perception of the garden .
We had many great stories in the local rags ( we even got on TV a couple of times ) surrounding the garden , the various events we held there and the resultant court cases .
We think the Council were caught off guard by our media onslaught , and did n’t start to get to grips with waging the media war until they finally evicted us – many months later .
We clearly ‘ won ’ the media war , and many of the later articles even included a slightly closer look at our politics , which had been one of our aims from the start .
We even made it onto regional television a number of times , appeared in national newspapers ( one article that springs to mind was in the Guardian ) , and even had a section written about us in a book ( from which we never saw penny one in royalties  ) .
This media barrage went some way to fulfilling one of our aims : Articulate and effectively communicate our analysis of society .
However , it also went a long way towards recognising similarities and commonality between ourselves and others .
To hear people agreeing with an anarchist critique of capitalist development , writing letters to the paper in defence of the squatters , and even organising similar projects elsewhere was what this was all about .
After the success of the opening night celebrations , reality hit hard ( much like the hangover the next day ) .
Although we had 200 people signed up on our petition demanding community control of the area , the Council technically had the law on their side .
On Friday 25th May 2007 , the Council took us to court to extend their injunction against opening the garden , and to seek a possession order for the houses and the land .
A couple of members of RGA went along and made our case ( many more were outside with a banner and a photographer .
Yet another victory for us in the papers at least ) , and even had the judge agreeing that we had a ‘ moral argument ’ .
However , in the eyes of the law , moral arguments carry no weight .
So their injunction was extended ( making opening the garden illegal ) and an eviction date was set .
Oh , if it was only that simple . . .

// Common Ground Community Garden Eviction Resistance !
// FUCK THE EVICTION , SAVE THE GARDEN !
// WEDNESDAY 20TH JUNE
They left the land to rot , covered in trash and needles .
They hope the buildings will fall down , so they can justify flogging to the highest bidder .
They hope to see more unaffordable prison - block apartments .
Reading Borough Council calls it development , regeneration .
We call it gentrification , exclusion .
Just profit and power .
The land is ours .
We occupied it , we cleared it , we worked it and we made it bloom .
We recycled and re-used , and on our squatted land we created sanctuary from the rampant capitalism of Reading .
Our friends , family and neighbours chipped in , and through direct - action and self - organisation , we created a community garden in our neighbourhood , Katesgrove .
The land is ours ?
Well , not exactly .
The land is nobody 's , because it is everybody 's .
And so we called it Common Ground .
On 19th May , we opened the garden to the public .
We invited our friends , families and neighbours .
Embarrassed and scared , the Council tried to stop us .
Their court gave them an injunction against us , making it illegal to open the garden .
So , we informed our community and re-invited ‘ em .
Fuck the injunction !
200 people came and enjoyed the garden that day , laughing at the Council and meeting others people who think the same things they do .
Even the media told the truth about us .
Then the Council got their injunction extended .
They told us it was illegal to open our garden at all and they want ' their ' land back .
They do n’t understand it has never been theirs ; they were just looking after it for us .
And since they did n't do a very good job , we 've found a better use for it .
For ourselves , our neighbours and local workers , for young and old , the garden is open every day .
So , now they say they will take it back by force , and demolish our garden and give it to the rich .
Their courts have given them the law , and their thugs will evict us on Wednesday morning - if they can ...
For us , existence is resistance - and Common Ground Community Garden exists .
Our self - organisation and direct - action exists .
On Wednesday and forever , our resistance exists .
Demonstrate , barricade , blockade , occupy - we will resist in different ways , because ' we ' is made of different people , and now hopefully will include one more - you .
In Love n Rage ,
Some gardeners .
Text of the call out issued to neighbours and the media about defending the garden from eviction the first time .
We quietly went about our work , every day opening the garden for the public , locking it at night , repairing the furniture and fences , and weeding as necessary .
Also , unbeknownst to us , others were also trimming the grass and tidying for us ( we had reports of one elderly gentleman coming from miles away once a week with his shears to trim the grass for us – this from a man we never met ! )
The community , although not really involved in running the space , clearly supported it and utilised it – throughout the summer of 2007 , walk into the garden and you ’d find single mothers and their children relaxing ( ok , the mum ’s relaxing , the kids playing on the slide ) , you ’d find young professionals eating lunch , you ’d find teens in tracksuits and you ’d find elderly residents from the sheltered housing opposite .
However , eviction day was looming large .
On Wednesday 20th June , bailiffs turned up to evict the squatters and the gardeners .
However , since early that morning we ’d been barricading the house ( ultimately moving out , leaving it to some other squatter friends ) and the garden , and we were not alone .
Residents were there with us , and so was the media ( local TV and newspapers again ) .
The bailiffs were unsure about how to deal with this so did the wise thing and left .
We knew exactly how to deal with this .
We had a party – more acoustic punk , bbq ’d meat , resident solidarity and the occasional beer .
Gardeners 2 , Bailiffs 0 .
By late July the Council tried again to evict the gardeners , and again left empty handed .
Whilst some RGA activists were out of the country ( getting CS gassed and water - cannoned in Germany ) , bailiffs again turned up , and were again met by strong local resistance .
With the expected police backup going AWOL ( due to a slight case of flooding in the town centre and outlying housing estates – you see , even nature was on our side ! ) , they swiftly retreated to the safety of their offices .
A couple of days later an event organised in conjunction with the nearby Rising Sun Arts Centre ( a previously squatted building who were nothing but totally supportive throughout the struggle ) was very well attended with children from the local area creating a new mosaic pathway , despite threats and intimidation from the Council .
It was also around this time that the Council , in a desperate attempt to move us on , offered us two possible plots for future community gardens in the area .
After careful consideration , the Common Ground gardeners decided to reject the offer – why should we leave this garden that we ’d already spent time and money on creating ?
However , as the Council had offered the land to us , they also had to offer the land to the local residents association , so members of RGA involved in the Katesgrove Residents Association strongly encouraged KRA to take the Council up on their offer of land .
KRA did so , and negotiations began about the setting up of Community Gardens in the Katesgrove area .
Direct action gets the goods !
Gardeners 2 , Bailiffs 1 . Down but not out .
Throughout the summer more events were organised , from BBQ ’s to film showings , from work days to family fun days .
Every day without fail we unlocked the padlocks so that the community could make use of their garden .
Plans for what we were going to do next were also being considered and discussed , as were ongoing meetings with the Council and the residents association regarding future legal sites and the future of Common Ground itself .
However , the immediate future of Common Ground was decided on Thursday 18th October .
At around 9 am council officials , bailiffs , PCSO ’s and police officers turned up .
They broke down the door to the Women ’s Information Centre and evicted the squatters there – friends of ours , who sometimes kept an eye on the garden for us .
They also broke a hole in the garden fence .
At around this time some residents turned up and attempted to ask questions and take photos of the event .
After plans to board everything up were heard , some of the original gardeners arrived .
Three people entered the garden and sat down at one of the tables in there .
An argument broke out as the residents demanded that the community should be asked what it wanted to happen to the site , rather than a development being imposed without consultation , while Council officials simply replied " its private property " - as if this is more important than social and environmental concerns or local democracy .
When told " this is n't right and you know it ! ” officials replied " You may have a moral argument , but by the law this is right ” .
Says it all , eh ?
Eventually one of the Council officials lost his cool , pulled a seat out from under one of the residents and threw it across the garden .
He also started to shove and square up to one of the residents , who stood his ground and asked the official his name .
Two of the residents felt they should leave in the face of such aggression , leaving one resident in the garden .
The police ( who by this time had lost interest and wandered off ) were called .
The police once again asked the resident to leave , to avoid " embarrassment " , only to be told " I 'm not embarrassed to defend this garden " .
Eventually , following discussions between the Council and the police , the Council official was told to use reasonable force to evict the person .
The protester was physically lifted and dragged out of the garden , before builders fitted boards over the garden gate and over the hole in the fence .
It was around this time that we also began to experience a bit of a media back - lash .
By now the Council ’s media department was in full swing , and newspaper articles were steadily becoming ‘ cooler ’ towards us .
Furthermore , due to the fact that we were resisting the evictions , the media could no longer be as vocal in support for us .
The general consensus seemed to be that ‘ we ’d done something nice for the community and we ’d made our point , but now that the Council wanted the land back we should just drift away into the night .
After - all , our assertions that the land was owned by everyone sounded dangerously like communism , and we would n’t want that , would we ? ’
However , there were more serious issues coming to light .
Firstly the Council started to portray us as uncompromising , saying that we rejected offers for new gardens ‘ out of hand ’ without even considering them .
This issue was cleared up with a simple letter to the papers correcting this misrepresentation .
More worrying allegations were to surface later .
A supporter of the garden sent an email to Katesgrove councillor David Sutton ( a very unpleasant man who , when approached requesting a donation , told a member of RGA who was running a stall in the centre of town to ‘ Fuck off and get a job ’ .
He eventually lost his seat in May 2008 , something we like to think we had at least a little influence in ) requesting information regarding the closing of the garden .
The reply contained some ridiculous , but very serious , allegations .
In his letter he attempted to portray the “ squatters ” and the “ gardeners ” as two different sets of people , describing the gardeners as ‘ nice and peaceful ’ whilst the squatters were described as ‘ prepared to use ( or at least threaten ) extreme violence ’ in defence of the building in which they were living .
This is based on the “ fact ” that a ‘ cache of weapons was found inside the property , including an axe , some double edged knives and pieces of wood with nails driven through them . ’
What on earth would some gardeners be doing with an axe , some knives and pieces of wood ?
Again , we swiftly dispatched a letter to the press attacking these lies , but this was a clear indication just how much we were annoying the Council .
Needless to say , there was no police investigation into any of Councillor Sutton ’s claims ( proof , if any more was needed , that they were patently stupid ) , but it certainly seemed to mark an escalation in the Council ’s handling of us .
However , we had absolutely no intention of just giving up .
Caught by the fuzz .
On Monday 5th November , 3 young men were stopped outside Common Ground by an unmarked police car .
The police called the Council and asked them what they wanted to be done .
The Council were overheard telling the police that they wanted the men arrested ‘ so that they could have a photo of [ their ] faces ’ .
The police complied , and took the men to the cells on the charges of attempted burglary and going equipped .
After a number of hours the police finally understood that they were gaining access to the garden from the road , not one of the buildings and the charges were dropped , and the men were released .
This was just one attempt we made during these few bleak months to reopen the garden , the majority of the others being more successful .
However , during these few weeks when the Council had retaken “ control ” of the garden , we quickly saw it revert to how it had been before we started the garden – a magnet for drugs , criminal activities and a blight on the neighbourhood .
During the weeks and months when then garden had been “ secured ” by the Council , lead was stolen from the roofs of the buildings ( leaving the remaining lead on the roofs in a precarious position , ready to fall and hit passers - by just as soon as it got windy enough – ‘ health and safety ’ my arse ) , all copper piping was stolen from the houses , and the toilets in the Women ’s Information Centre were smashed .
The Council ’s claim ’s that they shut the garden on ‘ health and safety ’ grounds were exposed for the lies we all knew them to be .
During the months when the garden was open , there was a significant drop in crime and anti-social behaviour in the area .
After just weeks of it being shut , crime , vandalism and drugs use was all on the increase again .
After a lull of activity over the winter ( who wants to go into a garden with no cover during one of the wettest winters on record ? ) , by the ’ day of direct action in defence of free space ’ on April 12th we were ready to try our luck again .
Using tools borrowed from a friend , we cut through the wire fencing at the back of the garden , and began tidying the garden .
After months of neglect it was a big job , but with two weeks of hard work , the garden was again in a fit state to be opened to the public .
Posters were produced advertising the reopening , and hundreds of leaflets were again produced and distributed locally .
Needless to say , we had a plan .
Past form suggested the Council would try to stop us opening , so we advertised ‘ Plan B ’ ; if we were prevented from partying in the garden , we ’d take the party to the Council offices and hold the party in the plaza ( grand word for a bit of shitty concrete surrounded by 60s brutalist architecture .
It ’s only saving grace is that there ’s a small statue dedicated to the Reading residents who fought and died ‘ defending democracy ’ in the Spanish Civil War ) that the Council , Police station and the Courts open onto .
Just before the opening day , RBC came and changed the locks and re-barricaded the garden .
However , at 7 am on Saturday 12th April , we were in the garden preparing for opening day .
Come 1 pm and off came the front fence creating an unblockable entrance .
Residents came , anarchists from across the country came , rain came ( as did some gazebo ’s hastily bought in Argos ) , and acoustic punks came , and an excellent day was had by all .
The only people who did n’t turn up were the Council or their goons , seemingly giving up as we ’d shown time and time again that we would n’t give up ( though we heard the previously mentioned plaza was well defended by the cops ) .
After re-securing the garden we went to bed , our point having been made .
Over the next weeks and months , we entered into discussions with the Council and the resident ’s association trying to push forward the legal gardens in the area .
We also had a new demand – temporarily legalise Common Ground under the control of KRA , at least until the land was sold to developers .
By September this battle had been won , and Common Ground was opened yet again – this time legally .
Another party was had , including more acoustic punk , a BBQ , face painting , a raffle , and a graffiti demonstration from a local graff crew TPK .
Again , we could open the garden every day and a brief ceasefire of sorts settled over the area .
Our survey says . . .
Of course , we knew this was only a temporary measure , and we began to mobilise along different lines .
We began to try and push for community control over the area , demanding that in the least the community should be consulted over what happened in the area .
We organised mass meetings for residents trying to set up a community - led campaign pushing for this .
We also mooted the idea of starting a wider campaign against the gentrification of the area , and we attempted to begin to link up the various community groups in Reading , trying to form a larger coalition .
Unfortunately , much of this came to naught as we had bitten off a little more than we could chew – by this time we had only 6 members , one of whom was ill with ME and others who were incredibly busy with jobs or exams .
However , we did manage to produce a survey consulting the residents on what they thought should happen to the area – our reasoning being that even if the Council do n’t do it , we will .
Over the winter of 2008 and early 2009 we distributed our survey , getting about 1 in 6 returned .
We were absolutely delighted with the response and only wished we could have got more handed out .
The results strongly echoed everything we ’d been demanding , and a lot of people pledged to get involved with the future community gardens .
This survey also signified a slight retreat on our part , handing responsibility of pushing for the gardens to KRA ( an organisation that RGA members were very active in ) , as we moved onto other projects .
Rose tinted spectacles
In the summer of 2009 , the Common Ground site was flattened .
This was seemingly done out of spite , as it now lies derelict , nearly a year later .
The houses were pulled down directly onto the garden , so nothing is left now besides rubble .
The houses cellars are now exposed , making the Council ’s claims they were doing it to make the site safer laughable .
In a final indignation , we had moved a lot of our materials ( plants , tables , etc ) to a section of the site where we were assured they would be kept safe from harm – these too were all destroyed .
However , this does not mean we lost .
Work on the new gardens is progressing , with KRA taking on the task with vim and vigour .
RGA has also moved on .
Becoming part of L&S towards the end 2008 , we have been instrumental in the setting up of Reading branch of the IWW workers union , which in turn has been one of the leading forces in setting up Reading Shop Stewards Network which see ’s militants from the NUT , the CWU , Unite , the RMT , PCS and the IWW all working together .
We are also very active in another community campaign in East Reading , and we have been hosting quarterly forums designed to get all lefty community activists in Reading working together .
Dropping the name RGA for simply RL&S ( 4 names in 5 years ?
Something of an identity crisis !?! ) , we have huge plans and ambitions for Reading in the future .
The future ’s bright . . .
So what can be learned from Common Ground ?
Do n’t start a community garden project unless you really like gardening , cos it ’ll be more successful than your wildest dreams ?
Personally for me , it was the first ‘ anarchist ’ project that I ’d been involved in that actually connected with local people .
Up to this point all we had been involved in were ‘ stunty ’ street protests such as May Day and the anti-G8 protests .
We ’d go to someone else ’s community , have a fight with the cops ( read : get kettled , piss in a bottle and then go to the pub ) and then go home , leaving someone else to tidy up .
This was the first time we ’d interacted , and , fucking hell , it actually worked !
Throughout this struggle the strongest support we had was from the local residents .
We got a councillor elected ( Lib Dem Warren Swaine – less of a bastard than the rest of them eh Warren ? ) and deposed ‘ leader ’ of the council David Sutton .
We encouraged KRA to step up to the plate and represent the whole of Katesgrove , not just the middle - class ghetto it had previously occupied – a challenge it has began to rise to .
Although only one member of RGA now lives in Katesgrove , it is an area we still have strong links with , with many comrades and friends living in the area , and it is an area we still operate in , albeit through KRA .
RGA is also much the better for this project .
This was when we developed our first ‘ strategy ’ , deciding that it ’s better to have a clear aim in mind and ways of measuring success than just doing things cos ‘ It ’s what anarchists do , innit , ’ or ‘ because there was a call out issued . ’
We now , as part of L&S , have short , medium and long term strategies for all our spheres of operation , which have very clear goals in mind and ways of actually achieving them .
This was also the time when RGA ’s internal structure underwent a massive change .
Now , when decisions are made , people are assigned tasks and if they do n’t do them they have account for their actions .
People take ownership of projects and make sure they get done .
When we organise events we assign people roles ( such as police liaison , cook , event coordinator ) with clearly defined job descriptions and responsibilities .
Most importantly though , we hold each other to account better , and RGA ( RL&S ) is still one of the most active and successful groups in Reading , and probably the country .
We managed to break out of the ( self - imposed ) anarchist ghetto and have made a real difference to our own lives and the lives of our neighbours .
We ’re acting like the anarchists of old now , organising within our workplaces and our communities , building the institutions and the structures that can and will run the country in the future .
Federal authorities have identified a person of interest in the investigation into New York ’s Times Square bomb plot , described as a naturalized American citizen who recently returned from Pakistan , Fox News confirmed today .
Associated Press , quoting two law enforcement officials , reported that he is the man who purchased the SUV involved in the attempted bombing .
The person is a naturalized American citizen who was in Pakistan for several months and returned to the United States recently , investigative sources told Fox News , though the person ’s identity has not been made public .
ABCNews.com reported that he is originally from Pakistan .

The news came as a FBI - led task force took over the case as it became more likely that there were connections to overseas terrorism , according to the Washington Post .
The NYPD was leading the investigation before the Joint Terrorism Task Force stepped in .
Forensic evidence turned up in the Nissan Pathfinder that was found Saturday in Times Square pointed in that direction , sources told The Post .
For instance , one of the bomb clocks was foreign - made .
Also , Rep. Peter King of Long Island , ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee , said the investigation has turned up some evidence of foreign involvement in the failed bombing attempt .

“ It very well could be a group in this country that is connected to al Qaeda , ” King told The Post .
“ As the investigation is going on today … they may be coming up with something which indicates an overseas connection .
I think it is something they are finding in the U.S. that could indicate some connection to overseas , ” he said .
The Washington Post earlier today reported that the botched car bombing appears to have been coordinated by several individuals with foreign ties .
“ Do n’t be surprised if you find a foreign nexus … They ’re looking at some tell - tale signs and they ’re saying it ’s pointing in that direction , ” a senior White House official told the Washington Post this afternoon .
But these sources told the Washington Post that this does n’t mean al - Qaeda or another terrorist group is involved .
A Pakistani - based Taliban group claimed credit for the attack in an Internet video on Sunday , but Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has said that police had no evidence to support that claim .
The possible link to foreign terrorism came during a day of rapid developments in the investigation .
— The last registered owner of the Nissan Pathfinder found Saturday in Times Square loaded with explosives has told authorities he recently sold the car on Craigslist for $ 1,300 in cash to a “ Middle Eastern ” or “ Hispanic ” looking man , CBS News reported .
Quoting “ sources , ” CBS said the mystery buyer reportedly paid in $ 100 bills .
The original owner is not considered a suspect in the case .
CBS said the vehicle identification number had been removed from the car ’s dashboard but was still stamped on the engine and axle .
— The White House for the first time clearly declared the incident a terrorist act .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said today that the SUV loaded with explosives was “ intended to terrorize . ”
— Attorney General Eric
Holder said today that investigators had made “ substantial progress ” in the probe and that those involved would eventually be caught .
“ I think that we have made really substantial progress , ” Holder told reporters , adding that “ ultimately this investigation will be successful and the people responsible for that attempt will be found and brought to justice . ”
Cops have said that the gasoline - and - propane bomb could have sprayed shrapnel and metal parts with enough force to kill pedestrians on Saturday night .
Police have asked the public today if they have any video from the moments leading up to the discovery of the bomb in a bid to identify the man who planted the deadly device .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said investigators have n’t ruled out any suspects , including foreign terrorist organizations , in the case .
“ Right now , every lead has to be pursued , ” Napolitano told NBC ’s “ Today ” show .
“ I caution against premature decisions one way or another . ”
The top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee , Peter King ( R - LI ) said there was no intelligence chatter before or conversation after the car was found — but warned that that all possibilities must be considered .
The NYPD released images Sunday , showing the SUV snaking through thousands of unsuspecting bystanders at the corner of 45th and Broadway at around 6:30 p.m. Saturday .
Moments later , its driver leaped out — leaving the motor running and the hazard lights on .
And within minutes , two vendors heard the pop-pop - pop of M88s and saw smoke seeping out of the SUV .
They alerted a mounted cop , and a massive evacuation began at the Crossroads of the World .
Authorities said the SUV was carrying a propane - and - fertilizer bomb powerful enough to trigger a “ significant fireball ” and hurl shrapnel through the tens of thousands of people in the vicinity , killing or maiming hundreds .
“ The vehicle itself would have been cut in half ” by the explosion , Kelly said on Sunday .
“ Clearly , it was the intent of whoever did this to cause mayhem , to create casualties . ”
But the fertilizer — eight bags , totaling 100 pounds , purchased at a grocery store — was not “ explosive grade ” and would n’t have produced “ the kind of devastation associated with ammonium nitrate bombs ” like the kind that demolished the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , said Browne .
“ Had [ the propane and gas ] gone off , it would have … produced a fireball ” that likely would have “ resulted in people being killed , windows being shattered , but not resulted in a building collapse or major structural damage , ” he said .
Detectives are looking into whether the botched attack may be linked to a warning issued last month by Revolution Muslim — a radical Islamic group based in Queens — following last month ’s 200th episode of Trey Parker and Matt Stone ’s “ South Park , ” which included a caricature of the Prophet Mohammad disguised in a bear suit .

Why does n't Windows include native PDF reader support ?
Posted by Sean @ 16:45 GMT Dear Microsoft ,
We 'd like you to consider developing a PDF reader for your Windows OS .
Something such as Apple 's Preview would be great :
" To view a PDF file , just double - click it to open it in Preview . "
Mac does n't require a third - party application to view PDFs , so why does Windows ?
Heck , you do n't even need to build it into the OS .
Just make it an optional download such as your Save As PDF add - in for Office .
We know , we know … even though anyone is allowed to create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to Adobe Systems , you guys can't .
You 're just too big and can't ship add on PDF functionality without freaking out Adobe .
But you know what ?
You really should n't care anymore .
Freak them out .
Your customers are tired of the exploits and the complications that so many of today 's PDF readers include .
We just want to read PDFs .
We do n't want to / launch executables , to play video & audio , or to run JavaScript .
A viewer that provides the basic functionality of the PDF / A standard is all we want .
Is that so much to ask ?
Please give it some thought , thanks .
Sincerely yours ,
F - Secure Labs
Scientists have described well over over 1.7 million of the world 's species of animals , plants , insects and algae .
Below you 'll find a list that gives the number of species known in the world for each major category of living creatures and organisms .
The numbers most accurately represent all living species of mammals , birds and coniferous plants .
Only for those groups have scientists almost completely identified all the world 's species .
Biologists have yet to describe many species of plants , invertebrate animals and lichens .
So the number of these species known to science increases substantially every year .
The greatest species diversity exists among insects , which account for about one million of the earth 's species known to science .
Mammals make up one of the smallest groups , with just 5,513 members .
Altogether the earth 's oceans , lakes , continents and islands support over 66,000 identified species of vertebrate animals and more than 307,000 species of plants .
How many species known to currently exist in the world .
Category Species Totals Vertebrate Animals Mammals 5,513 Birds 10,425 Reptiles 10,038 Amphibians 7,302 Fishes 32,900 Total Vertebrates 66,178 Invertebrate Animals Insects 1,000,000 Spiders and scorpions 102,248 Molluscs 85,000 Crustaceans 47,000 Corals 2,175 Others 68,827 Total Invertebrates 1,305,250 Plants Flowering plants ( angiosperms ) 268,000 Conifers ( gymnosperms ) 1,052 Ferns and horsetails 12,000 Mosses 16,236 Red and green algae 10,386 Total Plants 307,674 Others Lichens 17,000 Mushrooms 31,496 Brown algae 3,127 Total Others 51,623 TOTAL SPECIES 1,730,725
The species totals do not include domestic animals such as sheep , goats and camels .
Nor do they include single - celled organisms such as bacteria .
One of the troubling developments in the past few years , is the number of times police have been captured on film lashing out at innocent demonstrators and football fans , neither of whom can rely on ready sympathy from the public , but who nevertheless have rights in a democracy .
Three weeks ago , the east Lancashire derby between Burnley and Blackburn Rovers took place in normally tense conditions , in which fans from both sides were isolated before and after the fixture at Burnley 's ground , Turf Moor .
Trouble after the match was reported in the media with Superintendant Terry Woods , of Lancashire police , issuing a standard statement about a few troublemakers .
" Unfortunately we have had to deal with some disorder inside and outside the ground , " he said .
" However , the operation that is in place has enabled us to successfully deal with those pockets of disorder rapidly . "
Yesterday , the Police State website publicised a video that shows shocking levels of violence by the police and which certainly puts a different slant on what actually happened after the game .
Officers are seen wading into the crowd with batons flailing .
It is only a 40 - second video , but the fans did not appear to be presenting a violent threat .
In one instance , a father who had attended the match with his 12 - year old son said he had stumbled and fallen on one police officer .
He said he was beaten across the face , received a severely bruised leg and a suspected broken rib as his son watched in horror .
He was then arrested and held in custody by the police for four hours , during which he was seen by a police doctor and eventually presented with a choice – accept a caution or face a charge of violent disorder .
He opted for the first , but he is planning to press a complaint against the police in a civil action .
His case has also been taken up by the Football Supporters Federation ( FSF ) , which is increasingly active in defending fans ' rights and focusing attention on policing operations that involve violence and the abuse of new laws to prevent people from exercising their right to attend a football game .
While conceding that the Burnley v Blackburn Rovers game required a heavy police presence , Amanda Jacks , of FSF , said the violence in the film was shocking and would turn ordinary law - abiding football supporters against the police .
Meanwhile , the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it refused to investigate the matter .
At an FSF event earlier this year , I was struck by how many times people suggested that the police treat fans like animals .
That may be true , but I am almost certain that if a video showing animals being beaten like this was put up on YouTube there would be calls for an inquiry , but with football supporters the general reaction is that they deserve it .
That is clearly wrong .
Mental charity chief says GPs should keep a keener eye out for distress among men , who tend to suffer more in secret than women
Vast numbers of men are suffering from depression in the UK but missing out on treatment , owing to the skewed criteria used by GPs to diagnose the illness , warns the head of the mental health charity Mind .
Paul Farmer , the chief executive of Mind , says men are just as likely to suffer from mental distress as women of the same age and are far more likely to kill themselves : the highest suicide risk group in the UK is now men aged between 40 and 49 .
But because of the emphasis on typically female issues and symptoms under the categories used to understand how depression works , the extent of the problem among men is largely hidden .
While depressed women can turn in on themselves , men suffering from the illness can become animated , aggressive and angry .
Middle - aged men are also far less likely to talk to friends and relatives about their feelings , relying heavily on their partner , which can push them towards marital breakdown and further isolation .
A recent case in point is that of schoolteacher Peter Harvey , who was cleared of attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to a pupil last week because he was mentally unwell and had been tormented by the youth .
Although high - profile cases of male depression have made the headlines , as when the former footballer Paul Gascoigne was sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 , Farmer said that in general the problem remained hidden .
Research done by Mind has shown that a high proportion of men also saw doctors ' surgeries as " feminised " premises where they felt unwelcome .
" We are working on recommendations for GPs encouraging them to look out for some of the more male symptoms of depression , such as anger or aggression , " said Farmer , " and also calling for the increased provision of mental health services tailored for men , such as all - male service user groups , which are tremendously successful where they exist . "
The recommendations will suggest that surgeries be made more man-friendly , with male magazines in waiting rooms , and that men be given access to a network of all - male support groups where they might find it easier to talk about their problems .
" Statistics tell us that women are more likely to have depression than men , but in reality men are just as likely to experience depression , but are far less likely to seek help , be diagnosed or receive treatment , " said Farmer .
" Stereotypes such as ' real men do n't cry ' can hold men back from getting help , and we are worried that the true extent of men's mental health problems is further masked by the fact that the symptoms of depression that we look for are more commonly experienced by women than men , such as tearfulness .
" With diagnostic criteria being more geared towards women , we have heard that men's depression is n't always picked up and men who do try to reach out are slipping through the net and not receiving the support they need – support that can prove to be life saving .
Men make up three quarters of all suicides , and we have to start looking beyond the statistics . "
His call was backed by Peter Baker , head of the Men 's Health Forum , who said that men needed male - only clinics and groups , just like women already have , to help deal with the taboo of depression and anxiety .
" We 're not trying to start a competition between men and women about who is worse off , " said Baker .
" But the often quoted figure that middle - aged women suffer from depression at twice the rates of men is just not what we find to be true ; it is clear that the standard diagnostic tools being used pick up depression are n't working for men .
" The male mental distress manifests itself in other ways and is not always about sitting morosely in a corner ; nobody likes being around people being aggressive , which mitigates the kind of sympathy men can receive .
" Men are also less comfortable in the GP 's surgery than women and are not brought up to ask for help ; they want to appear in control and not weak or vulnerable .
But when men can't cope , they are the ones who go missing , who kill themselves , or who end up on the streets .
Women are streets ahead in asking for and getting the services they need . "
The chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners , Professor Steve Field , said doctors were aware of the problems of getting men to come forward for medical help when they needed it .
" I do n't think it is GPs missing the symptoms , as much as people not coming forward .
It is common for men to come into a surgery and the real symptom they are worried about wo n't be the first one they mention .
" Men 's mental health has worried me for a long time , " he said .
" We need to reach men , get more health issues into the curriculum at schools and teach boys it 's OK to talk . "
A survey of iPad buyers found that 44 percent would purchase the touchscreen device instead of a notebook , and 41 percent would not buy an iPod touch as a result of their tablet .
The March 2010 Alphawise survey results , disclosed Thursday by analyst Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley , give insight into the potential cannibalization of other Apple products due to the release of the iPad .
The study found that of the 44 percent who would not buy a notebook , 24 percent would not buy a MacBook , while the other 20 percent would not purchase a PC .
The survey also found that 27 percent of users would not buy a desktop as a result of their iPad purchase , with 14 percent of those not buying a Mac desktop , and the other 13 percent passing on a PC .
The survey also found that the iPad will affect e-reader and handheld videogame sales , two segments in which Apple does not have a dedicated device .
Huberty said that the iPad has already had an impact on portable computer sales , which have slowed since the start of 2010 .
The results suggest that the netbook market was most impacted by Apple 's iPad .
" U.S. consumer PC , and especially notebook , growth decelerated in January when Apple introduced the iPad and again in April when the iPad launched , " she wrote .
" Given the corresponding increase in ( average selling prices ) in the market , we believe much of the demand shortfall came from netbooks and low - cost notebooks . "
The data was included as part of a note on HP 's acquisition of Palm for $ 1.2 billion .
HP has already suggested that Palm's WebOS could extend to platforms beyond smartphones , and be ported to tablets and netbooks to compete in the mobile space with Apple 's iPad .
" HP 's acquisition of a mobile operating system is supportive of our view that mobile Internet devices , and tablets in particular , may prove a headwind to notebook growth , " Huberty wrote .
Her " bull case assumptions " suggest the global tablet market could grow to 60 million units in 2013 , which is nearly double the current netbook numbers .
She expects Apple 's iPhone OS and Google 's Android mobile operating system to be the market leaders in the tablet space , but said WebOS could capture a 15 percent market share by then .
The projection also calls for 35.6 percent gross margin for HP 's WebOS tablets , which would be better than rival HTC's 31.6 percent margins , but well below a projected 2011 gross margin of between 45 percent and 50 percent for Apple and the iPhone and iPad .
Apple 's iPad has had a strong start , with recently announced sales of 1 million in the first 28 days , based solely on U.S. sales .
That well exceeds most analysts ' expectations , most of whom predicted soon after the product 's launch that it would sell between 1 million and 5 million in its first year .
During Apple 's last quarterly earnings conference call , Tim Cook , the company 's chief operating officer , declined to predict how much the iPad would cannibalize sales of other Apple products .
He noted that after the iPad was announced in January , there was " nothing obvious " seen in sals of iPods or Macs .
He did , however , say that he could see the iPad taking a large portion of the netbook market .

Organisers of a graphic crucifixion reenactment in Victoria , which made children cry and was shut down by police , have vowed to tone down the event next year .
Where you there ?

This crucifixion reenactment made Geelong police cross .
Children were sobbing in distress at the sight of a man covered in fake blood who appeared to be nailed to a cross in the middle of a Geelong shopping precinct on Saturday afternoon , local police say .
But Heaven on Earth pastor Sarah Kenneally , who helped organise the event , said she saw no distressed children and police compromised freedom of religion by shutting down the reenactment .
Inside Perl 5.12
Perl 5.12 has just come out .
A rejuvenated development process helps ensure a bright future for Perl as it enters its third decade of making easy things easy and hard things possible .
Here ’s what you can expect when you upgrade to the latest release .
Release Schedule
The largest change in Perl 5.12 is n’t code .
It ’s the new release schedule .
Perl 5 now has monthly development releases on the 20th of every month .
Perl 5.13.0 is almost out , as of the time of writing .
These monthly releases are snapshots of the development process .
They represent points at which people interested in what will become Perl 5.14 can test against their most important code .
The current plan is to release Perl 5.14 in a year .
Sometime around March , the release manager will put together release candidates and start the countdown for final testing and release blocking bugs .
The process will repeat .
The Perl 5.12.x family will have several new releases in the next year as well , though they will have only a few changes .
Jesse Vincent described the policy for what changes will go into Perl 5.12.x maintenance releases in a message to the Perl 5 Porters .
5.12.1 will come out in May 2010 .
It will contain fixes for bugs found in 5.12.0 , but it will contain no new features or behaviors .
5.12.2 will follow in three months , and so on .
It ’s not clear if 5.12.4 ( February 2011 ) will be the final release of the 5.12.x family .
These plans are subject to change , but the monthly releases have gone well , and the release process for 5.12 had little controversy .
It ’s likely the next year will proceed similarly .
Improved Package Version Syntax
In previous versions of Perl 5 , individual packages set their version numbers by manipulating the package global variable $ VERSION .
There were few rules for what this variable contained or how to parse this version number , and toolchain modules such as ExtUtils : : MakeMaker and Module : : Build have to perform several contortions to parse them with any degree of accuracy .
David Golden ’s Version Numbers Should Be Boring gives copious detail on how to do version numbers right , if you ca n’t use 5.12 .
An addition to the core version module enables a feature called “ strict version numbers ” , where these numbers conform to a few guidelines .
The most important rule is that version numbers must be standard numbers with one decimal point ( 1.23 ” > }} ) or version strings ( v1.234.5 ) .
You may only use strict version numbers with the new package version syntax :
package Perl : : Improved 1.23 ; package Perl : : Improved v1.23.45 ;
Internally , Perl will parse these the same way as it does :
use Perl : : Improved 1.23 ; use Perl : : Improved v1.23.45 ;
… which is a benefit for consistency .
As well , toolchain utilities can find and parse these version numbers with little effort , thanks in no small part to a canonical set of version number parsing regular expressions now found in version .
“ >}} Sadly , there ’s currently no mechanism by which to add this syntax to 5.10 , but in a couple of years this may be the preferred way of specifying version numbers in Perl 5 .
Strictures by Default
Several CPAN modules enable features such as strict when you use them , including Moose , perl5i , Modern : : Perl , Dancer , and Mojolicious .
Perl 5.12 also enables strictures when it encounters use 5.012 ; , along with other new language syntax features such as the say and given / when keywords .
use 5.012 does not enable warnings .
The - E flag does enable new language features , but it does not enable strictures .
The - M5.012 flag does enable strictures and new language features .
Y2038 Safety
While Perl itself did not have a Y2 K problem , many programs written in Perl made assumptions that produced apparent Y2 K problems .
Unfortunately , Perl ’s time handling relies on system libraries , and many of those systems exhaust their available capabilities when dealing with dates and times in the year 2038 .
( Developers who think they have decades to solve this problem should consider financial instruments such as 30 - year mortgages . )
Perl 5.12 extends support for time and date handling in the core localtime and gmtime functions to manage dates beyond 2038 without overflow or truncation problems .
Replacement libraries for earlier versions of Perl are available from the CPAN as Time : : y2038 .
Core Support for Language Mutation Extensions
Devel :: Declare is the basis for a handful of CPAN distributions which add new features to Perl 5 without the drawbacks of source filters .
signatures and MooseX : : Declare are two prime examples ; they simplify common tasks in a very Perlish way and demonstrate how a few syntactic additions can remove a lot of repetitive code .
“ >}} Unlike source filters , they compose together well and do n’t interfere with external code .
Devel :: Declare works by hijacking part of the Perl 5 parsing process .
Though this has required poking in Perl ’s internals , Perl 5.12 includes a few APIs to make this behavior cleaner and better supported .
In other words , it ’s not only okay for Devel : : Declare to exist , but it ’s important that it exist and work and continue to work .
Some developers have discussed the idea of bringing Devel : : Declare into the core in one form or another .
This may or may not happen for Perl 5.14 .
Regardless , the process gives modules such as signatures and MooseX : : Declare a further stability and support , and it provides opportunities for further syntax - bending extensions , some of which may enter the core themselves as new features .
Deprecation Warnings by Default
Perl 5 development makes a priority of supporting syntactic constructs found in older versions of Perl , even going as far as to deprecate but not remove some .
As a minor compatibility change in Perl 5.12 , deprecated features now give warnings when you use them , even if you have n’t explicitly enabled deprecated warnings with use warnings ' deprecated ' ; .
You may still disable deprecated warnings with no warnings ' deprecated ' ; – they ’re still lexical warnings–but now these deprecations will be more obvious to developers who upgrade to and test their existing code against new releases of Perl 5 .
Deprecations do not necessarily imply any timeframe for removal of the deprecated feature , except as otherwise expressed explicitly in the appropriate release delta .
See perl5120 delta for more details about specific deprecations in this release .
“ >}}
@INC Reorganized
Several of the core modules distributed with Perl 5 have dual lives on the CPAN .
It ’s possible ( and often worthwhile ) to update them separately from the rest of Perl 5 .
If you do , Perl has to be able to find the updated versions instead of the core versions .
When you compile Perl 5 itself , @INC contains a handful of default directories in which to look for modules .
Some of these directories will contain core modules .
Others contain modules you ’ll install later ( likely through a CPAN client ) .
A reorganization of the order of these directories in the default @INC in Perl 5.12 makes Perl 5 prefer to load user - installed modules over core - supplied modules .
This will make it easier to manage dual - lived modules , and should help distributions which package and redistribute Perl 5 to manage their installation paths appropriately .
Unless you ’re a Perl 5 distributor , you should see no difference except for the lack of strange problems .
Deprecations
A handful of core modules are now deprecated : Class :: ISA , Pod : : Plainer , Switch , and Shell .
They remain available from the CPAN , though consider using given / when ( introduced in Perl 5.10.0 ” > }} ) instead of Switch .
There ’s no deprecation category quite strong enough to describe the recommendation against it .
The core has also included several libraries written in the Perl 4 era .
They are now available from the CPAN in the Perl4 : : CoreLibs distribution .
Though they are not quite deprecated yet , they will be in Perl 5.14 .
In almost every case , Perl 5 era replacements exist under active maintenance .
“ >}}
Unicode Improvements
As the Unicode standards change , so must Perl 5 ’s Unicode handling .
The biggest change in Perl 5.12 is an update to support the latest standards and definitions , specifically Unicode properties , property values , and regular expression matches using Unicode properties .
Miscellaneous
Many bugs have been fixed .
Several performance improvements are present .
More tests are available .
Dual - lived modules have been updated .
More documentation is available ( including perlperf , a detailed discussion of profiling and optimizing Perl 5 programs ” > }} ) .
Some 200 people have changed 750,000 lines in more than 3,000 files .
Even with all of those changes , Perl 5 remains a vibrant , powerful programming language .
Programs written a decade ago will still run with few , if any , necessary changes , and almost all of the CPAN is ready to run on it .
Yet development still continues .
Perl 5.13.0 will come out on 20 April 2010 , with all of the concomitant possibilities for improvements , bug fixes , and even more practical pragmatism .
Perl 5.12.1 and 5.13.1 will follow next month , with more bugs fixed , documentation improved , core modules updated , and the language always a little bit nicer to use .

JDBC Type 5 Drivers Needed to Overcome Type 4 Limitations
The Java Database Connectivity ( JDBC ) API is the data connectivity standard for industrial - strength , data - driven Java applications , and for nearly all purposes , native protocol ( Type 4 ) drivers provide the best JDBC architecture .
However , in the 10 - plus years since Type 4 was introduced , some important and far - reaching innovations and trends have taken place in the Java ecosystem .
These advancements have pushed Type 4 drivers beyond their limits in today 's data centers .
Any JDBC drivers that are fundamentally based on the Type 4 architecture yet are designed to address all or most of these limitations represent a drastic departure from the norm .
In fact , such drivers could be classified as an entirely new type .
Call them what you will , but for the purposes of this discussion , they are " Type 5 . "
Not all developers truly understand the role JDBC middleware plays in application - to - data operations , beyond simply enabling connectivity .
In fact , with the increased abstraction of object modeling and higher - level applications , many a developer views JDBC drivers as vital but " dumb " pipes rather than critical cogs that not only drive the success of an application stack but also enhance it .
For this reason , some in the developer community may take a " so - what ? " attitude toward the notion of a JDBC Type 5 driver .
They may even reject the whole notion of a data connectivity driver as a component where innovations such as application failover for high availability ought to take place .
Such innovations , they could reason , are more appropriately handled at the higher application level .
This reasoning , however , is very debatable .
The Limits of Type 4
Among developers who are knowledgeable about the behind - the - scenes workings of middleware data connectivity using JDBC drivers , the limitations of a Type 4 driver are generally undisputable .
These include :
The need to write and maintain code specific to each supported data source .
Even with modern framework - based object - relational mapping ( ORM ) models , JDBC Type 4 drivers typically require the use of proprietary code to support variant database features such as BLOBs and CLOBs , high availability , and XA .
Poor and / or inconsistent driver response times or data throughput performance when the driver is deployed in certain runtime environments ( such as different JVMs ) or with ORMs and application servers .
The inability to tune or optimize critical applications , or the ability to do so only with considerable application downtime .
Poor virtual machine ( VM ) consolidation ratios due to inefficient runtime CPU usage and high memory footprints .
Deployment headaches such as having to deploy multiple JARs to support different JVMs or database versions , or DLLs to support certain driver or database functionality .
These limitations point to the following key trends and advances in the modern Java environment as the sources of today 's Type 4 driver challenges :
Application support of multiple databases
Increased server virtualization and data center consolidation
Rapid adoption of ORM models such as Hibernate or app servers such as JBoss that sit on top of JDBC drivers and permit no access to JDBC code

At the onset , the newspaper blurb offering emotional healing beckoned to the vulnerable Cupertino woman , estranged from her husband after years of domestic abuse .
What the woman said she did not know then was that two years after answering the advertisement , she would be swindled out of $ 450,000 in an elaborate scam , which has left her broke , deep in debt and in even more despair .
Authorities say the source of the woman ’s misery , Peaches Marks , 43 — a self - described healer who has served time in several states for bilking other emotionally fragile victims — is now in Santa Clara County Jail , charged with grand theft , extortion and identity theft .
Marks also is believed to have swindled more victims in the South Bay and in other states , using various aliases including , Anna Marks and Christine Blick .
“ I feel very angry and betrayed , ” said the onetime prosperous real estate entrepreneur from Cupertino who did not want her name used .
After responding to the ad in January 2003 in the Chinese - language newspaper , the World Journal , the Cupertino victim began meeting with Marks almost daily at the suspect ’s gated Cupertino apartment complex .
“ She was willing to support me and listen to me , ” said the victim , who is in her 50s , during an interview Thursday with the Mercury News .
No money was exchanged — at first .
They shared confidences and prayed , with Marks claiming at one point to have extracted evil spirits from her and showing her a blood clot she supposedly removed from the victim ’s neck , authorities said .
“ She continued to make me believe she was a missionary and that all she was trying to do is help people , ” said the victim , a Taiwanese immigrant who moved to the United States in her 20s to pursue an education .
According to the Cupertino woman , Marks portrayed herself as financially independent , living on a lucrative life insurance settlement she received after her husband ’s recent death .
At one point , Marks told her she would attend a temple at a secret location , to seek guidance from her master , and that other Chinese monk disciples attended as well , the woman said .
The victim never doubted her .
“ My life was very closed off , ” said the victim , a mother of three .
“ I did not have much of a social life and no opportunity to learn religion . ”
To the woman , Marks seemed like a calm , peaceful , simple woman .
“ I did n’t know I would get into a trap . ”
Authorities say Marks tried to establish credentials with the victim by telling her she was an eye doctor , a professor at De Anza College and a researcher of the SARS virus — all lies , said Kristin Anderson , a sheriff ’s detective who led the investigation in early 2009 .
Six months after their initial meeting , authorities say ,
Marks began telling the victim that for her prayers to be heard and answered more quickly , she ’d need to buy gold hearts , which then would be embossed with the victim ’s family members ’ names .
The money would be placed in a sock with rose petals and kept at a temple .
Marks promised to return the gold once the victim was healed — something she never did , Anderson said .
Authorities say the victim first gave Marks $ 9,800 .
Then she handed over $ 12,000 , then $ 48,000 , and an additional $ 45,000 .
The highest amount she paid at one time was $ 51,000 .
After spending all her cash , the victim began borrowing on her equity line and drawing cash advances on her credit cards .
From 2003 to 2005 , the victim estimated she had given Marks $ 450,000 .
During that time , the woman said , Marks — who moved from house to house — made up other ruses to get her money , including seeking donations to help children who needed surgery for various illnesses .
Finally , the victim ran out of money and her meetings with Marks began tapering off , before stopping altogether .
And , she said , when she asked Marks for her money back , her healer became evasive and then disappeared .
“ I did n’t know what to do , ” the woman said .
“ I gave up .
I did n’t know where she was . ”
Still , the victim was not suspicious — not until 2008 , when she told a relative in Los Angeles what had happened .
The relative raised her suspicions and then subsequently contacted the Santa Clara County Sheriff ’s Office , which launched the investigation .
Marks — who had been sought by Santa Clara County authorities on a $ 500,000 arrest warrant since November — was stopped during a traffic check in Anaheim , where police spotted her in a Mercedes with a Florida license plate .
They discovered she had an arrest warrant stemming from the Cupertino case .
“ I am relieved and optimistic that justice will be served , ” said the Cupertino woman .
“ I feel there are many other more people like me who she targeted . ”
So does the sheriff ’s office , which is asking anyone with information about Marks to call Anderson at 408-808-4500 .
Contact Lisa Fernandez at 408-920-5002 .
The harbour was turned into a spectacular reception area , as hundreds of boats crammed into the narrow waters to greet the young adventurer on her small , pink yacht .
She had left Sydney in October , sailing in sometimes difficult conditions through the Pacific , across the equator , past Cape Horn in South America , across the Atlantic , past the Cape of Good Hope , through the Indian Ocean before returning to Australian waters .
Fellow solo sailors Australian Jesse Martin and English teen Mike Perham helped Watson take her yacht in after she crossed the finish line , as an aeroplane wrote her name ‘‘ Jessica ’ ’ in white smoke in the sky .
Fears that Watson would struggle to walk after such a long time at sea were unfounded , as she made her way up a pink carpet to the Opera House forecourt with her family , wearing a broad grin and looking none the worse for her epic voyage .
Greeted by the Prime Minister
She was met by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , who hailed her as " Australia 's newest hero " .
" You do our nation proud , " he said .
" You are a hero for young Australians ... and young Australian women . "
But Watson said she had to disagree with Mr Rudd as " I do n't consider myself a hero " .
Stepping off was so strange , because for the last seven months , I was doing everything to stay on board " I 'm an ordinary girl who had a dream .
You just have to have a dream and set your mind to it . ’’
Confident and relaxed , Watson was even able to throw in a joke or two .
‘‘ It was tough , ’’ she said when asked how it felt to leave her yacht .
‘‘ Stepping off was so strange , because for the last seven months , I was doing everything to stay on board , ’’ she said as the crowd laughed .
‘ You can achieve anything ’
The Queenslander was quick to emphasise how young people - especially girls - could achieve anything ‘‘ if you want it enough ’ ’ .
‘‘ People do n’t realise ... what girls are made of , ’’ she said .
‘‘ When you take away those expectations , it ’s amazing what you can achieve . ’’
She added at a press conference later that people ‘‘ just need the passion to want something bad enough and a way to make it happen ’ ’ .
‘‘ The thing that picked me up in the tough times was having come through other tough things , like the day I sailed in after the collision [ on my trial run ] holding my head high to the critics .
‘‘ I held my head high then , I can do this . ’’
Also present to welcome Watson was NSW Premier Kristina Keneally , who joked the young sailor was ‘‘ possibly the most important person in Australia , because you made the Prime Minister and NSW Premier and all these people wait for hours for your return ’’ .
But she hailed the teen for her courage and for reminding people that ‘ ‘ it ’s possible to follow our dream ’’ .
Dismisses criticism Watson brushed off criticism expressed during the last week of her journey that she did not fulfil the requirements to get a world record , saying ‘‘it ’s not something that worries me ’’ .
‘‘ It ’s really simple .
If I have n’t sailed around the world , I ’d be lost as to what I ’ve just spent the last seven months doing , ’’ she said .
Sail World website said Watson would not break Martin 's 1999 record , as she had only travelled 18,265 nautical miles , about 2000 nautical miles short of qualifying for official ‘‘ around the world ’’ status .
‘‘ For me , it was never just about the record , so I ’m not worried at all . ’’
She also refused to comment on Dutch sailor Laura Dekker ’s difficulties , after the 14 - year - old was blocked by her government from circumnavigating the globe because of her age , saying she did n’t know what Dekker ’s preparations were .
But she added she ’d learnt that ‘‘ you do n’t judge someone by a number or what they look like . ’’
What ’s next ?
Watson joked she had changed after the trip as she was ‘ ‘ a year older ’ ’ .
But she said she learnt that ‘ ‘ it ’s definitely about having fun ’ ’ .
‘‘ Just do n’t take it too seriously , ’’ she said .
The 16 - year - old - who turns 17 in three days - said she looked forward to doing more sailing and perhaps racing , but was happy to ‘‘ do normal things ’ ’ now .
Loading ‘‘ [ I ’ll ] just have a quiet few years , finish school , that sort of thing .
‘‘ We ’ll see where sailing takes me after that . ’’

Masked men defending a reputed druglord wanted by the United States burned down a police station and traded gunfire with security forces in a patchwork of barricaded slums in Jamaica 's capital yesterday .
The gunmen are thought to be supporters of Christopher ' Dudus ' Coke .
Photograph : AP
The government declared a state of emergency as sporadic gunshots rang out in impoverished West Kingston , stronghold of Christopher " Dudus " Coke , a Jamaican who is charged in the US with drug and arms trafficking .
His defiant supporters turned his Tivoli Gardens neighbourhood and other areas into a fortress with trashed cars and barbed wire .
Four police stations came under heavy fire from gangsters roaming the streets with high - powered guns .
In barricaded Hannah Town , close to Tivoli Gardens , black smoke spiralled into the sky from a police station that was set on fire by molotov cocktails .
Officers fled the station in West Kingston , where 25 civilians , a soldier and a police officer were killed in a standoff between gunmen and security forces in 2001 .
Authorities said two security officers had been wounded last night and that the attacks were unprovoked .
It called for all " decent and law - abiding citizens " in the troubled areas to immediately evacuate their homes and said security forces would ferry them out safely .
Police commissioner Owen Ellington said " scores of criminals " from gangs across the Caribbean island had travelled to West Kingston to join the fight .
" It is now clear that criminal elements are determined to launch co-ordinated attacks on the security forces , " he said .
The violence erupted after nearly a week of rising tensions over the possible extradition of Coke to the US .
The prime minister , Bruce Golding , had stalled the extradition request for nine months with claims that the US indictment relied on illegal wiretap evidence .
After Golding reversed his stance amid growing public discontent over his opposition , Coke 's supporters began barricading streets and preparing for battle .
Before Sunday 's shooting started , police urged Coke to surrender , calling the heavy barricades around his slum stronghold a sign of cowardice .
The UK , the US and Canada issued travel alerts last Friday warning of possible violence and unrest .
Most Jamaicans have been avoiding downtown Kingston .
The state of public emergency , limited to the parishes of Kingston and St Andrew , will be in effect for a month unless extended or revoked by lawmakers , the government said .
In a national address last night , Golding said the order gives authorities the power to restrict movement and effectively battle violent criminals .
Security forces will also be able to conduct searches and detain people without warrants .
Golding stressed that Kingston " is not being shut down " , and that schools and businesses outside the battle zone will be open .
Coke is described as one of the world 's most dangerous druglords by the US justice department .
He has ties to the governing Jamaica Labour party and holds significant sway over the West Kingston area represented in parliament by Golding .
Golding 's fight against the extradition strained relations with Washington , which questioned Jamaica 's reliability as an ally in the fight against drugs .
His handling of the matter , particularly his hiring of a US firm to lobby Washington to drop the extradition request , provoked an outcry in Jamaica that threatened his political career .
Coke , who typically avoids the limelight , has remained silent .
He faces life in prison if convicted on charges filed against him in New York .
His father was the leader of the notorious Shower Posse gang , a cocaine - trafficking mob with agents in Jamaica and the US which began operating in the 1980s and was named for its members ' tendency to spray victims with bullets .
The son took over from the father and expanded the gang into selling marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere , US authorities allege .
Lawyers for Coke , who is also known as Small Man and President , have challenged his extradition in Jamaica 's supreme court .
As a West Kingston community don , Coke has acted as an ad hoc civic leader and provides protection and jobs .
Ca n't imagine anything going wrong with this plan :
Beijing is to install 100 deodorant guns at a stinking landfill site on the edge of the city in a bid to dampen complaints about the capital 's rubbish crisis .
... Beijing 's waste problem — and China 's — is expanding as fast as its economy , at about 8 % each year .
With millions more people now able to afford Starbucks , McDonald's , Kentucky Fried Chicken and other elements of a western , throwaway lifestyle , the landfill sites and illegal tips that ring the capital are close to overflowing .
Granted , deodorant guns are n't the only option out there .
China could build a slew of incinerators to burn all that trash .
The central government , for its part , is planning to increase the incineration rate to 40 percent by 2015 .
But the trouble is that trash incinerators have a nasty habit of emitting mercury and dioxins , which are linked to all sorts of health problems and can waft across the Pacific .
( The World Bank has estimated that dioxin levels in China could double if the government goes ahead with its planned incinerator spree . )
Meanwhile , no one wants to live near an incinerator , so it 's a nightmare trying to put them anywhere .
Europe and Japan have dealt with this problem by forcing stricter pollution standards on their waste - disposal facilities , but those cleaner incinerators tend to be pricey .
There 's also that old standby : recycle / reduce / reuse .
The Guardian notes that China recycles just 4 percent of its trash , compared with 35 percent in Britain .
But this old New York Times piece by Keith Bradsher quoted a Chinese waste engineer who explained how people in China feel about recycling : " No one really cares . "
Well , hope those deodorant guns do the trick , then .

* Clean Water
Act allows per-barrel fines for oil spillers
* Civil fines may raise liability , not subject to cap
* Extent of fine depends on whether there was negligence
* Liability , including fines , may top $ 10 billion
By Joshua Schneyer
NEW YORK , May 25 ( Reuters ) - Just how many barrels of oil are gushing into the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon spill is a billion dollar question with implications that go beyond the environment .
It could also help determine how much BP BP.L and others end up paying for the disaster .
A clause buried deep in the U.S. Clean Water
Act may expose BP and others to civil fines that are n’t limited to any finite cap -- unlike a $ 75 million limit on compensation for economic damages .
The Act allows the government to seek civil penalties in court for every drop of oil that spills into U.S. navigable waters , including the area of BP ’s leaking well .
As a result , the U.S. government could seek to fine BP or others up to $ 4,300 for every barrel leaked into the U.S. Gulf , according to legal experts and official documents .
So far , analysts and experts calculating potential oil spill liabilities have mostly concentrated on the cost of the clean - up and compensation for economic damages to affected parties .
Some have also discussed criminal liabilities .
But the potential for civil fines has received scant attention -- and they could add up very quickly , depending on how agressive the U.S. government is in pursuing them .
The threat of hefty fines underscores the importance of quantifying how much oil is pouring into the Gulf .
As BP seeks to staunch the leak that has now been gushing for at least 33 days , it has estimated a spill rate of 5,000 barrels per day .
But some experts say the volume -- and hence the fines -- could be more than 10 times higher .
The little - known , seldom applied clause in the Clean Water Act was added in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska , and was intended to beef up the arsenal of penalties the government can apply to oil spillers to deter future disasters .
“ These civil penalties could be staggeringly high , possibly running into the billions , ” said Professor David Uhlmann , director of the Environmental Law program at University of Michigan .
Total liability -- including civil fines as well as the cost of clean - up , economic damages and potential criminal liability -- “ will run into the billions and may be in the tens of billions , ” Uhlmann said .
Under the Clean Water Act , the Environmental Protection Agency can seek in federal court to fine any party whose negligence results in an oil spill in U.S. federal waters .
Other companies involved at the Horizon platform and the oilfield could share liability with BP , experts said .
They include rig-owner Transocean Ltd RIGN.S , cementing contractor Halliburton Co. HAL.N , blowout preventer manufacturer Cameron CAM.N , and Anadarko APC.N and Mitsui 8031.T , which also hold stakes in the oilfield .
SHARP RISE IN FINES
The basic fine , according to the act , is $ 1,100 per barrel spilled .
But the penalty can rise to $ 4,300 a barrel if a federal court rules the spill resulted from gross negligence .
The fines were originally set at $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 but that was raised in 2004 to keep up with inflation , according to Tracy Hester , head of the Evironmental Law and Policy program at the University of Houston .
( To see an EPA memo on 2004 revisions to penalties outlined in the Clean Water Act , click here : here )
It is unclear , however , that the EPA would try to apply the fines , or seek maximum penalty levels .
EPA officials did not respond to several calls and e-mails requesting comment .
If the agency does act , the per - barrel fines could push oil companies ’ liability well beyond the cost of cleaning up the spill and paying legitimate claims for economic damages it causes , experts told Reuters .
“ There are civil fines that could be quite substantial .
I think BP ’s exposure to this is far greater than people initially thought , ” said Harvard Law School professor Jody Freeman , who recently served in the White House as Counselor for Energy and Climate Change .
BP has already said it will voluntarily exceed a $ 75 million cap on liability for economic damages , pledging to pay any “ legitimate claim ” it receives .
But the civil fines are another wild card .
BP spokesman Mark Salt said the company had nothing further to add to what it has said about the costs of the oil spill response .
Cash raised from such fines would be funnelled to government pollution funds , which provide economic aid for hazardous material spills .
BP or other parties facing fines could appeal them , or try to settle with the government for a lesser amount .
Another option would be for BP or other responsible parties to seek a far - ranging settlement covering various areas of liability .
“ The amount of barrels being released from the well is going to be critical , ” said Hester of the University of Houston .
Under pressure over the government ’s response to the disaster , President Barack Obama last Friday created a bi-partisan commission on the spill , and the administration has pledged to independently verify the volume of oil leaking into the Gulf .
“ We ’re not depending on what BP is telling us , ” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told CNN last week .
Daniel Dennett and Linda Lascola have published a paper called , “ Preachers who are not Believers . ”
The authors extensively interviewed five active preachers who do n’t believe in God .
They are all closeted in this regard .
Fascinating reading .
Why not just come out of the closet and admit that they no longer believe ?
You ’ll see that they believe that they can still do an important job without that core belief .
Interestingly , the participants expressed that lack of belief in God is common among active preachers .
When asked his opinion of why ministers do not pass on their seminary - learned knowledge of Christian history to parishioners , one of the participants had this to say :
They do n’t want to rock the boat .
They do n’t want to lose donations .
They want to keep their jobs .
They do n’t want to stir up trouble in the congregation .
They ’ve got enough trouble as it is , keeping things moving along .
They do n’t want to make people mad at them .
They do n’t want to lose members .
What they will often do is bring in someone like me to be a lightning rod , and teach it , and they ’ll follow up on it .
I myself have spoken with at least four active members of the clergy over my lifetime ( all of them Catholic priests ) who admitted that they do n’t believe in the God that they describe at the pulpit .
They each admitted that this is not an impediment to doing good work as a priest .
Dennett ’s paper parallels his contention ( in his book , Breaking the Spell ) , that most believers do n’t actually believe in God .
Rather , they believe in belief in God .
They say they believe because they think it ’s important to say it , whether or not they actually believe .
I have often discussed Daniel Dennett ’s work at this site ( e.g. , here ) .
He has a track record of being extraordinarily able to thoroughly think through many topics regarding religion and express his conclusions succinctly .
Twenty - five years ago , BMW Technik was established to " develop innovative , forward - oriented vehicle concepts " like this never - before - seen Z1 shooting brake .
Looking at the concepts that never reached production is like gazing into a world where BMW never became BBW .

Technik is essentially a Bavarian skunkworks , the part of BMW responsible for investigating new technologies and ideas that form the future of the brand .
Sadly , the future of funky sports cars and crazy hatchbacks that the division once pushed for became a present filled with overweight crossovers like the 5 - Series GT .
For the moment , however , let 's ignore the present and focus on what could have been .
BMW Just 4/2
At just 1212 pounds , the Just 4/2 is 3781 pounds — or one E90 M3 — lighter than a a BMW X6 M. Motivation comes from a BMW K1100 motorcycle four churning out 100 hp. 60 mph arrives in six seconds .
The Just 4/ 2 is obviously a Lotus 7 copy , but it would have been one hell of a drive .

BMW E1
It 's not the electric E1's 75 - mph top speed or its 125 - mile range that gets us hot and bothered , but rather its styling and diminutive size .
It 's like the horribly disfigured , misbegotten child of a Honda CRX and a BMW 8 - series .
Imagine if the 1 - series had been small , light , and practical instead of , you know , how it turned out .
Apparently there 's a front - wheel - drive electric BMW coming in the near future .
It probably wo n't look as cool as this .
BMW Z1 Prototype
You 're probably familiar with the BMW Z1 roadster , but have you seen the prototype ?
The first product of BMW Technik was a monocoque steel chassis with a plastic floor and plastic bodywork .
High sills provide side - impact protection while strengthening the car 's chassis .
The best part is the vertically sliding doors .
The Z1's " centrally spherical double wishbone system " rear suspension later became known as the Z-axle and was adopted by the E36 3 - Series .
The Z1 was n't supposed to enter production , but it found its way to showrooms in 1988 .
Eight thousand examples were sold between 1988 and 1990 .

BMW Z1 Shooting Brake
BMW calls this shooting brake the Z1 Coupe , but it 's really the predecessor to the BMW Z3 M Coupe .
Technik actually developed a four - wheel - drive version of this vehicle , one that has n't been seen in public until now .
Let 's add this up : steel monocoque , plastic body , plastic floor , vertical doors , two seats , wagon back , half E30 , half E36 .
If that does n't equal awesome , we do n't know what does .
BMW Z13
A rear - engined hatch with McLaren F1 - style seating — the driver sits in the middle with one passenger on each side — and enough storage space for 6.5 - foot skis .
The Z13 weighed just 1830 pounds ; its 82 - hp engine returns 40 mpg .

BMW Z18
Back in the mid '90s , Americans starting snapping up SUVs instead of sports cars as vanity purchases .
Boggled by this , Technik 's engineers found a way to combine the impracticality of a sports car with the poor handling of an SUV .
This probably sounded awesome at the time .
Hell , we 'd still take one of these over a 5 - series GT .
The Z18's plastic body resembled that of a boat , enabling the car to ford very deep water .
Power came from a 355 - hp V - 8 .
Actually , the more we think about this , the more we think BMW was onto something here .

BMW Z22
Looking for all the world like an early 5 - series GT prototype , the Z22 was actually a lot more than just an ugly body .
Equipped with steer - by - wire , brake - by - wire , panoramic rear view cameras , a fingerprint scanner , and a heads - up display , the Z22 was meant to explore high - tech solutions to problems that did n't exist .
Ah , now that 's the BMW we 're all so fond of .
The square steering wheel had no point other than looking different .
Shifting occurred Jaguar XF - style through a rotary knob that controlled a constant - velocity transmission .
Advertisement
There were two key areas where the Z22 was n't lame : weight and packaging .
It shared a wheelbase with the 7 - series but was no larger than a 3 - series .
Thanks to a carbon monocoque , it also weighed 30 percent less than a 5 - series and returned 40 mpg .
BMW Z29
A BMW with Lambo doors ?!?
The Z29 was actually designed in 2001 , long before every Civic in Fresno had flippy lids .
Long a closely guarded secret , the Z29 was created to explore lightweight construction methods .
Powered by a 343 - hp in - line six borrowed from the E46 M3 , the Z29 weighed just 2557 pounds , or almost 900 pounds lighter than the M3 .
A carbon / plastic passenger cell with aluminum subframes bolted to the front and rear .
Weight was saved by doubling the function of interior components — the air vents , for instance , support the dash .
Facebook is increasingly finding itself at the center of a tense discussion over privacy and how personal data is used by the Web sites that collect it , said James E. Katz , a professor of communications at Rutgers University .
Image Facebook asks users to link information in their profiles , which makes that information public .

“ It ’s clear that we keep discovering new boundaries of privacy that are possible to push and just as quickly breached , ” Mr. Katz said .
Social networking experts and analysts wonder whether Facebook is pushing the envelope in a way that could damage its reputation over time .
The privacy mishap on Wednesday did not help matters .
“ While this breach appears to be relatively small , it ’s inopportunely timed , ” said Augie Ray , an analyst with Forrester Research .
“ It threatens to undermine what Facebook hopes to achieve with its network over the next few years , because users have to ask whether it is a platform worthy of their trust . ”
Over the last few months , Facebook has introduced changes that encourage users to make their photos and other information accessible to anyone on the Internet .
Last month its chief executive , Mark Zuckerberg , unveiled plans to begin sharing users ’ information with some outside Web sites , and Facebook began prompting users to link information in their profile pages , like their hobbies and hometowns , in a way that makes that information public .
That last change prompted the Electronic Privacy Information Center , an advocacy group , to file a complaint on Wednesday with the Federal Trade Commission .
“ Facebook continues to manipulate the privacy settings of users and its own privacy policy so that it can take personal information provided by users for a limited purpose and make it widely available for commercial purposes , ” Marc Rotenberg , the group ’s executive director , said in a letter to the commission .
A candy - apple red 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 is at the center of an unusual court fight , and the car is lingering at a salvage yard until a judge decides who owns it .
Even stripped - down and without an engine , the body of the classic Mustang could be worth $ 30,000 .
If restored , it could garner $ 200,000 from an interested buyer .
The car was reported stolen in 1980 and , officially , never recovered .
But Jeff
Dove , the man who reported it stolen , died last year , leaving behind a tangled legal web .
Tim Shuler , an Aurora man who spent time and money trying to restore the car , and American Family , the insurance company that paid $ 14,000 on the theft claim 30 years ago , are at odds over who owns it .
Shuler , 42 , fell in love with Mustang muscle cars when he was 8 years old , riding in the back of his uncle ’s 1968 Shelby KR Mustang while speeding down Interstate 25 .
“ I remember standing up in the back seat when he was doing 140 , ” Shuler said .
“ I was looking over his shoulder at the speedometer . ”
The mystique of the Shelby dates back to the 1960s , when Carroll Shelby , a race - car driver turned automotive designer , helped Ford turn the Mustang into a racer by changing the suspension and the design .
Ford made a million Mustangs by the mid-1960s , but only 3,000 of them were Shelbys , making them a rarity coveted among collectors .
“ It is the cream of the crop of Mustangs if you are a Mustang enthusiast , ” said Joe Bolis , the Colorado president and regional representative of the Shelby American Automobile Club .
As a teenager , Shuler got addicted to racing cars at Bandimere Speedway .
He loved racing so much that he sometimes slept only a couple of hours before waking up and racing again .
Shuler began restoring cars as a hobby , and when Dove came to his Aurora home in 1996 and asked him to refurbish his ’ 67 Shelby , Shuler agreed .
Over a 12 - year period , Shuler stored the car at his house , restoring only the steering wheel .
Shuler says he also loaned Dove money with an agreement that the car was collateral .
“ He has legal claims to the car because he held it so long and he had an oral contract with Mr. Dove , ” said Shuler ’s attorney Kevin Flesch .
When Dove first brought the car to him , Shuler asked Dove for the title , but Dove told him he had lost the paperwork .
Dove never returned for the car , and in May 2008 , Shuler decided to title the Shelby for himself .
When Shuler took it to the Division of Motor Vehicles , a state trooper ran the car ’s vehicle identification number through the National Crime Information Center and it cleared , but when the trooper ran it through an online insurance - theft database , the Shelby came up as stolen .
Shuler said it ’s possible that Dove defrauded the insurance company , but he also believes that it ’s possible the car was recovered .
According to investigative reports , the Colorado State Patrol questioned Dove before he died , and Dove told them the car had been recovered , but had been so stripped , they allowed him to keep the insurance payout .
Steve Witmer , a spokesman for American Family , said the company is certain that it paid out $ 14,000 to Dove on the stolen car , meaning that if it has now been found , it belongs to the insurer .
He also acknowledged that American Family lost the file on the Shelby — including the title to it .
“ It ’s not normal for information like a title to be destroyed , ” Witmer said , but the company does have some remaining documentation that a claim was paid .
That explains why Shuler and American Family are fighting in court .
But why is the Shelby in an impound yard ?
Shuler said that ’s because a State Patrol detective accused him of stealing the car and running a chop shop .
And that is because a second VIN was stamped on the Shelby — one that identified it as a yellow Ford Mustang .
Detectives suspected the second VINs were from another vehicle .
The State Patrol seized the car from Shuler ’s house because Shuler refused to relinquish it voluntarily .
Shuler said he did n’t trust the State Patrol ’s investigator because he allegedly was mistreated .
Shuler eventually filed a complaint against Investigator Zach Murray with internal affairs .
In a letter to Shuler , the State Patrol determined Murray “ had sufficient probable cause to investigate the lawful ownership of the vehicle . ”
“ It ’s the principle of the thing , ” Shuler said of refusing to turn over the Shelby .
“ It ’s abusing their authority . ”
In December 2008 , Shuler was charged with two felony counts of altering the VINs on the Shelby .
“ I did n’t do anything wrong , ” he said .
“ I ’ve never been in trouble .
I never hid this car from anybody . ”
The case was later dismissed by the district attorney in Arapahoe County and a judge ordered that the Mustang be released to Shuler .
But when Shuler went to the salvage yard with his court order , he learned the State Patrol and American Family had placed a legal hold on the Shelby .
The insurance company then filed a lawsuit against him in Douglas County .
A hearing is scheduled for July 2 .
If the Shelby is returned to Shuler , he said he ’ll be forced to sell it because he owes money to friends who helped him with his legal fees .
“ I will find a good home for it , ” he said , “ but I am not going to quit . ”
Shuler said he already knows two interested buyers .
The fight over the Shelby is n’t about money , Shuler said , because he ’s never made more than a few thousand dollars restoring cars .
“ In this business , you have to have heart , ” he said .

Google Admits to Collecting WiFi Data through Street View
Coming on the heels of the uproar over Facebook 's recent privacy policy changes , reports that Google has found itself embroiled in a privacy dust - up involving its Street View feature in Google Maps .
The search engine has admitted that its StreetView cars - which travel around the world with a 360 - degree camera collecting images for the Street View feature - were also collecting WiFi information from different neighborhoods , including payload information about data being sent across wireless networks .
Several weeks ago , Germany 's Data Protection Authority asked Google to review its StreetView cars to determine what data it was collecting during its tours of German streets .
Initially , Google claimed that it was only collecting data such as SSIDs and MAC addresses - open information that was not being illegally obtained .
However , on Friday Google admitted that " it 's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open ( i.e. non-password - protected )
WiFi networks , even though we never used that data in any Google products .
" According to , this is n't the first time that Google has had issues with the German government over its Street View feature .
An earlier planned launch of Street View in Germany was scrapped after government officials claimed that the service - which lets people see street level views of almost any location - violated German privacy laws . -

ROUND 3 : MALAYSIAN GP , Sepang , 2 - 4 April 2010
( This forecast will be regularly updated .
This entry : Sun. 4 April , 07:15hrs BST )
NOWCAST UPDATE , Sunday 09:40hrs :
No immediate threat of showers - doubtless a relief for certain teams !
NOWCAST UPDATE , Sunday 08:45hrs :
As noted below , the distinctly capped look to the clouds was very evident as a backdrop to Martin 's gridwalk a moment ago .
Bernie Ecclestone suggests rain at 4.15 pm but the clouds say otherwise !
Dry running for the start ; probably the 30 mins thereafter and we 'll then see how the shower threat increases as the race is underway .
It could all change very quickly indeed .
NOWCAST UPDATE , Sunday 08:15hrs : Crucially , there 's less potent convection around compared to the same time yesterday ; the growth of the cumulus clouds is presently capped aloft , preventing widespread showers for now .
However , if this capping breaks - down later ( and it probably will ) , we will see the shower cells tower up very quickly and energetically .
But where , exactly ?
And when ?
Later in the race looks at risk .
It 's going to be another situation where watching radar alone is not sufficient insurance against red faces on the pitlane : cloud watching will be equally important .
NOWCAST UPDATE , Sunday 07:15hrs :
Well , the day has followed a familiar pattern thus - far : a very hot , sultry , dry morning in Sepang .
Latest forecast expecations continue much as previously advertised , with showers expected to tower - up through the late afternoon before turning thundery in places and organising into bands parallel to the west coast .
The influences of topography and low - level convergence will again tend to preferentially form shower cells east of the circuit , before these move west in the prevailing light winds .
Risk of wet weather at some stage of the race is around 70 % .
As we saw yesterday , this could be realised even before the lights go out at 4 pm local time ...
------------------------------------------------------------
NOWCAST UPDATE , Saturday 09:55hrs :
These conditions are exactly as I expect by this time tomorrow , too .
No real surprises .
I 'm amazed that some teams followed the radar so slavishly as to assume a dry window earlier in Q1 .
In these developmental situations , it was always very likely that the cells would rapidly evolve into thunderstorms .
As any storm chaser will attest , a clear slot evident on the radar in this type of set - up does n't equate to a guarantee of dry weather ... far more cloud - watching is required , me thinks , rather than myopically watching the radar feed !
NOWCAST UPDATE , Saturday 09:28hrs : Further heavy showers imminent .
NOWCAST UPDATE , Saturday 08:50hrs :
And as expected ... the first sign of showers duly arrives over the pitlane .
NOWCAST UPDATE , Saturday 08:45hrs : Towering cumulus around the circuit now ; showers look imminent and it's all about exactly where they start to deliver rain .
In this rapidly - developing situation , a few hundred metres makes the difference between a wash - out or staying dry !
NOWCAST UPDATE , Saturday 08:10hrs :
No significant change to the original forecast - showers expected to edge ever closer towards the qualifying hour and so it'll prove a nail - biter for the teams ( and us ! ) .
Worth adding a clarification from my colleague Sarah Holt , in Sepang : " We understand the rules of rain to be as follows .
If it comes down at 1600 local time ( 0800 BST ) to delay qualifying , then there is a three - hour window to get the job done .
If it 's not safe to get out on track in that time then qualifying will be held on Sunday morning .
If the first qualifying session opens but no times are set then the teams will also come back on Sunday .
If times are set from Q1 onwards , but the weather prevents the third session taking place , then those times will dictate how the grid will be formed for the race . "
NOWCAST UPDATE , Saturday 07:00hrs :
So , some close calls as showers passed by the circuit during P3 but will Sepang evade them in qualifying ?
NOWCAST UPDATE , Saturday 06:30hrs : McLaren suggesting showers imminent .
A tricky aspect for all the teams at this stage of the afternoon is how rainfall radar can be misinterpreted .
The growing convective cells can often seem suggestive of rain on the radar , whereas in reality no precipitation is actually reaching the ground ... yet .
But we 're now at a tipping point , weatherwise , where the showers will increasingly become a reality .
NOWCAST UPDATE , Saturday 06:10hrs :
The first showers are starting to appear on rainfall radar near the circuit .
A growing prospect now of some interruption from wet weather ... depending on the precise trajectory of the slow - moving shower cells .
NOWCAST UPDATE , Saturday 05:55hrs :
A very hot day has been developing at Sepang and we 've got the risk of heavy showers developing through the afternoon now .
The Cumulus clouds are already starting to readily tower - up near the circuit but for now it 's dry and should stay that way for at least part ( if not all ) of P3 .
Air temp .
31C ; track temp .
46C .
------------------------------------------------------------
NOWCAST UPDATE , Friday 09:30hrs : P2 escaped the showers , but they were visibly building east of the circuit by the end of the session as the outflow winds from these cells began blowing the palm fronds about .
Rain has duly arrived across Sepang just after 4 pm local time ... and clearly , a repeat performance of this during tomorrow 's qualifying could really throw a major variable into the eventual pecking order .
We shall see !
Rainfall radar at 3.40 pm local time on Friday ( TOP ) shows heavy showers starting to form just east of Sepang Circuit ( red dot ) and moving west .
Just after 4 pm , rain started falling across the track .
By 4.40 pm ( BOTTOM ) , the shower and thunderstorm cells were become organised as a line , orientated and forced by sea breeze low - level convergence and threatening further torrential downpours into Sepang .
Could Saturday see a repeat as qualifying gets underway ?

NOWCAST UPDATE , Friday 06:35hrs : Showers are forming east of the circuit inland , some looking quite lively on rainfall radar .
Sepang at risk of some into P2 ; they 've already seen one over the circuit as my colleague Sarah Holt can attest !
Track temperature has reached over 50 C ... tyre degradation could prove very interesting to monitor .
-------------------------------------------------------
So , what a difference a bit of rain makes .
As Andrew Benson blogs here , the Australian Grand Prix served as a timely reminder that Formula One can still deliver a highly entertaining and unpredictable spectacle , not least after the processional race witnessed in Bahrain .
Throw a sprinkling of wet weather into the mix and anything can happen in Formula One , " ... and usually does , " as Murray Walker would say .
Off next to steamy Malaysia , where the risk of further spells of wet weather , this time in the shape of heavy showers and thunderstorms , is almost omnipresent .
Climate & Local Weather
And guess what ?
April is the wettest month of the year ... albeit not at Sepang itself !
On average , the capital Kuala Lumpur - just north of Sepang - sees 279 mm ( 11 inches ) of rain falling during April , with temperatures typically close to 30C and humidity usually around 70 - 80 % .
The regional rainfall pattern throughout the year in this equatorial climate is very variable across Malaysia , with distinct drier ( inter - monsoon ) periods coupled to much wetter months .
In the southwestern coastal districts of Peninsular Malaysia - including Sepang - the daily weather at this time of the year tends to follow a broadly similar pattern , but local affects of topography , prevailing sea breezes , urban ' heat islands ' and other factors can greatly influence rainfall distribution .
At the Sepang Circuit , March typically yields 154 mm of rain , but April only 98 mm .
Both months see an average of 15 - 16 rainy days ( data supplied by Malaysian Meteorological Department ) .
The wettest months there are typically October , November and December .
Mornings at this time of year are typically dry , partly sunny affairs .
The temperature - which remains noticeably high and oppressive even overnight - then peaks into the mid to late afternoon , aided in part by insolation .
This thermodynamic forcing , combined with generally light winds and a sea breeze convergence zone offering additional lifting mechanism ; high humidity and deep instability aloft in the atmosphere , is a recipe for rapid thunderstorm development and these can prove slow - moving once formed .
Typically , the storm cells initially form into the late afternoon and evening - east of the circuit , in the convergence zone - and then migrate westwards , steered by the prevailing gradient winds aloft .
A variation of this , where an organised , vigorous line of storms develops through convergence over the Straits of Malacca and then moves east to affect southern Peninsular Malaysia , is known locally as a Sumatra Squall .
We saw the dramatic results of diurnal / sea breeze convergence thunderstorms during the 2009 race , which was ultimately red-flagged as lightning struck repeatedly around the circuit and a downpour of biblical proportions started drenching the track and pitlane by lap 31 .
Red flags bring the drenched Malaysian Grand Prix to a premature finish in April 2009 .
Organisers will hope that with a 4 pm local start ( 9 am BST ) this year , thunderstorms remain at bay for a while longer ...
Weather at previous races
The history of this event is , for the most part , actually one of dry races - despite running in three different months .
The inaugural F1 race at Sepang was in October 1999 .
It was dry .
Ditto 2000 .
In 2001 , it was moved forward to March - with a heavy shower affecting the race - and it remained a March event through to 2006 , with dry running largely prevailing during this time ( 2004 was an exception , in part ) .
In the 2007 calendar , the Malaysian GP shifted to April , with showers a constant looming threat during practice and qualifying sessions , albeit they did n't materialise during the race .
The following year - with the race moved back into March - it remained dry .
The return to April in the 2009 season brought the torrential rain and utter chaos noted earlier .
At the time , with the race finishing so prematurely on lap 33 , there was considerable criticism of the 5 pm local start time ( to suit European TV audiences ) when storms were likely to be very prevalent .
But Bernie Ecclestone 's response was typically bullish :
" No , I just have regrets about the rain , " he said .
" I do n't see anything wrong with the start time , we just did n't know about the rain . "
Well , forewarned is forearmed .
And this time , the race starts an hour earlier - but will that prevent the risk of a repeat performance ?
Do n't count on it ...
Sepang weather prospects for 2010 ...
The precise forecast detail for each period of track action in Sepang will prove impossible to pinpoint until very near to the time , because of the localised nature of shower and thunderstorm development .
For that very reason , it would be a forecasting folly to even attempt this a few days ahead - and I wo n't try to !
The rapid storm development means teams need to be sky - watching and ready to change strategy extremely quickly - as Steve Nielsen , Renault 's sporting director , stresses :
" There 's a good chance of heavy rain showers , which may only last for a few seconds , but completely soak the circuit . "
Indeed so .
However , by definition , there 's a higher statistical chance of dry running during any one session rather than wet , so in the comments below I 've emphasised the broad % risk of showers .
I do stress it 'll be very much a nowcasting situation - something the teams will be very acutely aware of in their preparations and assimilation of weather predictions .
Vice - President of Mercedes - Benz Motorsport , Norbert Haug , sums up the Sepang scenario thus :
" As usual for this race , we have to expect extremely hot and humid conditions , usually accompanied by torrential rain showers every now and then - a race in sauna conditions , virtually .
This climate is the greatest challenge for the teams , cars and drivers . "
Surface observations around Sepang reported at 0900hrs GMT ( 5 pm local ) on Wed. 31 March illustrate the weather lottery posed for qualifying and the race .
Had this been Sunday , the race would have been running an hour by this stage .
Moderately heavy thunderstorms and 27C are being reported at nearby Kuala Lumpur , whilst it remains dry and hazy further south in Malacca .
An hour earlier , showers were already falling around Kuala Lumpur , which had reached a sizzling 33C .
Note that the Lifted Index values ( combined with CAPE ) from coarser - scale forecast modelling across Peninsular Malaysia offer a latent risk of thunderstorms across almost every session but as you 'd expect , this is most pronounced into the late afternoon when some storms could turn very lively indeed .
Radars at the ready , then ...
Here 's the early forecast essentials :
FRIDAY : Should be effectively dry running .
Practice 1 gets underway at 10 am local time .
Hot & sultry , as temperatures reach 30C with light winds , predominantly easterly .
Latest modelling suggests dry , partly sunny weather should prevail , with a low chance of scattered showers even at this stage ( 20 % ) .
By Practice 2 ( 2 pm local time ) , there 's again a good chance of dry running for the teams , but a somewhat higher prospect of showers or thunderstorms looming ( 40 % ) as temperatures peak around 33C .
Winds remain light .
Latest meteograms for nearby Kuala Lumpur continue to suggest Friday could ultimately prove the wettest 24 - hr period of the weekend , but it 's very likely the heaviest downpours will gather only after the track action finishes and then develop into the evening .
SATURDAY : A growing risk of thundery downpours developing by and during qualifying .
Overnight spells of heavy rain from thunderstorms are likely , leaving the circuit ' green ' once again .
By the time of Practice 3 ( 1 pm local time ) , largely cloudy weather will prevail with a 50 % chance of showers ; surface pressure about 1010 mB and temperatures around 32C .
By Qualifying ( 4 pm local time ) , the risk of local showers is rising ( and has been enhanced in latest modelling ) to around 60 % and effectively increases throughout the hour ( something the teams will be monitoring closely towards Q3 ! ) ; winds remain light easterly and typically < 5 kts ( unless actually in the vicinity of any storm cells , where they 'll be noticeably gusty and variable ) and humidity up above 90 % .
Very uncomfortable sitting snugly in a cockpit wearing racing overalls , for sure .
The modelled rainfall accumulation signal for Saturday is ' noisy ' - as expected for this location - but somewhat less enhanced , compared to Friday .
SUNDAY : Risk of thundery downpours during the race , most especially after mid-distance .
The previous evening 's showers have likely ' washed ' the circuit once again .
A minority of models keep any ( decaying ) nocturnal shower activity alive cross coastal parts of western Peninsular Malaysia even until about 0800 hrs local time .
The morning then looks dry , continuing in similar fashion into the early to mid afternoon .
The race gets underway at 4 pm local time and critically , some models ( plus recent persistence forecasting ) offer a risk of isolated downpours even by the start .
Thereafter , the risk of shower or thunderstorm development continues to gather pace over the next 2 hours and as on each day of this event , the ' devil will be in the local detail ' .
Again , the broader cumulative rainfall signal is less pronounced than Friday but similar to Saturday .
The risk of wet weather is around 45 % at the start of the race , rising to 65 % by the end ; winds remain light east to east - southeasterly ; humidity about 90 % and temperatures around 30C .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
One of the basic components of a functional , cooperative society is a code of law , where the laws are usually enforced by some kind of incentive .
Social incentives can either be positive ( rewards ) or negative ( punishments ) , and a society must decide which combination to use to achieve the greatest efficiency , or the highest level of cooperation at the lowest cost .
Using a game theoretic model , a new study has analyzed this social dilemma in order to investigate how individuals are swayed by incentives , and how cooperation can emerge due to various incentive strategies .
Christian Hilbe and Karl Sigmund , mathematicians from the University of Vienna , have published the study , called “ Incentives and opportunism : from the carrot to the stick , ” in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Overall , their results show how a population can evolve to become dominated by individuals who cooperate by default ( that is , they cooperate unless they know they can get away with uncooperative behavior ) when faced with negative incentives .
As the researchers explain in their study , the efficiency in terms of a benefit - to - cost ratio of the two types of incentives depends on the circumstances .
In a society where most people cooperate , then it will be costly to reward them all , while a society in which most people defect would pay a high price for trying to punish them all .
So the obvious way to transform an uncooperative population into a cooperative one would be to first provide positive incentives , and later punish the few remaining individuals who refuse to be swayed .
“ In the last 10 years , there has been an intensive discussion about whether and how ( human ) cooperation can be promoted by offering incentives , ” Hilbe told PhysOrg.com .
“ Especially the effect of punishment is heavily disputed ; some researchers argue that the extensive use of punishment could lead to a downfall of overall welfare ( for example , as punishment might provoke counter - punishment ) .
Our study is one of the first examining the interplay of both types of incentives .
We found that opportunism makes both types of incentives profitable , but they have different effects .
In our model , rewards are very effective in increasing cooperation but , ironically , increased cooperation makes rewards expensive .
At some point punishment might be more efficient . ”
The researchers capture this dynamic in a game that is generally similar to the Prisoner ’s Dilemma game or the ultimatum game , except that here only the first player chooses to cooperate or defect , while the second player chooses how to respond with incentives , and each player receives respective pay - offs .
More specifically , the first player can choose one of four strategies : always cooperate ( cooperation comes with a small cost ) , always defect , cooperate unless they know they can defect without being punished , and defect unless they know that their co-player rewards cooperation or punishes defection .
The last two strategies are opportunistic , meaning that players use them to take advantage of a possible incentive , regardless of whether they must cooperate or defect to attain the incentive .
The second player then responds with one of four strategies : offer no incentive , only use punishment , only use rewards , or use both incentives .
In any interaction between two random players , there is only a limited probability that player one knows player two ’s strategy .
In the way that the pay - off values are arranged , the first player can gain the most by receiving a reward for their cooperation .
Although the second player gets a slight benefit from rewarding cooperation , they gain even more if the first player cooperates for no reward ( which can occur because the first player does not always know if they will be receiving a reward for cooperation ) .
Hilbe and Sigmund found that , since the frequency of how often a certain strategy is used changes , a wide variety of evolutionary dynamics can occur .
Some pairs of strategies tend to be dominated by other strategies , meaning that some strategies tend to evolve into certain others .
However , other pairs of strategies are stationary and only change due to small random shocks .
Further , there is one pair of strategies that tends to be the ultimate evolutionary outcome , and that is when player one uses opportunistic cooperation ( i.e. they cooperate unless they know they can defect without being punished ) and player two uses only punishment .
The mathematicians call this pair of strategies a Nash equilibrium , since neither player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other player keeps theirs unchanged .
While many populations evolve toward this Nash equilibrium , the researchers identified one essential step in this evolution , which is when player one transitions from opportunistic defection to opportunistic cooperation .
Moreover , the researchers found that the time until this transition occurs is greatly reduced if player two has a strategy involving rewarding , which entices player one to become more cooperative .
In other words , the model accurately represents the two - step incentive strategy stated earlier , where step one is rewarding and step two - the more lasting step - is punishment .
In this way , using the model may offer the potential to help determine the effectiveness of incentives in social programs by providing a glimpse into the future .
“ At the moment , the discussion about the evolution of ( human ) cooperation is on a rather theoretical level , ” Hilbe explained .
“ The main aim is to understand under which circumstances individuals tend to cooperate with each other and to which extent they behave selfishly .
But the knowledge about the nature of human altruism might eventually lead to optimally adapted incentive schemes ( for example , for increasing worker motivation ) .
“ However , we do n’t expect our study to be the final say on this topic .
It is a delicate matter to capture the complexity of human interactions in game theoretic models and usually those models are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions .
It will take much further research to get a conclusive understanding of the effects of incentives . ”

Congress is moving towards bipartisan agreement on changes to financial regulation , claiming to address the root causes of the market crash of 2008 .
The centerpiece of this legislation includes creating a group of officials to regulate " systemic risk . "
Unfortunately , instead of advancing transparency and empowering investors , it will do very little to address systemic risk , while adversely affecting many of America 's most successful non-financial businesses .
In fact , combined with other provisions of the bill , government officials will be in a position to substitute their judgment for that of investors .

A delicate " top kill " operation by BP appears to have halted the gush of oil and gas from its ruptured Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico , although experts warned that the underwater leak was still far from being permanently fixed .
Engineers were due last night to begin a second round of pumping thick drilling mud at high speed into the ocean floor , which lies 5,000 feet ( 1,500 metres ) under the surface of the sea about 50 miles off Louisiana .
Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , insisted that the operation was going to plan , but admitted : " What we do know is that we have not yet stopped the flow . "
He said BP engineers would soon use additional materials to try to plug the well , suggesting heavy mud deployed so far would not work on its own .
" It 's quite a roller coaster , " he told a reporters ' conference call , adding that the disaster had cost BP $ 850 m so far .
The modest signs of progress came amid dismal news on the sheer extent of the environmental damage caused by the accident , which began when BP's Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April , killing 11 workers .
New government estimates of a leak of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of oil a day indicated that after 37 days , the slick could be twice as large as the fallout from the tanker Exxon Valdez , which hit a reef off Alaska in 1989 .
" This will be felt for generations to come , " said Regan Nelson , senior oceans advocate at the Natural Resources Defence Council in Washington .
" It 's an unprecedented disaster . "
Environmental scientists who have toured the marshes off Louisiana by boat described a vast expanse of crude half an inch thick , with no visible sign of the BP or government clean - up efforts .
" We could n't see into the water at all , one engine quit working , " said Larry Schweiger of the National Wildlife Federation .
" We are talking about really heavy oil spill out there , and no one is out there cleaning it .
No one is out there measuring the scope of the oil mass . "
Doug Inkley , a wildlife biologist with the National Wildlife Federation , described seeing dead jellyfish and sharks affected by the slick .
" It 's impossible to me to know how any living organism could survive in that , " he said .
At least seven oil clean - up workers were taken to hospital yesterday after reporting nausea and headaches as a result of contact with chemical dispersants used to break up the slick .
Administration officials said the cause of the illness was unclear .
Offshore , marine scientists from a University of South Florida research ship reported the discovery of a new underwater plume of oil extending 22 miles from the ruptured well towards Mobile Bay , Alabama , raising new fears about deep water toxicity .
After failing earlier in the month to halt the leak with a top hat - shaped dome , BP began pumping bargeloads of sludge into the well on Wednesday afternoon .
Seven hours later , the company was able to drop the pressure at which it was pumping , a development considered positive by experts who said it meant the well contained a column of mud , rather than a plume of oil .
" That means they had enough pressure to displace the oil from the well into the rock formation , " said David Summers , a professor of mining engineering at Missouri University of Science & Technology .
However , he said the job was not complete yet : " They have n't been able to totally balance the pressure .
The column of mud in there should be stable enough to stand there by itself .
But they 're still having to apply a little bit of pressure to keep the column stable .
That means they may not have got the mud all the way down the well yet . "
There is still a risk that the pipe leading into the well could rupture .
If the effort fails , BP has mooted trying a " junk shot " to block the leak by firing golf balls , tyres and other debris into the ocean floor .
Meanwhile , the company is drilling two " relief wells " to suck up oil in a controlled way , although these are unlikely to be ready until August .
Scientists warned there was potential for even greater damage , with a forecast of an unusually hazardous hurricane season .
The national weather service in its yearly forecast for the hurricane season starting on 1 June predicted between eight to 14 hurricanes across the Atlantic .
Of those , three to seven could be major hurricanes , category three storms or higher .
Hurricane Katrina was a category three .
" If this outlook holds true , this season could be one of the more active on record , " said Jane Lubchenco , the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the government agency that oversees the forecast .
The pace of congressional investigations into the oil disaster also intensified with BP ordered to produce documents by June 3 into what was described as " questionable " decisions on well casing in the hours before the explosion .
In a letter to BP , Henry Waxman , the head of the energy and commerce committee , said he was concerned by omissions in BP 's 48 - page briefing to Congress on the events leading up to the explosion .
" This raises the possibility that BP 's internal investigation is not examining the consequences of BP 's own decisions and conduct , " he said .
Severe weather could accelerate the movement of the slick , which is threatening to stretch beyond Louisiana 's coastline to the beaches of Florida and could spread as far as Cuba .
Jupiter loses one of its stripes and scientists are stumped as to why

Jupiter has lost one of its iconic red stripes and scientists are baffled as to why .
The largest planet in our solar system is usually dominated by two dark bands in its atmosphere , with one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere .
However , the most recent images taken by amateur astronomers have revealed the lower stripe known as the Southern Equatorial Belt has disappeared leaving the southern half of the planet looking unusually bare .
The band was present in at the end of last year before Jupiter ducked behind the Sun on its orbit .
However , when it emerged three months later the belt had disappeared .
Jupiter was pictured this month ( left ) looking unusually bare , compared to July 2009 ( right ) .
It has lost its dark red Southern Equatorial Belt although scientists are unclear as to why .
The pictures have different tones because they were snapped a year apart .
Journalist and amateur astronomer Bob King , also known as Astro_Bob , was one of the first to note the strange phenomenon .
He said : ' Jupiter with only one belt is almost like seeing Saturn when its rings are edge - on and invisible for a time - it just does n't look right . '
It is not the first time this unusual phenomenon has been noticed .
Jupiter loses or regains one of its belts every ten of 15 years , although exactly why this happens is a mystery .
Jupiter has a complex belt system
The planet is a giant ball of gas and liquid around 500 million miles from the Sun .
It 's surface is composed of dense red , brown , yellow , and white clouds arranged in light - coloured areas called zones and darker regions called belts .
These clouds are created by chemicals that have formed at different heights .
The highest white clouds in the zones are made of crystals of frozen ammonia .
Darker , lower clouds are created from chemicals including sulphur and phosphorus .
The clouds are blown into bands by 350 mph winds caused by Jupiter 's rapid rotation .
Noted Jupiter watcher Anthony Wesley , who spotted an impact spot on its surface last year , has tracked the disappearing belt from his back garden in Australia .
' It was obvious last year that it was fading .
It was closely observed by anyone watching Jupiter , ' he told The Planetary Society .
' There was a big rush on to find out what had changed once it came back into view . '
Mr Wesley said while it was a mystery as to what had caused the belt to fade , the most likely explanation was that it was linked to storm activity that preceded the change .
' The question now is when will the South Equatorial belt erupt back into activity and reappear ? '
Mr Wesley said .
The pattern for this happening is when a brilliant white spot forms in the southern zone .
Gradually it will start to spout dark blobs of material which will be stretched by Jupiter 's fierce winds into a new belt , and the planet will return to its familiar ' tyre track ' appearance .
Jupiter will be closest to Earth on September 24 , offering stargazers their best chance of seeing it without its stripe .

Shortly after the Wachowski Brothers released a film called The Matrix in 1999 , I got a job on a film shooting in Hendersonville , North Carolina about summer camp and spent a beautiful month and a half in a small cottage reading Ray Kurzweil ’s The Age of Spiritual Machines : When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence .
It was a potent combination – the movie and the book ; what the Matrix was doing for me spiritually , Kurzweil ’s book seemed to be prepared to manifest on Earth .
Cut to a decade later , where I will be attending my fifth consecutive NAB
Show – the largest tech and entertainment media show of its kind in the world – and have the opportunity to see Kurzweil actually speak in person for a power session entitled “ The Acceleration of Technology in the 21st Century : the Impact on Media , Communications , and Society . ”
Kurzweil will begin the session with a presentation on how information technology is transforming traditional industries , including media and entertainment , into infotech businesses .
He will explore how the exponential growth of technology and the influx of new chip - driven tools is upending free enterprise as we know it and paving the way for an unparalleled change in human history .
After his presentation , Kurzweil will be joined on the stage by Professor Donald Marinelli for a special discussion highlighting topics that directly impact Hollywood and the entertainment technology arena .
This is precisely what I have been asked to speak about throughout most of my career – the confluence of technology and the arts – so you can imagine how excited I am to hear these two go on about it .
To give you a better idea about Kurzweil ’s relevance ( besides the fact that he invented speech recognition technology ) he has been described as “ the restless genius ” by The Wall Street Journal and “ the ultimate thinking machine ” by Forbes and ranked 8th among entrepreneurs in the United States by Inc. magazine .
PBS included Kurzweil as one of 16 “ revolutionaries who made America , ” along with other inventors of the past two centuries .
He is a six - time national bestselling author whose works include “ The Age of Spiritual Machines ” and “ The Singularity is Near . ”
Which reminds me , Kurzweil also recently spearheaded the opening of The Singularity University where he invites the world ’s foremost thinkers , doctors and technicians to figure out how to live forever , in harmony , probably with robots .
And he is totally serious .
And he might even pull it off .
Donald Marinelli is a tenured professor of drama and arts management at Carnegie Mellon University and is also the executive producer of that institution ’s Entertainment Technology Center ( ETC ) .
The ETC is recognized internationally as Carnegie Mellon ’s “ Dream Fulfillment Factory . ”
Its emphasis is on bringing artists and technologists together to work on substantive , real - world projects combining the latest digital media technologies with myriad artistic , educational , and entertainment efforts .
Marinelli ’s book “ The Comet & the Tornado ” will be released on April 6th .
This event joins an impressive line - up of previously announced keynote conversations , including Dana Walden and Gary Newman , Chairmen of Twentieth Century Fox Television ( TCFTV ) ; and Stan Lee , the iconic comic book visionary who co-created Spider - Man , The Incredible Hulk and The Fantastic Four .
“ A key theme of this year ’s NAB Show is transmedia : developing , integrating and monetizing content for multiplatform distribution , ” said Chris Brown , executive vice president , conventions & business operations for NAB Show .
“ Stan Lee has epitomized the concept of transmedia with his amazing creations , which have been turned into smash hit feature films , television series and innovative digital content . ”
Did I already mention how excited I am ?
This is like Christmas for prognosticators like me , never mind robotics fans .
And manifesting dreams .
And wanting to live forever .
And SEO types .
And comic books .
The NAB Show will take place 10 - 15 April , 2010 in Las Vegas ( exhibits open 12 April ) .
It is the world ’s largest electronic media show covering filmed entertainment and the development , management and delivery of content across all mediums .

After game two , commenter Passive Voice wondered about the individual match - ups and how the scoring chances totals were playing out .
The results showed that it was n't Dave Bolland 's line that was doing the job against Joe Thornton 's line ( or any line for that matter ) , it was Patrick Sharp , Marian Hossa and Troy Brouwer that were getting the chances against Thornton 's line .
I liked the concept very much and I hope that if the scoring chance project moves forward that this methodology is incorporated somehow .
After the jump I look at the head - to - head chances totals in the first two games , the last two games and the whole series .
For an outstanding look at head - to - head Corsi and an analysis from the Chicago perspective , check out VerStig 's post at Second City Hockey .
Note : Each matrix is compiled from San Jose 's perspective .
Games 1 & 2 were in the original post and I said then :
The biggest advantage in the series is by Pavelski on Bolland , but that 's also the smallest sample of time amongst any match up .
Next up is Sharp 's advantage on Thornton and then Thornton 's advantage on Bolland .
Looking at the data this way , it shows that Dave Bolland is ... getting drilled .
It also shows that Pavelski is faring rather well against Toews and Sharp , in addition to drilling Bolland .
Chicago 's only real advantage has been Sharp against Thornton .
So how did things change when Chicago went home ?
Todd McClellan decided to change his lines around and iced Joe Thornton with Copper & Blue - favorite Logan Couture and Devin Setoguchi , and used Thornton on the ice as often as possible with the other lines .
Joel Quenneville kept matching Bolland to Thornton 's new line .
McClellan paired Thornton 's prior linemates , Patrick Marleau and Dany Heatley , with Manny Malhotra .
Bolland countered with Patrick Sharp , Marian Hossa and Troy Brouwer .
McClellan 's leftovers , Joe Pavelski , Ryan Clowe and Torrey Mitchell ended up seeing Jonathan Toews , Patrick Kane and Dustin Byfuglien regularly .
The results are below , and I 've switched the lines around to reflect the ice time in these two games :
There is much more red here as compared to the first two games .
Bolland won his battles against all of the Sharks except Thornton and Couture , which again shows that the narrative was n't quite accurate , it was completely wrong .
Whereas Thornton was on the short end against the Sharp line in the first two games , the newly - formed Sharks first line was much better against them .
The new first line was just fine , but the rest of the team ...
The goats here are the rest of the Sharks top nine forwards .
Malhotra was beaten by everyone - his line looks like Bolland in the first two .
Chicago 's first and third lines really dominated San Jose 's second and third lines in these two .
By the raw scoring chances , Thornton and Couture look like San Jose 's best forwards in these two games .
The totals for the four games combined are below , with the Sharks grouped by ice time :
Thornton was - 2 for the series total , and only came out ahead against the Bolland line .
" Wait a second , " you might say , " Thornton was a negative for the series , but beat Bolland ?
Pierre told me that David Bolland was winning the battle against Joseph Thornton and that he had Thornton off of his game . "
Well sure .
Note the ' L ' on the matrix .
Toews winning his battles and Couture winning his .
Note how far Malhotra 's performance dropped off when McClellan swirled the lines .
Below is the head - to - head ice time totals with each Shark ' most common opponents shaded in gray . :
I wonder how much McClellan will regret blending the lines in the way that he did .
I also wonder what the Sharks top two lines would have done had McClellan simply switched Heatley and Couture .
Divide the chances by the even strength time on ice and multiply by 15 and we get the the chances / 15 head - to - head ratios :
Thornton beat Bolland to the tune of 1.9 chances per 15 minutes of ice time .
Unfortunately , we do n't have scoring chances data for San Jose from the regular season , but we have Edmonton chances , and Bolland 's - 1.9 chances / 15 against Thornton is the same rate that Jason Strudwick posted against the league this season .
To look at this a bit differently , we can compare Thornton 's performance against Bolland to his regular season scoring rates with a bit of extrapolation .
We know a few things about scoring chances from the work that 's been done on the Oilers by Dennis King over the last two years .
One of the things that Dennis ' numbers have shown is that the scoring chance to goal ratio falls somewhere between the very high fives and the very low eights , averaging somewhere around 7/1 ( more data needed ) .
During the regular season , Thornton played 1214 minutes at even strength .
He ended the season at +18 in even strength scoring .
Using the +1.9/15 ratio , we can determine that over 1214 minutes , Thornton would have been +153 in chances against Bolland .
If we assume that Thornton would have created a goal at a 7/1 ratio , Thornton would have been +21 against Bolland for the year , three goals better than his regular season , and this from the perennial " playoff choker " !
So , let 's use this to put an end to the silly notion that Bolland was doing something special against Thornton besides running cover for the other lines .
Let 's move on to the interesting parts of this series , like Jonathan Toews ' outstanding performance against the Sharks ' first and third lines , but Pavelski was able to play him to a draw .
Was Bolland the best matchup for Thornton , or was it Sharp ?
Or Toews ?
Like Marian Hossa winning the battles against everyone ( except Logan Couture ) but the puck not going in for him .
Speaking of , what about Logan Couture 's performance - is this rolling hot dice or is this a breakout ?
Is it strange that the chances point towards Pavelski and Couture being the best two Sharks forwards for the entire series ?
When I reviewed the chances totals I noted that it was a shame that this one was a sweep , because the play was much closer than that .
It 's also a shame that the media , and bloggers for that matter , jumped on the Bolland narrative so early .

Amnesty International complained in its annual report released Thursday that the U.S. and members of the European Union had obstructed international justice by using their positions on the UN Security Council to shield Israel from accountability for war crimes allegedly committed during last year 's Gaza war .

The rights group also accused Israel of continually violating human rights in the Gaza Strip .
It cited Israel 's ongoing economic blockade as violating international law , leaving Gaza residents without adequate food or water supplies
In its report , Amnesty lauded a United Nations commissioned report released last year by South African justice Richard Goldstone for highlighting Israeli violations during the war in Gaza .
Goldstone 's findings found both Israel and Hamas guilty of war crimes during the conflict .
" Israeli forces committed war crimes and other serious breaches of international law in the Gaza Strip during a 22 - day military offensive codenamed Operation ' Cast Lead ' that ended on 18 January ( 2009 ) , " the rights group said .
" Among other things , they carried out indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against civilians , targeted and killed medical staff , used Palestinian civilians as ' human shields ' , and indiscriminately fired white phosphorus over densely populated residential areas , " it added .
" More than 1,380 Palestinians , including over 330 children and hundreds of other civilians , were killed . "
" In a display of counter political bias , the UN Human Rights Council , initially resolved to investigate only alleged Israeli violations , " said the report .
" To his credit , Judge Richard Goldstone , subsequently appointed to lead that investigation , insisted that the UN Fact - Finding Mission should examine alleged violations by both Israel and Hamas . "
The group 's report listed examples of what it said were war crimes committed by Israeli forces , but did not provide details of sources .
Amnesty 's annual roundup of global human rights abuses urged members of the G - 20 — a collection of major industrial countries and fast - growing developing countries — to set an example to the international community by signing up to the International Criminal Court .
The United States and others have refused to ratify the court 's founding treaty partly because they fear the court could become a forum for politically motivated prosecutions of troops in unpopular wars like Iraq .
The U.S. State Department said in response to Amnesty 's accusations that it " supports the need for accountability for any violations that may have occurred in relation to the Gaza conflict by any party . "
" As we have said , the responsibility to address alleged abuses during the Gaza conflict lies with the Israelis and the Palestinians , " the State Department said in a statement .
Israel earlier this year submitted a 46 - page response to Goldstone 's inquiry , which accused both Israel and Hamas of " grave breaches " of the fourth Geneva Convention .
In its report , Israel claimed its forces abided by international law throughout the war last year .

Today on ABC’s This Week BP Chairman and President Lamar McKay put to rest all of the right wing conspiracy theories that the Gulf Oil spill was an act of terrorism carried out by left wing environmentalists , or a foreign government .
Instead McKay said the probable cause less sinister and more mundane , “ I believe we ’ve got a failed piece of equipment . ”
Here is the video from This Week :
Advertisements
When Jake Tapper asked about BP ’s less than stellar safety record , McKay replied , “ Well , the investigations are going to show the cause of this accident , and we want those investigations to be done .
My belief that is that that does not have anything to do with it .
I believe we ’ve got a failed piece of equipment .
We do n’t know why it failed yet in this contracted rig , and BOP system will figure that out .
But let me just tell you , our focus , our focus right now is dealing with the source of the oil , dealing with it on the surface , and dealing with it on the beach or the marsh if it occurs . ”
This seems much more probable than the conspiracy theory blaming left wing environmentalists advanced by Rush Limbaugh last week :
Limbaugh laid out his conspiracy theory , “ Now lest we forget , ladies and gentlemen , the carbon tax bill , cap and trade , that was scheduled to be announced on Earth Day , I remember that , then it was postponed for a couple of days later , after Earth Day … This bill the cap and trade bill was criticized by hard core environmentalist wackos because it supposedly allowed more offshore drilling and nuclear plants , nuclear plant investment , so since they ’re sending swat teams down there folks , since they ’re sending swat teams to inspect the other rigs , what better way to head off more oil drilling , nuclear plants than by blowing up a rig ?
I ’m just noting the timing here . ”
What a surprise , Rush Limbaugh and the right wing conspiracy theorists have been proven wrong again .
They are at least in consistent in that they never let facts get in the way of their desperate attempts to bring down Obama .
The Gulf oil spill is no more Obama ’s Katrina than the Exxon Valdez was George H.W. Bush ’s .
It was an accident , and it looking more like an environmental catastrophe , but comparing this to Katrina is an apples and oranges argument .
Limbaugh ’s desperate attempt to blame the Obama and Left for the oil rig explosion defied all common sense and overlooked the most likely explanation that the explosion was caused by some sort of on board accident .
Since it would be impossible to blame Obama for an accident , the right had to fabricate all sorts of tall tales to feed their paranoid delusions .
The Right has to blame Obama or else they might have to admit that offshore drilling is not as safe as they make it sound , and since they ca n’t have they , expect the crazy conspiracy theories and the blame of Obama to continue .

Some members of Congress made risky bets with their own money that U.S. stocks or bonds would fall during the financial crisis , a Wall Street Journal analysis of congressional disclosures shows .
Senators have criticized Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for profiting from the housing collapse .
And Congress is considering legislation to curb Wall Street risk - taking , including the use of financial instruments known as derivatives and of leverage , or methods that amplify returns .
According to The Journal 's analysis of congressional disclosures , investment accounts of 13 members of Congress or their spouses show bearish bets made in 2008 via exchange - traded funds — portfolios that trade like stocks and mirror an index .
These funds were leveraged ; they used derivatives and other techniques to magnify the daily moves of the index they track .
There 's no evidence the legislators and their spouses used privileged information or failed to follow rules on disclosure .
Congressional rules permit lawmakers and their families to invest in — or bet against — publicly held companies they oversee through committee assignments , as well as broader markets or indices .
While some made money , others lost .
Some of these legislators have publicly criticized practices such as short - selling , or betting on a security to decline .
In February , Sen. Johnny Isakson ( R. , Ga. ) argued on the Senate floor that " we do n't need those speculating in the marketplace to take unfair advantage of the values of equities that are owned by Americans all over this country for the sake of making a buck on a short sale . "
Let 's meet coal apologist Fred Palmer .
Mr. Palmer is currently the Vice - President for Government Relations of Peabody Coal .
But go back a decade or so and Mr. Palmer was the head of the so - called Western Fuels Association , a front group for the coal industry .
In that capacity , he said something in an interview that could best be described as , well , revelatory :
Every time you turn your car on , and you burn fossil fuels and you put CO2 in the air , you 're doing the work of the Lord , absolutely .
Now , it would have been easy to walk this back and claim that it was a joke , or a one - time exaggeration designed to emphasize the importance of the fossil fuel industry to the American economy .
But at a recent debate held at Washington University in St. Louis with Bruce Nilles of the Sierra Club , a student asked him to clarify his remark of 10 years earlier , and was met with a series of obfuscations ( fast forward to the 54.16 mark ) , and , when pushed by Nilles to actually answer the question , refused to say if he still stands by the remark .
Now , the only reason anyone would act that way is if they actually believed and stood by the original comment , but were too embarrassed to admit to such in a public forum .
And given the fact that the aforementioned Western Fuels Association created a front group and even made a documentary making the case that an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere would be of great benefit to humanity .
Now , let 's take a look at the conservative estimate of the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere , as documented by the IPCC :
The impact will be catastrophic , forcing hundreds of millions of people to flee their devastated homelands , particularly in tropical , low - lying areas , while creating waves of immigrants whose movements will strain the economies of even the most affluent countries .
' The really chilling thing about the IPCC report is that it is the work of several thousand climate experts who have widely differing views about how greenhouse gases will have their effect .
Some think they will have a major impact , others a lesser role .
Each paragraph of this report was therefore argued over and scrutinised intensely .
Only points that were considered indisputable survived this process .
This is a very conservative document - that 's what makes it so scary , ' said one senior UK climate expert .
Hmm ... sounds a lot like armageddon !
Now , there are people who are actively dedicated to making the Book of Revelations a reality , but they 're usually restricted to things like fundamentalist cattle ranchers in Texas breeding a perfect red heifer for sacrifice on the Temple Mount .
Palmer 's perspective is far more frightening .
Here we have somebody whose motivations to promote the coal industry are n't simply a matter of greed or economics .
It 's a principle born equally , if not primarily , out of religious zealotry .
And he 's not the only one .
Texas Governor Rick Perry 's first reaction to the calamity now occurring in the Gulf of Mexico was that it was an " act of God . "
And while he later walked back that remark ever so slightly , it 's still enlightening that Rick Perry 's personal god has no issue with unleashing what may well end up being the worst environmental disaster in our history .
Given the causes of the disasters at the Massey coal mine and the unthinkable tragedy currently occurring off our coast -- and the efforts of the fossil fuel industry to defend them - - it 's obvious that the industry is full of people who will sacrifice not just the environment , but hardworking American lives , in the pursuit of short - term profits .
But it 's also worth asking how many people there are who are dedicated to spewing carbon into the air because they feel it's the element of the Lord .
Pictured : X - ray of teenager with 12 - inch kitchen knife lodged in head after he SURVIVES attack
This shocking X - ray shows how a teenager was stabbed , leaving a 12 - inch blade in his head – and survived .
Doctors said the victim – known only as Alex – was ‘ unbelievably lucky ’ not to have been killed or at least blinded after the kitchen knife was lodged in his right temple .
The 19 - year - old was on a night out with a group of friends in Sydney , Australia , when he was attacked .
' Unbelievably lucky ' :
The X - ray shows how the knife was lodged in Alex 's head
They had been to the harbourside Star City casino , but trouble broke out as they were heading home .
' A friend got involved in an argument with two guys behind me , ' Alex said .
' I turned back to see if he was all right .
Before I knew it , a fight broke out .
' One of the guys threw a punch in my face - or at least I thought it was a punch . '
In fact , Alex had been stabbed in the head with the kitchen knife .
Admitting he had never seen such a horrifying knife injury in which the victim had survived , the surgeon said Alex was ' unbelievably lucky ' .
' Alex was stabbed in his right temple alongside the lateral canthus [ the tissue where the upper and lower eyelids meet ] of the right eye , ' he said .
' Travelling parallel to the skull in the temporalis muscle [ tissue on the side of the skull which controls jaw movement ] , the knife missed his eye , his skull , as well as the major arteries , veins and nerves , which are tightly packed in that region . '
The blade then protruded out through the skin towards the back of Alex 's head .
The plastic handle had been removed from the weapon – something police say gangs are doing to make it easier to conceal the blade .
Photographs of his injuries have been described as ' too shocking ' to reveal , but the X - ray image has been released to help track the attackers .
Police in Australia say knife attacks are on the rise - in just one week - end in Melbourne earlier this year , there were 13 incidents involving knives , most of which were alcohol or drug - related and involved young men .
In New South Wales last year , there were 3,736 knife - related crimes , with Sydney recording 254 .
More than 100 viewers have complained to broadcasting regulator Ofcom that Nick Clegg was unfairly questioned during the Sky News leaders ' debate on Thursday night .
They have accused Sky News political editor Adam Boulton , who moderated the debate , of breaking strict impartiality rules by raising newspaper reports about political donations paid directly into the Liberal Democrat leader 's bank account .
There is no suggestion Clegg broke any rules .
Ofcom has a legal duty to ensure all current affairs and political programmes are fair and balanced .
A spokeswoman for the regulator refused to confirm the number of complaints it had received , but said it would investigate .
" We do have rules around impartiality so we will assess any complaints . "
Most of the correspondence appears to have been prompted by an internet campaign orchestrated by Liberal Democrat supporters , who used sites such as Facebook and Twitter to encourage people to contact the regulator .
Boulton 's intervention also appears to break one of the rules drawn up by broadcasters and party representatives , which places restrictions on the role of the moderator .
Rule 63 states that " It is not the moderator 's role to criticise or comment on the leaders ' answers " .
The campaigners believe that Boulton breached rule 63 by " heckling " Clegg .
A spokesman for Sky said Boulton had mentioned the newspaper allegations " as a statement of fact " following a long exchange about MPs ' expenses , and denied he had ignored guidelines .
Contacted by the Guardian , Boulton said : " I spoke to Nick Clegg afterwards and I have had no complaints . "
The complaints to Ofcom will fuel a growing controversy over the role Rupert Murdoch 's media empire is playing in the general election campaign .
Sky News is controlled by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation , which also owns the Times , the Sun and the News of the World .
The tabloid titles have endorsed David Cameron , and the Sun has been particularly vocal in its support .
Last week , the Sun joined other rightwing papers including the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph and launched attacks on Clegg .
A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats refused to comment .
Clegg 's election coordinator Danny Alexander yesterday accused the Conservatives of orchestrating a " negative media smear campaign " in response to the Liberal Democrats ' dramatic surge in popularity following the first debate last week .
The list of 76 rules governing the exchanges allow any party to complain to a unit of " senior broadcasting journalists " set up by broadcasters during the debates .
No complaint was made by the Lib Dems during the show .
Complaints from the parties can also be made to various
Sky representatives , but the broadcasters said the Lib Dems " did not make one of substance " .
The debate , which was hosted by Sky News but was simulcast on BBC News Channel and Sky3 , drew a live audience of 4.1 million viewers .
Last Thursday's first leaders ' debate on ITV1 attracted more than double the live audience – 9.4 million – and about 40 complaints to Ofcom , mostly from Scottish National party supporters who believe their leader should have been included .

One year on from the Black Saturday fires in Victoria , many Australians , and the Bushfires Royal Commission , are still trying to explain the ferocity of the blaze that claimed 173 lives and burned more than 450,000 hectares .
The idea that the Australian bush burns the way it always has is being challenged by David Lindemayer , a professor of forest and wildlife management at the Australian National University .
Lindenmayer has been working in the Victorian forests for almost 30 years , and he says the latest research indicates that logging a forest can make it more prone to fire , and increase the severity of that fire .
An interesting disconnect exists between Goldman ’s public posture on the SEC ’s suit against it over its Abacus 2007 AC1 deal and its private remarks .
The firm has maintained that the charges are baseless and politically motivated , and hinted that if there is any dirt here , it must be the fault of Fabrice Tourre , the staffer named as a defendant along with the firm itself .
Yet according to the Financial Times , Goldman ’s chief Lloyd Blankfein made a series of calls to clients yesterday to defend the firm .
The substance of his remarks sound so over the top as to suggest that the firm ’s leadership feels badly threatened by the pending action .
A truly confident actor would make reassuring noises along the lines of “ Look , this may all look dramatic in the headlines , really there is n’t anything here , but the press and the government will take decisions and actions out of context and try to make them into something they are n’t .
These distortions are unpleasant , but we are confident the truth will come out in the end .
If you see or hear anything that troubles you as we fight this case , do n’t hesitate to call me or XXX . ”
Instead , Blankfein ’s comments sound like those of a narcissist completely unhinged at the idea that he is being criticized .
If this neurosis pervades the Goldman executive ranks ( which we think is entirely possible , see our earlier discussion ) , that provides an indirect confirmation of the widespread perception that the firm is concerned only with what it can get away with , and is lacking in any moral compass .
From the Financial Times :
Lloyd Blankfein on Wednesday attacked the Securities & Exchange Commission ’s fraud charges in telephone calls to clients as Goldman escalated its campaign to stem the damage to the bank ’s reputation .
One person who received a call from the Goldman chief said he was told the regulator ’s case against the bank was politically motivated and would ultimately “ hurt America ” … .
“ He was very aggressive , ” said one person called by Mr Blankfein on Wednesday .
“ He feels that the government is out to kill them , that they are under attack and the whole thing is totally political . ”
Yves here .
The idea that an SEC ’s enforcement action on a lone transaction is tantamount to a campaign to “ kill ” the firm is bizarre , and sounds an awful lot like Dick Fuld at his less than stellar moments .
It suggests either hypersensitivity to bad press , or recognition of the possibility that the discovery in the SEC case will expose widespread predatory conduct ( as we noted in an earlier post , the private suits against derivatives kingpin Bankers
Trust similarly looked weak , but they did huge damage to the bank by exposing cynical , rapacious behavior towards clients ) .
While it is too early to tell , the SEC may have found Goldman ’s underbelly .
Update 4/2/2010 : A major development occurred overnight .
It is now April 2 , 2010 ! ( no foolin ) .
Update 5/10/2010 : See this new analysis and addendum .
This week saw the release of the quarterly ratings performance data for television programming .
Much of the reporting on this story focused on the dominant position Fox News retains in the cable news sector .
As has been the case for several years , Fox News smothered the competition and experienced rapid growth while other news programmers stagnated or declined .
While most industry insiders accept the routine pronouncements from the sole ratings provider , Nielsen Media Research , without question , some observers could not help but notice a certain incongruity in the results .
How is it , they wonder , that Fox News can be so consistently in the lead despite their obvious niche programming focus on a narrow segment of the viewing audience .
The decidedly right - of - center bias of Fox News corresponds to a rather small portion of the national electorate .
Republican favorability has been hovering in the mid-twenties for years .
So how does this negligible slice of the market translate into such a disproportionate ratings advantage ?
The answer may be evident in new disclosures of business relationships that call into question the integrity of Nielsen ’s data .
With the rollout of its People Meter methodology in the early 2000 ’s , Nielsen entered the high - tech era of TV market research .
It was heralded as a major advancement of data collection that would vastly improve the ability of producers , programmers and advertisers to evaluate the marketplace .
But as with any upheaval in the status quo , there were skeptics and dissenters .
Chief amongst them was Fox Broadcasting , who argued that the new system significantly under- counted African - Americans , a key component of their audience at the time .
There was also a question as to the security of the new set - top boxes that would be recording viewer choices .
With the introduction of technology comes the risk of miscalculations and tampering .
But eventually the complaints receded or were resolved and the new service took its place as the signature survey product for television marketing .
It was during this time , subsequent to the implementation of People Meters , that Fox News began its rapid ascent to ratings dominance .
A prudent observer might wonder how this new system came to report so much more favorably for a network that had fiercely opposed its adoption .
What transpired that caused Fox News to withdraw their objections and become the biggest beneficiary of the change ?
It has recently been discovered that the Wegener Corporation , the manufacturer of the set - top devices that Nielsen uses , has a long association with Rupert Murdoch and the News Corporation , the parent of Fox News .
Wegener was founded by the former management of Scientific - Atlanta , a producer of set - top boxes for cable access and other purposes .
One of the other products in Scientific - Atlanta ’s line was a device used by Gemstar to provide television program listings to cable operators and their subscribers .
Gemstar was an affiliate of TV Guide , which in turn was owned by Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp .
So the executives who were responsible for developing and manufacturing Murdoch ’s equipment for Gemstar became the principles of the company providing Nielsen with their ratings collection devices .
And around that same time Fox News dropped their objections to the new People Meter service .
It would not be difficult to encode an electronic device so that it would purposefully miscalculate survey data .
A simple algorithm to multiply a target by a fixed percentage could produce a result that would artificially inflate one set of figures while keeping it in proportion to a larger set , making it virtually impossible to detect .
At present , their is no confirmation that such a deception has been contrived .
It would require a thorough examination of Nielsen ’s hardware and the ability to reverse engineer the chips inside of it .
But for those who presume that it would be an outlandish notion , they would be well advised to study recent news events that uncovered similarly scandalous conduct on the part of News Corp .
One situation involves a digital recorder and satellite receiver made by NDS Group for Murdoch ’s Sky network in Europe .
Unlike TiVo , the Sky + system records “ personal viewing information , ” which is information about your viewing practices that is tied to your contact information ( i.e. , it ’s not kept anonymous , like TiVo’s ) .
In addition to that , NDS was also charged with using spies and hackers to steal Sky competitor Dish Network ’s programming and make it available to viewers for free , thus undercutting Dish ’s financial viability .
As reported in Wired Magazine :
“ The case involves a colorful cast of characters that includes former intelligence agents , Canadian TV pirates , Bulgarian and German hackers , stolen e-mails and the mysterious suicide of a Berlin hacker who had been courted by the Murdoch company not long before his death .
On the hot spot is NDS Group , a UK - Israeli firm that makes smartcards for pay - TV systems like DirecTV .
The company is a majority - owned subsidiary of Murdoch ’s News Corporation .
The charges stem from 1997 when NDS is accused of cracking the encryption of rival NagraStar , which makes access cards and systems for EchoStar ’s Dish Network and other pay - TV services .
Further , it ’s alleged NDS then hired hackers to manufacture and distribute counterfeit NagraStar cards to pirates to steal Dish Network ’s programming for free . ”
On yet another occasion Murdoch ’s news group engaged in some sleazy and illegal behavior to get stories about celebrities and politicians .
The Guardian reported that Murdoch paid substantial sums of money to keep this scandal under wraps :
“ Rupert Murdoch ’s News Group Newspapers has paid out more than £ 1 m to settle legal cases that threatened to reveal evidence of his journalists ’ repeated involvement in the use of criminal methods to get stories .
The payments secured secrecy over out - of - court settlements in three cases that threatened to expose evidence of Murdoch journalists using private investigators who illegally hacked into the mobile phone messages of numerous public ­figures as well as gaining unlawful access to confidential personal data , including tax records , social security files , bank statements and itemised phone bills .
Cabinet ministers , MPs , actors and sports stars were all targets of the private investigators . ”
And if that ’s not enough , check into the incestuous and disturbing web of connections Murdoch has to the communists in China .
Glenn
Beck tried to pull the veil off of this one but was censored by his own employer .
Given the history of sleazy conduct and nefarious associations , is it really that far - fetched to conclude that something similar has taken place with regard to Murdoch ’s relationship to Nielsen and the firm that manufactures their ratings collection devices ?
It would explain how Fox News could wind up with such a dominate lead in the ratings despite catering to a relatively small potential audience .
It would explain why Fox suddenly halted their objections to a new process that they previously considered inaccurate and biased against them .
It would also explain a deep discrepancy between the allegedly broad viewing of Fox News and their nearly invisible impact on the political landscape .
If Fox were as ubiquitous as they ( and the ratings ) claim , then why , during the years of their strongest growth , did they fail to move the country to their positions .
With a sustained 24/7 propaganda effort , Fox failed to stop the 2006 Democratic takeover of Congress .
They failed to stop the 2008 election of Barack Obama despite incessant and false allegations of him being a Muslim , a radical leftist , and a pal of terrorists .
They failed to stop the 2010 passage of a health care bill despite charges of socialism , death panels , and national bankruptcy .
Does this sound like a network that holds a commanding majority of America ’s television viewers under its sway ?
To be sure , I am not the first to question the legitimacy of Nielsen ’s numbers .
Many people in the industry quietly accept what they regard as a flawed methodology simply because there is no alternative – or because proposed alternatives are even less acceptable .
When it suits their purpose , even Fox News complains about the ratings .
And I ’m not talking about simple complaints concerning minor numerical inconsistencies , but allegations of rampant fraud that warrant federal investigation .
After basking in the glow of Nielsen ’s data , Bill O’Reilly turns around and castigates them as having “ major problems … that have benefited MSNBC , ” and asserts that …
O’Reilly : “ The bottom line on this is there may be some big - time cheating going on in the ratings system , and we hope the feds will investigate .
Any fraud in the television rating system affects all Americans . ”
Of course the “ feds ” do n’t have any jurisdiction over private market research firms .
And it ’s rather hypocritical for O’Reilly to suddenly advocate for big government intruding on the free market .
But conservatives like O’Reilly are not averse to hypocrisy when it furthers their agenda .
And in this case the agenda is to work the refs at Nielsen and suppress any notion that Fox is not the king of the television hill .
In conclusion , if we are to have any certainty as to who the real king of the hill is , we will need to get to the bottom of this lingering controversy surrounding Nielsen ’s systems and procedures .
The connection to Murdoch ’s covert operations and his history of unlawful corporate espionage cannot be dismissed .
Nielsen must investigate their equipment providers and perform intensive examinations of the devices they place in viewers ’ homes .
Anything short of this would leave them open to charges of complicity and render their survey data useless .
