Image caption Greece is under international pressure to make deep budget cuts
Another Danish pharmaceutical company is withdrawing products from Greece in protest at the government 's decision to cut the prices of medicines by 25 % .
The Leo Pharma company says it is suspending sales of two popular drugs because the price reductions will cause job losses across Europe .
The Greek government is struggling with a debt crisis .
It has condemned as unfair the action of Leo Pharma , and another Danish company , Novo Nordisk .
Supply embargo ?
The decision by Leo Pharma to suspend distribution of an anti blood - clotting agent and a remedy for psoriasis takes Greece one step closer towards an all - out boycott by medical suppliers .
Kristian Hart Hansen , a senior director of the company , said the 25 % price reduction would encourage similar moves in other countries with large debt problems such as Ireland and Italy .
He warned that unless the company took action , there would job losses across Europe , including Denmark where the company is based .
Earlier this week another Danish company , Novo Nordisk , withdrew sales of its state - of - the - art insulin product from Greece for the same reason .
Greek government officials believe the Danish companies are blackmailing Athens because they monopolise the market with certain key drugs .
Stefanos Combinos , the director general of the economy ministry , told the BBC that Greece was one of the three most expensive countries in Europe for medicines .
He said pharmaceutical companies had enjoyed great profits out of Greece over the decades and had an obligation to accept price reductions .
Mr Combinos said Greece had been under pressure from the IMF to make severe cuts and he anticipated that a compromise on a price reduction would be reached soon .
The Greek government has promised to repay 5.6bn euros that it owes to medical companies for hospital equipment and drugs .
But the Greek Association of Science and Health Providers has warned that there is little chance of an agreement and that the country 's debt - plagued state hospitals face a supply embargo .
A spokesman for Novo Nordisk , which is owed 24.4 m euros by Greece , said that the debt issue was unrelated to the decision not to lower prices .
That decision , he said , was entirely a result of the new price decree .
Real estate agent Mike Reynolds had two desirable beachfront condos in escrow when the tide of crude from the Deepwater Horizon spill washed over his business and left it looking about as appetizing as an oiled crab .
“ I lost $ 20,000 in commission , ” Reynolds said .
“ The guy called and said he ’d never be able to make any money off of them .
He walked away from a $ 10,000 earnest - money check . ”
Just a few miles east of Reynolds ’ Gulf Shores condos , restaurant owner Matt Shipp has seen his Orange Beach business plummet by 90 % , even before thick masses of oily seaweed painted the white sand beach Saturday .
He put in a claim for $ 35,000 in lost business for May , and after more than 40 days of phone calls and faxes , got approved for $ 18,000 .
When will he get the money , he asked BP ’s adjuster , the fourth one to whom he had been passed .
“ He said , ‘ I do n’t know , ’ ” Shipp said .
“ I said , ‘ Who will send it to me ? ’
He said , ‘ I do n’t know . ’
I said , ‘ Is it a check ?
A bank transfer ? ’
He said , ‘ I do n’t know . ’
As of today , I still do n’t have the funds .
And that ’s only May .
What about June ?
It ’s been even worse in June . ”
Across the gulf , residents already shell - shocked by the tar balls , oil soup and dead sea life washing up on their beaches are getting hit with a second wave : the sudden collapse of their livelihoods , and the equally intimidating challenge of getting BP to pay for it .
President Obama , who on Monday makes his fourth visit to the gulf in six weeks , will try to compel BP to set aside a “ substantial ” sum in an escrow fund for economic damage claims .
Senate Democrats on Sunday requested that BP set aside $ 20 billion that would be overseen by an independent party , a contingency that could put further stress on the oil giant , which has lost about half its market value since the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig started the worst spill in U.S. history .
The 42,000 claims filed with the oil company so far go well beyond the shrimpers , oystermen and seafood processers who have been the spill ’s most visible victims .
Hotels , restaurants , machine shops , bars and tour companies all became collateral damage when the Gulf of Mexico , one of the nation ’s most important fisheries and tourist destinations , became an industrial cleanup site .
The people whose lives depend on those businesses complain about ignored claims , unanswered phone calls and lost paperwork .
One man said his BP claims adjuster did n’t even know where Grand Isle , La. , was .
“ What the future will hold , I have no idea , ” said Emma Chighizola , owner of the Blue Water Souvenirs shop on Grand Isle , a barrier island full of colorful beach cabins at the southern tip of Louisiana that is normally flush with pink , sweaty tourists this time of year .
“ We ’ve never been through anything like this .
We ’ve been through a lot of hurricanes and we always came back .
We knew what to expect .
This , we do n’t . ”
For now , cleanup workers have booked all the local rooms , but the shop ’s shelves remain tightly stocked with porpoise paperweights , shell necklaces , crab potholders and swimsuits .
“ Clearance on all fishing supplies , ” says a sign in the window .
Chighizola and her husband filed a claim several weeks ago for lost revenue , but have not received any response .
“ They keep saying , ‘ Not yet .
It takes time for the paperwork , ’ ” Chighizola said .
“ But I have to pay these bills .
All this merchandise , it was all ordered back in December , and I ’m having a hard time paying for it . ”
About the only business that ’s doing well is short - term rentals to contractors flooding into town to clean up the beach and the bay .
But selling real estate ?
Forget it , agents say .
“ My phone quit ringing a month ago , ” said Grand Isle real estate agent Karl Thayer , who has received a small initial payment from BP and is still waiting for the next .
“ I ’ve had one closing since the blowout , and that was a vacant property .
Everything else is dead in the water . ”
BP says it has paid out $ 53 million in economic damage claims so far , mainly the initial checks of $ 2,500 or $ 5,000 that are going to fishermen and others who can document immediate , direct losses .
Those payments will be repeated in June , but after that , claimants may have to supply additional documentation , BP said .
More than 20,000 of the 42,000 claims submitted have been paid , and no documented claims have been denied , said BP spokesman David Nicholas .
The payment process has been complicated and cumbersome in the initial weeks .
Fishermen frequently have complained about filing claims , only to find that their processing number was lost or the adjuster on their case had disappeared .
Others who work on a cash basis have had a hard time documenting their income .
“ It ’s ridiculous .
I filed an application out of Grand Isle , and it ’s been six weeks and I got nothing , ” said Tommy Malbrough , a commercial fisherman from Bourg , La .
“ They keep saying they ’re working on it .
They brought in an adjuster from Arizona to Grand Isle , and he keeps leaving on some family emergency .
Two days ago another guy took my case and they said he ’d call me , and he never did .
Finally I sent a fax , a big piece of paper with black marker on it , said : ‘ Will the manager of BP claims please call me ? ’
Well , he called me .
And then he gave me the runaround . ”
Nicholas acknowledged that the processing of large business claims needed to become “ more efficient and more responsive , ” but said there were already “ enhancements to the process ” that should speed things up soon .
He said the early kinks in handling fishermen ’s claims had been worked out , and that they were getting paid more smoothly .
A lot of boat owners have gone to work for BP cleaning up oil .
“ They would much rather be working and out there helping the situation and getting paid for it than just receiving a check , ” said Curtis Thomas , a BP spokesman in Grand Isle .
Terry Vegas , who is preparing to join the cleanup effort with his 56 - foot shrimp boat , said it was better than staying home and fuming .
“ Believe me , there ai n’t no fishermen want to do this .
None of them .
But they got to , ” Vegas said .
“ I ’m 60 years old , and I ’ve been shrimping for 46 years .
What else am I going to do ? ”
His wife , Rosemary , who suffers from emphysema and congestive heart failure , said she was not told that her husband ’s new employment would offset a second claims payment , as BP officials have said publicly .
“ We keep getting letters from lawyers .
But we ’re not going to hire no lawyer .
We ’re going to wait and see what they ’re going to offer to settle , ” she said .
Many of those waiting find their way to Frank Besson ’s Pirate Island Daiquiri Bar on the narrow finger of road that winds its way up the island .
It ’s a good thing , Besson said , because tourist business is down so far he ’s already had to cash his first BP claim check .
“ It took me 15 minutes to do what I needed to do , and I got the whole $ 5,000 , ” he said .
The competition down the road , in a nod to the times , is selling tar ball daiquiris , but Besson has n’t reached the point where he thinks that ’s funny .

These instructions are out of date .
The currently recommended solution is to use the FreeSpace Open Installer
This installation method is based on using an online installer .
The installer itself is rather small and the idea is that you get it running and it'll download all the components you choose and place them into appropriate places .
In theory , the Installer should be able to resume its downloads , meaning that you do NOT have to download everything on a single run .
If for some reason you must stop downloading , you can resume the download by repeating the same steps you took on your first attempt .
The Installer will notice what files it has already downloaded and wo n't try to download them again .
Alternative methods include :
Manual installation
Manual installation for Linux / Mac OS X
The ( Noob Friendly ) Guide to Installing FreeSpace Open
What is FreeSpace ?
What 's the plot ?
So why should I play it ?
Ok ok I get the message ... but are n't they a bit old now ?
Do I need anything special to play ?
OS : XP , Vista , 7 , Linux or MacOS
OpenGL capable GPU ( Shader Model 3 recommended )
CPU : Anything respectable made after 2003
Joystick ( not required ) : ( proper one preferred ) or X - box 360 pad
HDD space : a few gigs
Alright , I 'm sold .
So what do I do ?
Step - by - Step Installation Guide for FreeSpace Open ( Windows ) ( it 's really not difficult ) :
0.5 ) Install OpenAL :
Required !
1 ) Get a legit copy of FreeSpace 2 :
it will run on Vista just fine and dandy .
Install it to to wherever you like , but I recommend C: \games \Freespace 2 if you want minimum effort and not have to do anything really complicated like change an install path when you install FSO .
( Moderator person 's note : anything under \ Program files \ can be tricky with Vista / 7 , so yeah , C : \Games \FreeSpace2 \ or something like that is a good option . )
This is required , and is all you need to purchase to play all three games .
Though it would be appreciated if you bought all the games for the sake of clear conscience .
If you have a half - decent internet connection and a paltry $ 5.99 / game to spare , then head right over to Good Old Games now and buy them , safe in the knowledge that not only is it one convenient to use install file ( no CD's ) and DRM - free , but thatjust fine and dandy .
Install it to to wherever you like , but I recommend C: \games \Freespace 2 if you want minimum effort and not have to do anything really complicated like change an install path when you install FSO .
( Moderator person 's note : anything under \ Program files \ can be tricky with Vista / 7 , so yeah , C : \Games \FreeSpace2 \ or something like that is a good option . )
2 ) Get a copy of Turley 's Turney 's Turrey 's Turkey 's Trey 's Turey 's FreeSpace Open Installer ( and learn to spell it , dammit ! ) :
3 ) Initial configuration and Launcher update :
3.6.12
updated 5.5 f Launcher
4 ) Graphics / MediaVPs configuration for maximum eye - candy :
Some boneheads seem to think that you should move the MediaVPs from \ freespace2 \mediavps\ to \freespace2 \ so that life would be easier .
Feel free to ask any seasoned HLP member why this is stupid and should not be done .
-- Jeff Vader
IMPORTANT CAMPAIGN INFO :
The main FreeSpace 2 campaign is the one enabled by default .
If you want to start from the very beginning of the FreeSpace 1 campaign ( and I see no reason why you would n't ) then you need to use the " MOD " tab on the launcher and select the original campaign using the instructions below :
Specular
Glowmaps
Environment Maps
Normal Maps
Lighting to Missiles
Use Models For Ship Selection
Enable 3D Warp
Enable Flash Upon Warp
IMPORTANT PILOT PROFILE INFORMATION :
I am told that using the same pilot profile across different mods can can cause erratic behaviour in - game .
Go to the pilot selection room from within the game and click the " Clone " button to create a duplicate of your pilot profile , and rename it to reflect the mod you are running ( eg : RICHDOG FS1 ) , and do this for each mod , ensuring you load the correct profile each time in each different mod .
6 ) Configuring Multiplayer :
7 ) ZOMG that actually was n't too painful ... is that it ?
That was awesome !
Are there any MODS ?

Well , the wiki is here and will tell you everything you want to know , but I 've summed it up here :
The FreeSpace series is quite simply in my opinion the second best hardcore space - combat SIM ever made after TIE Fighter .
Yes , I did say ever , like in the history of gaming as we know it .
Not only did it boast visuals that were at the time like being in some kind of film , it had one of the greatest , most epic story lines to boot .
Nothing made you feel like you were fighting the greatest battle in history like this game .
We 're talking an engine that supported oodles of ships on screen at once without breaking a sweat , cruisers so big that you had to fly down the length of them for a minute or two before you got past them , and which fired Babylon 5 style beam weapons at each other while you sat there in your piddly little fighter .
Added to this the atmosphere was immense ... frequent comms chatter from allies giving a real feel of being part of something , and the constantly changing dynamic mission objectives giving everything a " wing and a prayer " feel .
The sense of scale was ( is ) simply unparalleled in my humble opinion .
The reviews agreed : Basically the story revolves around Terrans ( humans ) meeting an alien species called the Vasudans .
The Terrans offend the Vasudans , and as a result , a war starts , lasting several years .
After much pain and suffering a new threat arrives in the form of a xenophobic alien species whose sole aim is to exterminate everyone they meet , simply because err ... they can .
As a result the Terrans and the Vasudans stop fighting and start pooling their resources to fight this new enemy .
Thus begins the ' Great War ' .
Duh , re-read the first paragraph .
Stunning visuals ?
Epic gameplay like being in a movie , possibly even better ?
A dogfighting engine and HUD / comms system second only to the greatest space sim EVER made ?
Intelligent and clever AI that behaved exactly like it was supposed to ?
We are talking about gaming history here , you owe it to yourself to play this , you owe it to the creators of the game to play this , and by God you owe it to your children and your childrens children .
Ahem .
Well , yes and no .
You see , a community of fans dedicated a significant portion of their free time enhancing the now open - source game engine of FS2 into a " bells and whistles " epic , OpenGL - capable version that not only significantly upgrades every ship model , planet etc etc in the game ... but even runs like a dream both in widescreen resolutions ( I use 1680x1050 ) and using AA .
Concourse and briefing screens / sequences are still in low res but if this bothers you then you are quite frankly a plank , and should be worrying about the in - game bits instead .
Let me stress again that you can not only play FreeSpace 2 in extreme graphical goodness , but also the original FreeSpace and Silent Threat expansion pack with the help of a mod known as FSPort .
Hell , Silent Threat has even been completely revamped and re-written to make it the campaign it should have been in the original game .
We 're talking new missions , new scripting , new voiceovers .
Epic.[list=1]
Right , I will attempt to provide as a simple guide as I can to getting all this up and running as painlessly as possible ... follow the guide below to get yourself in space - combat bliss :
Get OpenAL for your operating system .
If you are a Windows user , download the file named " oalinst " , extract it and run the exe .
Click " Yes " or " Next " once , the " Finish " .
That 's it .
There 's no need to be concerned about installing OpenAL .
It is just an open source audio API developed by Creative .
It will not do anything evil and wo n't break anything .
It 's the Win ( Zipped .exe , 19 MB ) link at the top of this thread
Once it 's downloaded , run it , and click Next , then point the program towards the install path of your FreeSpace 2 installation .
The default is C : \Games \Freespace2 , but if you changed it to something different then you 'll need to do the same here so that everything is pointed towards the right place .
Click
Next again and it will now give you a choice of options of what the program will download .
Click " The Works : Absolutely Everything " if you want to get the full benefits of all this .
You can also select what components you want to download , but remember : if you want the new eyecandy , make sure the MediaVPs are selected .
Click " Next " again and you 'll see all the options ticked .
Click " Next again to start the download process .
The updater will then go away to the internetz and download every component it needs to update the game , and install it for you too .
It WILL take a while , so leave it to run for an hour or two or however long it takes until the log displays " Done " and the " Next " button becomes selectable .
Congrats , you 've just installed FreeSpace Open .
:D
Good , now we 're almost there .
Woo - hoo , you 're almost there , all that 's left now is to spend a few minutes ensuring we are using the correctexecutable , and then configuring the engine using thewhich should be in your FreeSpace 2 installation directory .
Go to your \freespace2\ directory and now open Launcher .exe .
Create a shortcut on your desktop to make things easier in future .
Once it 's been opened you 'll see a bog - standard Launcher .
At the moment the Launcher may be set to use the older 3.6.9 version of the FSO game engine , and we want it to be running the newer 3.6.12 .
To do this click the " Browse " button at the top of the launcher and it will open up to your root directory .
Scroll down to where the " " executable is and double - click it to set the Launcher to point to the 3.6.12 build sort of like in the screenshot below .
Make sure you pick the one that has an " r " instead of a " d " . " d " means debug and those exes just are n't meant for actual playing .
Thanks to this thread
If you opted to download the MediaVPs , they should be located in \ freespace2 \mediavps \ .
This is how we 'll use them :
Click the " MOD " tab of the Launcher and click the " Select MOD " button .
This will open an explorer window .
Locate the " mediavps " folder and highlight it then click " OK " like in the screenie below :
Simply click " Select mod " , select " fsport - mediavps " folder from the list , and click " OK " .
Then start the game , create a new pilot , go to the Campaign Room and select the FS1 main campaign .
Voila .
When you are done with the original campaign and want to try " Silent Threat : Reborn " , follow the instructions in this thread .
Note that you should have ST: R already installed so there 's no need to download anything .
When you 're done with both of those and want to play the daddy , FS2 , then simply change your current mod folder to " mediavps " from the Launcher , as we 've done before .
Now to finish the rest of the settings and get all the graphics options set in the launcher :
First set the basic resolution and engine ...
Select OpenGL ( though this should n't matter since the FSO engine uses OpenGL regardless of what is selected with the Launcher ) .
Mine are currently as follows :
Now click the " Features " tab and use the drop - down box to select the different aspect of the settings , like in the screenshot below : Under " Graphics " , enable : Enable everything under " HUD " Under " Gameplay " enable :
That 's enough for the Features tab .
Now go through the other tabs and set all the rest of the stuff that you 'll need to get sound and joystick goodness etc , you know the drill .
Err , yes basically .
All that 's required now is to launch the game and configure it for how you want it .
There may be a few detail settings to max , and remember that all campaign / options screens that are not in - game look like the originals , ie : low - res .
You get in the game and that 's where the difference lies .
Also remember this is a hardcore space - sim , so there are a LOT of controls to master and configure , though to start with you can get by with the core basic shoot / targeting / comms options for a good few missions until you really start to gel with the game and then start hungering for more .
Yeah baby yeah ... there are mods ... quite a few actually ( some as yet unreleased ) very briefly that I personally consider suitably epic and that I 'll definitely be keeping an eye on : Babylon 5 .
With the FSO engine .
Yes , think large beam weapons and awesome looking ships .
This does not require a FreeSpace 2 installation , it is completely stand - alone .
It is now at final release and looks simply awesome , but I think the devs would have liked to polish it a bit more but never really got chance to before the project reached an end .
I downloaded the " DVD Install " just so that I got all the extra goodies , user - made campaigns , missions etc and just installed the lot .
Epic , epic mod ... and again completely stand - alone .
These guys are basically converting the re-imagined TV series to the FSO engine , complete with a re-written physics engine to emulate the ships in the series , and some BADASS models .
Think the most epic moments of BSG ( Finding the pegasus , fleets of baseships firing nukes while supported by swarms of fighters , the hwole shebang ) .
There is currently only a demo of this on the site , but the full release is most definitely live and well , and is scheduled for some time pretty soon .
Wow how did I miss this one ?
Awesome looking TC , the screenies look VERY impressive .
This could well be the FS2 TC to end all FS2 TCs !
Another one I forgot to post originally ... this is another TC that has been given a LOT of love .
Those of you who were gaming in days of yore will remember Wing Commander as one of the grand daddies of space sims , and this looks to be very faithful to the original concepts .
Well that 's it ... I 'm spent .
Even if this guide only sucks in one or two people to this awesome game then I will consider my work done .
I hope the guide helped to make the process as simple as possible , and if you have any questions please let me know . : ) [ / list ]

Art came across this press release about a dolphin named Merlin who uses an iPad .
Last week , a young bottlenose dolphin named Merlin became the first of his species to join the growing number of enthusiasts using the Apple iPad .
Dolphin research scientist , Jack Kassewitz of SpeakDolphin.com , introduced the iPad to the dolphin in early steps towards building a language interface .
" The use of the iPad is part of our continuing search to find a suitable touch screen technology which the dolphins can activate with the tip of their rostrums or beaks .
After extensive searching and product review , it looks like our choice is between the Panasonic Toughbook and the Apple iPad , " Kassewitz explained .
" We think that once the dolphins get the hang of the touch screen , we can let them choose from a wide assortment of symbols to represent objects , actions and even emotions . "
Kassewitz explained the requirements of the technology .
" Waterproofing , processor speed , touch - sensitivity , anti-glare screens , and dolphin - friendly programs are essential .
As this database of dolphin symbols grows – we 'll need fast technology to help us respond appropriately and quickly to the dolphins . "
The research was being conducted at Dolphin Discovery 's dolphin swim facility in Puerto Aventuras , Mexico , along the picturesque coast now referred to as the Riviera Maya .
The dolphin , Merlin , is a juvenile , born at the facility only two years ago .
" Merlin is quite curious , like most dolphins , and he showed complete willingness to examine the iPad , " said Kassewitz .
For now , the researchers are getting Merlin used to the touch screen by showing him real objects , such as a ball , cube or plastic duck , then asking the dolphin to touch photos of those same objects on the screen .
" This is an easy task for a dolphin , but it is a necessary building block towards our goal of a complete language interface between humans and dolphins , " Kassewitz said .
I have no problems with people being religious per se .
I think that people have the right to believe in whatever they want .
If they happen to believe in something that is demonstrably wrong , well then , they should be prepared to suffer the slings and arrows of reality .
The problem tends to come in when some religious people try to impose their religion on others .
If you go through my posts on religion , you 'll find that this is where I tend to step in .
Want to teach creationism in the classroom ?
Uh uh .
Want to oppress women ?
Sorry , fella .
Think abstinence - only education works and you should get government grants to teach it ?
Keep it in your own pants , please .
The problem is amplified by the fact that pretty much every religion tends to think of itself as the One True Belief .
And when they get some political clout , things get very itchy indeed .
Or have we already forgotten what the Taliban did to the Buddhas of Bamyan ?
That 's why I worry when I hear politicians in the U.S. saying we 're a Christian nation .
We 're not .
We 're a nation of mostly Christians , to be sure , but there are other religions here as well , and a bunch of non-believers too .
When confronted with this , most of these politicians tend to say the Founding Fathers were Christians , and based this country on Christian beliefs .
But that 's not true either : the basis of our country 's law is the Constitution , and the Founders took a great deal of care making sure it kept religion at arm 's length ( despite what some politicians believe ) .
With the far - right going apoplectic every time someone mentions non-believers or religions other than Christianity ( remember this ? ) , I imagine the 2012 Presidential election will be one where every candidate tries to out - religious the next .
But we have the 2010 midterms coming up , and it 'll be an issue there too .
That 's why I like very much what the Freedom From Religion Foundation is doing : they 've created wonderful ads with quotes from the Founding Fathers showing precisely how they felt on this issue .
The one above of JFK is cool , because his candidacy was attacked for him being a Catholic , of all things .
The thing is , he was a religious man , and still understood that religion must be kept away from politics .
But far and away , I love this one the most :
Not a lot of wiggle room in that , is there ?
Sarah Palin , of course , disagrees ( read that link ; Barry Lynn 's -- sorry , I mean the Reverend Barry Lynn 's -- comment there is wonderful ) .
But I suspect that her grasp of the actual history of this nation is somewhat tenuous , given her many inaccurate statements about it and about reality in general .
Anyway , these banners ( seven in total ) will run on buses , and it 'll be interesting to see how the far - right religious folks will react .
I 'll note that the FFRF ran a full - page ad in the New York Times yesterday about how the National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional , which I agree with .
Strongly .
What strikes me as funny is how the über - religious in the US fight to tear down the wall of separation , not realizing that they are weakening themselves .
What stands between their religion being dominant and , say , Muslims ?
This is one of the many problems with having religion intertwined with government .
As long as it's your religion , hurray .
But see those guys over there praying in a place of worship with slightly different architecture from yours ?
They feel exactly the same way about their religion as you do about yours .
The only way to protect your own freedom of religion is to protect your freedom from theirs .
There are two ways to do that .
You can either emulate the Taliban ... or you can make sure that laws , politics , and government are kept wholly and , I dare say , fundamentally separated from religion .
The choice is ours .
MovieLens is a research project that provides datasets of various sizes and attributes , containing movie ratings .
These datasets are free to download and use for non-commercial purposes .
They have done an awesome job putting this data together and a big thanks goes to them for making it available .
I wanted to exercise my Clojure skills ( more like add to my tiny set of Clojure skills 🙂 ) and it just so happens that I recently came across the MovieLens project , so how about analyzing that data using Clojure ?
One of the datasets they make available is the One Million Dataset , this set consists of 3 files
“ movies.dat ” containing 3883 movie listings , contains title , genre… “ users.dat ” containing 6040 unique users , contains age , occupation , gender … “ ratings.dat ” containing 1000209 movie ratings , that references movie id and user id from the above 2 files .
I could analyze this data to answer questions such as , What age group gave the most ratings ?
or
What was the highest rated movie for a given time period ?
But before I could do this I wanted to denormalize the ratings file so that it also contains the user and movie information , why ?
cause I do n’t want to look it up when I am analyzing the data , each record should be self contained .
The outline of the program is quite simple
Read the users file into memory
Read the movies files into memory
For each line in the ratings
Find the corresponding movie and user Print it out to a file .
Take a minute to think how would you do this in java and then look at the below code .
I ran it on a Dell laptop dual 2.2 Ghz laptop with 4 gig of ram and care to guess how long it takes ??
scroll down for answer .

A controversy - courting Italian ice - cream maker is in hot water for running an ad featuring a heavily pregnant nun with the strapline " immaculately conceived " , after a stream of complaints to the advertising watchdog that it is offensive to Christians because it mocks the birth of Jesus .
The ad , which is featured in magazines The Lady and Grazia , features a pregnant nun enjoying a pot of Antonio Fedirici ice - cream .
The Advertising Standards Authority has launched an investigation to see if the campaign breaks the advertising code on the grounds of taste and decency .
The ASA has received about 40 complaints from members of the public that it is offensive to Christians , especially Catholics , " because it mocks the virgin birth of Jesus " .
Matt O'Connor , creative director at the ice - cream company , argued that it is an " intelligent , challenging and iconoclastic piece of advertising " .
O'Connor , who points out that he is an Irish Catholic himself , also argues that the ad " tells a deeper story " , satirising the " horrific stories involving thousands of pregnant Irish women enslaved by the Catholic church in convents and who had their children taken away from them by nuns because they were seen as ' moral degenerates ' " .
The ad is the latest in the company 's " Ice- cream is our religion " campaign .
Last year the ASA banned an ad campaign by the company featuring a a young nun and priest about to share a kiss after complaints that it was offensive to those in a religious order .

Google ( NSDQ : GOOG ) , which just last week launched a redesign of its search results page , is now introducing some changes to the content of its results too .
The company says it will directly answer ' millions of different fact - seeking searches ' with short answers at the top of its results .
Search for ' Catherine Zeta - Jones date of birth ' , for instance , and the date shows up at the top , along with where Google is pulling the information from .
Google says the feature is based on Google Squared , the experimental search tool it rolled out a year ago that gathers facts from the around the web and presents them in an organized way .
This is very much the way search market appears to be headed .
Microsoft 's Bing , for instance , has tried to differentiate itself with ' instant answers ' , which feature aggregated information at the top of results ( Compare the results for ' Cavs ' in both Google and Bing , for instance ) .
And WolframAlpha seems to be the rare search startup that is surviving - it says thriving - by providing data - driven answers to factual queries .
It tells you when Zeta - Jones was born .

If you ’re the type of person who needs to add sugar or other sweetener to your drinks , then you ’re probably familiar with the little pink blue packet called NutraSweet .
NutraSweet is one of many artificial sweeteners on the market today .
But do you know what ’s in this pink blue packet ?
The side effects of NutraSweet and its health risks will be examined in this article .
It may have you thinking twice about adding it to your coffee or tea next time .
What Is It ?
The main ingredient that makes up NutraSweet is aspartame .
Aspartame is comprised of three chemicals .
These chemicals are methanol , phenlylanine , and aspartic acid .
Methanol , which is a wood alcohol , makes up just 10 % of aspartame , but it ’s very toxic in small doses .
How Can It Affect Me ?
Just two teaspoons of methanol can be lethal to an adult .
Phenylaline is naturally found in the brain , but it can be dangerous if high amounts are present .
Large amounts of this chemical can lead to depression and schizophrenia .
High levels can also make a person ’s chance of having a seizure increase dramatically .
Aspartic acid makes up 40 % of aspartame .
Usually , aspartate functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain , but too much of this chemical can actually kill off brain cells through over - stimulation .
The slow process of destroying brain cells can bring on memory loss , Parkinson ’s Disease , and other neurological issues .
A person ’s metabolism can be affected by consuming NutraSweet .
Some people can experience weight gain , while others can experience weight loss .
Women can experience hair loss and disruptions in their menstrual cycle as a result of consuming this product .
There is a long list of side effects from using NutraSweet .
There are at least 92 adverse effects , both immediate and long terms problems .
Just a few include the following :
Anxiety attacks
Abdominal pain
Asthma
Arthritis ( natural cures for arthritis )
Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
Bloating or other fluid retention problems
Brain cancer
Burning urination
Breathing difficulties
Chest pain
Chronic fatigue
Chronic cough
Confusion
Death
Dizziness
Diarrhea
Depression ( natural cures for depression )
Insomnia
Joint pain
Memory loss
Menstrual problems
Migraines
Muscle spasms
Nausea
Rapid heartbeat
Seizures
Slurring of the speech
Swallowing pain
Tinnitus
Vision loss
You get the idea …
There are many more side effects , but it would all day to go through them .
NutraSweet also mimics symptoms that occur with variety of diseases .
In these cases , NutraSweet has to be consumed on a regular basis .
The disease symptoms occur only after long term usage .
These diseases include the following :
Lupus
Arthritis
Fibromyalgia
Multiple Sclerosis
Diabetes
Parkinson’s
Epilepsy
Birth defects
Alzheimer ’s
Lyme Disease
Again these are only a few of the diseases that the effects of NutraSweet can mimic .
The diseases that are listed are quite severe and devastating , not only to the person it effects , but their loved ones as well .
If someone uses NutraSweet long term , meaning every day for years on end , that ’s when the diseases listed above can be mimicked .
Sometimes , when the NutraSweet is cut out of the person ’s diet , these symptoms will stop .
NutraSweet can actually put toxins into the blood stream .
In today ’s society , the popular thing to do is to cleanse the body of toxins .
When toxins are deliberately put into the blood stream , serious side effects can happen , such as depression , suicidal thoughts and tendencies , birth defects , brain damage , and even death .
The side effects of NutraSweet and its health risks should be of major concern to anyone who uses artificial sweeteners .
There have been many news stories over recent years indicating that people do get sick from using these types of products .
If you absolutely need to add sweetener to your drinks , opt for raw honey , or try to ween yourself off of sweeteners if you can .

A brief tale in pictures :
Please note that this has nothing to do with our current economic problems .
That is why it is never discussed in the news , during elections , or by elected officials .
Our problems may be due to a lot of different things , including but not limited to :
– Outsourcing blue collar jobs
– Costly wars
– Tax cuts during costly wars
– The collapse of the dollar
– Poor monetary policy
– Lazy , entitled poor people
– Shiftless minorities
– Spanish language billboards
– Snake - handlers
– Al Worthington of Al Worthington Chevrolet in Grand Forks , ND
– Solar wind
– The death of Billy Mays
– Infrastructure destroyed by the Sasquatch , Rodan , or both
– Reckless disregard for official signage
– Jews
But not inequality .
So keep moving , there 's nothing to see here .

The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) is warning of the potential risk of overdosing infants with liquid vitamin D .
Some liquid vitamin D supplement products on the market come with droppers that could allow parents and caregivers to accidentally give harmful amounts of the vitamin to an infant .
These droppers can hold a greater amount of liquid vitamin D than an infant should receive .
" It is important that infants not get more than the recommended daily amount of vitamin D , " says Linda M. Katz , M.D. , M.P.H. , interim chief medical officer in FDA 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition .
" Parents and caregivers should only use the dropper that comes with the vitamin D supplement purchased . "
Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and plays a key role in the development of strong bones .
Vitamin D supplements are recommended for some infants — especially those that are breast - fed — because deficiency of this vitamin can lead to bone problems such as thinning , soft , and misshaped bones , as is seen with the condition known as rickets .
However , excessive vitamin D can cause nausea and vomiting , loss of appetite , excessive thirst , frequent urination , constipation , abdominal pain , muscle weakness , muscle and joint aches , confusion , and fatigue , as well as more serious consequences like kidney damage .
FDA 's Recommendations
Ensure that your infant does not receive more than 400 international units ( IUs ) of vitamin D a day , which is the daily dose of vitamin D supplement that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends for breast - fed and partially breast - fed infants .
Keep the vitamin D supplement product with its original package so that you and other caregivers can follow the instructions .
Follow these instructions carefully so that you use the dropper correctly and give the right dose .
Use only the dropper that comes with the product ; it is manufactured specifically for that product .
Do not use a dropper from another product .
Ensure the dropper is marked so that the units of measure are clear and easy to understand .
Also make sure that the units of measure correspond to those mentioned in the instructions .
If you cannot clearly determine the dose of vitamin D delivered by the dropper , talk to a health care professional before giving the supplement to the infant .
If your infant is being fully or partially fed with infant formula , check with your pediatrician or other health care professional before giving the child vitamin D supplements .
Remember : any type of medication or dietary supplement can have adverse effects and must be taken according to the manufacturer 's directions .

Australian scientists warn that rising concentrations of greenhouse gases are dramatically changing the way oceans function .
Many studies often overlook the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems because of their complexity .
But in a paper published today , a leading Australian marine scientist has pulled together research from the past 10 years , which he says paints a grim picture .
The Global Change Institute director at the University of Queensland , Professor Ove Hoegh - Guldberg , says the world is seeing a decline in major ocean ecosystems like kelp forests and coral reefs .
Along with a US colleague , Professor Hoegh - Guldberg says his research has found fish are getting smaller , there are changes in the distribution of marine life and there are more frequent diseases in marine organisms .
" We are seeing changes in the way food chains work in the ocean , " he said .
" We are seeing massive declines in some sorts of organisms and if we continue down this pathway we get into conditions which have no analogue to anything we 've experienced . "
Professor Hoegh - Guldberg says water pollution , over - fishing , increased ocean acidification and rising temperatures are to blame .
" Over the past several thousand years , conditions have been remarkably stable in many parts of the planet , so life tends to adapt to those local conditions , " he said .
" Now when we take those conditions and change them rapidly as we have over the past 150 years , we are essentially expecting organisms to suddenly evolve , and of course , evolution takes a long amount of time . "
The research has been published today in the journal Science , which is devoting a section of the latest issue to the ocean .
The chief scientist at the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research , John Church , who wrote the editorial for the journal , says the changes to marine ecosystems will affect how the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide .
He says the changes have gone too far and society has no choice but to adapt to the altered oceans and climate .
" The ocean is a central part of the climate system .
They absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide , delaying the impact of climate change , and they influence both regional and global climate , " he said .
" If we are going to be able to adapt cost effectively rather than in response to major events , then we need to know what might happen into the future .
" Knowing these things in advance requires observing and understanding the global oceans . "
Image caption Bill Pertwee played Warden Hodges in the long - running sitcom
A statue of Captain Mainwaring from the BBC series Dad's Army has been unveiled in the Norfolk town where many of the classic sitcom 's scenes were filmed .
The life - size bronze cast of the character , played by Arthur Lowe , is seated on a bench by the Old Anchor Hotel in Thetford .
Bill Pertwee , who played Warden Hodges in the series , was among those who returned to the town for the unveiling .
Others cast members and writers are in Norfolk on Sunday for a Dad's Army Day .
Many of them stayed at the Old Anchor Hotel during the filming of the series in the 1960s and 1970s .
The statue was funded by the Friends of Dad's Army Museum , also based in Thetford .
The sitcom , about the Home Guard during World War II , was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft and first ran between 1968 and 1977 .
On May 21st Hollywood 's Fair Game , starring Noami Watts and Sean Penn , premiered at the Cannes Film Festival .
The movie is based on the lives of Joe Wilson and Valerie Wilson , whose secret identity as a CIA agent working undercover against nuclear proliferation under the name " Valerie Plame " was in 2003 exposed by syndicated columnist Robert Novak .
That stunning outing of Plame 's identity was widely perceived as ultimately partisan , anti-patriotic payback by Vice President Dick Cheney , Karl Rove , and the Administration of George W. Bush , for Former US Ambassador Joe Wilson 's opposition to the United States invasion of Iraq .
Joseph Wilson is author of the new book , The Politics of Truth : Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife 's CIA Identity : A Diplomat 's Memoir
In their Friday , May 28th letter to the Pacific Palisades Democratic Club Joseph and Valerie Wilson wrote that Military Religious Freedom Foundation founder and head Mikey Weinstein has placed his life on the line in an ongoing campaign that has " almost single handedly " helped to blunt illegal and unconstitutional coercive evangelizing in the US military .
Presumably that 's why the influential and affluent Pacific Palisades Democratic Club of Santa Monica , California had offered Weinstein the club 's Anne Froehlich Political Courage Award , which in the past has gone to heavy hitters such as Ron Kovic , Phil Donahue , Daniel Ellsberg , and Joseph and Valerie Wilson .
But the club has just withdrawn its offer .
The stated reason ?
- Mikey Weinstein served in the first Reagan Administration .
In response , in a gesture Hollywood can well understand , Valerie " Plame " Wilson and Joe Wilson are returning their Anne Froehlich Political Courage Awards to the Pacific Palisades Democratic Club - in an act of solidarity with their friend Mikey Weinstein .
Former US Ambassador Joe Wilson , who served in the both the Clinton and George Bush Sr. Presidential Administrations , has recently joined Weinstein 's MRFF Board of Directors .
Can Republicans exhibit " political courage " ?
According to Weinstein the club 's decision to pull the award is ludicrous and offensive , and a " slap in the face " that appears to question the courage of fighting men and women in the US military , many of whom are Republicans , whose freedom of religion interests Weinstein 's MRFF represents .
The nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation has worked with over 18,000 clients in the US military , states Weinstein , 96 % of whom are Christian .
Describing MRFF 's ongoing efforts to protect the right of active duty United States military personnel to hold whatever religious or philosophical beliefs they choose and be free from unwanted religious coercion , Mikey Weinstein explains , " It 's not a political spectrum right or left issue - it 's a Constitutional right or wrong issue . "
Twice nominated for a Nobel Peace prize for his MRFF work that was featured in a May 25 , 2010 Foreign Policy magazine story , Mikey says the Pacific Palisades Democratic Club 's courage award might as well now be called the " political cowardice award . "
He 's not alone in his outrage .
In an exceptionally hard - hitting letter to Mike Stryer , President of the Pacific Palisades Democratic Club , Joseph and Valerie Wilson wrote ,
" We find it outrageous that you would offer the same award to Mikey Weinstein , founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation and Nobel Peace Prize nominee , and then rescind the offer because he " served in the Reagan White House " .
Mikey has single handedly thwarted the efforts of the Fundamentalist Christian right to convert our armed forces from one that serves the constitution of the United States and the defense of our homeland , and includes citizens of all faiths , into one that fights wars in the name of a specific brand of extremely conservative Christianity , and deeply discriminates against those who observe other faiths ...
You might want to rethink the Political Courage Award program altogether .
You make a mockery of the term when your organization itself demonstrates such an absence of political courage by your actions .
Mikey , quite literally , has put his life on the line for separation of church and state , a principle articulated in our nation 's constitution , not in some party platform .
Presumably that was the reason you honored him in the first place .
He certainly remains worthy of that honor whatever his past or present politics might be . "
According to Mikey Weinstein he had already arranged for Hollywood celebrity and Democratic Party backer Ed Asner to speak at the award ceremony .
Asner called the decision a " circular firing squad , " and the decision to withdraw Weinstein 's award was so controversial within the Pacific Palisades Democratic Club itself that , according to Mikey Weinstein , Gary Bettman , who had headed a subcommittee presiding over the original decision to give Weinstein the award , resigned in protest .
Although Weinstein is a longtime registered Republican , he says he has voted in past elections for presidential candidates Bill Clinton , Al Gore , John Kerry and Barack Obama , explaining that " the [ Republican ] party left me , I did n't leave it . "
There 's plenty of evidence to back up Mikey Weinstein 's suggestion of an ideological sea change within the GOP over the past several decades .
A 2000 survey by academics Kimberly H. Conger and John C. Green , commissioned by Campaign & Elections Inc. and published in 2002 , determined that by the year 2000 the religious right had achieved " a strong position in 18 state Republican parties , " and a moderate level of influence within GOP party structures in 26 US states , twice as many as when the same Campaign & Elections Inc. - sponsored survey was done in 1994 .
In a 1994 interview with the Washington Post , 1964 presidential candidate Barry Goldwater , once accorded the stature of an arch - conservative , had harsh words for the rising religious right faction within the GOP :
" When you say ' radical right ' today , I think of these moneymaking ventures by fellows like Pat Robertson and others who are trying to take the Republican Party away from the Republican Party , and make a religious organization out of it .
If that ever happens , kiss politics goodbye . "
Does anything transcend the current Republican / Democratic ideological divide in American politics ?
As Joe and Valerie Wilson 's letter admonished the Pacific Palisades Democratic Club ,

When Guillermo del Toro vacated the directing chair on two installments of The Hobbit , the prospect of Peter Jackson taking over was labeled a near impossibility by his camp .
That seemed to be contradicted a day later by Jackson ’s own comments to a New Zealand newspaper when he said “ If that ’s what I have to do to protect Warner Brothers ’ investment , then obviously that ’s one angle which I ’ll explore . ”
Is Jackson easing his way into the job ?
According to his manager , Ken Kamins , nothing has changed .
Jackson ’s film commitments are real , though he has n’t told us yet what they are , and Kamins maintains efforts are underway in New Zealand right now to find another director who ’ll keep the project on track to start production in late 2010 or early 2011 .
Per Kamins : “ When Peter says that directing himself is one angle he ’d explore if he had to , that means , if we ca n’t find another director who is right for the films that everyone can agree on , and , if at that time , the other studios involved in his other projects would relieve him of his obligations . ' ”
I will be surprised if Jackson does n’t direct , it solves too many problems for it not to happen .
He co-wrote the films and is fully staked creatively .
Based on the job he did on The Lord of the Rings , nobody does Middle Earth better and it would be daunting to try .
Many of the big directors who could pull it off are booked , like Alfonso Cuaron ( the 3D space film Gravity with Robert Downey Jr. ) Bryan Singer ( directing Jack the Giant Killer early next year and producing X - Men : First Class this fall ) or Sam Raimi ( World of Warcraft , plus why would he want to re-engage when MGM / New Line originally chose del Toro over him ? ) .
If they enlist a hot newcomer for such a gargantuan creative task , Jackson would be so tied up in a mentoring role that he might as well direct himself .

BP 's motto might as well have been : " Safety first , except when it comes to everything else . "
NYT :
Internal BP documents , including an e-mail message calling the well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon a “ nightmare , ” show a pattern of risky choices made to save time and money in the weeks before the disastrous April 20 blowout , according to a letter sent to the oil company by the leaders of a House committee on Monday .
The leaders of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce cited five areas in which the company had made decisions that “ increased the danger of a catastrophic well , ” including the choice for the design of the well , preparations for and tests of the cement job and assurances that the well was properly sealed on the top .
Taken together , the documents offer the strongest case yet that BP bears much of the responsibility for the catastrophic explosion that killed 11 workers and the still - unchecked leaking of millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
Among the decisions by BP that led to the disaster :
BP saved $ 7 to $ 10 million by using a cheaper -- but less reliable -- method to complete the well casing .
The so - called " tapered string " meant the well had less capacity to resist upward pressure caused by gas bubbles .
BP ignored advice from Halliburton to deploy devices that would have given the well additional stability because they would have taken too long -- 10 hours -- to install .
BP did not fully circulate drilling mud which would have created better conditions for doing cement work .
The reason : fully circulating the drilling mud would have taken 12 hours .
BP did not run a comprehensive test on the cementing job even though its own engineers had grave concerns about the quality of the cement work .
Again , the reason was time : the test would have taken 12 hours .
Clearly , BP and its employees were optimizing their decisions around short - term goals .
They were willing to take huge risks to achieve near - term objectives and were n't particularly concerned with potential downsides .
In this respect , they were operating very much like the traders at AIG who took bigger and bigger bets until they brought the house down .
Of course , every time the AIG traders made a bet , they pocketed some of the proceeds , and when they brought the house down , the government was their to prop them back up .
In recent days , BP has tried to follow in Wall Street 's footsteps by positioning itself as " too big to fail , " arguing that pensioners in Great Britain depend on its dividends , and saying that if it goes bankrupt , it wo n't be able to pay any damage claims .
That line of reasoning is nonsense .
Sure , if we go easy on BP they can pay a big dividend .
But the notion that they will pay more in damages if we do n't ask them to cover the cost of all the damages that they have inflicted is bizarre , at best .
Worse , going easy on BP would set a precedent that what they did was acceptable , a simple " accident " as Rand Paul would put it .
If we want to prevent future disasters like this , we must hold BP accountable , forcing them to pay every dime they owe and to face punishment for whatever laws they may have broken .
The goal is n't to put BP out of business , but if holding them accountable puts them out of business , so what ?
Other oil companies will come in and fill the market void , and they 'll do so with the full knowledge that if they screw up like BP , they 'll face the same consequences .
To reduce the risk of future disasters , there 's no question that we need to improve regulation and to develop alternatives to oil , but BP must also suffer the consequences of its actions .
For the most part , the Administration is now saying all the right things , and tonight 's Oval Office address should be no different , but the real test will be in the coming months : will BP be forced to pay , or will they be allowed to walk away ?
Heat released from the Arctic in ice free areas and areas with thin ice has changed wind patterns , driving cold Arctic air towards Japan .
Last January
I explained December , 2009 's bizarre weather .
Negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation
These regional contrasts in temperature anomalies resulted from a strongly negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) .
The AO is a natural pattern of climate variability .
It consists of opposing patterns of atmospheric pressure between the polar regions and middle latitudes .
The positive phase of the AO exists when pressures are lower than normal over the Arctic , and higher than normal in middle latitude .
In the negative phase , the opposite is true ; pressures are higher than normal over the Arctic and lower than normal in middle latitudes .
The negative and positive phases of the AO set up opposing temperature patterns .
With the AO in its negative phase this season , the Arctic is warmer than average , while parts of the middle latitudes are colder than normal .
The phase of the AO also affects patterns of precipitation , especially over Europe .
The phase of the AO is described in terms of an index value .
In December 2009 the AO index value was - 3.41 , the most negative value since at least 1950 , according to data from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center .
A number of climate scientists think that a tipping point was passed in 2005 .
The changes in the Arctic are now irreversible , he ( Overland ) said .
" This is a very big change for the entire planet , " said David Barber , an Arctic climatologist at the University of Manitoba in Canada .
The planet 's cold polar regions are crucial drivers of Earth 's weather and climate .
......
The winter of 2005 - 6 was the coldest in 50 years in Japan and eastern Eurasia , reported Meiji Honda , a senior scientist with the Climate Diagnosis Group at Japan 's Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology .
Honda 's studies show that the air over the Arctic was quite warm in the fall of 2005 , which altered normal wind patterns , pushing the jet stream further south and bringing arctic cold to much of Eurasia and Japan .
He also documented the same mechanism for the colder winters of 2007 - 8 and 2009 - 10 , he told participants .
In eastern North America , the same conditions of 2007 - 8 produced increased precipitation and colder temperatures in the winter .
As the sea ice declines , big impacts are likely to be seen in this region , said Sara Strey of the University of Illinois .
Reduced sea ice this fall warmed the Arctic , weakening the Arctic 's atmospheric circulation .
The warming may explain this December 's record low Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) index .
Note that before the recent strong decline in sea ice levels beginning in 2005 , AO index levels were high .
The Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) is based on seal level pressure differences ( now measured by satellite for the 1000 mb height ) .
( See : http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/... )
" The AO index describes the relative intensity of a semipermanent low - pressure center over the North Pole .
A band of upper - level winds circulates around this center , forming a vortex .
When the AO index is positive and the vortex intense , the winds tighten like a noose around the North Pole , locking cold air in place .
A negative AO and weak vortex ... allow intrusions of cold air to plunge southward into North America , Europe , and Asia .
Sea surface temperature changes over 58 years show that reduced sea ice in the Arctic is associated with increased flow of warm water into the Labrador sea and Arctic ocean .
It appears that the Gulf Stream and the global thermohaline circulation is being enhanced by increased overturning of dense salty water in the Labrador sea and the far north Atlantic .
Linear trend in sea surface temperature based on the December–January –February ( DJF ) seasonal mean for the 1950 – 2008 period .
Units are in Deg C /58 - years .
Increasing sea surface temperatures are increasing in the tropical Indian ocean and western Pacific while the eastern Pacific is cooling because of increased upwelling of cool midlevel water .
It 's well established that weaker high pressure in the mid-Atlantic ( the Azores high ) is associated with warmer water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic .
This spring 's weak Azores high is one of the factors in Klotzbach and Gray 's forecast of an intense hurricane season this year .
Another factor in our forecast increase is the weaker - than - normal Azores High that prevailed during April - May .
Weaker high pressure typically results in weaker trade winds that are commonly associated with more active hurricane seasons .
Anomalous low - level wind ( ms - 1 ) observed during April - May 2010 .
Westerly anomalies were observed over the tropical Atlantic , indicating a reduction in the easterly trade winds .
Weaker trades typically warm the tropical Atlantic .
Because Atlantic hurricane activity is highly variable while the scientific record of hurricanes is short , the relationship between climate change and Atlantic basin hurricane activity has been hotly debated by hurricane experts and climatologists .
Professor Michael Mann has examined geologic evidence of hurricane overwash in the sedimentary record to supplement the short historical record .
Atlantic tropical cyclone activity , as measured by annual storm counts , reached anomalous levels over the past decade .
The short nature of the historical record and potential issues with its reliability in earlier decades , however , has prompted an ongoing debate regarding the reality and significance of the recent rise .
Here we place recent activity in a longer - term context by comparing two independent estimates of tropical cyclone activity over the past 1,500 years .
The first estimate is based on a composite of regional sedimentary evidence of landfalling hurricanes , while the second estimate uses a previously published statistical model of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity driven by proxy reconstructions of past climate changes .
Both approaches yield consistent evidence of a peak in Atlantic tropical cyclone activity during medieval times ( around AD 1000 ) followed by a subsequent lull in activity .
The statistical model indicates that the medieval peak , which rivals or even exceeds ( within uncertainties ) recent levels of activity , results from the reinforcing effects of La - Nin˜a - like climate conditions and relative tropical Atlantic warmth .
Note that increasing warmth in the tropical Atlantic and La Nina like cooling in the eastern Pacific is exactly what has been observed over the past 58 years .
The same tropical sea surface pattern that caused the increase in Atlantic hurricane activity in the Medieval warm period is being observed today .
In a related paper in 2007 Sabetelli and Mann analyzed how 3 climate state variables affect the number of hurricanes in the north Atlantic .
Time Series ( 1870 -2004 ) of ( a ) annual Atlantic TC counts , ( b ) MDR ASO SST time series ,
( c) Nin˜o3.4 DJF SST index , and ( d ) NAO DJFM SLP index .
Red ( blue ) indicates positive ( negative ) anomalies in TC counts and Hurricane - favorable ( unfavorable ) conditions in the three indices ( MDR SST , Nin˜o3.4 and NAO ) .
Note that year convention applies to the ‘ D ’ in DJF and DJFM for both ‘ c ’ and ‘ d ’ .
They found that the variables El Nin˜o / Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) in August - October , Sea Surface Temperatures ( SST ) over the main development region ( ‘ MDR ’ : 6-18N , 20 -60W ) , and the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) accounted for virtually all non random correlations with hurricane counts .
The Arctic oscillation is directly positively correlated with the NAO .
Some climate scientists consider the AO and the NAO to be the same thing .
If the loss of Arctic sea ice caused this winter 's extremely low AO levels it is also contributed to warming the tropical Atlantic by reducing the strength of the Azores high , weakening the trade winds and making the NAO strongly negative .
Based on the statistical methods developed in the 2007 paper Mann is predicting a near record hurricane season this year .
The prediction is for 23.4 +/- 4.8 total named storms , which corresponds to between 19 and 28 storms with a best estimate of 23 named storms .
This prediction was made using the statistical model of Sabbatelli and Mann ( 2007 , see PDF here ) , including the corrections for the historical undercount of events ( Mann et al. , 2007 , see PDF here ) .
The basis of this forecast is the assumption that the current extremely warm sea surface temperature ( SST ) anomaly ( 1.34 C from NOAA ’s Coral Reef Watch ) , ( Today 's SST anomalies inserted by author )
in the Main Development Region ( MDR ) in the North Atlantic will persist throughout the 2010 hurricane season .
It also takes into account current model predictions of near - neutral or slight La Nina conditions during boreal Fall / Winter 2010 ( see ENSO predictions here ) .
Climatological mean conditions are assumed for the North Atlantic Oscillation ( NAO ) in Fall / Winter 2010 .
If the Arctic climate scientists quoted in this post are correct , then both this winters heavy east coast snows and this summer 's forecast intense hurricane season are related to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns caused by the melting of Arctic sea ice .
Sea ice is now so thin in much of the Arctic ocean that it is allowing much more heat to escape to the Atmosphere than it did 10 or 20 years ago .
The increasing amount of heat escaping from the Arctic ocean is changing atmospheric circulation patterns ( causing the strongly negative Arctic Oscillation index ) leading to harsher snowy east coast winters and more intense Atlantic basin hurricane seasons .
Rumours are rapidly gathering pace suggesting that Sony is looking to follow - up the success of its HD " remastering " of the God of War titles with a similar gaming double pack featuring the classic ICO and Shadow of the Colossus .
Digital Foundry took a good , long , hard look at the God of War Collection at the tail end of last year , comparing the original PlayStation 2 titles with the new 720p60 PS3 revisions , and came away supremely impressed .
Sony Santa Monica 's original PS2 art worked beautifully in high definition , and the improved performance level could only be a good thing .
We were also intrigued by the approach that the conversion team took .
Rather than attempt to run the game under emulation , Sony Santa Monica 's original C code was essentially ported over to create the new PS3 versions .
In our feature we compared the PS3 versions with the source PS2 titles , running not just on the original hardware but also on the PC via the open source PCSX2 emulator .
The result ?
The PC emulation turned out to be very , very close indeed to the HD remixes , proving that the conversion team had replaced no original in - game art , aside from the on - screen text and button graphics .
With that in mind , we decided to check out ICO and Shadow of the Colossus running on the same emulator in order to get some idea of how the original titles would scale up to high - definition resolutions .
The results were ... intriguing .
First up though , a word of warning .
Both ICO and Shadow of the Colossus 's technology exploits the PlayStation 2 in aspects that the emulator creators have still yet to fully implement in PCSX2 - so while the PC experience draws closer to the PS2 on both games with each successive release , it 's still not the absolutely precise carbon copy you might expect .
This is perhaps best exemplified by ICO .
While the software renderer is a close reproduction of the original game , the GPU - accelerated version still lacks the fog effects of the original game .
So to kick off with , here 's the ICO intro sequence captured with both software and hardware rendering - it 's easy to see where the HD emulation is off - beam , but at the same time , it is equally apparent that ICO 's artwork still has much more to give when liberated from the confines of standard definition .
Away from the external environments , emulation offers a far closer representation of the original game , and you can see that in effect in this cut -scene .
Texture detail and filtering are enormously improved , and there is a definite hint that any HD " remastering " of the game should be something quite special - even if the original art assets are used without any replacement , higher - resolution assets in place .
ICO 's core technology - especially in the use of bloom lighting and animation - is simply remarkable , but the SCE team 's next project , Shadow of the Colossus , saw them pushing the PlayStation 2 technology to absolute breaking point .
The engineers produced a close emulation of HDR lighting , tone - mapping and motion blur ( including per-object - wow ! ) .
Astonishingly the SCE team even mimicked something approximating the look of the kind of fur pixel shaders seen in PS3 titles like LittleBigPlanet .
Programmable pixel shaders were still in their infancy when Shadow of the Colossus was produced , and the PS2 hardware itself offers no support for them , so the inclusion of an equivalent effect within the game was all the more phenomenal .
The terrain streaming mechanics , the brilliant physics and the shadowing systems were remarkable for their time .
Indeed , Shadow of the Colossus even features character self - shadows and cloth simulation .
There 's also an outstanding implementation of volumetric fog , adding another layer of atmosphere and ambience to the game .
The downside ?
All of this remarkable technology comes at a cost .
The frame - rate in Shadow of the Colossus is , to put it very simply , very poor indeed by today 's standards .
Putting this to the test , we decided to go for the purest possible conditions : no launch PS3 hardware emulation here , we unearthed our vintage " fat " PS2 and ran the game directly at 480 p from component into one of our capture stations .
Hold onto your potatoes , this ride is rough !
Shadow of the Colossus runs with an uncapped frame - rate .
In very , very rare occasions , you may even hit 60FPS , but as the tests reveal , in its original form 15 to 20 FPS is the norm .
In the current era , where 30 is the standard , it 's surprising how much the gameplay is impacted , especially in terms of the controls which feel inconsistent , sloth - like and sluggish .
Adjusting for the additional lag in the controls proved to be a big ask , as some of the boneheaded platforming footage in the clip reveals .
So , the chance to bring the game to PS3 in the form of an HD " remastering " offers new opportunities : not just in unlocking the detail of the original art , but also in bringing some kind of consistency to the frame - rate .
Hopefully , we would n't just be seeing an improvement to the definition of the game 's visuals , but also in terms of temporal resolution too : smoother gameplay and with it hugely improved , consistent , controller response .
720p60 ?
Yes please , but we'd take a rock - solid , v-locked 720p30 .
Intriguingly , with the latest version of the PCSX2 emulator , Shadow of the Colossus looks very close to the PS2 original .
Sure , there 's a small ghosting / offset problem and the odd glitch in the intro , and in our gameplay video , some of the bloom appears to be a touch overwhelming compared to the original , but we reckon that these videos give a good insight into how an HD SotC would look ... first up , here 's the intro :
And now , the same initial confrontation with the first colossus that we featured in the performance analysis , but this time presented in full high definition .
Note that in these videos , not only are we seeing a vastly increased resolution but we 're also showing the game locked at 30 frames per second .
Assuming the HD remix rumours are true , it will be very interesting to see how the game creators roll with any potential HD versions of these classic games .
We 've taken the emulation approach to showing how the games could look in high definition , but assuming the developers port the code across as opposed to emulating it , all manner of possibilities open up : Shadow of the Colossus ' LOD system , for example , could be tweaked so that the extra processing power of PS3 gives us the full detail models at all times .
Porting also opens up the opportunity to replace any art that does n't quite make the grade when rendered in high - def , although it would be surprising if this happens based on our tests .
The core art is more than up to the task at hand .
So yes , we 're genuinely fascinated at how this story plays out .
We 'll let you know !
I enjoyed Mike Trick ’s post on discounts and data mining last week .
It got me thinking about discounts and coupons .
This post piggy - backs on Mike ’s post about my disappointment in discounts .
I love coupons of all kinds .
I am someone who buys very little without a discount ( My frugality is like a blessing and a curse ) .
To get my business , you had better send me a coupon !
Since the fall , I have been overwhelmed with discounts and coupons for the first time in my life .
With the economic downturn , I noticed that more stores offered store coupons than ever before .
The coupon proliferation was out of control .
Store coupon deals became increasingly lucrative , and sadly , I had to throw away many coupons that I normally would have used during the Christmas season ( I only can do so much shopping , and I usually finish my Christmas shopping early ) .
Just keeping on top of my coupon organizing was a chore –I did n’t have time to cut and prune coupons .
Like Mike , I was truly surprised that so few stores have been taking advantage of data mining to offer personalized coupons .
There is a real opportunity there , particularly since many consumers have many loyalty cards ( I have eleven on my key chain ) .
Due to the proliferation of store coupons in the last year , I throw away most regular , non - data - mined coupons since I do not have time to organize them .
These stores that make the loyalty cards have a lot of data and they are n’t really using it effectively .
Major chains have been dropping like flies .
Is it really easier to succumb to Chapter 11 than figure out how to do data mining ?
There are exceptions .
Kroger is truly a customized coupon superstar .
I ca n’t think of anyone else in the same league .
They mail me a pack of customized coupons about every month or two , based on products purchased on my store rewards card .
Kroger helps me save on products that I buy anyway , since I assume they ’d rather have me buy them at Kroger than elsewhere .
Last month , Kroger included coupons for hummus and baby carrots in their coupon pack .
I timed it right and bought both items for a quarter .
I picked up a few other items with my hummus ( hummus is like my gateway drug ) .
It ’s not a well - kept secret , but not everyone has figured it out .
Other brick and mortar stores have offered some personalized coupons that print out with receipts .
These systems seem to perform data mining by tracking credit card numbers .
I ’ve have one or two good personalized Target coupons in the past year but nothing else that I remember .
Kroger is particularly notable , since the Richmond supermarket Ukrops changed ownership , which has really shaken up the local supermarket scene .
It ’s a free for all here .
All of the supermarket chains offer great deals now since they have a lot to gain ( or lose ) .
And grocery shopping is essentially a zero - sum game .
Consumers can do away with luxuries , but they are going to buy groceries despite the bad economy ( this is n’t completely accurate , since consumers are doing away with luxury groceries ) .
One store ’s loss is another store ’s gain .
But so far , Richmond grocery store chains have mainly offered generic deals that are either in the ad or mailed to everyone .
The personalized coupons bring me into the store .
As a result , I still do nearly all of my shopping at Kroger .
I ’m not the only Kroger convert , and I suspect that Kroger is beating their competitors with data - mining .
Personalized coupons and discounts are n’t really rocket science .
But maybe they are , since I so rarely encounter effective , personalized coupons that take advantage of data mining .
Tell me about your personalized coupon experiences !

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
With the U.S. drowning in a monstrous $ 13 trillion national debt , it 's clear we need to consider any and all options to stem the tide .
This may be an idea worth taking a look at ... then again , maybe not .
Bill Gates
A group of 51 German millionaires and billionaires is volunteering to give up 10 percent of their income for 10 years to help with that country 's finances .
CNBC reports that these uber - wealthy Germans founded a " Club of the Wealthy " ... and proposed the so - called " rich tax " to Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Germany , like much of Europe , is in the midst of tightening its fiscal belt ... as the country debates an upcoming $ 80 billion Euro austerity package .
It 's a noble gesture , but so far there are only 50 German millionaires on board ... out of an estimated 800,000 .
The total number of millionaires represents about one percent of Germany 's population ; similar to the ratio of millionaires here in the U.S.
Makes you wonder how many American millionaires would be willing to do the same .
Speaking of America 's very rich - two of the wealthiest are calling on their fellow billionaires to give away half of their wealth for charity during their lifetimes or after they die .
As first reported in Fortune Magazine , Warren Buffett and Bill Gates want the 400 richest people in the U.S. to give $ 600 billion to philanthropy and charity .
Their goal is to create an expectation that the rich should give away a big part of their wealth to better society .
Here ’s my question to you :
Would a voluntary millionaire 's tax work in the U.S. ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Michael in Alexandria , Virginia writes :
No .
Neither does cutting taxes and expecting millionaires to give their tax savings to charity ( rather than buying companies ) .
If volunteerism worked as touted , the coffers of every charity helping the poor would be bursting , given that tax rates are at their lowest in more than half a century .
T. in Memphis , Tennessee writes :
Jack , Instead of figuring out how to get more money from its citizens , the government should figure out how to effectively spend the money it already has .
In other words , if you or I spent money without some sort of balanced budget , sooner or later no one would loan us any more ... our credit score would be so low it would n't tip the scale .
A large portion of the deficit is the interest on loans from foreign countries .
This is insane .
Rob writes :
The wealthy already pay more than their fair share in taxes .
If we would adopt a flat tax system , then this idea would at least have legs .
Chandra in Las Vegas writes :
No and nor should it .
I would n't trust the government to use the money responsibly and it still would n't be enough for them , it never will .
The entitlement programs currently on the books have gotten so out of control that many people become dependent on them and are on them for life .
When you pay someone to do nothing , that 's what they 'll do .
Mike in Anaheim , California writes :
Probably not , Jack .
Most millionaires got to that lofty place in life because they had the good fortune to afford a truckload of tax accountants to help them avoid paying their fair share in taxes .
Why would any of them now volunteer to pay more ?
Ben writes :
Considering 90 % of the wealth is with 1 % of the population , yes – tax them .
They should be grateful we 're not tarring and feathering them , the bunch of exploitative unscrupulous thieves .
There are many historical novels about submarines during World War II and several of which are excellent .
Run Silent , Run Deep , written by Edward Latimer Beach , Jr. , who was a highly - decorated United States Navy submarine officer , is one of the best ever written .
This book , which was also filmed , has been referred to by some as “ the Holy Grail of submarine novels ” , “ an American equivalent of Das Boot ” and “ a landmark novel ” .
The book was written by Beach while he served as Naval Aide to President Eisenhower , and first published in 1955 .
It quickly became a bestseller .
The current edition of this book , which includes an interesting introduction by Edward P. Stafford , is published by the Naval Institute Press as part of the Classics of Naval Literature series .
The story begins shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor .
An American submarine captain , Edward “ Rich ” Richardson is given a new boat – Walrus – with orders to destroy Japanese shipping in the Pacific .
His executive officer and his former best friend , Jim Bledsoe , is resentful because Richardson had felt it necessary to fail him after Bledsoe acted in a reckless manner during his test for qualification for command after he had made several mistakes and nearly sunk their boat .
Walrus ’s first patrol is tough .
Just outside of “ Area Seven ” ( the Bungo Suido ) , Walrus has its first encounter with “ Bungo Pete , ” an elusive Japanese destroyer commander , Captain Tateo Nakame , who is responsible for a series of sinkings of American submarines and who seems to know the names of his victims .
After a severe depth charge attack , Richardson is forced to abort to Midway .
After a patrol near the Aleutian Islands , Richardson learns that “ Bungo Pete ” has claimed three more American submarines .
Walrus returns to The Bungo Suido and conducts an amazing surface attack on a Japanese convoy during nighttime .
As before , Bungo Pete arrives on the scene with his guns blazing , and Richardson is wounded and nearly killed by Japanese shellfire .
Richardson is forced to stay ashore to rehabilitate and convinces his superiors that Jim Bledsoe now is ready for command .
Accordingly , Jim is promoted to Captain of the Walrus and goes on to become one of the most successful captains of the war .
Edward L. Beach Jr .
Edward L. Beach Jr.
While rehabilitating for several months in Pearl Harbor , Richardson played a major part in an effort to correct severe reliability problems in the Mk 14 torpedo ’s exploder .
In the meantime , Bungo Pete is still on the loose and has sunk more submarines , including Jim Bledsoe ’s and Richardson ’s Walrus .
Richardson begs to be given command and sent to Area Seven to take care of Bungo Pete .
He wants revenge , and he feels that he knows Bungo Pete well enough to be able to deal with him .
He is given command of the Eel , one of the most modern submarines in the US Navy , and returns to Area Seven .
The battle that ensues between the Eel and Bungo Pete ’s special anti-submarine warfare group is epic .
Naval fiction about submarines can hardly get better than this .
It has excellent descriptions of equipment , life onboard , tactics , and so forth .
The characters are interesting too , and the writing is to the point and good .
Run Silent , Run Deep is a very compelling and believable book , and the writing takes the reader into the minds , souls , and terror of the crew of a submarine at war .
Run Silent , Run Deep really is a landmark novel , and also very entertaining and suspenseful .
I loved it !
To usher in the weekend we have a blistering attack on early - science fiction fandom from an unlikely source : science fiction novelist Robert Heinlein .
In a letter to super - fan Forrest Ackerman , written during the final months of World War II , Heinlein begins by offering his condolences following the death of Ackerman ’s brother whilst serving his country , then proceeds to passionately condemn the inaction of most fans – the ‘ slackers ’ , ‘ bastards ’ , even ‘ neurotic , selfish , childish , insensitive and unimaginative , vicious bunch of jerks ’ – during the war , and sneer at their supposed collective superiority complex ( see ‘ Fans are slans ‘ ) .
A truly fascinating letter .

Dear Forry ,
Our hearts are sore at your loss and there is nothing we can say to relieve your personal anguish .
Your brother died a noble and heroic death .
It is my belief that he did in fact die to make a better world ; it is for us who live on to see to it that a better world is accomplished .
I am heartened that you regard it as your duty to follow through on his unfinished work .
I will not be able to supply an article for the fan publication you propose to publish in his memory .
I dislike to have to tell you that I will not be writing for you , under the circumstances , and I feel that you are entitled to a full explanation .
Forry , every day I am writing things which are , literally , dedicated to Alden , and to the many , many others who have died and are dying .
My daily writings are dedicated to getting the war won quicker with the fewest number of deaths of our own .
My writings are laboratory instructions , engineering reports , letters to manufacturers , and other things having to do with the tedious work of scientific research for war .
It takes up all of my energy and all of my imagination and I have none left over for other matters .
If I had any energy left over , I would know that I was not doing all that I could do and I would then , in truth , be disloyal to your brother ’s memory .
( I have , not a belief , not a conviction , but a knowledge of personal survival .
You said on your post card that you wanted to discuss the matter with us someday .
We will be honored to do so . )
Forry , you have sought my advice on matters which worried you in the past .
You have not sought my advice in this matter , but I am going to presume on our old friendship to offer you some .
I know that you are solemn in your intention to see to it that Alden ’s sacrifice does not become meaningless .
I am unable to believe that fan activity and fan publications can have anything to do with such intent .
I have read the fan publications you have sent me and , with rare exceptions , I find myself utterly disgusted with the way the active fans have met the trial of this war .
By the fan mags I learn that many of these persons , who are readily self - congratulatory on their superiority to ordinary people — so many , many of these “ fans ” have done nothing whatsoever to help out .
Many of them are neither in the army nor in war work .
Many have found this a golden opportunity to make money during a war boom — by writing , by commercial photography , through the movies , or by other worthless activities — worthless when compared with what your brother Alden was doing .
These bastards let your brother die , Forry , and did not lift a hand to help him .
I mean that literally .
The war in Europe would have been over if all the slackers in this country had been trying to help out — would have been over before the date on which your brother died .
The slackers are collectively and individually personally responsible for the death of Alden .
And a large percent of fans are among those slackers .
Alden ’s blood is on their hands .
As for persons who are guilty not merely by sins of omission but who actively threw their weight against us , like that traitorous little bastard Jocquel , I have no words to describe them .
It is a bitter thing that he should be alive while your brother is dead .
It would be well for him to stay out of my sight when this is over .
As for any of them , unless they have fought this war in every way they could to the best of their ability , I will not meet with them socially when this is over .
I will not shake hands , speak , sit down , nor eat with them .
I am not alone in this opinion .
You will find that my opinion is shared by Carnell and by Franklyn Brady .
You will find it shared by many others of the grown - ups who know that a war is going on and know that it is not a game nor a joke nor a piece of fiction but a tragic business in which men like your brother Alden meet their deaths , too young and too horribly .
Forry , I want you to dedicate yourself to Alden ’s memory .
To be faithful to him we now have two jobs to do .
The first is to win this war as quickly as possible .
You can do that by volunteering for something more useful than you are now doing .
General Lear has said that he needs thousands of limited - duty clerks and such behind the lines in Europe to release able - bodied men for action .
Or , perhaps , a re-examination will find you no longer limited in duty .
In either case a Wac can edit your camp paper .
The second job is , now and after the war , to see to it that it shall not happen again .
There are many ways to do that and each must select his own — political activity of every sort , writing intended to stir people up , the willingness to combat race hatred , discrimination , limitations of civil liberty , generalized hates of every sort , whenever and wherever they show up .
But I am damn well sure that fan activity is not the way to serve Alden ’s memory .
Fandom has had a chance to prove itself and it has failed .
I find the mags crowded with escapism and other nonsense ; I find that fans now call themselves “ Slans ” ( God save us ! ) on many occasions .
I find many other evidences of group paranoia and of psychotic infantilism — and unwillingness to face up to adult problems and to cope with them .
Forry , you may write the most inspiring things for a better world possible ; if you direct them to this group , they will be worthless in carrying on with Alden ’s unfinished work , for they will fall on sterile ground .
I am not generalizing ; there are a few adults among them and there was a fair percentage before the war .
I do not indict any who are carrying their load .
But there are many ( and you know that I am right ) who are doing nothing and did nothing to save your brother ’s life .
A bunch of neurotic , selfish , childish , insensitive and unimaginative , vicious bunch of jerks !
It is time you quit associating with them and tackled the problems of the real world .
We are very fond of you , Forry .
You are a fine and gentle soul .
This is a very difficult letter to write ; if I did not think you were worth it , I would not make the effort .
This letter is for your eyes only ; the ideas in it you are free to use but the letter is for you only .
I am very sorry your brother was killed ;
You may be sure that Leslyn and I will be faithful to his memory with all our strength .
Love ,
( Signed , ‘ Bob ’ )

There are a lot of lies and half truths .
No one will care .
The article has enough valid points that people wo n’t check up on them .
That said , here ’s my attempts to correct the lies .
Lie Â # 1 : “ Adobeâ€™s Flash products are 100 % proprietary . ”
The Flash IDE , yes .
Â The Flash Player , no .
Â
Here is a list of technologies open sourced / published by Macromedia / Adobe that are in the Flash Player ecosystem :
ActionScript 3 runtime , called Tamarin .
Â Given to Mozilla to hopefully utilize in future browsers .
RTMP ( and it ’s ilk ) , the protocol for real - time video & audio streaming as well as data ( AMF ) .
Â
Yes , many want “ more ” open sourced .
Â Red5 and Wowza seem to be doing just fine with what is there currently .
The SWF format itself , which is what Flash Player plays / runs , has most of it ’s spec published in case you want to generate SWF files .
This street goes both ways , too .
Â Macromedia / Adobe has adopted open source technologies into Flash Player with the hopes of embracing standards , not just the de-facto ones .
ActionScript 1 , 2 , and 3 are all based on EMCAScript .
Â
Yes , it ’s not as compliant as many would like .
Â
Additionally , Adobe did participate in many ECMA Script discussions / debates .
Â
Yes , 4 did n’t turn out so well for Adobe .
The XML parsing is based on E4X , ECMA Script for XML .
I ’m not saying Adobe ’s open sourced a lot of the Flash Player .
Â
There ’s open source , there ’s published , and then there is open source .
Regarding their products , he ’s wrong there too .
Â The Flex SDK , one of the biggest boosts for the Flash Platform in the past 4 years , is also open source ( yes , the real kind ) .
Â Most utilize Flex Builder , built on top of the open source Eclipse .
Using a blanket statement saying Adobe ’s Flash products are 100 % Â proprietary Â is a lie .
Â
It paints an incorrect & negative picture over all the wonderful things Macromedia / Adobe have done in open source around their products .
Lie # 2 : “ HTML5 being adopted by Google ”
Google created the first browser to fully integrate plugins , and continues to work with Adobe to do so .
Â Google also utilizes Flash Player in Gmail for both file uploading , and Â configuring Â your web cam .
Â Google utilizes Flash Player in their online maps product for street view .
Â Google Finance utilizes Flash Player for a lot of their charts .
Â
Their video site , YouTube , utilizes Flash Player for their videos .
Google did n’t start out with Flash .
Â
They started with text , AJAX , and later Flash .
Â
They ’ve done a lot of forays into HTML5 , yes , and will continue to do so .
Â Saying they are “ adopting ” it , and only it and not Flash Player , is incorrect .
Lie # 3 : “ … 75 % of video on the web is in Flash .
What they donâ€™t say is that almost all this video is also available in a more modern format , H.264 , and viewable on iPhones , iPods and iPads … ”
Incorrect . Â
If a video is H264 , that does n’t mean it can play on the iPhone .
Â
If you look at the iPhone specs , you ’ll see the only support a subset of what H264 offers , specifically 2 major components to quality video : Using a maximum of the Baseline profile , with Simple for higher bitrates / resolutions , as well as 2.5 for maximum ( ish ) bitrate .
Not all H264 videos conform to these specs .
Â YouTube converted a lot of their Spark ( Flash 6/7 ) videos to H264 to support iPhone because there was money to be gained in the large investment .
Â Even so , not all YouTube videos work on the iPhone , in part because of the aforementioned reasons .
Â
There is a reason why when you upload a H264 video to YouTube , they ’ll often re-encode it .
I ’ve been in web video for 7 years .
Â Getting video to work in the browser is the easy part .
Â Setting up video encoding farms to support thousands / millions of users is not .
Â
It ’s hard and expensive .
Â
Not everyone has the resources ( read money and time ) Google has , and that ’s why companies like Brightcove are trying toÂ capitalizeÂ on this problem .
MostÂ importantly , HTML5 currently has no universal DRM solution .
Â
That is why Flash Player ’s RTMPE , and soon HTTP Streaming via Project Zeri , are the de-facto standard today .
Â
Those who deploy video content they either own or license the rights to will not utilize HTML5 because it cannot be protected .
Â
There is a reason you rent videos in iTunes using their < strike > ACC </ strike > MP4 format vs. straight H264 .
Â Legally , those videos CANNOT be utilized via HTML5 .
Also , Hulu.com and others are n’t using H264 , they ’re using On2’s VP6 .
Lie # 4 : “ users arenâ€™t missing much video . ”
Every time a user see ’s a blue lego instead of the video they wanted to see , they are missing a video .
Â
There were so many people seeing the blue lego , including Steve Jobs himself on stage demoing the iPad , that they removed the blue lego as a PR effort to make it seem like there was something wrong with the website itself vs. the iPhone / iPad .
… thankfully , Grant Skinner added it back .
Lie # 5 : “ … Flash has recently added support for H.264 … ”
Incorrect . Â
It ’s been there since August of 2007 .
Â
That ’s almost 3 years .
Â
That ’s a long time in technology .
Lie # 6 : “ … must be run in software … ”
Not entirely correct .
Â Apple FINALLY gave Adobe and others access to hardware for desktop systems , which Adobe has recently utilized .
Â
The # 1 criticism for Mac ’s & Flash video is lack of hardware acceleration .
Â
This move by Apple will go a long way to improving video experiences , not just for Flash , for browser based video .
Â Meaning , cooler Macs and more battery life .
For mobile , Safari / WebKit is using H264 hardware decoding just fine .
Â
They just wo n’t expose it , forcing yet again , Flash to utilize a sub par video experience for iPhone ( having to launch a URL to utilize the iPhone ’s default video player vs. incorporating the video into the experience ) .
Lie # 7 : “ … When websites re-encode their videos using H.264 , they can offer them without using Flash at all … ”
See # 3 . Â Also , not all Flash video is just a video block on a page .
Â Some are immersive experiences , games , or involved in compositing with other objects ( alpha channels , easier particle systems , etc ) .
Â HTML5 does not currently support some of these features .
Finally , not all video is pre-recorded and progressive .
Â Live and streamed events are currently done using Flash Player and Silverlight .
Â
Yes , I ’ve seen systems that can do live H264 via progressive with only seconds latency over CDN ’s , regardless , they are n’t what ’s being used en masse today .
Â
This includes DVR like functionality that both technologies offer , including Adative Streaming capabilities to ensure you can see un-interruptedÂ video regardless of your internet connections ’s integrity .
Lie # 8 : “ … Flash was designed for PCs using mice , not for touch screens using fingers … ”
Incorrect . Â
The whole reason Flash Player has continued to stay ahead of the curve is because Macromedia / Adobe innovates it .
Â
There are gesture & touch API ’s in the Flash Player ; I and many others have used them for the iPhone resulting in a 100 + apps on the App Store .
Lie # 9 : “ For example , many Flash websites rely on â€œrolloversâ€ , which pop up menus or other elements when the mouse arrow hovers over a specific spot . ”
Incorrect . Â
This was already discounted 2 months ago by Mike Chambers .
Â Additionally , I tested both MouseEvent .
CLICK , MouseEvent .
MOUSE_DOWN , and MouseEvent .ROLL_OVER , and all 3 worked just fine on my iPhone .
Â Additionally , I ’ve seen video of a Nexus One using the native Flash Player 10.1 that plays a Flex website I made just fine with no code changes to support touch .
Lie # 10 : “ Appleâ€™s revolutionary multi - touch interface doesnâ€™t use a mouse , and there is no concept of a rollover . ”
Incorrect . Â
There are roll over states for buttons on the iPhone / iPad because you can click / touch on something , which shows the roll over state , but then drag off to not trigger the up , thusÂ canceling Â your button click if you did n’t meant to touch something .
Â
Works the exact same way as a mouse does .
Lie # 11 : “ Most Flash websites will need to be rewritten to support touch - based devices . ”
Incorrect , see Mike Chambers ’ post in # 9 .
Lie # 12 : “ If developers need to rewrite their Flash websites , why not use modern technologies like HTML5 , Â CSSÂ and JavaScript ? ”
Those same JavaScript Developers need to do the same work Flash Developers need to do : Nothing .
If both wish to utilize Gesture or Touch events , then BOTH need to re-write / adjust their content to support these events .
Lie # 13 : “ The avalanche of media outlets offering their content for Appleâ€™s mobile devices demonstrates that Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content . ”
Incorrect .
Â See # 3 .
Â Media companies will have to create players like Netflix did to support those devices ; these are n’t HTML5 , they ’re Cocoa .
Half - Truth # 1 : “ Adobe was the last major third party developer to fully adopt Mac OS X . ”
iTunes , flagship Apple software product enabling the success of the iPod , selling over 1 billion songs , and empowering digital movie rentals , is n’t Cocoa .
Gruber , the same guy who Apple apparently used as an example of why Flash does n’t belong on the iPhone , was quoted , when referring to why Apple has n’t ported iTunes to Cocoa :
What really matters are features and user experience , not the developer technologies used to make them .
Conclusions
I agree with everything else the article says .
Â
While the spin is HTML5 is better than Flash , Apple wants you developing with Cocoa , not HTML5 ; that ’s where the money and good user experiences are .
Â
While many have said that the PR person responsible for writing that article is doing Apple a disservice , I disagree .
Â
Yes , they do loseÂ creditability Â writing that many lies , and yes , this just fuels the fire for many developers , not just Flash Devs , to focus on Android instead of iPhone .
However , iPhones and iPads still rock .
Â While Apple is “ only the 10th ” largest phone manufacturer , they are the only mobile platform people care about right now in the USA ( unless you ’re a pissed off Flash / Flex Dev ) .
Â
Their app store , combined with the user experience , is un-matched .
Me ? Â I ’m still trying to learn Cocoa so I too can participate in building applications for these wonderful devices ; devices whose sales wo n’t be hurt by that article .
Â
My colleagues in the industry ?
Â Most are heading towards Android along with Adobe .
Â
Those moonlighting in Flash & iPhone development simultaneously do n’t say much , beyond correcting & helping me with my Objective C knowledge on Twitter ( y’all rock ! ) .
… oh yeah , and someone cast Cure 2 on Adobe .
But the Obama administration refused to endorse a statement that singled out Israel , and it proposed a broader condemnation of the violence that would include the assault by passengers of the Israeli commandos as they landed on the deck of the ship .
As the wrangling continued late Monday night and in the early hours Tuesday , the two countries were trying to work out their differences on the wording , including whether to specify that the investigation should be conducted by outsiders , diplomats said .
While condemnation of Israel in the Security Council is not uncommon , the criticism at the emergency session called by Turkey and Lebanon was notable for both its vehemence and for the broad array of countries demanding an independent investigation into the decision to fire on civilians in what they described as a humanitarian mission .
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey , whose country ’s once close relations with Israel have deteriorated markedly since Israel ’s invasion of Gaza in 2009 , called the attack “ tantamount to banditry and piracy ; it is murder conducted by a state . ”
Noting that the ships were carrying items such as a playground equipment , cancer medicine and milk powder , he said that given the history of the Jews the Israelis should be more conscious than others of “ the dangers and inhumanity of ghettoes as the one we currently witness in occupied Gaza . ”
Gerard Araud , the French ambassador , said the death toll indicated “ there was disproportionate use of force and a level of violence which nothing justifies and which we condemn . ”
Nawaf Salam , the Lebanese ambassador , said even the laws of war require the delivery of humanitarian aid .
He started off with a nod to liberal opponents of the sonogram legislation , saying the bill “ places an inappropriate burden on women seeking to terminate a pregnancy . ”
Image Gov. Charlie Crist , running for the Senate as an independent , took a centrist approach .
Credit ... Joe Raedle / Getty Images
Mr. Crist then emphasized that his own personal views , which he has most recently described as “ pro-life , ” “ should not result in laws that unwisely expand the role of government . ”
That explanation , along with a mention of women ’s right to privacy , seemed aimed at Tea Party libertarians .
Finally , he said financial and medical measures that make it harder for women to end their pregnancies “ do not change hearts , which is the only true and effective way to ensure that a new life coming into the world is loved . ”
Compassionate conservatives and parents of all persuasions may be hard pressed to disagree .
Political opponents immediately pounced .
The law would have required doctors to perform ultrasounds and show and describe the image to patients unless they signed a refusal .
Abortion rights advocates praised the governor ’s veto .
But Kendrick Meek , the leading Democrat in the Senate race ( who favors abortion rights ) , told reporters that the veto was simply a cynical effort to gain traction in the campaign .
“ I think a lot of this has to do with political expedience , ” Mr. Meek said .

Do n't miss : 10 countries on the verge of a Demographic crisis >
The sovereign debt crisis in Greece had a brief respite when Euro - zone member countries and the IMF agreed on a € 110bn rescue package last week - end .
However , the financial markets wanted nothing of it , dragged the world stock markets lower and drove the Euro to its lowest level in 14 months .
Market sentiment is clearly against the Euro right now ; rumors of contagion and a possible eviction of Greece from the Euro - zone are increasingly coming to surface .
The scale of the violent protests against the planned austerity measures which include a freeze on government salaries , the elimination of the standard bonuses for government workers ( 13th and 14th months pay ) and an increase in the retirement age to 63 by 2014 seem completely out of whack considering the miserable state of the Greek government ’s finances .
The Greek crisis and the populist backlash are a wake - up call , not just for Greece and Europe but also for the US and most other developed nations .
The current government budget deficits and the overall debt burden may be frightening but they pale in comparison to the scale of unfunded liabilities for pensions and healthcare .
Temporary measures for bailouts and economic stimulus packages are one thing but without drastic measures , ongoing government deficits are simply not sustainable for the simple fact that people live longer and there are not nearly enough young people joining the work force to generate sufficient government revenues and to support the growing unfunded liabilities .
In my view , the root of the problem ( in addition to the obvious irresponsible spending habits of most government officials ) is demographic in nature ; the easiest way to hint at the scale of the predicament is to look at projected population charts .
If Greece has problems based on current demographics , the projections for 2050 look even more devastating .
The US projected demographics are not nearly as bad as Greece but the thought of having 13 % of men and 17 % of women over the age of 70 makes the current US retirement age a near impossible proposition .
A completely untenable development is under way in Japan .
Currently , almost 10 % of all men and 14 % of all women are 70 and older .
By the year 2050 , those figures are forecasted to reach 24 % ( men ) and 33 % ( women ) .
If those projections are somewhat close to reality , the current fiscal imbalances are child ’s play .
For this very reason , politicians need to address these issues not just with temporary band aids but with real measures to control spending and to put the economy on a path to sustainable economic growth .
Yes , meaningful measures will be painful and there will be much more at stake than seemingly silly programs like 13th and 14th month salaries .
Politically , this may be an extremely risky endeavor as most politicians tend to play to the mood of the latest opinion polls .
Granted , there are no easy answers but something ’s go to give if we want to avoid the obvious path towards the bankruptcy of many nations .
Greece must be viewed as an important wake - up call .
Mr. Obama , Mr. Brown ( Mr. Cameron ? ) , Frau Merkel , Mr. Hatoyama , Mr. Sarkozy et. al , have your phones been ringing lately ?

The two types of dispersants British Petroleum is using to clean up the Gulf oil spill are approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency but banned in the United Kingdom , ProPublica reports .
EPA data suggest these products , from the Corexit line of dispersants , are more toxic and less effective in handling southern Louisiana crude than those made by competitors , Greenwire reports .
Dispersants work by breaking oil into droplets .
ProPublica learned of the U.K. ban from Rep. Edward J. Markey , D - Mass. , who told the New York Times that the ban occurred because of " harmful effects " on sea life .
" The release of hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemicals into the Gulf of Mexico could be an unprecedented , large and aggressive experiment on our oceans , " Markey , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment , told the Times .
" The information regarding the chemical composition , efficacy and toxicity of the dispersants currently being used is scarce . "
Read Markey 's letter to the EPA , here .
ProPublica reported earlier that a compound in Corexit has been linked to headaches , vomiting and reproductive problems at high doses .
BP spokesman Jon Pack said Corexit was " pretty effective " and " rigorously tested , " according to Greenwire .
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson told a Senate panel that EPA is working with BP to get less toxic dispersants to the site as quickly as possible , reports Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones .

A novel drill that is inspired by a jet engine and uses super - heated water to carve through rock could help make clean energy from underground rocks more economically viable , according to its backers at Google .
Potter Drilling is part - funded by Google.org - the internet search giant 's philanthropic arm - and wants to use its technology to develop geothermal energy , which involves tapping the energy from hot rocks deep in the Earth .
Geothermal energy is seen by environmentalists as a vast potential source of clean , carbon - free energy if it can be tapped efficiently .
Traditional methods drill into the Earth and use naturally occurring underground pockets of steam or hot water in order to make clean electricity .
A report ( pdf ) by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimated that tapping just 2 % of the potential resource from so - called enhanced geothermal systems between 3 km and 10 km below the surface of continental USA could supply more than 2,500 times the country 's total annual energy use .
Geothermal projects in countries from Australia to Iceland and Germany already generate thousands of megawatts of electricity .
Geothermal power plants can be used as baseload electricity because they are usually productive for more than 90 % of the time , compared with 65 % - 75 % for fossil - fuel power plants .
They also produce virtually no greenhouse gas emissions .
Enhanced geothermal systems ( EGS ) allow the traditional techniques to be applied almost anywhere .
By drilling deep into the Earth ( where rock temperatures can reach more than 200C ) and pumping water into the hole , the underground hot rocks fracture , thus allowing the water to circulate and heat up .
The hot water comes back to the surface and is then used to drive turbines and produce electricity .
" EGS could be the killer app of the energy world , " said Dan Reicher , director of climate and energy initiatives for Google.org , when its funding was first announced for Potter Drilling .
" One of the attractive aspects is that it 's baseload , it 's 24 - hour power and that 's a nice complement to solar and wind , which are intermittent sources .
If you can put all three of these technologies together , we 're going to have a much more attractive green electricity mix . "
Potter 's technology aims to make EGS more economical because it can make drilling the holes more simple and cheaper .
It will test its radical water - based design in the field for the first time in August .
The technology uses heat instead of mechanical abrasion to break rock apart .
It works because certain types of hard rock , such as quartz and feldspar , do not expand uniformly when they get hot .
This creates stress between the grains of the mineral sand that causes them to break apart .
" The key is to heat it very quickly , " said Jared Potter , chief executive of Potter Drilling .
In the past 18 months , the company has drilled holes of 1 and 4 inches in diameter through hard rocks , to prove that their idea works .
In August this year , the company will for the first time drill a 4 - inch hole to 1,000 feet deep .
" A realistic target for this type of intermediate development would be 5 km , " said Potter .
" Eventually our goal is to be able to drill to 10 km . "
So -called " spallation " drilling has been used before but with air , rather than superheated water , fired out at supersonic speeds into a hole .
The original designs for spallation drills in the 1950s effectively used jet engines to fire hot air at rocks .
But they were restricted to use very close to the surface , in applications such as rock quarrying .
Jared 's father , Bob Potter , came up with the water - drill design after working on geothermal technologies for the Los Alamos National Laboratory , the government installation where the nuclear bomb was invented and tested in the 1940s .
The Potter drill initially requires fossil fuels to heat the water , but the company claims the process is still far more environmentally friendly than using a regular drill .
" What you need is very concentrated energy and it's hard to do that without using combustion , " said Potter .
" It 's a trade - off , it might create a little CO2 in the drilling process but it 's going to be less than what they do in the conventional process with conventional drill rigs . "
In a traditional drilling rig , most of the fuel 's energy never reaches the underground drill - bit because as it is wasted in friction and other inefficiencies in the system .
The drill bits also wear out frequently and , in certain types of rock , it may only be possible to drill for 100 feet before you need a new bit .
" Every time you take the bit in and out , if it 's a deep hole , you may lose a day of time - that has to be factored into the cost as well , " said Potter .
" Our technology does n't have a bit , can drill continuously and we can drill 3 - 5 faster than they can .
We can drill 30ft an hour and they 're drilling 5 - 10 ft an hour .
And we 're not taking the bit in and out of the hole .
Our energy is right at the rock face . "
That trial will be funded by the US Department of Energy but the company has also received money from Google.org , as part of the web search gaint 's larger $ 10 m ( £ 5.4 m ) investment into renewable energy sources that could replace coal in the future .

And this week is no different as we ask the question :
Who are the sexiest aliens to ever appear on our TV or cinema screens ?
We 've even included a couple of men is here too .
Of course , realistically , the chances of us finding any intelligent life at all in the cosmos are slim – never mind the kind of alien that would not look out of place on the cover of Vanity Fair .
In fact , it 's more likely to look like the crap that grows in your coffee mug when you leave it in your bedroom too long .
Mind you , there are some sick people around .
Anyway , here goes .

Blayne Haggart does n't consider himself a " radical extremist , " which is why he 's chafing at possibly being labelled as such by Heritage Minister James Moore .
The 37 - year - old Ottawa native thinks there are many positives in Bill C - 32 , the copyright reform legislation unveiled by Moore and Industry Minister Tony Clement earlier this month .
But he says it also has a key flaw — it would make the breaking of any digital lock illegal , which could trump all the other positive provisions .
On his Orangespace blog , Haggart wrote that he does n't believe the government 's rationale for stronger copyright protection in general and the digital lock provision specifically — that they are essential to creative production — is supported by much evidence .
He hopes that Bill C - 32 can be modified and fixed when the parliamentary process begins in the fall .
Voicing such concerns , though , may brand him a radical extremist under Moore 's definition .
" The only people who are opposed to this legislation are really two groups of radical extremists , " Moore said at a meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce in Toronto on Tuesday .
" There are those that pretend to be for copyright reform , but they do n't believe in actual copyright reform .
There are those that are cited as experts by the media endlessly who are not in favour of copyright reform . "
The minister 's comments were also interpreted by observers as taking aim at his chief critic , University of Ottawa professor Michael Geist .
Although he did n't specifically reference Geist by name , Moore criticized " people who pretend to be experts on copyright reform " who are " endlessly cited by the media . "
" Those absolutists out there , who are babyish in their approach to copyright legislation , who think that any idea of copyright reform will be an attack on individual citizens ... [ we must ] make sure that those voices who try to find technical , non-sensical , fear - mongering reasons to oppose copyright reform are confronted every step of the way and they are defeated , " Moore said .
Haggart , who is just finishing his PhD in regional governance and copyright issues at Carleton University in Ottawa , said the minister 's comments were misleading and out of line .
" Michael Geist is no radical .
I go to university , I know radicals .
They 're in my class .
[ Geist ] proposes specific alternatives .
He has never said , ' Let 's scrap copyright . '
He is not a radical by any stretch of the imagination , " Haggart said .
" Criticizing people or trying to characterize their position as something without actually engaging in the substance of what the people are saying is just not constructive or helpful . "
Comments were ' unseemly '
Laura Murray , an English professor at Queen 's University in Kingston , Ont. , and author of Canadian Copyright : A Citizen 's Guide , was alarmed by Moore 's comments .
She works with archivists , librarians , artists and teachers , many of whom have problems with parts of Bill C - 32 — especially the digital locks , which would make it illegal to make copies of CDs , DVDs or any other media if its producer chose to include them .
" These are not people I 'd call extremists .
It was almost amusing except that the tone is so combative .
That 's unseemly for a minister , " she said .
" The bill is out there to be debated .
To say it 's all or nothing like that is very much against the spirit and process I understand for debating bills . "
Murray , who presented a submission to the government during 2009's cross-country copyright consultations , says she was especially discouraged by Moore 's characterization of Bill C - 32's criticisms , particularly over the the digital locks provision , as fear - mongering .
" Putting [ locks ] on a pedestal and giving them all the power really overwhelms everything else they 've done , " she says .
" The way they 've treated [ digital rights management ] gives it too much power for anyone to say there 's balance . "
In subsequent correspondence over Twitter , Moore said his comments were aimed only at those people who do n't want copyright laws at all .
" The point I was trying to make is that those who do n't believe in any copyright are , of course , extreme .
We 're open to ideas , as demonstrated by our consultations .
And we welcome amendments that strengthen the bill , " he said .
" But those who do n't believe in any copyright need to [ be ] debated and proven wrong . "
On his blog , Geist countered and said Moore 's comments were obviously directed at the " thousands of other Canadians who have argued for fair copyright " during the consultations .
Geist also denied that he is in favour of abolishing copyright and pointed to a list of his suggested amendments to Bill C - 32 .
Consumer group unhappy
Michael Janigan , executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre ( PIAC ) , an Ottawa - based consumer watchdog that opposes the bill mainly because of the digital locks clause , was also disheartened by Moore 's comments .
" He has morphed from a personable , PR - savvy techno - nerd minister to a young Richard Nixon [ with an enemies list ] , " he said .
" I 'm very surprised at efforts to demonize opponents at a fairly early stage in discussion about the bill .
I do n't think that 's helpful at all . "
PIAC , along with several other consumer groups , wrote to the minister last week to express their dissatisfaction with his recent assertion that consumers support Bill C - 32 .
Moore has not yet replied to the letter , Janigan said .
Last week , Moore also said the legislation had broad support from a range of stakeholders , including the entertainment industry , provincial ministers , small businesses and students .
Tina Robichaud , chairperson of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations , said that while her organization was pleased with Bill C - 32's expansion of fair dealing , which will allow limited copyright infringement for the purposes of education and research , it has concerns with the lock provisions .
Robichaud is " absolutely " concerned that the locks could trump the fair dealing expansion that the students fought for .
The Retail Council of Canada is also concerned with the locks clause .
While the government 's rejection of calls to adopt a new copying tax on devices such as iPods and laptops pleased retailers , the provision for locks remains a major issue .
" We are , overall , very happy with the government 's decision to not extend the blank media levy .
The copyright bill strikes a good balance .
Are there ways it can be improved ?
Of course there are , " said Terrance Oakley , vice - president of federal government relations for the retail council .
" Digital locks should n't get in the way of consumers using their fair - use provisions . "
He said retailers will be bringing that concern up when they appear before the copyright parliamentary committee in the fall .
" Being supportive of the bill does n't mean we support every clause , " Oakley said .

Gus : C'mon , Baby , lose the zero and get with a hero !
Poncho :
She 's not " with " me , we 're just friends .
Gus : " Just friends " ... the siren song of the loser !
Poncho : So I 'm a " loser , " am I ?
Gus : I also called you a zero , in case you missed it .
Poncho : Actually , zero is the cardinal number of the empty set , and is therefore instrumental in field theory and thus all algebra .
Without it , and the ideas contained in the notion of identities and inverses , there would be practically no modern mathematics and physics .

SALT LAKE CITY --
Five special Utah dads were honored Saturday , just in time for Father 's Day .
Jeff Edwards , Chris Erickson , Gerardo Reyes , Mark Broderick and Mike Millgate all received the Foster / Adoptive Dad of the Year Award .
The men were praised for being great foster and adoptive dads , as well as doing it for the right reason .
" I think the right reason is for the kids , " Millgate said .
" It 's always about the kids for me and my wife . "
The award ceremony was part of the KSL Family Fair and the Chalk Art Festival .
People involved in the event want to help place foster children and teens in loving homes .
" Maybe help other people get involved or open up their hearts , " Millgate said .
Right now there are 2,800 hundred kids in the Utah foster care system .
Go ahead : Touch it , hug it , give it a big wet kiss .
The Stanley Cup is n't the germ bomb you might suspect .
The NHL champion Blackhawks ' beloved trophy stopped by the Chicago Tribune newsroom Thursday , and so we took the opportunity to do something the Cup 's keeper said had never been done :
We swabbed it for germs .
We sent the samples to the Chicago lab EMSL Analytical , which found very little general bacteria and no signs of staph , salmonella or E. coli .
" It 's surprisingly clean , " lab manager Nancy McDonald said .
Just 400 counts of general bacteria were found , she said .
By comparison , a desk in an office typically has more than 10,000 .
" I think that 's great , " said a somewhat relieved Philip Pritchard , keeper of the Cup and curator of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto .
Every day , he said , the Cup is washed with a soft detergent .
Twice a year it 's taken apart and professionally cleaned with a high - end silver polish .
When the Cup is on tour , more than 5,000 people touch or kiss it a day , Pritchard said .
Tales of far worse activities over the years are legendary , though unconfirmed by the alleged perpetrators .
While some people wo n't kiss it for fear of germs , most " do n't think twice about it , " Pritchard said .
" But we can reassure them they are going to be OK . "

But while many consider Churchill ’s oratorical mastery to have sometimes been improvised or off - the - cuff , a new examination of his papers , held at Cambridge University ’s Churchill Archives Centre , reveals the toil that went into early drafts – and the revisions made until the last possible moment before delivery .
After reading comments on a weekly basis from our loyal and , thankfully , critical readers , I kept tabs of what you all did n't go gaga over , made my own notes and made a nifty little guide of things the crew should ponder while on hiatus .
But with that frenzied hype comes the undeniable pressure to avoid the sophomore slump .
So we thought we ’d help out and offer some tips on how to make Season 2 even better .
We admit , we ’re not show runners by any means here at Show Tracker , but we are in the business of offering a bit of unsolicited advice from time to time , as we pride ourselves on being experts in the shows we cover .
Easy on the guest stars :
Make no mistake , there have been some phenomenal guest spots this season .
It ’s impossible to think of the season without Kristin Chenoweth , Idina Menzel and Jonathan Groff and their multi-episode arcs .
( I consider Mike O'Malley more of a regular than his technical “ guest ” status . )
I 'm not afraid to say Eve ’s stint on the show was my favorite because she truly felt like a guest star and none of the kids got lost , which is hard when you have three Broadway vets .
I ’ve yet to understand the purpose of Molly Shannon joining the ranks from what we ’ve seen so far , and if she 's not fleshed out next season then there is no use for her , which is a shame given her excellent comedic chops .
Although I ’m excited to see John Stamos as the dentist pursuing Emma ’s affections , my head is pounding at the thought of another guest - star - packed season that loses sight of the background players that have yet to be given much of a chance to shine , which leads to my next tip .
: While I ’m all for the occasional guest star , I feel there has to be a way to get our background players higher up into the mix .
We ’ve had some great stories with Kurt and Artie and a few with Mercedes and Tina , but now that New Directions has expanded let ’s find a way to integrate the other Asian with the fantastic dance moves and the adorable but quiet black guy -- we 've had lots of Brittany and Santana moments , but no story , so let 's fix that as well .
It seems that finding this balance is increasingly difficult , and that could partly be because the major guests have had so much to do this season .
Smartly use the new three characters : I think the newbies could go either really well or painfully awful .
There is no in - between for this Gleek .
I think a boyfriend for Kurt and a love interest for Mercedes will offer up some good material , as will this Christian country singer who competes with Rachel .
But I do fear that trying to introduce new players when some of the others have n’t been fully developed is dangerous .
The good thing about the show being set in high school ?
Students are easy to transfer right out the door .
No more Madonna : Please , please , please , please do n’t do another all - Madonna episode !
I 'm begging here .
It was fun the first go round , it truly was .
I love the Material Girl just like anyone else , but do we really need another full hour of Madge ?
I mean , really ?
Limit the themed episodes :
This goes two ways .
Although I think another Madonna episode is incredibly self - indulgent , I do think it is fun to do maybe one of these themed episodes a season because it can be something fun for the fans .
Even though there were only two Lady Gaga songs in “ Theatrically , ” it felt like a Gaga tribute , and we do n’t need to see a slew of these tribute episodes because while the show is about music , there is a story to be told .
The best story that was told during the Gaga fest had nothing to do with Gaga ( sorry Tina , that story line was a weak setup ) .
Because I know a few more of these puppies will be cooking for next season ( one at the most would be fun ) , here 's to hoping the crew finds a way to make the music propel the episode ’s story because when it ’s done well there are some incredible results .
Going on the whole idea of themes , it seemed that as of late Will took the backseat as the teacher and just gave them an assignment for the week to set up the episode 's theme .
I miss the old days when he worked with them ( even if he had to teach by showing , just no more rapping … no more ) .
There does n't need to be so much " here 's the theme that you should take away from this episode . "
Know what works , and what does n’t :
After suffering through the “ Funk ” episode , which just fell completely flat , I realized they are still figuring out what works for them , and what does n’t .
And that 's OK .
Here are some quick observations :
What works is when the kids have had the entire hour .
It ’s yielded some of the better plots ; story - driven episodes with complementing songs such as " Hell - O " and " Home " are always a match made in Gleek heaven ( though some fans only care for the music , us theater geeks like a good story ) ; and fleshing out the stronger story lines over time has benefited viewers .
What does n’t work , however , is abandoning stories after they ’ve been set up ( we never forget ) ; the often cheesy after - school - special approach ; and some of the random decision making when it comes to song selections ( " Ice , Ice Baby , " sigh ) .
I ’ve always respected how the kids of New Directions have an eclectic mix of songs that offer something for everybody – but for Season 2 , dig even deeper .
We ’ve had a lot of ‘ 80s classics and some great Broadway tunes , but it ’s time to up the ante .
The greatness of the show is that , regardless of how viewers may feel about a particular song choice , the show is introducing a new generation to classic music .
Let the kids explore Elvis , Bob Marley and everything else .
And , of course , for the young uns out there , throw us a bone with some contemporary cuts .
There has always been a great blend of old and new .
Now that it 's Season 2 , more risks in song choices is the way to go , and let ’s be honest :
There is a line of artists begging for the “ Glee ” treatment .
Too much of a good thing : Absence makes the heart grow fonder .
A summer break is something fans need , regardless of whether they want to admit it .
Once the show became a phenom , it drifted into that dreaded overexposure category , which very much worries me for Season 2 and beyond .
It ’s great to see this cast truly blow up because they are wickedly talented and I do n’t mind seeing them everywhere .
But now that they have become lil’ pop icons comes the inevitable oversaturation of merchandise .
I ’m absolutely not prepared to see " Glee " merch at Macy 's or Claire's .
My stomach churns at the thought of a Christmas album , karaoke machines , musical greeting cards , pajamas , games , books ( “ Glee : The Beginning , ” “ Glee : Foreign Exchange ” ) , bedding and cosmetics .
Though I admit a box of “ Glee ” - branded Cheerios would be a nutritious way to start the day ( make it happen , General Mills and Fox ) .
The three , OK five , soundtracks for one season alone was enough to make my wallet say “ no mas . ”
I 'm sure beyond Matthew Morrison 's debut album we 'll be treated to albums from other cast members -- and that I welcome with open arms .
On behalf of Fox , I apologize ahead of time to the parents who will undoubtedly be stuck with the oh - so - tragic decision between the “ Glee ” bedspread , karaoke machine of the new line of clothes and accessories .
Gosh , could you imagine if your kid liked " Harry Potter , " " Twilight " and " Glee " ?
Yikes !
Any tips I left out ?
What are you hoping to see in Season 2 ?

It may be a prank — or it may be raining oil in Louisiana .
A videotape posted on the Russia Today news site shows an amateur cameraman filming oil - slicked streets in River Ridge , a suburb of New Orleans .
The camera pans across oil running down the streets and into storm drains .
The videographer , who is n’t identified at the RT Web site , describes it as “ the same brown bubbly stuff we saw yesterday in the Gulf under the Bay St. Louis Bridge . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
He continues : “ You can see it .
It ’s raining oil .
It is literally raining oil in River Ridge . …
Is this not crazy , dude ? ”
Because oil generally does n’t evaporate , it should n’t be possible , under normal circumstances , for it to rain down from the skies .
But Charlie Paxton of the National Weather Service tells WTSP in Tampa that “ a water spout could pick up some oil and carry it a short distance . ”
Another possibility is that the dispersant BP has been using to thin the oil , Corexit , may have made some of it light enough to be absorbed in the atmosphere .
This skeptical article at Fast Company declares it “ not likely ” that it ’s raining oil , but it quotes the EU Times as stating that “ when combined with the heating Gulf of Mexico waters , [ Corexit ’s ] molecules will be able to ‘ phase transition ’ from their present liquid to a gaseous state allowing them to be absorbed into clouds and allowing their release as toxic rain upon all of Eastern North America . ”
And the article also points to a report ( PDF ) from the newly - renamed federal Minerals Management Service which states that oil , if it ’s light enough , has been known to evaporate .
“ So it might be possible that oil is mixing with rain , ” Fast Company ‘s Ariel Schwartz concedes .

“ Worst case scenario ?
It ’s petroleum mixed with Corexit , the cancer - causing dispersant BP ’s spraying on its oil slick , ” writes ben Wojdyla at Jalopnik .
“ Best case scenario ?
Dirty roads . ”
The following video was posted on Russia Today , June 23 , 2010 .
America 's current struggles notwithstanding , life here is pretty good .
We have a standard of living that 's the envy of most of the world .
Why did that happen ?
Prosperity is n't the norm .
Throughout history and throughout the world , poverty has been the norm .
Most of the world still lives in dire poverty .
Of the 6 billion people on earth , perhaps 1 billion have something close to our standard of living .
Why did America prosper when most of the people of the world are still poor ?
Milton Friedman taught me the answer .
More than any other American , Friedman , who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1976 , clearly warned the world about the unintended consequences of big government .
" We 've become increasingly dependent on government , " said Friedman .
" We 've surrendered power to government ; nobody has taken it from us .
It 's our doing .
The results — monumental government spending , much of it wasted , little of it going to the people whom we would like to see helped . "
That 's from Friedman 's PBS TV series Free to Choose , which aired 30 years ago and became the basis of his No. 1 bestseller by the same name .
The title says a lot .
If we are free to make our own choices , we prosper .
That was a new idea to many back then .
At the time — when inflation and interest rates were in double digits and unemployment approached 10 percent — people thought a wise government could ensure economic growth , guarantee full employment , and eliminate poverty .
Friedman explained that the opposite was true , that bigger government had brought us " burdensome taxes , high inflation , a welfare system under which neither those who receive help nor those who pay for it are satisfied .
Trying to do good with other people 's money simply has not worked . "
No , it has n't .
So why , 30 years later , is America doing so much more of it ?
Because people still have not learned Friedman 's lesson .
Because of that , I give money to a charity that offers teachers free copies of some of my TV news videos that explain the benefits of free markets .
The video most popular in high schools is one in which I ask students , " When so many nations remain poor , why did America become prosperous ? "
Many answer , " Because we have democracy . "
Yet India has democracy , and India has been poor for years .
" India is overpopulated , " they say .
They do n't know that India has the same population density as New Jersey .
Other students suggest that America prospered because of our natural resources .
But Hong Kong has no natural resources .
It 's basically a rock .
It is also more densely populated than India .
Yet , in just 50 years , Hong Kong went from poverty to American levels of wealth .
How ?
In Free to Choose , Friedman explained that it was the free market .
Overlooking the amazing Hong Kong skyline , he said : " This miracle has n't been achieved by government action — by someone sitting in one of those tall buildings and telling people what to do .
It 's been achieved by allowing the market to work . "
Walking down a crowded street , he added , " They are free to buy from whom they want , to sell to whom they want , to work for whom they want .
Sometimes it looks like chaos , and so it is , but underneath it 's highly organized by the impersonal forces of a free marketplace . "
At the time of his series , India was a symbol of enlightened central planning .
" India has tremendous economic and human potential , " Friedman commented .
" The human tragedy is that in India that potential has been stifled by the straightjacket imposed by an all - wise and paternalistic government .
Central planning has condemned India 's masses to poverty and misery . "
What counted most for Friedman was that people should be free to try innovative ideas and succeed … or fail .
" The free market enables people … to trade with whomever they want ; to buy in the cheapest market around the world ; to sell in the dearest .
… ( B ) ut most important of all : If they fail , they bear the cost . "
" Most important of all . "
It 's clear what he would have thought of today 's government bailouts .

I went to buy Angry Birds on Topherchris ’ recommendation and got this :
The first two pages of search results for “ angry birds ” .
The first two are real .
Rocket Bird 3D and MY BEST FRIEND are other things ( although probably keyword spammers ) .
The other six of the top ten results for this game ’s name are pure spam .
Judging from the number of customer ratings , a lot of people are downloading them — and , reading the reviews , it looks like they ’re mostly scams and ripoffs .
Most are from a handful of squatters .
InTekOne , LLC has 58 apps , nearly all of which are “ cheats ” or “ guides ” for top App Store games , violating nearly all of their name and icon trademarks in the process and ripping off thousands of buyers .
ESCAPP is similar with 24 apps , 13 of which are scam “ cheats ” apps that violate other games ’ trademarks ( and I bet most of the others violate various photo and text copyrights ) :
Ben Cousins has 86 scammy apps , including 12 “ cheats ” apps and many more “ guide ” and “ trivia ” apps , plus a few more audacious squats such as “ iFart - Epic Rip Edition ” ( the famous iFart app is made by someone else ) :
And I found all of these from just the top 10 search results for one popular game .
( And I ’m not even mentioning popular - app keyword spam today , which is still massively widespread even though some apps get rejected for including names of other apps in their keywords . )
Apple ’s reviewers are in a difficult position : any large - scale developer bans in the App Store are likely to attract negative press , so they ’re probably reluctant to do any .
But when so many obviously spammy and trademark - infringing apps are getting through , it makes every trivial rejection by real developers even more frustrating .
Update :
How to prevent this for your apps
When an app is infringing on your copyright or trademark , the proper procedure is to send a clear notice to appstorenotices@apple.com citing your intellectual property and which apps are infringing it ( provide their iTunes URLs to eliminate ambiguity ) .
As part of this notice for trademark infringements , you can request that apps not be allowed to use your trademark to market themselves in search results ( keyword spam ) .
I was n’t able to find this information when I first looked for it when I had an Instapaper squatter , so I ’m publishing it here with permission in case it helps other developers .
Nationally , the crime rate declined to 455 incidents per 100,000 people , from 507 in 2000 .
But the rate for property crime , the kind that people may experience most often , increased in the state , to 4,082 per 100,000 residents in 2008 from 3,682 in 2000 .
Preliminary data for 2009 suggests that this rate may also be falling in the state ’s biggest cities .
What is harder to pin down is how much of the crime was committed by illegal immigrants .
Phoenix ’s police chief , Jack Harris , who opposes the new law , said that about 13 percent of his department ’s arrests are illegal immigrants , a number close to the estimated percentage of illegal immigrants in the local population .
But the Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office , which runs the jail for Phoenix and surrounding cities and is headed by Joe Arpaio , a fervent supporter of the law , has said that 19 percent of its inmates are illegal immigrants .
Scott Decker , a criminologist at Arizona State University , said a battery of studies have suggested that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes , in part because they tend to come from interior cities and villages in their home country with low crime rates and generally try to keep out of trouble to not risk being sent home .
But he understood why people ’s perceptions of crime might lag behind what the statistics show .
“ Hard as it is to change the crime rate , it may be more difficult to change public perceptions about the crime rate , particularly when those perceptions are linked to public events , ” Mr. Decker said .
He added , “ There is nothing more powerful than a story about a gruesome murder or assault that leads in the local news and drives public opinion that it is not safe anywhere . ”
Kris Kobach , a University of Missouri law professor who helped write the Arizona immigration law , pointed to crimes like a wave of kidnappings related to the drug and human smuggling business in Phoenix , something Ms. Brewer herself noted when she signed the law .
Although the reports have dipped in the past couple of years , the police responded to 315 such cases last year .
Cleanup workers on these South Louisiana beaches are n't the only ones who could use more protections .
What Elmer told me echoed the reports that BP is n't exactly doing everything in its power to keep track of the toll the spill is taking on wildlife .
In nearby Port Fourchon , where he has also worked , there are markers to denote wildlife nesting areas , but they are n't clearly labeled and no one knows what they mean , so workers drive and trample over sensitive habitats .
One day last week , Elmer and his coworkers came upon eight oiled pelicans , but though they called the official number to report their findings , no one had come to collect the birds by the time his shift ended many hours later .
( A representative from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has yet to respond to my request for comment . )
Workers on Elmer 's have not been instructed to report dead animals for collection or autopsy .
Elmer said he 'd recently come upon a dead crab and , knowing no one was going to come to examine it , decided to slice it open himself .
Black oil poured out .
I 've seen some pathetic excuses for cleanup out here -- were the workers on Elmer 's at least making some progress ?
" They 're not being effective out here , " Elmer said .
" Two days after your article , they bused in twice as many workers , so they 're up to 120 guys on Elmer 's now , but I can't see any considerable difference .
They 're only working five sites and it 's eight miles of beach .
No one seems concerned about cleaning it up .
The contractors are getting their money ; they do n't care .
They 've got all these people out there , but they 're not accomplishing anything . "
Oh , wait .
Not nothing : " They 've brought in prostitutes . "
No one knows who the " they " that brought in the pack of hookers is , but the gals have definitely arrived , and you can buy time with one for $ 200 .
It only took someone a whole month even to figure out that it would be lucrative to sell sex to guys earning 44 hours of overtime a week and living in camps and converted 18 - wheelers .
This piece was produced by Mother Jones for the Climate Desk collaboration .
of the conference room in the office of Popular Mechanics .
It comes in a medium - size box , weighing in at about 30 pounds , topped with a clear hemisphere housing a prominent mirror mounted on a 360 - degree gimbal .
Peering inside the dome , a viewer can see a network of other mirrors that bounce light from a laser housed below , directing the beam to the main lens affixed to the gimbal .
This prototype is the only one in the world , and this is the first time its inventors , BAE Systems , have brought it out of the lab for a journalist to paw over .
The device , called Boldstroke , is the solution to a problem the Army does not want to have .
The threat of advanced shoulder - fired missiles to American helicopters is a nightmare , one that hearkens to the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan , where U.S. supplied Stinger missiles downed an estimated 250 Russian helicopters over two years .
Shoulder - fired missiles with infrared tracking can rightfully take their place next to improvised explosive devices , sniper rifles and car bombs as gold - standard tools of asymmetric warfare .
Insurgents in Iraq have used SA - 7s , shoulder - fired missiles tipped with infrared homing devices , against U.S. and British aircraft .
But there are more sophisticated threats out there , like the SA - 16 , which has a sensitive seeker that adds ultraviolet tracking to IR seekers in order to ignore flares that aircraft fire to spoof the missiles .
The SA - 16 is available on the black market .
In 2008 , something happened that triggered an increase in helo protection , and the Army commissioned BAE to fast - track a system that uses lasers to blind the seekers in infrared missiles .
Exactly what prompted the request , called a Quick Reaction Contract , is classified .
But it 's not a leap to assume that intelligence reports or an actual attack set the wheels in motion .
By the end of 2009 BAE delivered its first Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasure ( ATRICM ) to the Army for use on its CH - 47 Chinooks .
ATRICM fires a pencil - thin multiband laser at frequencies that blind IR seekers scanning for targets in those same frequencies .
The Pentagon recently confirmed to Aviation Week that the defensive system thwarted an IR missile attack on a Chinook , and BAE officials tell PM that the attack occurred within weeks of weeks of ATIRM 's arrival in Iraq .
The Army is on track to outfit its fleet of Chinooks in Iraq and Afghanistan with the protective system by the end of the year .
Helicopters are a deciding factor in both Iraq and Afghanistan — more so in Afghanistan , where roads are lacking and helos are used for resupply as well as combat missions .
The crucial rotorcraft that ferries troops and supplies is the Chinook , but they depend on massive engines to haul their heavy loads .
Those engines produce a lot of heat , enough to attract the attention of even modest missile seekers .
" There is a huge IR signature from Chinooks , " says Ernest Keirstead , the director of BAE 's Boldstroke program .
That brings us back to the prototype on the conference - room table .
BAE has created Boldstroke to improve on ATIRCM .
It 's lighter , has fewer moving optical parts and uses mirrors instead of a physical " light pipe " to shoot its laser .
Instead of three boxes , the entire unit is housed in one box .
A helicopter with a Boldstroke system mounted on either side of the helicopter would have 360 degrees of protection .
And the 360 gimbaled mirror is an improvement on the two - axis steering of the currently deployed ATIRCM .
The Boldstroke rollout is coinciding as simple , unguided rocket - propelled grenades ( RPGs ) continue to take their toll on helicopters during takeoff and landing .
In early June a NATO helicopter was felled by a pair of RPGs , killing four soldiers .
It is not the first such successful attack .
BAE officials say they have dedicated money in - house to investigating how to modify current detection systems that could warn pilots of the approach of an RPG .
The key , again , is heat from the rocket , which could be tracked by BAE 's existing thermal sensors .
Instead of a laser countermeasure , the system could warn pilot where the missile is coming from and allow for some evasive action .
BAE has sunk $ 70 million over the last three years on upgrading its lab and production infrastructure at its Nashua , N.H. , facilities .
They are betting — with good reason — that more work will come their way as IR missile threats proliferate .
That could mean deploying similar systems on commercial airplanes as well as a wider variety of military aircraft .

Last week the Netherlands found out the hard way what the risks are when copyright - law is seriously neglected by parliament .
Just mentioning a file - name has been declared legally synonymous with hosting illegal material .
When parliament fails to adequately update it ’s own laws , private lobbying groups like BREIN will take over the initiative and they will create the laws .
By forcing the debate from the parliamentary proces into the civil courtroom , BREIN and other lobbying groups bring the number of participants in this debate down to a handful of judges and lawyers specializing in this subject .
One of the outcomes of this process is that it becomes almost inevitable that judges cannot help but appear biased .
When reaching landmark decisions that overturn years of jurisprudence , neither the judge nor the issue is served when it turns out that the judge in question is in business with the copyright - lawyer from the party benefiting from this shocking verdict .
The fact that this joint enterprise mainly offers courses on ‘ counter - piracy ’ at €900 per day , makes the situation appear even muddier still .
If the Netherlands wants to avoid looking like a banana - republic where the law is for sale to the highest bidder , it is urgent that parliament takes control of the debate on copyright - reform , and brings it back into the public arena where this discussion belongs .
It is vitally important that parliament takes charge , but in order to do that , the members clearly need detailed knowledge of the subject - matter as well as lots of guts .
Both of which are completely lacking at the moment .
The Dutch Pirateparty is on the brink of gaining a seat in tomorrow ’s parliamentary elections .
Our seat will be the first step into reigning in out of control lobby - groups and bringing the copyright debate ‘ home ’ .
Horror as woman stamps on her baby after being accused of stealing a mobile
This was the shocking moment a woman accused of stealing a mobile phone in China threw her baby on the ground and stamped on it .
The hideous incident came after a high school student had challenged the woman and a female friend , both holding babies , after being told by witnesses that they had stolen her phone .
The suspected thief throws the baby to the ground and starts to stamp on it in Zhengzhou , China
The baby lies on the ground screaming after the incident .
Miraculously , the infant was not injured
The confrontation turned physical and the police were called in Zhengzhou , Henan province .
Officers arrived along with some of the student 's relatives .
One of these family members pushed one of the suspected thieves who , shockingly , responded by throwing her baby on to the road and stamping on it while shouting in protest .
For a few horrifying the moments the tiny child was left crying in the middle of the road as the woman was pulled away .
The two women suspects were eventually taken to the local police station .
Miraculously , the baby escaped uninjured .

Regardless of strict moral codes , some nineteenth - century writers opposed convention by creating erotica published by underground houses and distributed all over .
They did this despite opposition from the religious and political leaders of the Victorian Age .
According to the testimonies of many people born in the Victorian age , they were both factually uneducated and emotionally frigid about sexual matters .
Instead , multiple couples seem to have relished mutual pleasure in what is now seen as a normal , contemporary manner .
Earlier this week , we showed you how to add a USB Power Outlet to Your Car .
If you need a bit more versatility and power , though , here 's how to install a full , four - outlet power panel with regular A/C plugs .

This project is a bit more involved than the aforementioned USB hack , but it will give you quite a bit of versatility in terms of charging your electronic devices .
You 'll need a strip of aluminum for the panel , a power inverter , some inline fuses , a 12 volt extension plug , and some wire and connectors to hook it all up .
You 'll also need a soldering iron as well as a few other basic tools to get behind your dashboard and to mold the panel to your liking .

The main idea of the project is that you will take apart the inverter and hook up the internals to the car 's battery , and add some 12 volt cigarette lighter outlets on the other side of the panel .
The inverter in these particular instructions also came with a USB port , so if you get a similar model , you 'll have one of those too .
Unlike the USB hack we featured earlier , you 'll be able to get some pretty good power out of this thing .
You should easily be able to charge your laptop , iPad , or other more power - hungry devices instead of just your mobile phone .

The Jackets will host their annual prospect development camp later this month , it is tentatively scheduled to run from 30 June to 5 July .
The camp consists of prospects drafted or signed by the Jackets and a handful of free agent invites .
Here are the players who are on the roster at this point :
Names will be added to the list after the draft later this month .
Most of these names are well - known to Jacket fans , but there are some invites who may not be readily known :
RW Nick Sucharski : Former CBJ draft pick Sucharski completed his fifth year at Michigan State this past spring .
I have to be honest , I do n't know the details behind an NCAA player spending five years at school .
I was under the impression that a prospect 's rights were owned by the team that drafted him until the end of his fourth year at school , unless he 's signed first .
Perhaps it 's four years after the player has been drafted , which is the situation with Sucharski .
At any rate he is a fringe player looking for a shot in the pros .
He has never scored more than nine goals with the Spartans , and will be a long shot to earn a contract with Columbus .
D Kyle Page :
An undrafted free agent who also recently completed his college career .
Page suited up for Bowling Green and had a tryout with the Toledo Walleye at the end of last season .
He 's an undersized guy ( 5 - 10 , 185 ) who has offensive talent .
Given the depth earmarked for the Springfield blueline , Page is in - tough to earn a contract .
At the end of the day though , these guys could surprise - that 's why they are invited to these camps in the first place .
G Chris Rawlings : Rawlings is an interesting story .
He just completed his freshman year at Northeastern , after making the jump from Junior A .
He had a rough start to his career but finished the season on a strong note .
He 's a monster as well - checking in at 6 - 5 , 210 .
There is raw talent there , and with some coaching he could be a solid positional goalie in the pros .
He 's 22 , so he 's likely ready for a move to the pros .
It 's good to see recent signing Gustaf Wesslau and draft pick Anton Blomqvist make the trek over from Europe to take part in camp .
Wesslau will likely be part of the goaltending tandem in Springfield next season .
A large portion of the potential Falcons blueline will be taking part in this camp , so it will be a great opportunity for these guys to gel together .
There is a hefty ommission from that list however , and that is Nikita Filatov .
Tyler Wright is currently en-route to Russia to speak with Filatov , and the hope is for him to make the trip across the pond as soon as possible , working out in Columbus over the summer , rather than just showing up for main camp in September .
Here 's hoping Wright can convince him .
The technique could benefit about 100 babies a year , researchers believe A technique that " washes out " the brains of severely ill premature babies may aid survival , a study suggests .
Bleeding in the brain is one of the most feared complications for the most premature babies as it can lead to brain damage or death .
The Bristol University study of 77 babies found the technique - involving draining the brain while introducing new fluid - could reduce the risk .
It is thought the technique could benefit about 100 babies a year .
The therapy , pioneered at Bristol 's Southmead Hospital , is carried out over a couple of days and requires close monitoring to ensure the pressure in the baby 's brain does not rise too high , researchers say .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme Experts have described the findings as encouraging .
It would be used only on the most premature babies with large haemorrhages , which cause the brain and head to expand excessively - a condition called hydrocephalus .
Standard treatment currently involves repeatedly inserting needles into the head or spine to remove the build up of fluid over a number of months before a shunt is inserted to drain fluid into the abdomen .
But the study , published in the Pediatrics journal , found the new treatment called Drift was more effective .
Of the 39 babies to receive the treatment , by the age of two 54 % had died or were severely disabled , compared with 71 % who were given the standard treatment .
This is the first time that any treatment anywhere in the world has been shown to benefit these very vulnerable babies
Ian Pople , lead researcher Paediatric neurosurgeon Ian Pople , one of the lead researchers , said he hoped the technique would soon be used in the NHS .
" This is the first time that any treatment anywhere in the world has been shown to benefit these very vulnerable babies . "
One of the first babies to be given the treatment before the study took place was nine - year - old Isaac Walker - Cox , from Yate , near Bristol .
He was given a 1 % chance of survival when he was born 13 weeks early .
His mother , Rebekah Walker - Cox , said that while he has mild paralysis on the left - side of his body , he is living a normal childhood .
" Mentally he has no problems at all , he has an above average reading age and is very good with computers .
He just gets on with life and is an outgoing , happy little boy . "
Andy Cole , of Bliss , the premature baby charity , said : " This is a very interesting piece of new research and we always welcome anything that has the potential to improve outcomes for babies born sick and premature .
" The early results of this technique are encouraging and we look forward to seeing how these findings might be translated into treatments that could ensure better outcomes for these vulnerable babies . "

Today 's Newspoll figures show Opposition Leader Tony Abbott closing the gap on Kevin Rudd as preferred prime minister .
While Mr Rudd remains preferred prime minister , the poll , published in The Australian newspaper , shows the margin between the pair has narrowed .
The Newspoll comes amid continuing speculation over Mr Rudd 's leadership as MPs arrive back in Canberra for what could be the last sitting week before the federal election .
Support for Mr Abbott jumped four percentage points to 37 per cent , while Mr Rudd 's popularity dropped three points to 46 per cent .
Mr Abbott is now the closest Liberal leader in the preferred prime minister stakes since Mr Rudd was elected .
Labor has edged slightly further ahead in the two - party preferred stakes , leading the Coalition 52 to 48 per cent .
Newspoll 's Martin O'Shannesy says nothing has been gained for the Government or the Opposition 's voting position .
" Another tough couple of weeks for Prime Minister Rudd , and Tony Abbott discovering the value of a low - profile target position , has led to the only major change in the poll , which is an improvement in Tony Abbott 's better prime minister position , " he told AM .
Mr Rudd says fluctuating polls are inevitable .
" The business of economic reform is tough and you 're going to lose some paint on the way through , " he said .
" That 's what being a government committed to the nation 's long - term strength and economy is all about . "
Government frontbencher Craig Emerson says Mr Rudd can turn the poll results around before the election .
" The truth is Labor governments have been in this sort of position before , " he told AM .
But Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner has conceded the Government is taking a " belting " in the polls .
" We 've got a lot of challenges in front of us and we 're just endeavouring to do the right thing by the nation in trying to make sure we build a prosperous economy and develop long - term sustainable growth for Australia , " he said .
" Now , we know things sometimes go awry , and one or two things have gone awry , and we 're getting a bit of a belting for that . "
The poll also comes as the Government continues its bitter battle with the mining industry over the controversial resources tax .
But Mr Rudd had a win yesterday when the Government announced that it had reached an $ 11 billion agreement with Telstra over the National Broadband Network .
However , Mr Rudd has continued to face questions over whether he would step aside and let Julia Gillard take over if Labor 's prospects do not improve .
Last night he told the 60 Minutes program he would be leading the party to the next election .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Preparing the U.S. military to fight two major conventional wars is " out of date " and does not reflect the numerous challenges U.S. military forces could face in the future , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday .
Gates made that pronouncement as he revealed the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review , the military 's strategic outlook .
He said the military needs to start planning for multiple operations such as major disasters in the United States and various scuffles around the planet .
" We now recognize that America 's ability to deal with threats for years to come will depend importantly on our success in the current conflicts , " Gates said , pointing out this is the first time the anti-insurgent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been included in a Quadrennial Defense Review ( QDR ) as long - term planning priorities .
He said the previous idea of planning for two conventional wars was " too confining and did not represent the real world that ... our military forces are going to face in the future . "
The quadrennial review is a congressionally mandated document in which the Pentagon looks at future threats and the requirements to mitigate them .
That the 2010 review was announced the same day as the 2011 Department of Defense budget was not an accident .
The review is a major driving force behind how the Pentagon plans its budget .
The 2011 budget request " builds on the reforms begun in last year 's budget , changes that were broadened and deepened by the analysis and conclusions contained in the QDR , " Gates said .
A common theme between the fiscal year 2011 budget and the 2010 review is reform , something Gates has been pushing since his arrival in late 2006 .
He announced the cancellation of a number of projects , saving billions of dollars , as well as the restructuring of the long - delayed next generation F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter program .
However , the Defense Department budget is up $ 44 billion over last year , totaling $ 708.3 billion , including funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Among the additions are an increase in the number of unmanned aerial vehicles -- something also called for in the defense review -- and putting a priority on adding new helicopters to the fleet .
Gates said the review calls for " a 75 percent increase over the next couple of years in the number of combat air patrols by the most advanced UAVs [ and ] increasing the availability of helicopters by procuring more aircraft . "
Both aircraft platforms are key tools in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and Gates said they will total about $ 9 billion .
Share your views on military plans
While special operations forces continue to be a priority , as they were in the 2006 review , the 2010 outlook places emphasis on adding more troops and improving the support for the elite troops .
That support will include new AC - 130 gunship aircraft to protect the troops during combat missions as well as an additional 2,800 combat and support personnel who would improve intelligence and communications for the special operations forces in coming years , according to Gates .
Looking elsewhere in the world , the Pentagon still is keeping close watch on China .
" The lack of transparency and the nature of China 's military development and decision - making processes raise legitimate questions about its future conduct and intentions within Asia and beyond , " the review says .
The 2006 review was heavily focused on the threat of a large - scale conventional war with China and that country 's saber rattling over Taiwan .
The 2010 version still stresses such threats from China , but also looks at the need to defend against a growing threat of cyberattacks -- without directly tying China to past cyberattacks , according to Pentagon officials .
In another area , intelligence shows that terrorists have plotted to get their hands on biological , chemical or nuclear material to attempt attacks , and the Pentagon expects weapons of mass destruction to be a continued threat in the future .
In response , Gates said , the military " will expand capabilities to counter WMD threats , strengthen interdiction operations , refocus intelligence requirements , enhance and grow international partnerships and thwart proliferation . "
The report recommends that the Pentagon develop a joint task force headquarters to oversee these operations .
One of the biggest costs for the Pentagon since 2001 has been in health care as the military handles the thousands of mentally and physically wounded troops each year from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , on top of taking care of day - to - day health care needs for troops and their families .
The health care budget rose from $ 19 billion in 2001 to $ 50.7 billion in the latest proposal .
The Pentagon will spend some $ 8.8 billion in the coming budget alone for expanding assistance counseling , child care and education to support military families , and another $ 2 billion for wounded warrior initiatives , with a special focus on the signature ailments of current conflicts , such as post - traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury , Gates said .
The report also touched on how the military can respond to environmental concerns , and how the environment will affect what the military is called to do .
Future conflicts can be handled in an environmentally responsible way , it says , by using more solar power and biofuels , and increasing overall energy independence .
It also points out that the Department of Defense " provides environmental stewardship " at hundreds of bases around the country .
Bigger challenges for the Pentagon will be environmental catastrophes and future conflicts fought around and over reduced resources , the review says .
It calls climate change an " accelerant of instability " and suggests the military in planning for future operations will have to take into account climate factors such as rising sea levels and reduced ice in the Arctic , in addition to what climate change could bring in terms of the spread of disease , mass migration and a scarcity of resources .
Atul Gawande gave the commencement speech at Stanford ’s School of Medicine last week .
Here is what he told the graduating class .
Many of you have worked for four solid years — or five , or six , or nine — and we are here to declare that , as of today , you officially know enough stuff to be called a graduate of the Stanford School of Medicine .
You are Doctors of Medicine , Doctors of Philosophy , Masters of Science .
It ’s been certified .
Each of you is now an expert .
Congratulations .
So why — in your heart of hearts — do you not quite feel that way ?
The experience of a medical and scientific education is transformational .
It is like moving to a new country .
At first , you do n’t know the language , let alone the customs and concepts .
But then , almost imperceptibly , that changes .
Half the words you now routinely use you did not know existed when you started : words like arterial - blood gas , nasogastric tube , microarray , logistic regression , NMDA receptor , velluvial matrix .
O.K. , I made that last one up .
But the velluvial matrix sounds like something you should know about , does n’t it ?
And that ’s the problem .
I will let you in on a little secret .
You never stop wondering if there is a velluvial matrix you should know about .
Since I graduated from medical school , my family and friends have had their share of medical issues , just as you and your family will .
And , inevitably , they turn to the medical graduate in the house for advice and explanation .
I remember one time when a friend came with a question .
“ You ’re a doctor now , ” he said .
“ So tell me : where exactly is the solar plexus ? ”
I was stumped .
The information was not anywhere in the textbooks .
“ I do n’t know , ” I finally confessed .
“ What kind of doctor are you ? ” he said .
I did n’t feel much better equipped when my wife had two miscarriages , or when our first child was born with part of his aorta missing , or when my daughter had a fall and dislocated her elbow , and I failed to recognize it , or when my wife tore a ligament in her wrist that I ’d never heard of — her velluvial matrix , I think it was .
This is a deeper , more fundamental problem than we acknowledge .
The truth is that the volume and complexity of the knowledge that we need to master has grown exponentially beyond our capacity as individuals .
Worse , the fear is that the knowledge has grown beyond our capacity as a society .
When we talk about the uncontrollable explosion in the costs of health care in America , for instance — about the reality that we in medicine are gradually bankrupting the country — we ’re not talking about a problem rooted in economics .
We ’re talking about a problem rooted in scientific complexity .
Half a century ago , medicine was neither costly nor effective .
Since then , however , science has combatted our ignorance .
It has enumerated and identified , according to the international disease - classification system , more than 13,600 diagnoses — 13,600 different ways our bodies can fail .
And for each one we ’ve discovered beneficial remedies — remedies that can reduce suffering , extend lives , and sometimes stop a disease altogether .
But those remedies now include more than six thousand drugs and four thousand medical and surgical procedures .
Our job in medicine is to make sure that all of this capability is deployed , town by town , in the right way at the right time , without harm or waste of resources , for every person alive .
And we ’re struggling .
There is no industry in the world with 13,600 different service lines to deliver .
It should be no wonder that you have not mastered the understanding of them all .
No one ever will .
That ’s why we as doctors and scientists have become ever more finely specialized .
If I ca n’t handle 13,600 diagnoses , well , maybe there are fifty that I can handle — or just one that I might focus on in my research .
The result , however , is that we find ourselves to be specialists , worried almost exclusively about our particular niche , and not the larger question of whether we as a group are making the whole system of care better for people .
I think we were fooled by penicillin .
When penicillin was discovered , in 1929 , it suggested that treatment of disease could be simple — an injection that could miraculously cure a breathtaking range of infectious diseases .
Maybe there ’d be an injection for cancer and another one for heart disease .
It made us believe that discovery was the only hard part .
Execution would be easy .
But this could not be further from the truth .
Diagnosis and treatment of most conditions require complex steps and considerations , and often multiple people and technologies .
The result is that more than forty per cent of patients with common conditions like coronary artery disease , stroke , or asthma receive incomplete or inappropriate care in our communities .
And the country is also struggling mightily with the costs .
By the end of the decade , at the present rate of cost growth , the price of a family insurance plan will rise to $ 27,000 .
Health care will go from ten per cent to seventeen per cent of labor costs for business , and workers ’ wages will have to fall .
State budgets will have to double to maintain current health programs .
And then there is the frightening federal debt we will face .
By 2025 , we will owe more money than our economy produces .
One side says war spending is the problem , the other says it ’s the economic bailout plan .
But take both away and you ’ve made almost no difference .
Our deficit problem — far and away — is the soaring and seemingly unstoppable cost of health care .
We in medicine have watched all this mainly with bafflement , even indifference .
This is just what good medicine is like , we ’re tempted to say .
But we ’d be ignoring the evidence .
For health care is not practiced the same way across the country .
There is remarkable variability in the cost and quality of care .
Two communities in the same state with the same levels of poverty and health can differ by more than fifty per cent in their Medicare costs .
There is a bell curve for cost and quality , and it is frustrating — but also hopeful .
For those getting the best results — the hospitals and doctors measured at the top of the curve for patient outcomes — are not the most expensive .
They are sometimes among the least .
Like politics , all medicine is local .
Medicine requires the successful function of systems — of people and of technologies .
Among our most profound difficulties is making them work together .
If I want to give my patients the best care possible , not only must I do a good job , but a whole collection of diverse components must somehow mesh effectively .
Having great components is not enough .
We ’ve been obsessed in medicine with having the best drugs , the best devices , the best specialists — but we ’ve paid little attention to how to make them fit together well .
Don Berwick , of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement , has noted how wrongheaded this is .
“ Anyone who understands systems will know immediately that optimizing parts is not a good route to system excellence , ” he says .
He gives the example of a famous thought experiment in which an attempt is made to build the world ’s greatest car by assembling the world ’s greatest car parts .
We connect the engine of a Ferrari , the brakes of a Porsche , the suspension of a BMW , the body of a Volvo : “ What we get , of course , is nothing close to a great car ; we get a pile of very expensive junk . ”
Nonetheless , in medicine , that ’s exactly what we have done .
Review : UFC Undisputed 2010
by Binh Nguyen [ Thursday , 3rd of June 2010 - 05:02 PM ]
Is that blood or red paste ?
The first thing you would probably notice is graphically the game looks eerily similar to last year 's title .
I am not saying it is a bad thing , but minor changes would have been nice .
I really felt like I was playing last year 's game .
Graphically , the fighters ' movements feel about the same as before , but inexplicably , feels off at times .
Some of the punches and kicks that should have landed do n't and some that should n't , do .
Though , when it lands cleanly , you can certainly feel the punch .
And in the blue corner ...
As much as I would love to spend every minute following MMA news around the world , I do n't have the time to do such a thing .
In Career Mode you get to do that for one fighter , and that fighter is you !
Career Mode is the Story Mode of the game where you create your fighter the way you want him to look .
Even though the customization is pretty much a bunch of preset models where you 're allowed to modify a few things here and there .
After you create your character , you are now free to experience a twelve year career which also includes testing your fighting ability against the game 's four difficulties before going pro .
The “ story ” of the game is you becoming a rising star in the UFC where after a match you can choose what you want to say in the post fight interview .
Something that can have lasting consequences based on whether you respect or disrespect your opponent .
It can affect your fighter 's credibility and popularity attributes and how the fans and commentary react to you .
Oh what a right hook !
UFC is certainly one event that you can enjoy watching in person or through your television screen .
Adding to the overall real experience is the commentary of the event .
This is dutifully recreated and captured in UFC Undisputed 2010 .
It has it all , from the pre-match commentary to the announcement of the fighters by one suave Bruce Buffer to announcers Joe Rogan and Mike Goldberg talking over each other .
The only thing that could be construed as lacking is the absence of some sort of commentary for the replays , but I am sure most of us have forgiven them for not adding it in .
Or have we ?
Still after the end of a round or match I was left with a sense of satisfaction that I did more than just press buttons .
I actually got to feel what it is like to be in a UFC event thanks to the wonderful commentary that the game provides .
I 'll throw a jab here
The gameplay for this year title is no different from the previous title .
It is really similar , if not exactly the same button configuration .
To be honest , there is no big difference in the control system .
So if you played 2009 's title , then you should be familiar with the button scheme for 2010's .
Need to get this off my chest
So while reviewing UFC Undisputed 2010 I wanted to fight some matches online only to find out that I was not able to do so .
Why ?
Well in order for you to play online you need to enter a code .
Something I did not get with my copy of UFC Undisputed 2010 from GameFly .
So reviewing the online portion of the game was out of my reach .
Also if you so happen to get rid of the game and the next person that purchases the game wants to go online , they will have to pay a $ 5 charge for a code to go online .
Now I can't even comment about how stable the online play is as I was not able to get on .
There are also online camps you may able to attend , but I was not able to be a part of that as well .
Now that came from no where ....
One of the major differences in the game is the defense style .
Well really the lack of defense style .
It does n't matter how often I have my hands up - obviously important , even the commentators will mention about “ always keeping those hands up ” - your opponent will find a way to either knock you out or knock you down to the ground .
At that point you can block and kick all you want , but there is still a good chance your opponent will find a way to finish the fight quickly .
Defending a take down and transitions require holding the stick in either one direction or the other .
At times when I am trying to do the reversal , I feel so disconnected because of the timing .
UFC Undisputed 2010 has the ability to show you your fighter 's health and stamina bar .
It certainly increases the chances of a spontaneous knockout , which is fine because that is how it is in a real UFC fight .
Unfortunately , this is n't a real UFC fight .
This is a video game where K.O.s happen way , and I mean WAY too often .
I do n't mean just against you , but against your opponent as well .
It 's baffling at times , especially when you are watching the replay of your K.O.
You do n't see that much of a difference there from what you were doing before .
It may have been carried over from the previous title .
My take :
UFC Undisputed 2010 is a solid game .
Despite some issues in the game that could have been avoided - like the lack of updated graphics - even if it 's minor , just give us something .
There will be times when you get a bit ( alright extremely ) frustrated when you think you are winning the match and BAM its all over with a right hook or uppercut .
Just hang in there and keep on trucking .
It is still a solid pick up for $ 60 if you are a UFC fan or a really good rent if you are on the fence about it .
Oh you can unlock a few secret characters and one of them is Shaq .
I wonder why ... hmmmmm
UFC Undisputed 2010 was developed by Yuke 's Media Creations and published by THQ for the PS3 , XBox 360 , PSP on May 25th .
A copy of the game was rented from GameFly.com .
I played through 10 matches in the career mode and played many of the modes with the exception being online on the PS3 .
WASHINGTON Ã¢â‚¬â€ Human rights groups filed a complaint seeking an investigation into allegations that CIA - led medical personnel conducted research experiments on terror detainees after the September 11 attacks .
As RAW STORY reported Monday :
A new report by the watchdog group Physicians for Human Rights alleges Monday that the Bush Administration experimented on terrorism suspects during their enhanced interrogation program put in force starting in 2002 .
The group ’s review , which examined Bush - era documentation , asserts that the administration violated laws set up in the wake of the Holocaust to prevent medical testing on prisoners of war .
( Nazi doctors sometimes experimented on their prisoners . )
The report states that , “ Medical personnel were required to monitor all waterboarding practices and collect detailed medical information that was used to design , develop and deploy subsequent waterboarding procedures . ”

Physicians for Human Rights , which released the report this week outlining allegations of illegal human subject research and experimentation on detainees , said it filed the complaint Wednesday with seven other organizations with the US Department of Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections .
The office “ should initiate immediately an official investigation ” into the evidence , which the group said was detailed in declassified government documents .
The division , which sets guidelines for government research on humans including by the CIA , “ has a legal responsibility to investigate these disturbing new allegations about the CIA and possible illegal human experimentation on detainees , ” said Nathaniel Raymond , lead author of the report .
The CIA has rejected the report as erroneous .
“ The CIA did not , as part of its past detention program , conduct human subject research on any detainee or group of detainees , ” said CIA spokesman George Little earlier this week .

Joining in the complaint were Amnesty International USA , the Bill of Rights Defense Committee , the Center for Constitutional Rights , the Center for Victims of Torture , Human Rights Watch , the National Religious Campaign Against Torture and Psychologists for Social Responsibility .

TORONTO , Canada —
A week before leaders of the world ’s most powerful countries were set to gather near Toronto , a group of young women presented their own plan to tackle global challenges .
The 21 young women , all chosen for their leadership skills , had spent days discussing many of the same issues to be debated at the G8 and G20 meetings , in an event of their own dubbed the G( irls ) 20 summit .
Now sitting in front of a room packed with reporters , four of them presented the results of their efforts : a blueprint that stressed the role of women and girls in solving the world ’s economic , social and medical crises .
“ What we ’ve noticed during our discussions … is how interconnected everything is , ” 19 - year - old Leah Stuart - Sheppard , Canada ’s voice in the group , told reporters .
“ And how important it is to have education so that health care can be improved ... and women ( can ) have the economic potential and capability , because they ’ve been empowered through education , through vocational training and things like that .
“ We hope every G20 leader and country , and expanding beyond that , all the change - makers in every country will … take some of the recommendations we ’ve made , ” she said , referring to the document drafted during their discussions .
The inaugural G( irls ) 20 Summit brought together delegates from every G20 nation and one from the African Union , each of them already engaged in grassroots projects and international campaigns .
The goal , organizers say , was to remind world leaders that women have a crucial role to play in solving the world ’s greatest problems .
Part training and part advocacy , the unique new program explores what it takes to educate girls — and how that learning ripples through a community .
While delegates pondered how to best help educate women at large , they also learned new skills for themselves .
Over the course of a week , the delegates attended a series of workshops to help them build networks and connect with the public , using social media and other tools .
“ We wanted to send them home with tools — media relations , government relations , financial literacy — skills they can apply to their own communities , ” said Farah Mohamed , president of the Belinda Stronach Foundation , which organized the summit .
The young women then charted a series of changes governments should implement to make education more accessible to girls , including free and compulsory education , improving sanitation in schools and adding sexual education and self - defense to school curricula .
They also came up with education initiatives to pursue in their own communities upon their return .
In the next year , the group will use their newfound connections to promote their projects , and keep track of each other ’s progress .
Alexandra Rose Rieger , 18 , plans to work within the school system .
The German delegate , who has long worked with children ’s charities , wants to create language programs in schools , to help immigrant children and families “ really adapt well into the culture , ” she said .
“ We also need to expand the curriculum for all students to include lessons in respecting different cultures . ”
Irem Tumer , Turkey ’s representative , will instead focus on establishing peer mentoring programs .
“ I believe that ( formal ) education is effective , but having a mentor to connect with can be more helpful in many ways , ” she said .
“ It ’s like having a life coach . ”
For many girls , mentors “ play a really important role , ” Mohamed said .
Most of the summit participants said a role - model or mentor had helped them achieve their goals , she said .
In turn , she said , these young women will become role - models for the next generation of girls — and next year ’s G( irls ) 20 group .

President Barack Obama gave Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu “ concrete guarantees ” that the US will strengthen Israel ’s strategic capabilities , sources in Jerusalem said late Sunday evening .
Top government officials said there has recently been a “ significant upgrade in ties ” regarding security understandings between Washington and Jerusalem .
Over the weekend , Israeli officials were angered and surprised by the Obama administration ’s decision to support the vote at the UN by 189 member states of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to single out Israel for its alleged possession of nuclear weapons , was told on Sunday .
The vote Friday garnered an unusually harsh Israeli retort over the weekend , in which the Prime Minister ’s Office said the resolution “ ignores the realities of the Middle East ” and focuses “ on the only country in the world that is actually threatened with annihilation .
” Netanyahu seemed to reiterate the point in a speech in Toronto on Sunday , in which he told some 7,000 people gathered at the city ’s Ricoh Coliseum ahead of the annual United Jewish Appeal of Greater Toronto Walk for Israel that “ the establishment of the State of Israel has given the Jewish people the power to repel the attacks on the Jewish people .
“ There are those who want to strip Israel of that power , ” he warned .
“ I promise you that will never happen .
Israel will never give up the power to defend itself .
” Referring to Iran as the number one threat to Israel , Netanyahu said , “ We have to ensure that this regime , the world ’s leading sponsor of terrorism , does not acquire the weapons of mass death .
” The American vote in support of the resolution on Israel ’s nuclear facilities has cast a shadow over the Tuesday meeting in the White House between Netanyahu and Obama .
That meeting , which was originally intended to deal with recent advances in the diplomatic process as US - mediated proximity talks with the Palestinian Authority began , will now deal also with the nuclear issue .
“ This vote left us feeling that the White House is saying that Israel ’s needs are expendable in the search for international consensus , ” a diplomatic source said on Sunday .
Intelligence Services Minister and security cabinet member Dan Meridor added that Israel had believed that the US was working toward a “ much more balanced proposal ” at the UN parley .
Speaking to Channel 1 on Sunday , Meridor said “ the issue will come up [ in Tuesday ’s Netanyahu - Obama summit ] in all its seriousness , and I hope we ’ll be able to find ways to correct the damage .
” Obama criticized the resolution over the weekend , saying , “ We strongly oppose efforts to single out Israel , and will oppose actions that jeopardize Israel ’s national security .
” But Netanyahu is expected to use Tuesday ’s meeting to ask why the US allowed the resolution to pass in the first place .
The answer may reflect a confused American policy , according to Middle East scholar and former ambassador to Washington Itamar Rabinovich .
“ The Americans were trapped in a contradiction – the commitment to Israel ’s [ nuclear ] nondisclosure policy alongside Obama ’s desire to enact a larger reform on the nuclear issue .
They could n’t sustain that contradiction , ” he explained in an interview on Israeli television Sunday , so the administration was forced to sacrifice Israel ’s interests on that issue in order to obtain a consensus resolution on non-proliferation .
“ I would n’t call this a betrayal , but it was a misstep , ” Rabinovich said .
The 28 - page resolution voted on Friday was the concluding statement of a monthlong parley of NPT member nations .
It calls for the reduction of nuclear warhead stockpiles by the world ’s nuclear powers and urges an increase in the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
Meanwhile , Netanyahu used his speech in Toronto to reiterate his long - standing insistence on a demilitarized Palestinian state as a key Israeli demand in peace talks , saying that Israel could n’t afford a third Iranian presence – in addition to Lebanon and Gaza – overlooking the hills of Tel Aviv .
“ We must insure that any future Palestinian state is effectivelydemilitarized – not just a paper agreement .
We ’ve had a lot of paperagreements with the international community .
We had one in Lebanon – itdid n’t work .
And we had one in Gaza that did n’t work .
Here we must haveeffective arrangements on the ground , in which Israel and Israel alonecan vouch for its security .
We ’re prepared to make compromises forpeace , but I ’m not willing to make any compromises on our security , ” hesaid .
Netanyahu also insisted that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state , to more applause .
“ Just we as we are asked to recognize a nation state for the Palestinian people , the Palestinians will have to recognize Israel asthe nation state of the Jewish people , ” he said .

Here ’s a strange detail of IEEE floating point arithmetic : computers have two versions of 0 : positive zero and negative zero .
Most of the time the distinction between +0 and - 0 does n’t matter , but once in a while signed versions of zero come in handy .
If a positive quantity underflows to zero , it becomes +0 .
And if a negative quantity underflows to zero , it becomes - 0 .
You could think of +0 ( respectively , - 0 ) as the bit pattern for a positive ( negative ) number too small to represent .
The IEEE floating point standard says 1/+0 should be +infinity and 1 /- 0 should be - infinity .
This makes sense if you interpret +/- 0 as the ghost of a number that underflowed leaving behind only its sign .
The reciprocal of a positive ( negative ) number too small to represent is a positive ( negative ) number too large to represent .
To demonstrate this , run the following C code .
int main ( ) { double x = 1e - 200 ; double y = 1e - 200 * x ; printf ( " Reciprocal of +0 : %g
" , 1/y ) ; y = - 1e-200*x ; printf ( " Reciprocal of -0 : %g
" , 1/y ) ; }
On Linux with gcc the output is
Reciprocal of +0 : inf Reciprocal of - 0 : - inf
Windows with Visual C++ returns the same output except Windows prints infinity as 1#INF rather than inf .
( See these notes for more on how Windows and Linux handle floating point exceptions . )
There is something , however , about signed zeros and exceptions that does n’t make sense to me .
The aptly named report “ What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating Point Arithmetic ” has the following to say about signed zeros .
In IEEE arithmetic , it is natural to define log 0 = -∞ and log x to be a NaN when x < 0 .
Suppose that x represents a small negative number that has underflowed to zero .
Thanks to signed zero , x will be negative , so log can return a NaN .
However , if there were no signed zero , the log function could not distinguish an underflowed negative number from 0 , and would therefore have to return -∞ .
This implies log( - 0 ) should be NaN and log ( +0 ) should be -∞ .
That makes sense , but that ’s not what happens in practice .
The log function returns -∞ for both +0 and - 0 .
I ran the following code on Linux and Windows .
int main ( ) { double x = 1e - 200 ; double y = 1e - 200 * x ; printf ( " Log of +0 : %g
" , log (y ) ) ; y = - 1e-200*x ; printf ( " Log of -0 : %g
" , log(y ) ) ; }
On Linux , the code prints
Log of +0 : - inf Log of - 0 : - inf
The results were the same on Windows , except for the way Windows displays infinities .

The Adams Theory of Content Value :
As our ability to search for media content improves , the economic value of that content will approach zero .
I heard someplace , albeit unreliably , that 90 % of all music that people own for personal use is stolen .
Let ’s agree that the real figure is some large number , if not 90 % .
And you can already obtain every top - selling book , TV show , and movie on the Internet for free , assuming you do n’t mind mixing your shopping with your copyright crime sprees .
Newspapers , magazines , and comics such as Dilbert have been freely available on the Internet for years .
At the moment , plenty of people still pay for media content .
Those reasons will evaporate .
Let ’s consider books .
Most people still prefer old - timey tree - based books , but the Kindle and other ebook readers are eating into that preference quickly .
I have n’t yet heard of anyone buying a Kindle and later returning to a preference for regular paper books .
It appears to be a one way ride .
The Kindle , and similar devices , are designed for buying legal copies of books , which is a doomed attempt to forestall the inevitability of all media content becoming free .
Now comes the iPad , which is destined to become primarily a criminal tool , and it will cause a change in society the same way that widespread illegal boozing caused a change in Prohibition laws .
I ’m not saying the changes will be bad , just inevitable .
The iPad has a browsing capability that allows you to see any content on the Internet , legal or not , and consume it from just about anywhere .
Once you have an iPad , the only reasons to ever buy physical books , magazines , or newspapers will be :
You might want to read outdoors , where the iPad is n’t so good .
You do n’t want to break the law .
It ’s still a little bit hard to search for illegal content .
Kindle is cheaper than an iPad .
My guess is that the iPad will someday be easy to read in bright light , perhaps working in concert with your sunglasses of the future .
And when Kindle owners begin to factor in the unnecessary cost of books , they will start to see the iPad as a bargain .
Then there ’s the issue of not wanting to break the law .
Every kid understands that stealing is wrong .
But ask the average ten - year old about copyright law and watch for the blank stare .
Students are taught to freely download copyrighted content from the Internet for school reports , which I understand is legal in the context of education .
And at the same time , every school kid is learning from friends that downloading music and movies from the Internet is common practice .
Paying for content on the Internet is strictly a generational thing , and it will pass .
Those of you reading this blog are already savvy enough to find and download any content you want for free .
But I ’ll bet the average 40 - something user of the Internet still would n’t know how to search the Internet for criminally free content .
At some point , I assume , a Google search for any popular book title will return an illegal source at the top of the page .
When that happens , Amazon.com will primarily be selling electronics , household products , and clothes .
I predict that the profession known as “ author ” will be retired to history in my lifetime , like blacksmith and cowboy .
In the future , everyone will be a writer , and some will be better and more prolific than others .
But no one will pay to read what anyone else creates .
People might someday write entire books – and good ones – for the benefit of their own publicity , such as to promote themselves as consultants , lecturers , or the like .
But no one born today is the next multi- best - selling author .
That job wo n’t exist .
As an author , my knee - jerk reaction is to assume that the media content of the future will suck because there will be no true professionals producing it .
But I think suckiness is solved by better search capabilities .
Somewhere out in the big old world are artists who are more talented than we can imagine , and willing to create content for free , for a variety of reasons .
And so , as our ability to search for media content improves , the economic value of that content will approach zero .
Night of the Living Wonks
There are many sources of fear in world politics — terrorist attacks , natural disasters , climate change , financial panic , nuclear proliferation , ethnic conflict , and so forth .
Surveying the cultural zeitgeist , however , it is striking how an unnatural problem has become one of the fastest - growing concerns in international relations .
I speak , of course , of zombies .
For our purposes , a zombie is defined as a reanimated being occupying a human corpse , with a strong desire to eat human flesh — the kind of ghoul that first appeared in George Romero ’s 1968 classic , Night of the Living Dead , and which has been rapidly proliferating in popular culture in recent years ( far upstaging its more passive cousins , the reanimated corpses of traditional West African and Haitian voodoo rituals ) .
Because they can spread across borders and threaten states and civilizations , these zombies should command the attention of scholars and policymakers .
The specter of an uprising of reanimated corpses also poses a significant challenge to interpreters of international relations and the theories they use to understand the world .
If the dead begin to rise from the grave and attack the living , what thinking would — or should — guide the human response ?
How would all those theories hold up under the pressure of a zombie assault ?
When should humans decide that hiding and hoarding is the right idea ?
Serious readers might dismiss these questions as fanciful , but concern about flesh - eating ghouls is manifestly evident in today ’s popular culture .
Whether one looks at films , video games , or books , the genre is clearly on the rise .
According to conservative estimates , more than a third of all zombie films ever made were released in the past decade .
Zombies are clearly a global phenomenon : Beyond the United States , there have been Australian , British , Chinese , Czech , German , Irish , Italian , Japanese , Korean , Mexican , and Norwegian zombie flicks .
Zombie video games , including the Resident Evil and Left 4 Dead franchises , have also proliferated , attracting huge followings globally .
And zombies have clawed their way to the top of book best - seller lists in the last decade with literature ranging from how - to survival manuals to reinterpretations of early Victorian fiction .
“ In the world of traditional horror , nothing is more popular right now than zombies , ” one book editor gleefully told USA Today last year .
“ The living dead are here to stay . ”
This zombie boom is — and should be — taken seriously .
For some international relations thinkers , the interest in all things ghoulish might represent an indirect attempt to get a cognitive grip on what former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld once referred to as the “ unknown unknowns ” in international security .
Or perhaps there exists a genuine if publicly unacknowledged fear of the dead rising from their graves and feasting upon our entrails .
Major universities have developed mock contingency plans for a zombie outbreak , and an increasing number of college students have been found to be playing “ Humans vs. Zombies ” on their campuses , whether to relieve stress or prepare for the invasion of the undead .
The Haitian government takes the threat seriously enough to have a law on the books to prevent outbreaks of zombiism .
No great power has done the same publicly , but one can only speculate on what plans are being hatched behind closed doors .
From a public - policy perspective , zombies surely merit greater interest than other paranormal phenomena such as aliens , vampires , wizards , hobbits , mummies , werewolves , and superheroes .
Zombie stories end in one of two ways — the elimination / subjugation of all zombies , or the eradication of humanity from the face of the Earth .
If popular culture is to be believed , the peaceful coexistence of ghouls and humans is but a remote possibility — outside of Shaun of the Dead , at least .
Such extreme all - or - nothing outcomes are far less common in the vampire and wizard canons .
Indeed , recent literary tropes suggest that vampires can peacefully coexist with ordinary teens in many of the world ’s high schools , provided they are sufficiently hunky .
Zombies , not so much .
If it is true that “ popular culture makes world politics what it currently is , ” as a recent article in Politics argued , then the international relations community needs to think about armies of the undead in a more urgent manner .
What follows is an attempt to satiate the ever - growing hunger for knowledge about how zombies will influence the future shape of the world .
But this is a difficult exercise : Looking at the state of international relations theory , one quickly realizes the absence of consensus about the best way to think about global politics .
There are multiple paradigms that attempt to explain international relations , and each has a different take on how political actors can be expected to respond to the living dead .
I. The No - Drama School of Zombie Realpolitik
There are many varieties of realism , but all realists start with a common assumption : that anarchy is the overarching constraint of world politics .
Anarchy does not necessarily mean chaos or disorder , but rather the absence of a centralized , legitimate authority .
No matter what ardent cosmopolitans or crazed conspiracy theorists believe , there is no world government .
With no monopoly on the use of force in world politics , actors must take their own “ self - help ” measures to ensure their continued existence .
In a world of anarchy , the only currency that matters is power — the material capability to ward off pressure or coercion , while being able to influence others .
The anarchic global structure also makes it impossible for governments to fully trust each other , forcing states to be guided solely by their own national interests .
As this summary might suggest , realism has a rather dystopian and jaundiced view of the world .
In other words , it is perfectly comfortable in the zombie universe — particularly the world of George Romero ’s films .
How would the introduction of flesh - eating ghouls affect world politics ?
The realist answer is simple if surprising : International relations would be largely unaffected .
Although some would see in a zombie invasion a new existential threat to the human condition , realists would be unimpressed by the claim that the zombies ’ arrival would lead to any radical change in human behavior .
To them , a plague of the undead would merely echo older plagues , from the Black Death of the 14th century to the 1918 influenza pandemic .
To paraphrase Thucydides , the realpolitik of zombies is that the strong will do what they can and the weak must suffer devouring by reanimated , ravenous corpses .
Realists also predict balance - of - power politics , so would n’t the specter of the undead create a balancing coalition of humans against ghouls ?
This possibility cannot be ruled out .
If zombies emerged from central Eurasia , for example , their capacity to spread quickly could trigger an alliance designed to prevent zombie hordes from taking over the continent .
However , buck - passing would be an equally likely outcome .
In a buck - passing situation , states would refrain from taking an active stance against the zombies in the hopes that other countries would do the dirty work of uniting to slay the demon hordes .
States could also exploit the threat from the living dead to acquire new territory , squelch irredentist movements , settle old scores , or subdue enduring rivals .
The People ’s Republic of China could use the zombie threat to justify an occupation of Taiwan .
Russia could use the same excuse to justify intervention in its near abroad .
The United States would not be immune from the temptation to exploit the zombie threat as a strategic opportunity .
How large would the army of the Cuban undead need to be to justify the deployment of the 82nd Airborne ?
But in the end , realists , particularly American realists , would no doubt evoke the cautionary words of U.S. President John Quincy Adams and warn against going abroad “ in search of monsters to destroy . ”
II . Unite - to - Fight - Zombie Liberals
Like realism , there are many varieties of liberalism .
All liberals nevertheless share a belief that cooperation is still possible in a world of anarchy .
Liberals look at world politics as a non - zero - sum game .
Working together , whether on international trade , nuclear nonproliferation , or disease prevention , can yield global public goods on a massive scale .
Major actors in world politics have an incentive to realize the gains that come from long - term mutual cooperation and avoid the costs that come with mutual defection .
At first glance , the liberal paradigm appears to be pretty incompatible with a zombie canon that tends more to undead apocalypses .
Indeed , the tragedy of liberalism in a universe with zombies is that some of its central tenets would likely accelerate the rise of zombiism .
Open borders , for instance , would surely facilitate the cross - border spread of both the undead and infected human carriers .
A second glance reveals that the liberal paradigm offers some significant analytical bite .
Romantic zombie comedies — rom-zom - coms for short — contain both implicit and explicit elements of liberalism .
The 2009 film Zombieland is about the articulation of and adherence to well - defined rules for surviving in a zombie - infested landscape .
Its central message — beyond the need for cardio workouts — is the need for disparate individuals to credibly commit to each other .
At the climax of Shaun of the Dead , Shaun rallies his friends and relations with a stirring paean to liberalism : “ As Bertrand Russell once said , ‘ The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation . ’
I think we can all appreciate the relevance of that now . ”
And what would liberals do after a ghoul invasion ?
Provided that the initial spread of zombies did not completely wipe out governments , the liberal expectation would be that an international counterzombie regime could make significant inroads into the problem .
Given the considerable public - good benefits of wiping the undead from the face of the Earth , significant policy coordination seems a likely response .
The liberal paradigm would predict an outcome that would not be perfect and would be quite vulnerable to political criticism over time — much like the European Union .
That said , the system would also be expected to function well enough to ward off a total zombie apocalypse .
Zombie flare - ups would no doubt take place .
Quasi - permanent humanitarian counterzombie missions , perhaps under United Nations auspices , would likely be necessary in failed states .
Liberals would acknowledge that the permanent eradication of flesh - eating ghouls is unlikely .
The reduction of the zombie problem to one of many manageable threats , however , is quite likely .
Most countries would kill most zombies most of the time .
III .
Neoconservatism and the Axis of Evil Dead
The neoconservative policy response to an undead uprising would be simple and direct .
To paraphrase Robert Kagan , humans are from Earth , and zombies are from hell .
Neither accommodation nor recognition would be sustainable options in the face of the zombie threat .
Instead , neocons would recommend an aggressive and militarized response to ensure human hegemony .
Rather than wait for the ghouls to come to them , they would pursue offensive policy options that take the fight to the undead .
A pre-emptive strike against zombies would , surely , be a war against evil itself .
It is to neoconservatism ’s credit that this doctrine is consistent with extant work on how best to respond to the zombie menace .
Indeed , one recent simulation by researchers at Canada ’s Carleton University and the University of Ottawa offered just such a finding : “ An outbreak of zombies infecting humans is likely to be disastrous , unless extremely aggressive tactics are employed against the undead .… [ A ] zombie outbreak is likely to lead to the collapse of civilization , unless it is dealt with quickly . ”
However , other elements of neoconservatism might undercut the long - term viability of proponents ’ initial policy pronouncements .
For example , neoconservatives frequently assume that all adversaries are part of a single axis or alliance of evil enemies .
To be sure , that assumption works when confined to zombies , but it is unlikely that neoconservatives would stop there .
They would inevitably lump reanimated corpses with other human threats as part of a bigger World War III against authoritarian despots and zombies — an “ Axis of Evil Dead . ”
This would sabotage any attempt at broad - based coalition warfare , hindering military effectiveness in a Global War on Zombies ( GWOZ ) .
IV .
On Managing the Zombie Threat
This quick review of the theoretical paradigms reveals some interesting findings about the world in the age of zombies .
There is some continuity across the different theories .
For example , most approaches predict that the living dead would have an unequal effect on different governments .
Powerful states would be more likely to withstand an army of flesh - eating ghouls .
The plague of the undead would join the roster of threats that disproportionately affect the poorest and weakest countries .
The different international relations theories also provide a much greater variety of possible outcomes than the Hollywood zombie canon .
Traditional zombie narratives in film and fiction are quick to get to the apocalypse .
The theoretical approaches presented here , however , suggest that in the real world there would be a vigorous policy response to the menace of the living dead .
Realism predicts an eventual live - and - let - live arrangement between the undead and everyone else .
Liberals predict an imperfect but nevertheless useful counterzombie regime .
Neoconservatives see the defeat of the zombie threat after a long , existential struggle .
These scenarios suggest that maybe , just maybe , the zombie canon ’s dominant narrative of human extinction is overstated .
To be sure , disastrous outcomes are still possible .
Bureaucratic dysfunction could trigger a total collapse in state authority .
Public opinion and interest - group pressure could make multilateral cooperation more difficult .
A societal breakdown could also trigger a world in which the biological distinctions between humans and zombies would be immaterial — they would both act like traditional zombies .
Still , these are possible outcomes ; whether they are the likely outcomes is another question altogether .
In the end , what I am suggesting is that with careful planning and a consistent approach , the zombie threat can be managed .
The purpose of this essay is not to make a policy recommendation or suggest that one approach is superior to another .
It is up to the reader to exercise his or her own judgment in determining what to do with this information .
Indeed , interested and intelligent students of world politics should use their own brains — before the zombies do .
Dr Kelly ' could n't have slit his wrist as he was too weak '
Dramatic new testimony has heaped pressure on ministers to reopen the investigation into the death of Dr David Kelly .
A female colleague claims that the UN weapons inspector could not have committed suicide as claimed , as he was too weak to cut his own wrist .
Mai Pedersen , a U.S. Air Force officer who served with Dr Kelly 's inspection team in Iraq , said a hand and arm injury meant that the 59 - year - old even ' had difficulty cutting his own steak ' .
A female colleague claims Dr David Kelly could not have committed suicide as claimed , as he was too weak to cut his own wrist Mai Pedersen is the U.S. Air Force officer who served with Dr Kelly 's inspection team in Iraq .
Below is Miss Pederson in a picture taken 30 years ago
Miss Pedersen 's view is significant because she knew Dr Kelly so well , both personally and professionally
Dr Kelly was found dead in woods near his home in 2003 after the Government exposed him as the source of a BBC report questioning Tony Blair 's government 's case for war in Iraq .
In a letter to the new Attorney General Dominic Grieve through her lawyers , Miss Pedersen also said Dr Kelly had difficulty swallowing pills , casting serious doubt on the Hutton Inquiry conclusion that he swallowed 29 painkillers before slitting his left wrist .
Campaigners hope her extraordinary intervention will convince ministers of the need for a new investigation .
Mr Grieve has already indicated that he believes the case could merit a further inquiry .
Had she testified at the Hutton Inquiry , Miss Pedersen would have revealed that in the months leading up to his death Dr Kelly was unable to use his right hand for basic tasks requiring any strength such as slicing food because of a painful elbow injury .
Miss Pedersen says he would therefore have had to be a ' contortionist ' to have killed himself by slashing his left wrist , as Lord Hutton concluded in 2004 .
She called for a ' formal , independent , and complete ' review of the case at the earliest opportunity , saying it was the only way to achieve ' closure ' .

The letter said the absence of a full coroner 's inquest into Dr Kelly 's death and ' perpetual secrecy ' meant it was ' crying out ' for further scrutiny .
Dr Kelly , who worked for both the UN and later the Ministry of Defence , was found dead seven years ago next month in an Oxfordshire wood .
He was said to be deeply upset after being exposed as the source of a controversial BBC news report questioning Britain 's grounds for going to war in Iraq .
The report , by journalist Andrew Gilligan , stated that Tony Blair 's press spokesman Alastair Campbell had ' sexed up ' the case for war for political reasons .
But , unusually for a death of this nature , no full coroner 's inquest has ever been held .
Instead , Tony Blair appointed retired judge Lord Hutton to chair a non-statutory public inquiry into the circumstances leading to his body being discovered .

He concluded he died by haemorrhage after slashing his left wrist

Witnesses , who included Dr Kelly 's widow , Janice , and Tony Blair , were not questioned under oath .
Lord Hutton concluded that Dr Kelly died by haemorrhage after slashing his left wrist but , as the Mail reported last week , his death certificate was officially registered before the Hutton Inquiry ended and it was not properly completed .
It was not signed by a doctor or coroner and does not state a place of death , as all death certificates should if this information can be established .
This leaves open the possibility that he died somewhere other than where his body was found .

The report stated that Tony Blair 's press spokesman Alastair Campbell ( pictured ) had ' sexed up ' the case for war for political reasons
To further deepen the mystery , all evidence relating to the post - mortem has been classified for an incredible 70 years .
Miss Pedersen 's view is significant because she knew Dr Kelly so well , both personally and professionally .
Janice Kelly , widow of Dr Kelly , was not questioned under oath at the inquiry
The pair worked together in Iraq in the 1990s and remained close friends until his death , although Miss Pedersen , 50 , has always that she and Dr Kelly were not romantically involved .
She was initially asked to give evidence to the Hutton Inquiry in 2003 and agreed to do so , but was not called .
This was because , it is claimed , the inquiry would not allow her to testify in private .
Her letter to Mr Grieve , dated June 10 , states : ' We understand you have indicated a willingness to consider possibly reopening the investigation into the continuing controversy into the death of Dr Kelly .
' Given the absence of any coroner 's inquest and the perpetual secrecy surrounding the post - mortem examination , it is painfully obvious that this matter continues to cry out for a formal , independent and complete review .
Ms Pedersen fully supports and adds her voice to such an effort .
' The passage of time [ does ] not diminish either the public 's interest or the government 's responsibility to ascertain the full truth , whatever that might be .'
The Hutton Report failed to allay suspicions of foul play in Dr Kelly 's death .
On the morning of July 17 , Dr Kelly mysteriously told a friend by email that there were ' many dark actors playing games ' .
In 2007 it was discovered , through a Freedom of Information request , that the pruning knife he is said to have used to cut his wrist had no fingerprints on it .
MONTREAL
By the time the three - year clock ran out on the Meech Lake constitutional accord on June 23 1990 , Parliament Hill was quieter than a funeral parlour .
As is usually the case in late June , the House of Commons stood adjourned for the summer .
Over the last days of the Meech episode , the multi-year campaign to enshrine the deal ratified by 10 premiers and the prime minister at Meech Lake in 1987 in the Constitution had shifted to Manitoba and Newfoundland .
Until the very end , federal strategists hoped against hope and , eventually , against reason that the two hold - out provinces would make the Meech Accord whole by ratifying it .
The entire Liberal clan was gathered in Calgary to choose a successor to John Turner and so was the bulk of the parliamentary press gallery .
Delegates and reporters alike were glued to the few available television sets for breaking news from Winnipeg or St. John’s .
Only a skeleton crew of journalists — made up mostly of die - hard constitutional watchers who would go on to spend another half - decade on the unity treadmill covering the rout of the 1992 Charlottetown accord and the sovereignist near - win of the 1995 Quebec referendum — was on hand to hear federal officials pronounce the official death of the accord .
Saint - Jean - Baptiste day was two days later and Mulroney was scheduled to celebrate Quebec ’s Fête nationale in his riding .
On June 24th 1990 , a very quiet group of advisers and journalists boarded a small plane for the tiny Charlevoix locality of Rivière - St - François .
There , Mulroney swore that Canada would remain united .
He vouched his government would pursue efforts to formally bring Quebec into the constitutional fold and continue to treat the province as a distinct society .
Then he joined a group of musicians for a sing - along and on that surrealistic note , the small crowd quietly broke up .
On the news that night , Mulroney was upstaged by images of the hundreds of thousands of Quebecers who had turned downtown Montreal into a sea of fleurdelysés flags earlier in the afternoon .
It would not be the last time he was upstaged .
On the day 20 years ago when Meech foundered , Mulroney was at the peak of his power .
At the half - way point of a second majority mandate , he had beaten long odds by successfully crafting a historic free trade agreement with the United States .
But on June 23 , 1990 , his luck ran out and his performance the next day , in Rivière - St - François , was his swan song .
After the Meech finale , the federal future turned out to belong to other players .
Jean Chrétien , who had been greatly helped in his quest for the Liberal leadership by the anti-Meech wave , was one of them .
He would go on to win the next three elections .
Lucien Bouchard left Mulroney ’s cabinet over the handling of the Meech file a month before the accord ’s ultimate demise .
Over the following five years , he would create the Bloc Québécois ; lead it to official opposition status in the Commons and , in the process , alter the fundamental dynamics of federal politics in a lasting way .

The Meech debate also paved the way for an unlikely Alberta policy wonk called Stephen Harper to go from founding member of a right - wing regional party — borne out of the backlash over Mulroney ’s approach to Quebec — to Canada ’s 22nd prime minister .
As constitutional overhauls go , the Meech Lake Accord was a modest effort of ultimately limited scope .
In hindsight , its demise has brought about a more unpredictable transformation of the Canadian political landscape than its adoption would have had .
Twenty years after the fact , that transformation is still ongoing .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad signed Wednesday a new amendment to a law in the Islamic Republic that forbids the airing of advertisements for " Zionist companies . "
The blacklist of prohibited companies is comprised mainly of international companies , mainly American , owned by Jews or that operate branches in Israel .
Among those on the list are Coca Cola , Nestle , Intel , and IBM .
The boycott is rooted in Iran 's " Palestinian support law , " which acts as a response to assertions that Israel prevented goods from entering the Gaza Strip during its raid on the flotilla
Coca Cola .
In Ahmadinejad 's crosshairs .

The amendment obligates a number of government ministries to establish a committee to identify and locate products from " Zionist " companies being sold in Iran .
In addition , this committee will be charged with finding the names of leading figures in the blacklisted companies so that they may be boycotted as well .
This move is another link in the chain of efforts made by Iran to isolate Israel in the world in accordance with a decision passed in Iranian parliament on the matter .
Iran also plans on bringing forth a resolution to boycott Israel in the UN and in other international forums , including the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League .
The amendment also obligates the Iranian foreign ministry to present annual reports on the progress made in the Israeli boycott .
Beyond wanting to bring harm to Israel , the amendment may also be an indirect response to the new round of sanctions recently imposed on Iran by the West over its nuclear program .
The move is intended mainly for internal purposes , in order to increase civilian support of the Palestinians .

FORT WORTH , Texas - Bruce Florence 's family was his motivation for working hard .
For more than a decade , he was a regular sight at the Walmart in Westworth Village , greeting customers , ringing up purchases and stocking merchandise , his wife , Cathey Florence , said .
He also frequently worked a second job to further provide for her and their 14 - year - old daughter , Kelsey Bernae Florence .
" He did n't want his daughter to go without anything , " Florence said .
" Life was about her .
He wanted her to go to college .
He wanted her to be somebody . "
But on June 14 , Bruce Florence was knocked to the ground when he tried to stop a man who was trying to walk out without paying for a $ 348 TV .
Florence was hospitalized with a head injury until he died on Father 's Day .
" Bruce was a good man who left behind a loving family and good friends , " said Darrell Bartell , a Walmart co-worker .
" He did n't die defending his country or saving someone 's life .
He died because a coward wanted a television set . "
William Alan Kennedy , 37 , of Fort Worth , was already in the Tarrant County Jail , charged with aggravated robbery in the Westworth Village case .
He is a suspect in six similar Fort Worth thefts , police have said .
The Tarrant Count medical examiner 's office has not yet ruled on the cause and manner of Florence 's death .
If it is ruled a homicide , Westworth Village police say , it will be up to the Tarrant County district attorney 's office whether new charges are filed against Kennedy .
" If the police present us with additional facts , then we will consider additional charges at that time , " Assistant District Attorney Kevin Rousseau said Tuesday .
About 2 p.m. June 14 , Bruce Florence , working in the lawn and garden department , spotted a man carrying a 26 - inch Vizio television and heading toward the exit .
Florence stepped in front of the man , but he barreled right over him , dropping the TV in the process , Westworth Village police Detective John Moore said .
" It was kind of like a football player where you bull rush somebody , " Moore said .
The man ran out the door and got into a waiting white sport utility vehicle , whose driver has still not been identified .
That night , Kennedy was arrested by officers looking for a suspect in a similar shoplifting case that occurred June 10 at the Walmart at 3851 Airport Freeway in Fort Worth .
Lt. Paul Henderson , a Fort Worth police spokesman , said a Walmart employee got the license tag number of the white SUV used as a getaway vehicle , and investigators determined it had been rented by Kennedy , he said .
Kennedy is a suspect in five similar Fort Worth thefts , four involving Walmarts , Detective Leslie McGee said .
Kennedy was in the Tarrant County Jail on Tuesday night with bail set at $ 55,000 .
He has been charged in one of the Fort Worth shoplifting cases and on the Westworth Village aggravated robbery charge .
Tarrant County court records show he has previous convictions for theft , evading arrest and possession of a controlled substance .
Cathey Florence said that her husband had been awaiting a liver transplant , but he had been able to work at Walmart and serve as a deacon at his church .
While in the hospital , he remained conscious and talking , she said .
" They told me they had got the bleeding ( in his brain ) and everything under control , " she said .
But on Thursday , Cathey Florence said , she arrived to find her husband with a runny nose and slurring his words .
" He was up walking .
I said , You need to put your shoes on .
You 're going to catch a cold .
It looks like you 're getting sick , ' " Cathey Florence said .
" He said , I 'll be all right .
I 'll probably be coming home this week , ' but it never happened . "
By Friday , Bruce Florence was n't talking at all and was in what doctors called a " sleep mode " brought on by a high ammonia level , she said .
" I kept talking to him .
I would put lotion on his feet and hands , talking to him and reading Scripture to him , but there was no response , " Cathey Florence said .
" On Sunday , the doctor came out and told us he was n't going to come out of this .
It was just a matter of time before he would code . "
That night , just minutes before midnight , Bruce Florence was pronounced dead .
" We keep expecting him to walk through the door , but it 's not going to happen , " Cathey Florence said .
Hilda Ferris , manager of the Westworth Village Walmart , said Tuesday : " Our thoughts and prayers are with Bruce 's loved ones during this difficult time .
We 've lost a valued member of our family , and he will be missed .
" Bruce was an outstanding associate who never met a stranger ; but , most importantly , he was our friend . "
A Chinese man who spent almost 10 years in jail for murder has been freed after his supposed victim was found alive .
Zhao Zuohai had a fight with his neighbour , who then disappeared , and was charged when a headless , decomposed body was found 18 months later .
The miscarriage of justice came to light when the neighbour , Zhao Zhenshang , returned to his village in Henan province to seek welfare support .
He had fled after their fight because he feared he had killed Zhao Zuohai .
Mr Zhao 's conviction for murder was reportedly based mainly on a confession .
His brother said police had forced him to drink chilli - tainted water and set off fireworks above his head in order to make him confess .
Correspondents say convictions in the Chinese court system are strongly dependent on confessions , motivating police to use force to get one .
Henan Provincial Higher People 's Court has ordered an investigation into the case and the original judges will be punished .
Mr Zhao was initially sentenced to death for the crime , but the sentenced was commuted to 29 years in prison .
While he was in jail , his wife remarried and several of his children were adopted .

Roadmap shows the way for nuclear future
18 June 2010
Share
Nuclear power could become the world 's single biggest source of electricity , said a roadmap revealed today by intergovernmental agencies .
Industry says the projections are not ambitious enough .
The roadmap for the potential of nuclear in a world that reduces its carbon dioxide emissions by 50 % by 2050 was produced by the International Energy Agency at the request of the Group of Eight industrialized nations ( Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia , the UK and USA ) .
In doing so it enlisted the help of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the World Nuclear Association ( WNA ) .
Addressing the current issues slowing the increase of nuclear power , the report discusses the actions industry and government must take to resolve them .
Some of the issues - such as skills and manufacturing capacity - are already being dealt with and would rapidly respond to market forces caused by high demand for nuclear power .
Others are far more difficult : " A clear and stable policy commitment to nuclear energy as part of overall energy strategy is a pre-requisite . "
Immediately however the most pressing problem is the high up - front cost of building a new nuclear power plant , and manufacturers must reduce this financial burden and the risk it carries through standardisation and experience .
Annual power sector carbon dioxide emnission reductions in the
BLUE Map scenario in 2050 compared to the Baseline scenario ,
by technology area .
Nuclear is the only major contributor that
needs no technical breakthrough ( Source : IEA )
Given correct action to promote a stable policy regime and an adequate industrial base by 2020 , nuclear power could grow by 320 % to 1200 GWe before 2050 .
Achieving this would mean completing about 20 large reactors each year , meaning " the rate of construction starts of new nuclear plants will need to roughly double from its present level by 2020 , and continue to increase more slowly after that date . "
This clearly achievable rate of work is enough to replace every single reactor operating now and grow nuclear power 's contribution to 24 % of global electricity supplies even while energy demand doubles .
The IEA said the scenario above is based on assumptions of some " constraints on the speed with which nuclear capacity can be deployed . "
A high nuclear scenario , which the roadmap did not examine in detail , places nuclear power at 38 % of power supplies with a total generating capacity of about 1900 GWe .
This level of nuclear would bring even greater emissions savings - as well as an 11 % cut in power prices .
" An expansion of nuclear energy is thus an essential component of a cost - effective strategy to achieve substantial global emissions reductions . "
WNA head John Ritch welcomed the positive nuclear projection but found it " still too cautious . "
The WNA 's Nuclear Century Outlook , Ritch noted , is " far more expansive and takes full account of the enormous potential for nuclear growth in China and India .
Those two countries alone , " he said , " could conceivably achieve as much nuclear expansion by 2050 as the IEA posits for the entire world .
Globally , the WNAs upside scenario for 2050 exceeds 3000 GWe . "
" Where WNA and IEA fully agree , " Ritch went on , " is on the imperative that governments align themselves squarely and unequivocally in support of nuclear power as the world 's premier clean - energy source .
The time for timidity and double - talk is long past .
Our world needs a bold , clear , pro-nuclear policy vision . "
Government was told in the roadmap action plan to lead public debate on nuclear energy , put proper regulation in place and implement financial support ( such as loan guarantees ) where required , while the nuclear industry was told that it must continue to operate existing plants at the highest levels of safety and efficiency .
Reactor vendors must take what steps they can towards standardization of the current generation of designs so that new reactors are be routinely built on time and budget by 2020 .
Vendors must also build up their supply chains and nuclear fuel companies will have to prepare for a large expansion in production from 2015 or 2020 .
Good cooperation with government research bodies should help Generation IV reactor designs come to market after demonstration around 2030 .
Finally , the benefit of international cooperation to facilitate all this was underlined , with a call to " maintain and strengthen where necessary international cooperation " in a range of areas .
Key to this would be " intergovernmental nuclear and energy agencies , international non-governmental industry and policy organisations . "

RE : Arbitrary
When I used to be given changes to make on behalf of an SEO as part of my job , they seem to change about monthly .
As far as I can tell , 90 % of the job is link building , so these changes it would appear are only being made either .
1 . Because they do n't know what they are doing
or
2 . They are trying to pretend there is something the client can't do in these tweaks ( blinding people witch science ) , unlike the link building which does n't * seem * to require qualifications and they could do themselves .
I admit in this case I am basing a practise on the evidence of 1 team , so it 's not really an overly valid point .

I submit to you that youy may have a shit SEO
but at the end of the day I can demonstrate that the work I do produces far more money than it costs , which is why I am worth it .
I stopped being a developer a long time ago and have done pretty much none at all for 3 or 4 years , but I have developers working for me and a very deep and broad knowledge ( deep in my discipline and broad in the field - I am a T shapes person ! )
I really think that I can do a lot of good and I have experience and practice in doing so .
( , Tue 22 Jun 2010 , 12:07 , archived ) ( , Tue 22 Jun 2010 , 12:07 ,
Do you not think that your background in development
is a strong benefit over your rival SEOs ?
Qualifications is one thing that many do not seem to have .
A background in the industry , honing in on the one aspect seems relevant , whereas coming from a sales background does not .
" I can demonstrate that the work I do produces far more money than it costs , which is why I am worth it . "
Good point , though do some people not just buy AdWords and when their sales go up , say this is a sign of success ?
Would you say that is an honest practise ?
As an un-argumentative aside , do you not think that link building is a somewhat sisyphean challenge - for as soon as you set them up , google discover them and knock them down .
Would you say a company is better approaching an SEO firm than a Viral Marketing firm to get links ?
If so , why ?
Do you think there is a long future in SEO , or are you just in it while the going 's good ?

If I might just answer your last question first ,
I am a technical consultant - yes I am good , but there are quite a few good SEOs about .
Maybe I am in the top 10 in the UK , but then I am SEO Director at the largest digital agency in Europe , so I fucking well ought to be good .
On the flip side of that , there are a lot of shit SEOs and , more importantly , a lot of good PPC chaps , media buyers , affiliates and so on who say they can do SEO in order to land a full service contract , which is what you are probably falling foul of .
AdWords is PPC , not SEO .
Sales people make shit SEOs , but they are good at selling it .
SEO should die - SEO should become part of D&B and not exist as a lone product , but that ( and the hiring of shit SEOs ) will only happen once marketing managers listen to professionals and stop building flashy poorly coded sites and developers learn to build sites well .

I would point out
SEO -ing is no exact science ; it 's constantly changing & evolving , and there really are no set rules how to do it .
That 's why some people are shit at it , and others are shit - hot at it ; a good SEO consultant will charge by results rather than time , and get stinkingly rich doing it ( rightfully so IMO ) .
I 'm not a SEO but I know a couple of people who are , and I 've been genuinely impressed with how in just days they can boost a site without even trying .
I 've also seen other self - proclaimed experts struggle to bring in 10 extra visitors over weeks .
Also a good web - dev needs to know about SEO if the site 's gonna have any chance of being ranked well ; there is some cross-over .

Cheating is half the game
In Googles ' ideal world , it would rank everything according to unbiased relevance .
SEO on the other hand is as much about making your relevance stand out , as is about tipping the scales in your favour through whatever tactics necessary .
It 's not supposed to be fair , goodness me . :)
Also , you 'll never know when Google et all will start to punish sites on certain underhand tactics .
The rules change almost daily sometimes , and if you get caught cheating your ranking will be punished ; often irrecoverably .
It 's a game .

nobody with no background in coding can give good technical consultancy as an SEO .
Of course , I do n't make the tweaks , I give them to the dev - it 's his baby , not mine .

Surely to understand what the tweaks are doing ,
a knowledge of code helps ?
Another bad experience :
An SEO once told me to remove the " javascript links " from my site .
He thought they were javascript because they changed colour when you rolled over them ... ie using CSS .
A knowledge of basic coding would have helped there .

Its only the same as the dot com boom
Where the last panel would have been true for web designers ( not even developers ) .
Give it a few years , and SEO and social media will cease to be black magic voodoo ( in the eyes of the old codgers who hold the cheque books in most companies ) , and most people designing the sites in the first place will get it right when they build the site .
I 'm writing this as someone works in all 3 fields of web development , SEO and Social Media ...

I completely agree with you .
SEO should just be the optimisation code - fixing side , which is a development skill .
And a one off charge .
However , most companies have a monthly charge which is often more than the website is worth , for which they are merely paying for spam ( which makes the company look bad ) or AdWords which they could buy themselves for far cheaper .
They use " optimisation " as a slight of hand to disguise from their spammy techniques .
They make changes each month to look like they are doing something technical .
Likewise , no companies * need *
Twitter or a Blog , and yet they are being oversold them all the time , lied to that it is a great way to get new business .
If you can write and enjoy writing , it perhaps is .
If you are writing a blog because you have to ... no one will read it .

I am willing to dispute it entirely .
I am an SEO ' expert ' and I am not very good at Flash , but I can get by , I am not good at pretty , but if you cannot code HTML , CSS , JS and understand a bit of VB , ASP , PHP and , for example , CURL , ASAPI , server configurations and write a pretty damn mean regex then you cannot really do your job .
Essentially , I would say that a web developer is like an SEO expert who just does not fucking bother to think about making his dev good for engines or the disabled user .
SEO is linking and ' not shit ' dev .
The reason SEOs exist is because most devs cannot manage that .

I agree that there are many developers who build bad code .
They are thus bad at their job .
However , since most SEOs have no background whatsoever in coding , I fail to see how hiring someone with less skills is more appropriate than finding a different dev who can do his job well .
It would be like if someone was still ill after seeing a homeopathist , sending them to someone who plans just to look up their problem on Wikipedia , rather than sending them to a proper doctor .

I read this elsewhere ...
" You know how they say the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt ?
It 's usually that .
A lot of webby people work their asses off to learn every relevant language , and every other skill that remotely applies to their field , then get out of school skeptical as to whether or not they can go tell an employer they 're also an SEO expert ( or replace that with any other skill that is n't their primary ) .
An idiot marketing major ( not saying marketing majors are idiots , just that a lot of idiots are marketing majors ) will get out of school thinking they 're some techy elitist for knowing how to register a gmail account , having taken one class on internet marketing that briefly covered SEO , and not hesitate to boast themselves to a potential employer that they 're an SEO expert .
When asked to go in more detail , they 'll cite their four years of school .
Ask that smarter techier person to go into more detail , they 'll cite one or two classes they 've taken on it , and mention that they go out of their way to build their sites to be search engine friendly , but have n't literally been paid specifically to do SEO .
To the employer , the marketing major who just sounded confident , rather than going into detail , will probably be their choice .
Of course , this is n't always the case , but I think it is quite often .
Best thing to do is probably to just cite all of your skills , and just make it absolutely clear to every employer what you 're really worth . "

SEO is a big subject and the snake oil needs changing a lot .
I would n't pay a dev to be pissing about with all that when there are 1001 other features that need to be knocked out by 5 pm yesterday .
There is the " business point " more than anything else .
I 've seen some fucking mental changes requested by an SEO that returns some nice results .

To be honest , it became an annoyance
when I looked to see if it is something I could offer my clients , and the more I looked into it , the more of a con the whole thing seemed to be .
The books I have read on it are all about possibilities and never proven facts .
No science whatsoever .
There is also very little theory behind it , proven or not .
Which would be all okay if it was offered as a small job .
However , it 's the fact people then dare then charge monthly fees for SEO which costs more than the site is actually worth by pretending it 's a really complex science .
If it was , they would need a degree in statistical analysis to do the research .
Reaching a high accessibility level does take real programming skill , and yet SEO ( the actually Optimisation side of it ) which should be a sub set of that job same seems to be an unqualified position .
I think you 'll find that it 's a shockingly low amount of SEOs who could build a site which even validates , and making a site validate is rarely part of what companies offer as SEO work .
If SEO meant that the Accessibility would be improved for people , at least it would have some positives !

Validation * is* important to accessibility
If bad code breaks a site in certain browsers , it could well break a screen reader , which is ultimately another browser .
It maybe not so important with SEO , but could confusing code not also confuse the Google spider , which is ultimately also html - parsing software ?
There is also the cross -over with things like alt - tags .
Back on topic - I fail to find out what skill sets an SEO uses on a day to day basis which deserves the high price they charge .
I 'm not saying all the work is invalid , but do you really not think that a lot of people are abusing the fact that most business people have heard of SEO , think they need it but are ignorant to what they are actually paying for on a day - to - day basis ?
I do n't mean to slander * everyone * - and I am willing to admit that my own research hit a brick wall when I started looking into link building and felt dirty , so if I may have just done a bad job on the actual optimisation side .
However , I 've yet to find anyone who can explain what it is they actually do that requires an expertise that people should pay premium rates for .
I like to think that I am willing to change my opinion , and it might be bad experience - but when I 've asked why a theory exists or why a change needs to be made , it 's rare that anyone seems able to qualify it with anything other than hearsay .
Again , a lot of them do not seem to actually use common " Would Google have any reason for doing this ? " sense when they do optimisation .
Eg
The recent theory about page speed .
You see blogs obsessing about milliseconds difference , when surely Google is only trying to weed out sites that are on a stupidly slow server and piss people off , rather than the rank a site that takes 0.5 seconds to load over one that takes 0.7 seconds .

That is why you often separate
design and development .
The developer * should * be trained in areas of accessibility when they build the site .
If they are not , they are failing in their job .

What qualifications does a designer / developer need ?
Reason I asked is the designer / devs I know , probably about 45 % of them do not have any sort of formal qualifications but know a bit of PHP / Design .
A lot of the training of them in UX / accessibility is done inhouse , which I 'd imagine SEO is or will become the same
My training is through trial & error on my own sites , reading books - including the one you 've used in your image - and a hell of a lot of blogs .
I 'll be honest , there are some really terrible SEO 's out there , and there 's a lot of misinformation out there , so it takes a lot to get through it .
I will maintain my stance .
Build a website & leave it there and nothing will happen to it .
Do n't tweet , do n't link to it & nothing will happen .
That 's not what companies want .
Companies want to make money , which is what a good SEO will do - provide a return on investment .

A developer needs
to understand at the very least html , css , javascript , one server side language , usability , web standards and accessibility .
If they want to move up in their job , then they 'd need to learn more .
A designer needs a mixture of usability and the more abstract " eye for design " , plus detailed knowledge of Photoshop and Illustrator .
They 'd also need extra knowledge if they want to apply their skills to print work .
Out of interest , what is your opinion on the ethics of spamming blogs and directories ?
That seems to be the main way people do SEO .

Okay back on point
" My point is :
You do what anyone could learn to do in a week , pretend it 's rocket science and charge a lot for very little .
Argue back to that point . "
It is in essence simple .
You 're exactly right .
SEO is all about the following :-
1. Producing a site that both looks decent AND is indexible in the search engines .
2 . Write content that both is readable by users , and as well includes a range of keywords that you would like to be ranking for in Google .
Again , it 's not that hard !
3 . Market your content to relevant people in the hope of getting links to it .
There we go , it 's learnt .
However , a good SEO will have a list of directories that AREN 'T free for all & spammy ( which are rarer & rarer these days ) .
A good SEO will help grow bloggers blogs & their clients sites by being useful .
A good SEO will craft contact that will both be readable by the search engines & not be drier than the Sahara Desert .
Building a list of contacts take time & expertise , which people will pay for .
I sell advertising on my sites , they are sponsored links .
I will not have an issue with anybody selling advertising on their website .
I have an issue with two things :-
1. People who sell people paid links without explaining the risk .
2 . People who have a go at SEO firms whilst - assumingly ( and yes I 'm assuming here ) - profiting from them .
( , Mon 21 Jun 2010 , 19:24 , archived ) ( , Mon 21 Jun 2010 , 19:24 ,
.
So you agree with me that SEO consists of producing an indexable site with good contents and then trying to get relevant links ?
I do n't believe there is anything more to it than this ( excluding black hat SEO ) .
You claim that the following are a skill set which is worth paying high rates for :
1 ) A good SEO will have a list of paid for directories to place a clients site .
As you do not know the algorithm used by any search engine today ( let alone how it will change tomorrow ) , then surely you cannot possible asses the quality of a directory link ?
You can only fall back on anecdotal evidence , which is not evidence at all .
Therefore if your clients were to cut you out and then randomly choose paid directories to list in , up to the value of your fees , then why would this not be better value for them ?
2 ) A good SEO will help grow bloggers blogs & their clients sites by being useful .
Nice and specific , ' by being useful ' , what does that mean ?
Can you link to an example of a useful blog post you have produced for SEO reasons ?
Can you explain why anyone would ever bother to read , let alone link to , a blog article written by a person who 's only role is to churn out blog articles without love of the subject matter ?
Without backlinks to your articles , you have achieved nothing more for your client than a single link from a page with infinitesimally low page rank .
3 ) A good SEO will craft contact ( sic ) that will both be readable by the search engines & not be drier than the Sahara Desert
Does that mean you have to have qualifications as a copywriter ?
If you do , fair enough .
I will happily concede that is a skilled job in itself .
4 ) Building a list of contacts take time & expertise , which people will pay for .
Yet again more vagueness , mysterious contacts .
Who are these contacts ?
Let me guess , if you told me , you 'd have to kill me .
I 'm not one of your clients , and you are not going to be able to fob me off simply by saying that you are an expert and have contacts .
What expertise ?
If you really have expertise then surely you should be able to be more specific about it .
As for trying to turn things back on me , which seems your approach to argument ( pointing out hypocrisy is not a logical argument - everyone is a hypocrite about some things and at least I get self - hate for anything spammy I do ) .
I admit that I have tried some spammy SEO techniques when seeing if I could use my viral work to promote my day job , though I felt cunty doing it , and so stopped .
Sometimes it feels like " If you can't beat them , join them " , though at least I try and link from things I have made for the right reasons and was charging no - one to spam on their behalf .
I 'll try and link build for myself via making things that I hope people like , and still build things when there is no seo value in it , but the only ' SEO '
I actually sell is based more around accessibility , and it's a low one - off charge for this , plus explaining the concept of link building so that their marketing teams can do it themselves .
And even then , I wo n't go out of my way to sell it as a separate cost , the optimisation I try and do as part of building a site .
I have no problem taking money from an SEO firm who want to buy links .
I do n't see why it is hypocritical .
I see you have worked on a tobacco site , so I assume you agree with all the ethics of the tobacco industry ?
The fact they can afford to buy the links just proves to me that there 's silly money in it .
If you want accusations of hypocrisy , you starting a post with a title " I have an in built hatered ( sic ) for web designers " is hardly not trying to provoke on a forum heavily populated by designers , so you can hardly complain when someone does an equally heavy - handed criticism of SEOs .
If , for example , you said to me that you are a qualified copywriter ( which you may well be ) , or a qualified statician ( which , again , if you are - then all this post is n't aimed at you ) , then I would say that you are worth the £ 200 a day you boasted about getting , if you are * very * good at it .
If however , as any books I have read on SEO suggest , it can be learnt in a day , I can't see why it is so lucrative unless it is a confidence trick .
I promise you that I am willing to listen to reason and change my mind , I just find people are only ever defensive rather than explanatory ( which hands up again , I was unnecessarily provocative in my above post for the sake of it ) .
I 'd just like to see actual evidence that it 's decent hard graft and worth the money .
Show me the evidence !

1. Dmoz is huge and well known .
Please give an example of a decent free one .
2 . According to your website , there are over 100 variables google takes into account , others say as many as 500 .
These change hundreds of times a year .
If you do testing , what statistical techniques to you use to keep your variables constant ?
How many sigmas is the confidence level of your results ?
If your tests are not scientifically valid , then the testing time is pointless .
Indeed , how do you test ?
As for not giving a guarantee , your website says " We will get you high positions on Google searches ( SEO ) " without any qualifier , does it not ?
3 . Why can you not divulge client blog posts ?
That suggests they are not up to scratch and you are scared I will point out their failings , or they do n't exist .
Of course your own blog is n't relevent , unless you say that all it takes to be qualified is to have your own blog ?
As Christopher Hitchens says , " What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence . "

2 & 4 . The examples you give are from a company I no longer work for .
I did recently change jobs .
£ 200 was the going rate for SEO in my old work , which included my wages , rent of the building , heating , leccy , etc .
Most business guides mention this .
Yes I know you got the examples from my CV , which is on my website .
3 . I can't divulge due to non disclosure agreements signed between the clients & myself .
Not unheard of in business .
5 . I am not twitter friends with many ( indeed I 'd say any ) clients , but you asked for my contacts list .
That 's right there .
The reason we can justify charging what we charge is that we can track that our work is earning the client far much more than what we charge them .
Again , with knowledge of Google Analytics - this can be proven .
Can you justify your earnings ?
I 'm assuming you 've done research on me .
You will also see that I know PHP to an adequate level , I admit I can't design for toffee , but I consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable when it comes to SEO .
Anyway I 'm prepared to take this discussion into private messaging , feeling it 's getting vitriolic .

Most business guides mention this .
Yes I know you got the examples from my CV , which is on my website .
3 . I can't divulge due to non disclosure agreements signed between the clients & myself .
Not unheard of in business .
5 . I am not twitter friends with many ( indeed I 'd say any ) clients , but you asked for my contacts list .
That 's right there .
The reason we can justify charging what we charge is that we can track that our work is earning the client far much more than what we charge them .
Again , with knowledge of Google Analytics - this can be proven .
Can you justify your earnings ?
I'm assuming you 've done research on me .
You will also see that I know PHP to an adequate level , I admit I can't design for toffee , but I consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable when it comes to SEO .
Anyway I 'm prepared to take this discussion into private messaging , feeling it 's getting vitriolic .

1 . You could just link reverse a site which had been SEOd by someone to find an easy list of directories , surely ?
2 . Fair enough , but you said you still test , so how do you test , and what is the accuracy of those tests ?
3 . " I can't divulge due to non disclosure agreements signed between the clients & myself .
Not unheard of in business . "
Seems unlikely , but could you tell me what your non disclosure agreement you give to clients says ?
5 . So , why did you bring it up as a qualification ?
" The reason we can justify charging what we charge is that we can track that our work is earning the client far much more than what we charge them . "
Is this not like homeopathy - the placebo effect sometimes works , so it 's fine to charge a fortune for very little ?
" Can you justify your earnings ? "
Yes , I breakdown costs and explain exactly what I 'm doing .
If a client thinks it excessive , they will go elsewhere .
I will offer them a range of options .
I will talk them through their site and see what they actually need .
Do you explain exactly what it is you are doing for a client or do you say it is all Top Secret and thus must be worth it .

It 's standard practise to link to your own site on websites you build , it was even before SEO was an issue ( although I imagine you were in business - school then ) .
My main point is that SEOs are paid a lot for nothing ie snake oil , annoyance with spamming is an aside .

Your accessibility page does n't validate , the " accessibility " link has green text on a green background , and many of the images have alt= " " .
Your accessibility page is therefore inaccessible .
Do your clients know that you are selling them non-validating pages as accessible , widdy ?
Is this something you are charging them less for ?

I think I work in exactly the same type of place as you .
However , my " SEO Expert " also has a proper job which takes up 90 % of his time , and the horseshittery ( this is from what I 've seen of what he does ) takes only 10 % of his time .
90 % of his SEO time is spent doing one of the following :
1. Set up a Twitter and Facebook account for [ company ]
2. Post update to [ company 's ]
Social Media accounts
This should not be a separate job in my opinion .
I fully agree with you regarding what SEO Expertise should be about is accessibility and good code .
Companies simply do n't need a Twitter or Facebook page as it will purely be spamming nearly 100 % of the time .
Link building is essentially cheating and I can't bring myself to do it as I feel people probably do n't respect companies they find doing this .
However , properly indexing your site with ( for example ) dmoz is something quite different .
It 's enabling your site to be found by search engines and then indexed as you would like .
However , the same logic also applies to websites themselves .
Some companies that I 've built websites for simply do n't need them .
It is equally hocum to sell websites to companies that have no need for them as it is to sell other companies SEO rubbish .
So as long as I do n't have to sell my soul to this kind of nonsense , or get involved very often with what s/he wants done , I do n't mind them having that job title .
I can live with it .
The salaries will probably equal out over time as every time a new job title comes along it always brings large salaries , then bosses realise and it'll come down .
It 's just the computing cycle I 'm afraid .
You should see the wages Ruby developers get .
I for my part produce accessible websites , but often forget to properly index them as there 's usually time constraints and everything gets pushed out slightly before it 's ready .

I 'm just not convinced it needs to be a separate job on its own .

Often this is the case .
I am being glib , of course , and almost everything that you need to know to be a good SEO is available through a mixture of common sense and Google .
If you are a small business then you are best off doing it yourself , but if you are a corporation or an SME then it is not unreasonable to pay an agency , rather than paying someone in house , since the cost is a hard one , the expertise is instantly available ( as it the experience of starting new campaigns and with a variety of platforms and sites ) and relationships exist already .
In the long term the ideal is to have someone heading up the site who has a broad understanding of all disciplines , but any large CMS comes with its own problems and short of having an entirely bespoke solution these will have to be navigated .

I qualify out more work than I accept
and I often pass on this sort of advice , or recommend smaller agencies ( http://www.puresystems.co.uk/ for example ) so yes , you are right .
Of course it does depend on the size of the work , the dependency on web and the abilities of the individuals available - if you have to hire someone to do the work then we are back in small agency territory again .
The aim of any engagement is to provide the best solution for a client - sometimes that is micro managing their campaigns , but on the flip side even some larger clients ( particularly within traditional press ) only really require a technical review , with recommendations and some training .

What 's the main difference
in skill set required by a client you think needs an expert and one you think just needs some training ?
Also , with so many inconsistent variables to consider , do SEOs you trust actually do proper testing , or are the ones that say they do just bullshitting to people ?
I 'd have thought that an SEO who is aware of the impossibility of testing and admits to working on likely theory is far more knowledgeable than someone who claims to do tests , or even does tests which I can not see have scientific value .

I 'm sure you 're going to say " bad seo "
but so many companies claim to test all of the small theories as part of their skill base .
eg testing for keyword density
There are so many variables to keep constant that I think it would be impossible to prove anything about this from any test .
Your test makes sense for the job , but when I worked for a company whose SEO team who passed all their work onto the developers , we were never once asked to build any sort of testing sites or tools .
I 'm sure the root of my cynicism comes down to that !
Ultimately , I 'd have thought that an expert would know the limits of what is testable , though I suspect many SEOs get work by saying " we know this through testing ... " , rather than " no one can know this but it makes logical sense in theory because ... " ( , Fri 25 Jun 2010 , 17:32 , archived ) ( , Fri 25 Jun 2010 , 17:32 ,
Ha Ha !
Now I can really throw the cat amongst the pigeons !
I work for a business developing applications in a system called Pega Rules Process Commander .
It 's a BPM suite made by PegaSystems .
I am not qualified in anything at all , but I 'm a bit of a self taught geek who has occasionally dabbled in HTML and Java , but not to any real level that I would consider ' programming ' .
The combination of a logical brain , genuine business experience , the stamina to work through techy books to expand my knowledge and a system to work with that makes sense to me has led me to call myself a ' system architect ' .
Having browsed the internets for information to further my knowledge of PRPC , I know that there is a growing level of hatred for people like me from traditional Java developers .
I do n't fully understand it , but they seem to struggle with the principles and simplicity of PRPC and seem to really resent its presence .
They want to be able to suck air through their teeth like a mechanic about to make a big quote when they are presented with any development work .
I just say " give me some requirements and I 'll let you know what I can do " .
On the whole , I can have a proof of concept test model ready within a week for any new application or enhancement , and I normally end up expanding on the requirements themselves since I have the business knowledge to do this as well .
On the whole , this POC model goes into production within a month , and so far I have not had any failures .
This is causing a bit of friction with all the old IT crowd .
They want to go through endless ' high level ' requirements that somebody being paid a lot of money can then turn into ' detailed requirements ' that can then be passed onto somebody else for an impact assessment including costings , that can then go on to a steering committee for further approval before engaging the technology team who can then assign several developers to work on it whilst a change team produce reams of planning documentation before we enter 5 stages of testing , including largely unnecessary regression testing , and then after a year or two , the change might me implemented , unless the budget has been blown and the whole thing has been dropped .
Developers do n't like me and my application , and understandably so .
Last change I made to the main business application cost them less than 10 k , but estimations from the traditional route put costs at a minimum of 150k !
This is not necessarily relevant , and I do understand the irritation with the whole SEO thing , but times move on , and systems and requirements change , and sometimes , it 's better to bite the bullet and go with it .
One thing I completely agree with is the Social Media ' Expert ' thing .
I 've never really ' got ' twitter , and as far as I can see , facebook is all about making a fool of yourself after a heavy saturday night .
Why is there a need for an ' expert ' , and why do people ( the media ) care ?!? ( , Tue 22 Jun 2010 , 0:48 , archived ) ( , Tue 22 Jun 2010 , 0:48 ,
Speaking as an SEO ...
I would n't have a job if web developers were perfect , but they rarely are .
I have written ASP code for professional ASP developers that could implement what I needed them to .
Same with PHP .
I have written reg-ex based URL mappings for mod_rewrite when the Apache server " expert " could n't .
The same goes for CSS & HTML .
A good SEO will have very deep knowledge of very narrow and specific aspects of web development ; deeper than most web developers .
I have acted as intermediary between user experience people and the web development team - usually backing the devs side of the argument and getting the decision swayed in their favour .
In an ideal world , there would be no need for SEOs , but the world is far from ideal and web developers ( as a whole , not individually ) are far from perfect .
The world is also full of shite SEOs , just like it is full of shite " web designers " who have done a distance learning course and have a " webmaster " qualification .
Just like it is full of people who think they know PHP because they read a book and can do a few basic things .
The main difference is that a professional organisation with an existing skill - base can pick out the shite developers because they are easy to spot .
I can pick out a shite SEO , because I know the subject , but your average organisation would n't be able to ; hence , the snake - oil salesmen manage to survive .
As the industry matures , it will be harder and harder for shite SEOs to make a living and they will drift away .
Maybe one day , web developers will get enough background knowledge in SEO not to create god-awful sites that do n't perform .
Do n't get me wrong , we already turn away business because a site is good and needs little doing to it , but these are in the far minority .
There are developers that have specialisms .
There is the go - to guy for PHP if you are stuck , there is the CSS guru .
In a similar vein , there will one day be the developer that knows SEO .
It will become integrated into web development and there will be someone that knows more about SEO than your average dev to turn to .
Until then , SEOs will be sticking around .

Yes , they are " bad " and it annoys the shit out of me .
But every industry has them .
We do include link building as a service , but I would rather we did not .
We get better results encouraging the client to product content that is naturally worth linking to , but the reality is that many do n't want this , they just want link building ; if we turned this business away , we would be poor as pure consultancy gigs are quite rare .
We strive to not generate shit spam links that piss off other web users , and see it as an opportunity to educate the client in better ways of going about pushing their site 's authority .
This is often a slow and painful process though .

Yeah , I tried putting a small link to my site on my popular posts
when I was experimenting with SEO for a month , felt dirty and spammy and so stopped .
Hence , why you 'll see it was only over a period of weeks .
If Rob gives a shit about this , then I thoroughly apologise as I respect him .
I 'd imagine , however , that he does n't give a shit about link juice .
And if he did , any I get for my posts is mostly brought to b3ta , even if I 'd tried syphoning some off to my site seeing if that would work , which it did n't .
Ultimately , he 's a viral man , so knows how to get links for the right reasons without all the nonsense SEO .
My actual posts had no spammy reasoning behind them - I 've been making stuff for years , I was just seeing if I could get any benefit out of the work I do for pleasure .
I was hoping it would tell google that this popular picture was made by this designer .
I have admitted all this .

To me SEO seems like homeopathy in that it pretends to be a complex science but is n't , which , again - I would happily concede if someone would actually point me to some valid testing they have done .
Homeopathy takes any placebo effect as proof that it works .
SEO * seems to * take increase in sales as proof that it works , when this might just be from the purchase of Adwords , which the client could buy themselves .
Back to a point everyone has been avoiding : is link building not spam ?
I admit I 've tried it , and I admit that I felt like a spammy cunt .
I * do n't* label people who improve a site 's link structure and keyword relevance as spammers .
However , it 's the link - building thing I have a problem with .

You can produce reports on traffic sources , keywords used to get to the site , daily / weekly / monthly rankings .
I do n't understand how an engine tuner might improve my car 's performance , does n't mean when he 's finished I 'm going to put the increased speeds I 'm achieving down to having a shit that morning making me lighter .

" Just keep in mind to contribute in a positive way , rather than spamming or soliciting for your site . "
- Google
I 'd agree with that .
However , this seems to be a tip for people promoting their own site ( who know their business and could contribute to relevant discussion ) , rather than people promoting it on their behalf .
Most link building you see tends to be very badly written - which may be just that the good stuff I do n't notice .
Do you have an example of any link building writing you have done for a client ?
And , obviously , a lot of people just use paid links .
What is your opinion on that ?

Paid links is an awkward one
Definitely not great as a long term strategy and in an ideal world should n't be used at all .
Unfortunately in a lot of competitive industries ( e.g. loans ) for every 100 natural links you build through link bait , participation , etc. your competitor will simply buy £ 1000 using their bottomless pit of a marketing budget ( some companies have in - house SEOs whose sole job it is to contact websites offering to buy links ) .
So in these instances it 's easy to go down the route of ' if you can't beat them , join them ' .
I 'll gaz you on the other point .

Paid links are against the terms and conditions of search engine indexing
... and therefore are to be avoided .
Saying that , the definition of a paid link is full of shades of grey .
Arguably a company paying and agency to build links by hand is " paid linking " , as is sending someone and iPad to review and saying they can keep it .
I draw the line at actual exchange of money ( or goods with a monetary value ) for a link .
If the link is optional ( ie : " here is a phone , keep it and review it - no link required " ) , I would n't say it was paid - for .
The key thing that you need to look for is transparency .
An SEO should provide on demand , if it is not already part of the reporting , all activity that you have paid for ( you have paid for it after all ) .
SEOs that claim that they can't reveal their trade secrets and try to hide things from clients are charlatans .
There are no secrets in SEO - it is not rocket science .
All the knowledge is out there to find , the challenge is staying on top of it and keeping up to date .
The main difficulty is that it cuts across multiple disciplines ; development , usability , hosting , copy - writing and accessibility all play a part in a quite eclectic specialisation that not everyone has the ability to master within the scope of their job ( it can happen though ) .

As I mentioned in my first foray into this thread , a good SEO has a deep knowledge of specific aspects of each of those fields , but will have a far from complete knowledge of each of them .

Some examples off the top of my head ...
Given the following URL to URL mapping list , write a regular expression for Apache 's mod_rewrite in order to 301 redirect from the URLs in column A on the URLs in column B .
Brand X uses a corporate font for branding purposes and as such uses a lot of imagery on their site to convey content ; create one example using just JavaScript and one example using pure CSS of a text / image replacement system that allows the imagery of a clickable link to be used for the majority of users but also presents the textual content to search engines and screen readers .
Comment on which you would choose and why .
Describe four common methods of page redirection and include their advantages and disadvantages in relation to search engine indexing .
These are more technical examples .
For content development , ask them to look at a site and recommend three content changes and three suggestions for new content development , complete with reasoning / justification .

I really have no idea .
I tend to mix with peers in the industry and they tend to be pretty good .
The best SEOs will be expensive and you wo n't be likely to find them working for Mrs Miggins ' pie shop .
Charlatans might be a bit of a strong word ( I know that I started it ) .
A little local web development company wo n't cope with a large corporate site with a complex technology stack that integrates content serving , back - end warehouse control and an inventory count that runs to millions of products .
SEOs are the same .
There are little outfits that serve local businesses - I would n't likely rate many of them on a corporate business scale .
Then there are the big players .
Some are good , some are not so good .
Their credentials and case studies should let you judge them against each other .
As for individuals , it is impossible to tell what percentage are worth their salt .
We have had people apply to us claiming to be experienced SEOs and they have just copied an essay from the internet as " proof " of their skills ; a quick quoted search revealed him for what he was .
Then again , we have had some great people apply who have stood up to scrutiny under interview and worked out very well .

Surely you see the merit / value in a I 'd say all the top ranking sites for competitive keywords kind of prove it - chances are they 're there because they 've been optimised by someone ( or a team of people ) who describe their job as " SEO " .
Surely you see the merit / value in a # 1 ranking for something like " car insurance " ?
Well so do moneysupermarket , swiftcover , go compare , more than , kwik fit , swinton et al , all of whom I would bet my salary ( the one that you suggest I do n't deserve ) on having ongoing search engine optimisation , and rank quite comfortably on the first page of Google .

I can see the merit in it , yes .
However , I can't help feel that it 's ultimately pointless when Google are constantly catching up and blocking SEO tricks .
Would other marketing techniques that improve the client 's website not be more effective in getting permanent links ?
I think many people are told that a monthly SEO fee is the only way to do well on their site , when their own marketing ideas would often be just as effective if they could provide interesting content for their site .
I guess , ultimately I think that link - building is a poor - man 's viral marketing .

I completely agree .
Well , maybe I do n't agree with the term " viral marketing " - things that " go viral " are successful in their own own right - " marketing " suggests it is deliberate , which a true viral should n't be really .
But this is a semantic argument at best .
But SEOs will do link building as a service while there are poor men out there with the lack of imagination to make that viral content .
It does n't have to be viral either , just interesting and useful ; people link to useful resources , it does n't have to be a wildfire explosion of a successful viral .

I think tat it is an important and valuable resource which can be used as a superb and targeted channel .
I also think that every man and his dog want to jump on the band wagon and that the sort of marketing director who wants ' social media ' because it sounds good is a lot more likely to be charletonized ( yes I do make words up , what of it ? ) than the same man in traditional media channels ( including organic search ) .

As such , I get pissed off when I see people who , say , run a dog walking company who have been sold a blog and twitter by a social media ' expert ' .

Things like Twitter feeds ...
... need a reason to exist .
It needs to be part of the service and it needs to add value to the customer in some way , shape or form .
For a kennel , I can see there being an argument for a feed to allow the dog owners to keep tabs on their animal , when it was walked , fed , etc .
As well as a way for owners to keep in touch with the kennel in a fairly simple way .
A dog walking service ?

I would n't say better and cheaper .
I would say that an agency can do it well from contract start ( as long as you have picked a good agency ) without having to go through the pain of recruiting staff that you are not geared up to assess the skill - set of .
This is ultimately why agencies exist .
They have specialists on tap and ( presumably ) can pick a decent candidate at interview .
They can also hit the ground running .
It takes time to build a competent in - house team .
They can be just as good as an agency .
They are likely to be cheaper in the long - run though .

" It takes time to build a competent in - house team . "
Is there really that much knowledge to the link building side that an SEO consultant could n't teach a marketing department in a day ?
I appreciate that there is skill to code optimisation ( which I suspect should be a one - off job to someone who knows what they are doing . )
However , as I mentioned before , I 'm sure that it 's going to be the in - house team who are more able to write interesting content about their area of expertise to post on relevant blogs and article collection sites , which seems to be a far less spammy approach to link building .
( , Tue 22 Jun 2010 , 20:45 , archived ) ( , Tue 22 Jun 2010 , 20:45 ,
But where do you distribute your content ?
You could achieve something in a day , but I doubt you will create anything lasting .
We have a three - month probation period for our link builders ( although we usually have a pretty good idea if they are worth keeping after two months ) .
Yes , in - house people are often much better placed than a third party to write authoritatively on a subject , but they often crank out very formulaic material and marketing or PR departments are often geared up for offline writing ; the jump to engaging an online audience is quite often beyond them ( sweeping generalisations but still ) .
I deliver training courses to people like this on a semi- regular basis and am astonished at how unimaginative these in - house writers can be .
We often come up with a small raft of suggestions about how to create new and interesting content and see a look of dawning realisation cross their faces , accompanied by " oh yeah , I had n't though of that " - and these are ideas we come up with after spending less then an hour with them and their brand .
There needs to be someone who is responsible for some sort of creative input into the writing process , but they need to be divorced from the writing process - someone responsible for the content strategy - and some sites have this .
Those that do n't will see the benefit of hiring and SEO , even if it is difficult to justify a new hire .
As for link building , they need monitoring .
It is too easy for a team to get stuck in unimaginative ruts .
They need an oversight system to poke them out of their comfort zones .
A culture of idea sharing needs to be cultivated and innovation needs to rule the team .
Ultimately , there is nothing wrong with in - house teams .
They will be just as susceptible as agencies to charlatans ; the defense against this is someone knowing their onions doing the hiring ( difficult if you are building a function from scratch ) .
But if you want work to start with professionals doing the work , and you want them started by the start of next month , you will be lucky to get job ads live by then ; you call a good agency and say I need this resource starting on the 1st July , as long as the money is good , you will have those people working right on time .

Should SEO not therefore
be performance related pay ?
If the value of SEO is in the increased sales ( and thus is okay to charge more than the skills involved in the actual work ) , then surely you can't reasonably charge for a site for which it did n't increase their sales ?
( , Wed 23 Jun 2010 , 14:34 , archived ) ( , Wed 23 Jun 2010 , 14:34 ,
Performance related pay is not unusual , but there are complications ...
Over what time from do you base the judgment ?
SEO consultancy will improve a site 's ranking for potentially a lot longer than the time you are working on it .
Clients tend to disagree with payment terms lasting for 12 months after cessation of work .
It is n't PPC that it neatly wrapped up ; traffic does n't stop when work stops .
Another complication is separation of traffic .
You can never discretely measure uplift from one activity in a multi-variable system .
Traffic rises and falls of its own accord , with seasonality , with natural growth , in response to TV advertising , special offers and more .
It is impossible to completely isolate the traffic or sales generated by SEO activity .
This is one of the reasons SEO gets a bit of a bad reputation , because it is not possible to directly measure its value ( not with any degree of transparency and honesty anyway ) .
This is a strong part of your argument and one that we have with clients a lot .
PPC and Banners are tracked and each click can be accurately accounted for .
SEO just does n't work like that .
It is more like information architecture or design .
You cannot attribute a traffic or sales value to the colour - scheme design of a site , or the icons used , or the content hierarchy .
People just accept this though without question , claims of quack science or snakeoil selling .
You can give approximate upflit and indicative figures , but not attribute every click .
People find PPC easy to buy into because a clear return on investment is easily demonstrable ( if the campaign is run competently ) .
SEO is much more complex because it is not easy to ring - fence traffic .
So yes , performance related pay is quite common , and is being requested more frequently by clients who are trying to protect their investments ( or more commonly , need to build a business case to justify the spend ) .
But the client needs to be very aware that there are some generalisations involved and predictions are very hard to make .
Some clients have a massive mental block and cannot see why there is any difference between SEO and PPC traffic ; we never work with them because the performance related pay is going to be either unfair to us or the client .
I put a performance model together once based on 80 % of projected PPC cost per click ( the client wanted to see a 20 % cost reduction against PPC costs ) ; they would have been much better off paying our ratecarded costs .
Silly really , but they insisted in spite of us trying to persuade them otherwise .

" Clients tend to disagree with payment terms lasting for 12 months after cessation of work . "
Would it ever actually take that long for link - building to have an effect ?
I thought that links were supposed to lose value over time , and so are likely to peak pretty soon .
With regards to the actual optimisation - why are there no standards towards the actual optimisation of the site a la accessibility standards ?
Surely there must be an agreed approach towards things like creating a decent link structure .
If there is not , then surely the whole thing is guesswork , and thus all you can offer is to make sure that the site validates and the relevent keywords are present and correct .
Which should be a very cheap job .
I personally think that it's the optimisation of the code which is where actual skills lie , but the book I read on SEO was full of utter guesswork and nonsense ( including such gems as saying that since Google own YouTube , then you might do better if you have a YouTube video on your site ) .
If this side of it has no standards or consistancy , what hope is there for someone to learn the appropriate skills .
How should someone learn the skills ?
At what point would you say that you became professional ?
What type of knowledge do you have that a bog - standard SEO does n't ?

You can base performance related pay on achieving specific search engine positions and link building tends to target a small cluster of specific search phrases .
However , this is a very shallow look at what SEO does for a site .
With personalised and universal search results , measuring positions is becoming not only difficult , but pointless .
We can measure a search result at a specific position , but 30 % of your users might see it in a lower place and 40 % in a higher place .
Search engine positioning is becoming a pointless metric .
Also , where consultancy is concerned , with technical improvements to the site , you will see improvements across all positions the site holds in the search results .
I for one , am not going to put a performance model together based on the overall average improvement of 100,000 search phrases ; it is a reporting nightmare and would take more time than the actual work being done .
We tend to focus on traffic .
Specifically , non-branded organic search derived traffic .
Non -branded search has an impact on branded search , so there should be indirect uplift there too , but we largely ignore that .
Our typical aim for an SEO campaign ( tech & content consultancy and link building ) would be to increase non-branded search traffic by X % ; these are our usual KPIs and we sometimes tie performance models to these .
However , we can conduct six or twelve month programme of work on a site and then walk away .
The traffic benefits of this work will exist long after contract end ( until they tear the site down and replace it ) , so performance - related pay based on traffic can be a little unfair , especially if the client wants a cost - per - click model so that they can compare SEO ROI against that of PPC .
This is a common request from clients , but there are fundamental differences between SEO and PPC activity ; traffic gains from SEO work does not go away when the spend stops ( like PPC does ) .
A lot of what is written is " SEO books " is out of date , or just shite .
I have never read one that is worth the paper it was printed on , apart from as a basic beginner 's guide ( but I would n't even give one to a trainee as they can learn faster from our internal training programme ) .
A lot of our knowledge came from trial and error ( not on client sites , but testbed sites we control ) .
A lot of it was driven from hypothesis and testing , and we do use control pages ; it is a little hard to do proper blind testing on this kind of thing though .
We use testbed sites to confirm or refute other SEOs ' assertions - we do n't much like taking things as read , we need to see some impact before we take methods to clients .
We tend not to publish our results very often - this is the stuff that gives us a competitive edge over our competitors .
Link building is fairly bread - and - butter work , and to some degree , content optimisation and keyword research is as well ; I tend not to get involved in that very often ( the people that do this earn a lot less and have a lower rate - card cost ) .
I tend to stick to the in - depth tech stuff and the overarching strategies and supporting new site builds .
Everyone in my business is self - taught or trained internally .
You start out by reading everything you can find .
With experience and testing , you learn what to discard as conjecture or nonsense .
This is where a lot of the best people come from .
Sometimes we cannot satisfy someone 's ambitions and they leave to become a " head of " at an agency that is keen to build a search offering and start training their own team .
It is n't an easy industry to break into on your own .
Of the people I would field to handle any question or problem a client could generate ( this includes myself ) , I would say it took at least three years of on - the - job learning to get to that point .
But like development , it is a constant requirement to stay on top of changes in the industry , and this is n't just they way search engines rank pages , it is changes in HTML , CSS , CMSs , server platforms and other elements of the technology stack ( you do n't want to know the problems an Endecca information access platform with guided navigation introduces ) .

They never seem to have been taught what to write on them , or merely told it has mystery " seo value " .
Indeed , one of my clients who'd been sold all this functionality in the past told me that he felt he was just blogging to no-one , but had been sold on the fact that it was a necessary part of business nowadays .
Is there more to it than this ?
And , I 'll ask you what I 've been asking the others - what qualifications do you need to be a Social Media Expert ?

One of my clients has just started out in the last 6 months , we recommended starting a blog and it's already the highest generator of traffic to his main site .
Fair enough , we 're talking faily low numbers right now as he's in a particularly competitive area but blog traffic should grow alongside traffic to the main site .
Image caption Adobe has been criticised by Apple boss Steve Jobs over software security
Adobe has acknowledged a " critical " security flaw in its Reader , Acrobat and Flash Player software .
Adobe says the vulnerability potentially enables hackers to take control of affected computer systems .
Users running Windows , Macintosh or Linux might all be open to attack .
The company is working to fix the problem .
In the meantime , users of Reader , Acrobat and Flash are advised to ensure their anti-virus software is up to date .
" It does n't really get any worse than a ' zero - day ' vulnerability like this , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos , a security software company .
Affected software Adobe Flash Player 10.0.45.2 and earlier 10.0.x versions for Win , Mac , Linux and Solaris
Adobe Flash Player 9.0.262 and earlier 9.0.x versions for Win , Mac , Linux and Solaris
Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.3.2 and earlier 9.x versions for Win , Mac and UNIX
Adobe Flash Player 10.1 Release Candidate does not appear to be vulnerable
Adobe Reader and Acrobat 8.x are confirmed not vulnerable Source : Adobe
He said that hackers could create a " booby - trapped Flash animation , or PDF " that would give them access to a person 's computer , potentially allowing them to harvest personal information or use the machine to send spam messages .
In recent years , PDFs have become a popular means of sharing documents that are not easily altered by the recipient .
Vulnerability exploited
In a security advisory , Adobe said : " There are reports that this vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild against both Adobe Flash Player , and Adobe Reader and Acrobat " .
Whilst it works to fix the problem , the company suggested upgrading to the latest " release candidate " for the Adobe Flash Player , version 10.1 , which it said " does not appear to be vulnerable " .
Alternatively , the company said that Adobe Reader and Acrobat users could delete or rename the " authplay.dll " file on their system .
However , Adobe said that doing so meant that " users will experience a non-exploitable crash or error message when opening a PDF file that contains SWF [ Adobe Flash ] content . "
Mr Cluley said that keeping anti-virus software up to date would also help to avoid problems .
" There has been a long history of vulnerabilities being found in Adobe 's products , " he said .
" This is probably because they are everywhere and omnipresent . "
Adobe estimates that more than 95 % of computers worldwide have Flash Player installed .
Argument strengthened
Apple has been criticised for preventing its popular iPhone and iPad devices from viewing Adobe Flash animations and videos .
Apple boss Steve Jobs recently wrote an open letter explaining that Adobe 's Flash was , amongst other things , " the number one reason Macs crash " .
Mr Cluley said : " The more people who are concerned about Adobe 's products and the ability for them to be written securely , the more it backs up Steve Jobs ' argument that Adobe 's software is buggy .
" The crux of the problem is that Adobe have overloaded some of their programs with so many bells and whistles , that with lots of code , there is a much higher chance that there will be a bug .
" This vulnerability exploits a feature of a PDF file format that will not be widely used .
" A simpler code might have led to a simpler life . "
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Europe faces almost inevitable recession next year and years of stagnation as policymakers ’ response to the euro zone crisis causes a downward spiral , billionaire investor George Soros said on Tuesday .
Flaws built into the euro from the start had become acute , Soros told a seminar , warning that the euro crisis could have the potential to destroy the 27 - nation European Union .
The euro ’s lack of a correction mechanism or of a provision for countries to leave it could be a fatal weakness , he said .
Germany had imposed its criteria on how a 750 billion euro ( $ 1 trillion ) euro zone rescue mechanism should be used and was imposing its own standards -- a trade surplus and a high savings rate -- on the rest of Europe , Soros said .
“ But you ca n’t be a creditor country , a surplus country , without somebody being in deficit , ” he said .
“ That ’s the real danger of the present situation -- that by imposing fiscal discipline at a time of insufficient demand and a weak banking system , by wanting to have a balanced budget you are actually ... setting in motion a downward spiral , ” he said .
Germany would do relatively well because the decline in the euro had boosted its economy , he told the seminar on the euro zone crisis organized by two thinktanks , the European Council on Foreign Relations and the Center for European Reform .
“ Germany is going to smell like roses but ( the rest of ) Europe is going to be pushed into a downward spiral , stagnation lasting many years and possibly worse than that , ” he said .
“ In other words , I think a recession next year is almost inevitable given the current policies , ” Soros said , later clarifying that he meant a recession in Europe as a whole .
WARNS OF SOCIAL UNREST
“ If there is no exit , ( it ) is liable to give rise to social unrest and , if you follow the line , social unrest can give rise to demand for law and order and ( sow the ) seeds of what happened in the inter - war period , ” he said .
Political will to forge a common fiscal policy in Europe was absent and since Europe was liable to move backwards if it did not advance , “ the crisis of the euro could actually have the potential of destroying the European Union , ” he said .
European banks had bought large amounts of the sovereign bonds of weaker euro zone countries for a tiny interest rate differential , Soros said .
“ That ’s one of the reasons why the banks are so over - leveraged and why the German and the French banks own Spanish bonds , ” he said .
“ Now ... they have a loss on their balance sheets which is not recognized and it reduces the credibility of those banks so the banking system is in serious trouble , ” he said .
“ The commercial paper market , for instance , in America is now refusing to lend to European banks so there is even a funding crisis and the ECB ( European Central Bank ) has to step in and the banks are unwilling to lend to each other , ” he said .
Holy Land opened in Minneapolis in 1987 as a storefront cafe that sold tubs of hummus as a sideline .
Back then , Americans did n’t eat a lot of hummus .
A staple of the counterculture in the 1960s and 1970s , hummus was long relegated to health food stores and “ ethnic ” aisles of markets .
More recently , though , Americans seem to have decided that this low - fat , high - protein snack with a little olive oil stirred in is not so exotic .
Industry giants have joined the market , for chips require dips .
In 2008 Frito - Lay North America , a division of PepsiCo , became an owner of Sabra Dipping Company , producer of more than a dozen hummus varieties , including one with salsa .
Fifteen years ago , hummus was a $ 5 million business led by a smattering of companies .
Today it dominates its sales category , called refrigerated flavored spreads , which has more than $ 325 million in annual retail sales , according to Symphony IRI Group , a Chicago market research firm .
Sales are up more than 18 percent in the last year , it said .
Ripple effects have been felt on American farms , said Peter Klaiber , marketing director for the U.S.A .
Dry Pea and Lentil Council in Idaho , which researches and promotes chickpeas .
“ Ten years ago , we shipped 90 percent of chickpeas out of the country , ” said Mr. Klaiber , who keeps a tub of roasted red pepper hummus in his refrigerator .
“ Now we only ship 40 percent .
That ’s all because of our new American appetite for hummus . ”

Mr. Wadi said his mother helped create that appetite .
“ ‘ Eat , eat , eat .
Taste , taste , taste , ’ that ’s all my mother knew how to say , ” Mr. Wadi said , recalling the early 1990s , when Fatima Wadi was in charge of production and sales of Holy Land hummus .
“ She worked the street festivals , the gay and lesbian parades .
Everywhere she went , she went with a tub of hummus and some pita . ”

( CNN ) -- Chinese officials were investigating Sunday a coal mine blast that killed 17 miners in central Hunan province , state media said .
Dynamite stored at the Shuguang Coal Mine exploded Saturday , the state - run Xinhua news agency reported , generating toxic gas that killed the underground miners .
Mine accidents are common in China .
On May 13 , a coal mine explosion in southwestern Guizhou province killed 21 workers .
And last month , the Wangjialing mine in Shaxi province flooded , leaving 153 workers trapped .
Rescue workers pulled out 115 alive .
In 2009 , 2,631 people were killed in mine accidents in the country .
The figure , while high , is down from 2002 when 6,995 people died .
In April , the country launched a two - month campaign to review safety regulations in mines and other industries that have had serious accidents .

The Robotics Industries Association wants to remind the American public that automation can create jobs for people just as easily as others worry they may take them away .
President Jeff Burnstein recently wrote an editorial for Bloomberg BusinessWeek highlighting how the robotics industry strengthens the US economy and how industrial robots will help US companies compete , ultimately leading to better jobs for American workers .
This unsurprisingly positive stance towards automation from the RIA is backed up by good numbers : robot sales are on the rise and US robotics companies are increasing in size and stature .
Is automation going to be good for the US economy ?
What about the global economy ?
Looks like it ’s time for another edition of one of our favorite topics here at the Hub : automation and employment .
According to the RIA , there are about 1 million industrial robots actively employed in the world , of which about 196,000 are in the US ( second only to Japan ) .
If you include non-industrial bots , the number ramps up to close to 8 million .
Those robots have a significant impact on the global economy by increasing production levels and decreasing ( over the long term ) production costs while requiring less human labor .
As impressive as these numbers are now , there ’s little doubt that they ’ll see big growth in the years ahead .
Automation is expanding from simple manufacturing and industrial settings into a wider range of applications .
We ’ve already seen artificial intelligence tackle everything from astronomy to sports writing .
As I discussed in my review of Martin Ford ’s book on the topic , automation is likely to continue to expand into industries and jobs that we do n’t normally consider vulnerable .
Whether its with robots or computer programs , human labor is going to see itself replaced at some level in many different fields .
The question is , will that be a good thing ?
Burnstein ’s article in Bloomberg makes an interesting ( and very Ameri- centric ) point .
Robots are good for the US economy in part because they counter balance lower labor costs in other countries .
Manufacturing projects that might get out - sourced to China or Mexico could stay in the US thanks to robots that allow factories to work at lower costs and higher efficiency .
These robot - factories may not employ as many US workers as ones in the past , but the maintenance , oversight , and sales jobs associated with them will stay in the country instead of leaving with the factories .
The same might be true in Europe .
Burnstein points out that this retention of manufacturing could be very important as new ‘ green energy ’ projects start to ramp up in the next few years .
RIA ’s other major evidence that automation is good for the ( US ) economy is that the creation of robots is itself creating jobs .
Since its inception in 1974 , the RIA has come to represent some 225 companies in the robotics industry .
These businesses employ hundreds of thousands of workers .
Groups like Adept , iRobot , and Intuitive Surgical Systems ( maker of the Da Vinci surgical system ) , are all based in the US .
As these companies grow , so too will the jobs associated with them .
According to a recent report from the RIA , the first quarter of 2010 saw a 45 % increase in robotics sales ( in dollars ) over the previous quarter .
That ’s great news for the industry , though they admit that this is partially due to a slump in 2008 - 2009 .
I think that Burnstein and the RIA are making some interesting points .
Yes , as with the growth of any new industry , leaders of the robotics field are going to experience considerable financial gains that will translate into regional economic benefits .
Those benefits will include new jobs , many at higher income brackets .
But what about the global economy as a whole ?
And what about the far future ?
Automation is going to do more than just play a game of musical chairs with the available jobs in the world .
In the short term , robotics and artificial intelligence may create a battle between out - sourcing and automation .
Eventually , however , every side is going to use robots .
Everyone is going to be developing AIs that replace human labor .
With the increasing inter connectivity of the global economy it ’s going to become less important whether jobs are being sent to India or the US , and much more important about how the shift in employment affects the average ( global ) citizen .
On that topic there is a divergence of opinions .
Martin Ford ( and others ) foresee a dramatic decrease in human employment with the danger of economic collapse if we do n’t drastically rethink the way consumers gain purchasing power .
While I admit that such a catastrophe is a possibility , I think the fundamental nature of employment may already be shifting .
Consider this half - formed notion in my head : what if we all became entrepreneurs with a plurality of capital enterprises ?
Open source projects are fostering innovation and reshaping the concepts of ownership .
Facebook and other social media are gearing up to provide ( non-monetary ? ) compensation ( i.e. ‘ points ’ ) for their use , ‘ gaming ’ the system of advertisement .
The creation of an Internet of Things could radically alter how consumers are expected to act , increasing their roles in design and marketing .
I ’m not saying that any of these developments are going to “ save ” the economy from automation , but all of them have the potential to reshape the way that economy works .
It ’s important that we consider the long term effects of automation on the global labor market ( something that many economists simply do not seem to be doing ) but we should also admit that there are many factors that we cannot predict .
New trends in purchasing and product development could affect labor as much as automation , and we do n’t know how those forces will interact .
Which leaves us where we often find ourselves when considering the far future : mostly in the dark .
The RIA makes a good pitch for robots helping to revamp and rebuild the US economy .
Along with other robotics innovators ( Japan , we ’re looking at you here ) , the US could experience tremendous boosts as the industry continues to grow .
Beyond that though …well , there ’s a reason we call it the Singularity , and it ’s not because it ’s easy to predict .

In the final hour , they huddled around , studied her face and shook her gently as if to revive her .
And when the others had drifted away , one stayed behind to hold her hand .
As death scenes go , it has all the poignancy of human loss , but this was no everyday tragedy .
The last breath was drawn before scientists ' cameras and represents one of the most extraordinary displays of chimpanzee behaviour ever recorded .
Video footage of the death of Pansy , who at fifty - something was the oldest chimpanzee in the UK , was released by scientists today .
The film captures for the first time the complex reactions of our nearest evolutionary cousins to the death of a group member .
Studying the apes ' behaviour could tell us as much about ourselves as the attachments and responses to death that chimpanzees exhibit within their groups and families , scientists believe .
It could also challenge procedures for dealing with terminally ill animals in captivity .
" Some of these behaviours have never been seen before in chimpanzees .
It leads us to ask questions about the evolutionary origins of our own response to death and dying in a member of our own group or family , " said Jim Anderson , an expert in the social behaviour of non-human primates at Stirling University in Scotland , who recorded the footage .
" Many of our greatest philosophical questions concern death and dying and how we perceive it and deal with it . "
Pansy , a female who died of old age at Blair Drummond Safari Park at the end of 2008 , was one of four chimpanzees being filmed by Anderson 's group .
When she became ill , vets paid regular visits to give treatment , while her companions – her daughter , a male and another female – looked on from a distance .
When Pansy lay down in a nest that one of the other apes had made , the rest gathered around her and began grooming and caressing her .
Shortly before she died , all three crouched down and inspected her face very closely .
They then began to shake her gently .
" It is difficult to avoid thinking that they were checking for signs of life , " said Anderson .
" After a time , it seemed that the chimpanzees arrived at a collective decision that she had gone .
Two left immediately , but one , the other adult female , stayed and held her hand , " said Anderson .
" That evening , her daughter came back and stayed with her mother all night long .
She was trying to sleep , but was clearly very disturbed .
All three of them were . "
Chimpanzees are rare , even among nonhuman primates , in displaying self - awarness and empathy to other individuals .
An animal may only respond to death in an apparently emotional way once these abilities have evolved , Anderson said .
The chimps ' behaviour contrasts starkly with accounts of chimps being killed during encounters with other animals in the wild .
Typically , groups react to violent deaths by going into a mass frenzy .
Anderson , whose research is published in the journal Current Biology , described the behaviour of chimps at Blair Drummond after a death as " serene " .
The footage has led him to call into question the wisdom of removing terminally ill animals from their enclosures shortly before they die .
" At least in some cases , it might be better for all concerned to allow the animal to die in the comfort of familiar surroundings , " he said .
Other extraordinary footage of chimps dealing with death is reported in a second paper in the same journal ( see below – some readers may find the video upsetting ) .
Dora Biro , a researcher at Oxford University , witnessed the deaths of five chimpanzees , including two infants , in a community living in the forests of Bossou in Guinea .
The mothers of the two infants , which were killed by a respiratory disease , carried their dead offspring for weeks and months .
During that time the two infant corpses became mummified , but the mothers continued to groom the bodies and carried them to their day and night nests as though there were alive .
Over time , the mothers began to allow others in the group to handle the corpses and went longer periods without them .
" Chimpanzees are humans ' closest evolutionary relatives , and they have already been shown to resemble us in many of their cognitive functions .
They empathise with others , have a sense of fairness , and can cooperate to achieve goals , " said Biro .
" How they perceive death is a fascinating question and little data exist so far concerning chimpanzees ' responses to the passing of familiar or related individuals either in captivity or in the wild . "
She added : " Our observations confirm the existence of an extremely powerful bond between mothers and their offspring which can persist , remarkably , even after the death of the infant , and they further call for efforts to elucidate the extent to which chimpanzees understand and are affected by the death of a close relative or group - mate .
" This would both have implications for our understanding of the evolutionary origins of human perceptions of death and provide insights into the way chimpanzees interpret the world around them . "

GEORGE A. ROMEROS MASTERFUL REINVENTION OF THE VAMPIRE GENRE COMES TO DVD AS A SPECIAL TWO - DISC COLLECTORS EDITION
Label : Arrow Video
Release date : 21st June 2010
Release type : DVD
Certificate : 18
Running time : 91 minutes
Pricing : £ 15.99
Genre : Horror
Director : George A. Romero
Stars : John Amplas , Christine Forrest , Lincoln Maazel , Elyane Nadeau , Tom Savini
Writer - director George A. Romeros personal favourite of his own movies , Martin is a genuinely disturbing horror film that turns the traditional conventions of the vampire myth inside out and one which , at the time of its original release , reinvented the vampire movie genre .
Now , Romeros masterpiece comes to DVD as a special two disc release courtesy of Arrow Video featuring the original theatrical cut of the film ( with 5.1 and Stereo audio options plus a choice of 16:9 and the Romero - recommended  Academy  4:3 aspect ratio presentations ) , the Italian cut of the film ( reputedly edited by Dario Argento ) and featuring music by Goblin , plus a host of other extra features .
Despite a lack of fangs , and having no aversion to daylight , garlic or crucifixes , insecure teenager Martin believes he is actually an 84 - year - old vampire compelled to drink the blood of humans in order to survive .
Martins belief is reinforced by his elderly uncle , Cuda , with whom he is sent to stay to work in his Pittsburgh grocery store .
Cuda is convinced vampirism is part of their family curse and refers to Martin as  Nosferatu , employing ineffective Old World defences in an attempt to keep the teenager at bay .
Driven by his insatiable blood lust , the frustrated and confused Martin is forced to kill and feed , first drugging his victims to reduce their suffering before opening their veins with a razor blade .
However , his inhuman desires are almost overcome when he begins an affair with a desperate older woman and he starts to question the validity of his self - belief .
An intelligent , modern day story of addiction , sexuality , and obsession given a unique vampire twist , Romero 's film begins with a typically shocking opening scene that perfectly sets the tone for what is to come .
Romero regular John Amplas ( Creepshow ; Day Of The Dead ) gives an astonishing , sympathetic performance as the eponymous anti-hero , starring alongside the real - life Mrs. Romero , Christine Forrest ( Dawn Of The Dead ; Knightriders ; Creepshow ; Monkey Shines ; The Dark Half ) , make - up wizard Tom Savini , and , as an ineffectual priest , the director himself .
Hugely underrated at the time of its release , Martin has now come to be accepted by many critics and horror fans as Romero 's finest work to date .
Martin ( cert. 18 ) will be released on DVD ( £ 15.99 ) by Arrow Video on 21st June 2010 .
Special Features include : the original theatrical cut of the film with 5.1 and Stereo audio options plus a choice of 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratio presentations ;  Wampyre  the Italian cut of the film , featuring Italian dialogue ( with optional English subtitles ) and musical score by Goblin ;  Making Martin : A Recounting  ; Documentary on George A. Romero ; TV and radio spots ; original theatrical trailer ; photo gallery ; four sleeve art options ; double sided poster ; exclusive collectors booklet ; six original poster art postcards .

TIM Cahill and Brett Holman scored magnificent goals to drive Australia to a 2 - 1 win against Serbia - but the Socceroos have been eliminated from the World Cup on goal difference .
Needing a victory and the result of the clash between Germany and Ghana in Johannesburg to go their way , the Socceroos kept up their end of the bargain with an inspiring effort highlighted by stunning goals from Cahill and Holman in front of 37,836 fans at Nelspruit .
But Germany 's 1 - 0 win over Ghana was n't enough for the Australians to reach the second round , with the Germans topping the Group D and the Ghanaians pipping the Socceroos for second spot on goal difference after both sides finished on four points .
Germany will now meet England in a tantalising round of 16 affair , with Ghana to meet Group C winners USA .
Send your tribute to the Socceroos - click on the Fan Zone link in the navigation bar at the top of this page and post a comment on our World Cup Fan Wall
Cahill and Holman gave Australia hope with goals within the space of four frenetic second - half minutes .
But an error from Socceroos goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer that gifted Serbian substitute Marko Pantelic a tap - in goal in the 84th - minute ended any hope of Australia pulling off a miracle by qualifying for the second round .
The Socceroos ' hefty 4 - 0 loss to Germany in Durban proved Australia 's downfall , with the goal difference too much to peg back .
Coach Pim Verbeek hailed the " great result " after the game , saying he was delighted with the spirit of his men .
" We have four points , I was hoping it was enough , but after all the goal difference against Germany killed us , " Verbeek said .
In the opening moments of the match , Serbia 's CSKA Moscow star Milos Krasic made himself an instant enemy of the pro-Socceroos crowd when he appealed for a penalty after a harmless bump from Australian midfielder Carl Valeri .
Despite Krasic 's protests , referee Jorge Larrionda waved play on , with the Serbian attacker then constantly jeered every time he touched the ball .
But it did n't stop him demanding possession , with Krasic tormenting Socceroos left fullback David Carney , who was lucky to hold his place in the side ahead of the experienced Scott Chipperfield .
Krasic forced Socceroos keeper Schwarzer into a sharp save in the sixth minute , and was again in the action six minutes later after leaving Carney in his wake in running on to a sublime through ball from Milos Ninkovic .
But Schwarzer cleverly forced Krasic out wide enough for the Serbian 's shot to miss the target .
The Serbians continued to dominate , with Schwarzer required to pull out his very best to deny defender Branislav Ivanovic from point - blank range in the 22nd minute after some poor Australian marking in the penalty area .
Australia 's first real chance of the contest came in the 32nd minute after a smart build - up involving Brett Emerton and Mark Bresciano .
It was Bresciano who delivered the final ball , a dangerous back post cross that Cahill met with interest .
But the Everton star 's header sailed wide .
Serbia hit back immediately , but wasted a golden chance to take the lead in the 34th minute .
Given far too much space on the ball by the struggling Carney , Zdravko Kuzmanovic floated a dangerous cross in between Socceroos central defenders Beauchamp and Lucas Neill .
The ball found an unmarked Nikola Zigic , but with only Schwarzer to beat , the 202 cm giant failed to hit the target with his header .
Nine minutes later Bresciano found himself totally unmarked on the left and demanding the ball from Kennedy .
But the lanky striker dawdled on the ball , with the danger snuffed out by a grateful Serbian defence .
Kennedy had the chance to make amends in the final minute of the first half , but his header from an Emerton cross was a weak effort that went straight to goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic .
Cahill was in the thick of the action in the first minute of the second half , winning a free kick and remonstrating with the man who made the foul , Serbia 's Manchester United star Nemanja Vidic .
Bresciano stood over the dead ball and whipped it low and hard into the penalty area but it was cleared away to safety .
Tensions continued to rise , with Socceroos pair Beauchamp and Luke Wilkshire booked within the space of three minutes for cheap fouls .
Zigic blew another opportunity to put the Serbians ahead in the 53rd minute after being found unmarked in the box by Milan Jovanovic .
But the big man blazed his shot over the crossbar .
The challenges continued to fly in , with Ninkovic booked for a dangerous foul on Wilkshire in the 58th minute .
Bresciano's subsequent free - kick was tipped around the post by an alert Stojkovic .
The Serbian keeper was again called into action by Bresciano six minutes later , parrying a fierce 20 m drive away to safety .
But the Socceroos were rewarded for their persistence when Cahill outjumped Vidic to head home a Wilkshire cross in the 69th minute .
Australia doubled their advantage four minutes later through substitute Holman .
Running into space through the midfield , Holman unleashed a potent 25 - metre strike that rifled into the corner of the net .
The Aussies ' fighting spirit was all the more impressive considering that official World Cup statistics indicated Serbia had a massive man - for - man advantage over the Socceroos .
The Castrol Index - which analyses every pass , tackle and shot a player makes on the field - showed Serbia had no fewer than seven players ranked higher than Australia 's number one - goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer , who at 7.07 ranks 196th in the tournament .
Winger Milos Krasic was the highest - ranked Serbian , with 8.06 squeaking him into the top 100 at 99th .
Mindfielder Branislav Ivanovic is ranked 101st with a figure of 8.04 .

Four Houston Police Department officers were indicted Wednesday on misdemeanor charges in connection with the beating of a burglary suspect that was caught on videotape earlier this year .
The four and three other officers were fired for their roles in the incident involving Chad Holley , an Elsik High School sophomore , who was handcuffed and lying on the ground after leading police on a short chase March 23 .
Critics called the charges a " slap on the wrist . "
Community activist Qua­nell X , who first publicized the incident April 29 , said he was " absolutely disappointed " that none of the officers was indicted for assault .
" You 're watching a handcuffed young man being beaten by law enforcement officers , and the only charge is official oppression ?
Where 's the assault charge ? “
Quanell X said prosecutors sought felony charges , but grand jurors reached a " compromise " returning lesser charges .
The activist called the move racially motivated , and said white males made up the majority of the grand jury .
Holley , 15 at the time of the beating , is black .
Grand jury proceedings are secret and names of the grand jurors have been sealed .
Harris County District Attorney Pat Lykos would not divulge the makeup of the grand jury , but described it as " diverse . "
The incident was recorded by a surveillance camera at Uncle Bob 's Self - Storage , 8450 Cook Road , then sent to HPD by Uncle Bob 's parent company .
Lykos identified the indicted officers as : Phil Bryan , 44 , a 19 - year HPD veteran ; Raad Hassan , 40 , who had been on the force five years ; and Andrew Blomberg , 27 , and Drew Ryser , 29 , both with three years at HPD .
All four were charged with official oppression , a Class A misdemeanor .
Bryan and Hassan also were charged with violation of the civil rights of a prisoner , also a misdemeanor .
Class
A mis-demeanors carry a maximum punishment of a year in jail .
All four were fired by Police Chief Charles McClelland , who also terminated HPD Sgt. John McClellan , 59 , a 38 - year veteran officer ; Gaudencio Saucedo , 38 , an eight - year veteran and Lewis Childress , 48 , a 24 - year veteran .
All but McClellan were members of the department 's Westside Gang Unit .
Officer Waleed Hassan , who was suspended with pay during the investigation , was counseled but not disciplined , McClelland said .
Five other officers were given two - day suspensions for " policy violations unrelated to the arrest of Chad Holley , " McClelland said .
Their roles in the incident and ensuing investigation were not clear .
Unlike the others , none of the five was suspended during the investigation .
The charges and firings were outlined in a press conference by Lykos , McClelland and Mayor Annise Parker .
" Seven officers lost their jobs today and it's our intent that they never work in law enforcement again , " Parker said .
" When our officers behave in an inappropriate manner , they will be disciplined . "
Under Houston 's civil service rules , the officers can appeal their punishments .
Defense attorney Dick DeGuerin maintained that his client , Blomberg , had done nothing wrong .
" He was well within his use - of - force rights , " DeGuerin said .
" He 's not one of the ones seen on the videotape hitting and kicking . "
Bryan 's attorney , Aaron Suder , said , " We 're going to be eager to get this case in front of a neutral jury and be able to present our side of the evidence …
It 'll show his actions were legitimate and legal .
I think they were legal and justified under the law . "
Joe Owmby , who represents Hassan , said his client believed the teen was capable of resisting arrest .
" We will plead not guilty .
The use of force was justified to make an arrest when a person is resisting , " Owmby said .
Video withheld for trial
Parker has viewed the video­tape of the incident and called it " disturbing . "
Lykos , Parker and McClelland separately declined to release the video , despite pledging transparency for each of their administrations .
" The first showing of the video will be in a courtroom , " Lykos said .
" The defendants are entitled to a fair trial . "
Asked if someone else could release the tape , McClelland said any copies that may be in HPD 's possession belong to the Harris County District Attorney 's office .
Parker volunteered that if anyone else had a copy of the tape , she would consider it stolen .
Quanell X claimed on Wednesday that he has a copy , but said he has been threatened with legal action if he releases it .
He would not say who was pressuring him .
Holley , 16 , was hospitalized after the incident .
He spoke to the grand jury for about an hour on Monday , his attorney Wilvin Carter said .
Carter said the teenager still faces burglary charges and his family plans a civil suit against the city .
" They 're upset .
They feel as if an injustice has occurred .
They wanted the grand jury to come back with felony charges , " Carter said .
Pastor James Nash , secretary of Houston Ministers Against Crime , commended McClelland for acting quickly , but said the officers involved should face more serious charges .
" You ca n't let a police officer hide behind a badge and commit crimes , " Nash said .
" When we start indicting these guys and give them what they deserve , that will send a signal to the rest of them .
" Even though we got something , I 'm disappointed because it 's like a slap on the wrist … it 's a step forward , but it 's not enough , " the pastor said .
Union waits on ' process '
Councilman C.O. Bradford , a former Houston Police chief , said he believes the videotape should be released to the public , although he acknowledged that he has concerns about the potential public reaction .
" Something went terribly wrong where that number of officers were involved , " Bradford said .
Houston Police Officers Union President Gary Blankinship noted that the indictments are not the end of the process .
" In no way is this a conviction , but another step in the process of our criminal justice system , " Blankinship said .
" I think it 's important to note a very fast , very thorough investigation was conducted and presented to a grand jury relatively quickly , given the magnitude of the investigation .
We 'll just let the process run its course and see what the outcome is . "

I know my analysis comes a tad bit late , but with the Hall of Fame snubs and Devils ’ schedule release , the news of Scott Niedermayer ’s retirement came buried in the news .
But that does n’t lessen his worth to the organization , and I ’ve come to respect Niedermayer as one of the best defenseman to ever wear the Devils sweater .
The Devils originally drafted Niedermayer in the first round of the 1991 NHL draft .
The defenseman was considered one of the best coming out of the Canadian Hockey League , an offensive - minded player known for his skating and ability to join the rush .
He joined the team full - time during the 1992 - 93 season , where he recorded 11 goals and 40 points and earned a spot on the NHL All - Rookie team .
Niedermayer improved to 46 points in his second season , when the Devils were defeated in the Eastern Conference Finals by the New York Rangers .
During the Devils first Stanley Cup run , in 1994 - 95 , Niedermayer took a step back .
The defenseman only played 48 games , recording 19 points .
But he showed up in the playoffs , recording 11 points in the Devils ’ Stanley Cup championships .
During the finals , Niedermayer scored one of the more memorable Devils goals in history :
After those finals , Niedermayer seemed to take off .
Niedermayer recorded 33 and 35 point efforts the next two seasons before his breakout year in 1997 - 98 .
That year , Niedermayer totaled 57 points ( 14 goals , 43 assists ) , his highest point total as a Devil .
During the rest of his Devils career , Niedermayer would never slip under 30 points while averaging no less than 73 games played per season .
The 2000 Stanley Cup Finals brought Niedermayer another championship and a playoff record .
Niedermayer scored two shorthanded goals , tying Larry Murphy and Paul Coffey for the most shorthanded goals scored by a defenseman in the playoffs .
In 2002 - 03 , Niedermayer would again display his offensive skill in the postseason .
His 18 points ( two goals , 16 assists ) tied teammate Jamie Langenbrunner for the league lead as the Niedermayer won his third Stanley Cup .
Niedermayer ’s final season as a Devil proved to be his best one .
With both Scott Stevens and Brian Rafalski missing significant time with injury , Niedermayer became the leader of the defense .
He recorded 54 points that season and won the Norris Trophy for the league ’s top defenseman .
But that would be his swan song for the Devils , as the player left for the Anaheim Ducks .
Niedermayer would go on to win another Stanley Cup with his brother , Rob , and record his career high in points ( 69 in 2006 - 07 ) .
In addition to winning four cups , Niedermayer won several international gold medals with Canada .
The first came in the 1991 Junior World Championships , which was followed by two gold medals in 2004 ( Hockey World Cup , World Championships ) .
He also clinched two Olympic golds , in 2002 and in these past Olympics .
What Niedermayer did in a Devils jersey was beyond remarkable .
He formed one of the best defensive units in NHL history .
While he sometimes stood in the shadow of Stevens , Niedermayer ’s impact on the Devils defense is still felt today .
Since Niedermayer left , the Devils have struggled to find another talented offensive - defenseman .
They ’ve also struggled to find a leader like Niedermayer .
It always seemed like Niedermayer could step up and do the right thing to help the team win .
He knew how to push buttons and knew his role , which was to help keep the defense together and win .
Continue reading for my thoughts on the Niedermayer retirement !
Niedermayer will always remain one of the most respected Devils ever to wear the sweater .
He was always professional , willing to do whatever it took to win .
For years , he patrolled the Devils blue line , making sure opponents knew they ’d have to break down the tough defense before even attempting a shot .
And he took care of the puck on the offensive end , applying offensive pressure and being one of the best facilitators on the ice .
It was a sad day when the team lost Niedermayer , and it made it even worse when he hoisted the Cup in a Ducks uniform .
I hope to see Niedermayer ’s number 27 hanging from the rafters of the Rock .
He gave the Devils some amazing seasons , and I ’ll always be grateful to the way “ Nieds ” represented the team .
A consumate professional and sure - ballot Hall of Famer , I believe Niedermayer will one day be among the best Devils ever to play the game .

( CNN ) -- Australian mining magnate Ken Talbot is among nine passengers in a plane reported missing after it took off from Cameroon en route to the Republic of the Congo , his company said Sunday .
Most of the passengers aboard the chartered flight were employees of Australian mining company Sundance Resources , including some executives .
Talbot , 59 , is the director of Sundance , said Brian Thornton , a spokesman for Talbot Group .
The plane had taken off from Yaounde on Saturday .
It was reported missing after it failed to land in Yangadou in the Republic of Congo .
The group was visiting Sundance 's iron ore project in Cameroon and Congo , according to the company .
" The families of the missing have been notified and are being supported during this deeply distressing time , " the company said .
A search was under way between the takeoff point and the intended destination .
Military forces in Congo and Cameroon were helping in the search , the company said .
* Captured oil increases to 6,000 barrels in a day
* BP moving to improve on that in next few days ( Recasts , adds quotes , capacity of containment device )
MIAMI , June 5 ( Reuters ) - BP
Plc BP.L has increased the amount of oil it is collecting through a containment cap fitted over its ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil well , and is working to improve on that rate , the U.S. national oil spill response commander said on Saturday .
U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters the containment effort was working “ with caveats ” , although it was still only collecting part of the leaking oil at this stage .
“ In the first full 24 - hour cycle yesterday ... they were able to bring up ... 6,000 barrels of oil from the well , ” Allen said , speaking in Theodore , Alabama .
Using the government ’s highest estimate of 19,000 barrels ( 800,000 gallons / 3 million litres ) per day spewing from the blown - out Macondo well , the 6,000 barrels captured on Friday would represent nearly a third .
While he avoided giving a percentage of how much of the escaping oil was being captured , since BP , the government and outside experts have provided different estimates of the size of the leak , Allen stressed that the amount collected over 24 hours was an improvement over the 1,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) reported being collected previously by the containment cap .
“ They started out at a lower rate and are going to a higher rate , ” he said .
He said the full capacity of this containment device was 15,000 bpd , which he called the “ upper limit ” of what can be done with this attempt to control the leak .
“ On June 4 , a total of 6,077 barrels of oil was collected .
Improvement in oil collection is expected over the next several days , ” BP said in a Twitter feed .
Allen said the company hoped to raise the amount being collected in the next few days by closing vents in the containment cap as engineers managed to stabilize pressure in the gushing well .
BP plans further improvements in the containment operation this month , although hopes for a final solution to plug the well are fixed on two relief wells being drilled that will be completed in August .

I came home today to an Amazon package waiting for me and I knew exactly what it was .
ARBITRARY DAY STUFF , YEAH !
I opened it up to reveal a set of gifts that gave me a few laughs :
1. ) The first gift is a " Gin & Titonic " ice cube tray that features some Titanic and glacier - shaped ice cube molds .
What better way is there to chill your favorite drink than with the " Ole T " ?
These bad boys are already in my freezer !
2. ) It seems that my Arbitrary gifter is trying to dispose of some evidence .
" Where am I gonna ditch this thing , " he asks himself .
The solution ?
Ship it off to a random person and play it off as a gift !
I'M ON TO YOU , PAL !
This gift is pretty interesting .
It 's a knife for the kitchen , complete with fake blood spatter on the blade and an NYPD evidence tag tied to the handle .
Hopefully I can use this to scare a few guests out of coming over for cheese and crackers .
I LOVE THIS !
3. ) This gift is perfect for the office and practical for everyday use .
A pair of Sharpie fine tip marker pens !
They do n't bleed through paper either ??
TELL ME MORE .
These will go perfectly with my Field Notes notebooks .
The first coworker to swipe one of these is gonna get their phalanges severed with my awesome NYPD evidence knife .
My Arbitrary Day gifter 's message for this gift on the Amazon packing slip cracked me up as well : " I 've never used these , but I needed to spend exactly $ 3.59 in order to get free shipping . "
THANKS FOR THE SWEET GIFTS AND THE LAUGHS , TROY !
As the NWO project has progressed , it has been very difficult to anticipate accurately how things are going to unfold .
9/11 , for example , caught us completely off guard , and who could have predicted how rapidly the entire Constitution could be dismantled , along with international law , and have it all accepted by most Americans ?
Some things happen faster that we expect .
With Iran , on the other hand , it seemed attack was imminent many times in the past few years , and yet it still has n't occurred .
Some things happen slower .
And then they throw things at us like the swine flu non-pandemic , and we still do n't know what it was about .
It certainly had nothing to do with public health , and pharmaceutical profits just does n't seem like a strong enough motive for such a vigorous global campaign of disinformation .
Perhaps it was all just to keep us off balance and confused , as we tried to find some rational scheme behind the fiasco .
Or perhaps it was to test our various social defenses against vaccine warfare .
There is a lot of documentation about the New World Order , from the elites themselves , and other kinds of evidence .
There are a few outcomes that are definitely included in the plans , even if we do n't know the timing .
These include world government ( in essence if not in name ) , centralized control of currencies , drastic depopulation , and a major nuclear war .
We need to recognize that this is no longer something in the future , something that might happen or might not happen .
We are now in the midst of the switchover process .
The toxic - bubble - collapse - bailout project was a clear sign that the switchover process has now been launched .
With that one move , essential sovereignty was transferred from national governments to the financial elite .
Greece is the poster child of this transfer , but it applies throughout the West .
The Greece ' crisis ' was a psy - op event aimed at giving other governments an excuse to tighten down austerity .
It was like whipping one slave in front of the rest , so the rest will behave .
( Illuminati Plays Its Cards , as in 1995 Card Game )
Once we recognize that the switchover process has begun , then we have no reason to expect it will proceed piecemeal , or at a slow pace , like an unfolding TV series .
Instead we are seeing parallel assaults from different directions .
And in any assault , it usually makes sense to get it over as quickly as possible , as we saw with the 9/11 assault on the Constitution .
Daniel Estulin and his friends tell us , from the very latest Bilderberger meeting , that the folks there are in a bit of disarray , and they 're worried about people losing their fear , and beginning to resist .
We need to remember however that Bilderberger is not a decision - making group .
It is a place where filtered elite plans are discussed with secondary puppet elites ... politicians , media moguls , and the like .
Bringing Bilderberger into line is simply one of the threads of the switchover process , not yet completed .
Meanwhile , other threads of the switchover process can continue in parallel .
The Soros article ( below ) gives us , more or less , a status report on the progress toward world government and global currency control .
The attack on Iran will be the stepping stone toward a major nuclear war .
Meanwhile , apart from the ongoing mega - genocide in Africa , what progress are they making toward depopulation ?
It is in this context that we need to consider the events in the Gulf .
When the Valdez spill occurred in Alaska , there was no reason to suspect that it was an intentional act , designed to destroy the local environment .
It was clearly an accident , due to inadequate safety measures , and everyone involved wishes it had never happened .
There was no motive for intentionality , even though there were means and opportunity .
But now in the Gulf , in the midst of a switchover process that calls for drastic depopulation , motive clearly enters the picture .
What better way to move the project forward ?
Whatever toxic brew they cook up in the Gulf will be spread by the Gulf Stream all over the Atlantic Ocean and coastal areas , and into the global current system .
And when the hurricanes begin , which they soon will , the toxic brew will be sprayed all over the Gulf region , making large areas of the coastal states , and probably all of Florida , uninhabitable and toxic to crops and creatures .
And it is indeed a toxic brew .
They tapped into a major migration channel of abiotic oil , deep down at the level where volcanos originate , and all kinds of toxic gases are being released along with the oil , under enormous pressure that cannot be contained and is leaking out from many places in the Gulf .
And in case that 's not toxic enough , they 're adding all that Corexit , a neuro toxin banned in Europe because of bitter experience with its toxicity .
None of this can be chalked up to accident .
The geological properties of the area , and the nature of the deep oil system , were well known to the experts .
The Gulf is one of the oldest and most studied drilling areas in the world .
Any legitimate attempt to tap into that deep oil system would have called for better - than - usual safety measures , not systematically shoddy safety measures .
Deep Water Horizon was an accident meant to happen , and the witnesses have been scared into silence .
Consider in addition these points , from the ' BP Oil Spill False Flag ' article above :
- Sales of shares and stocks in days and weeks beforehand
- Halliburton link , acquisition of cleanup company days before explosion
David Lachapelle 's " The Rape of Africa " was featured in this year 's CONTACT Photography festival in Toronto as a Mural at Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art .
Nearly 4,600 years ago a third dynasty pharaoh named Snefru launched one of the greatest construction projects in human history .
He decided , for reasons that are unknown to us , to build four pyramids scattered at different places across Egypt .
He constructed two of them at Dashur ( the Red and Bent pyramids ) , one at Meidum and another at a place called Seila .
Together they used up more material than Khufus pyramid at Giza .
Casing stones were used to give them a smooth appearance in other words make them into true pyramids . ”
This was the first time in Egyptian history that this was done .
Today a team from Brigham Young University , in Utah , is investigating these pyramids , trying to figure out why Snefru would build four of them in the way he did .
One of the puzzles the team is trying to decipher involves a cemetery not far from the Seila Pyramid .
Its a 40 minute hike away and research indicates that it has an enormous number of mummies .
We estimate over a million bodies in this cemetery , said Professor Kerry Muhlestein in an interview with Heritage Key .
Its very very densely populated by mummies .
Only a small percentage of them have been unearthed .
Weve been digging there for 30 years and we could dig there for a hundred more and still have only done a small percentage , said Muhlestein .
Results indicate that the cemetery was not in use during Snefrus time .
In fact the earliest burials appear to be from the Middle Kingdom at least 600 years after the Seila pyramid was constructed .
Furthermore most of the burials are even later than that .
For the most part the cemetery is Graeco - Roman period , from the Ptolemaic era down to the end of the Byzantine era , said Muhlestein .
This period started when Alexander the Great entered Egypt in 332 BC .
So the question is why did so many people who lived long after Snefrus reign choose to be buried so close to the Seila Pyramid ?
A sacred place
Making this question more enticing is that this wasnt just a local cemetery .
People seem to have come some distance to be interned here .
Its such a huge cemetery its hard to account for where all these people would have lived the population centres around there dont seem to substantiate that many burials , said Professor Muhlestein .
Maybe these are people coming from a variety of communities , all around , being buried in this place .
Were not sure what would account for such a large number of burials .
Could there be a connection to the pyramid ?
Despite the fact that it was built thousands of years before most of these people were buried ?
Muhlestein believes that its a real possibility but one hard to prove unless textual evidence is found .
It probably is at least partially responsible for why theres a cemetery there , said Muhlestein .
It seems very reasonable to suppose that the pyramid designated that as a sacred place , he said .
Once that place is a sacred place it typically will remain a sacred place .
A family of mummies
In early 2010 the Brigham Young team continued their work .
The university has a program that lets students learn field techniques while excavating at the site .
Its an interesting , and indeed fairly rare , opportunity for students .
You wont find too many field - schools , who accept undergraduates , operating in Egypt .
Muhlestein said that they have had an excellent experience with this program and the most recent dig turned up , what appears to be , a family who lived at some point during the early / mid 1st millennium AD , when Christianity was widespread in Egypt .
They found an adult male and female buried close together with an infant at their feet and a toddler on their chest .
We think this might be a family but well have to do some DNA analysis to know for sure , said Muhlestein .
Each of them was buried with their head facing to the east , this is probably indicative of the advent of Christianity , said Muhlestein .
The family does not appear to have been very wealthy .
They were mummified , but without all the chemical treatments seen in wealthier burials .
A poor mans version of mummification , is how Muhlestein described it .
The only grave goods the team found were palm branches .
The mummies were covered with a layer of wrapping , which had ribbons on it , that had badly deteriorated .
Crowding Out Government
Arnold Kling has a great post at Econlog on possible strategies libertarians might take to improving freedom .
Arnold prefers a secessionist or “ bye - bye ” agenda , by which he means competitive government :
The idea is to enable people to escape the power of monopoly government .
This could be all - out escape , as in seasteading or charter cities .
Or it could be incremental escape , as I propose in Unchecked and Unbalanced , with vouchers , charter communities , and competitive government , meaning mutual associations and standard - setting bodies in which people enter and exit voluntarily .
Under competitive government , you would not have an FDA , but you would have several private companies that certify pharmaceuticals .
It would be up to individuals to decide which certification companies to trust .
You would not have government - provided deposit insurance and bank regulation , but you would have several mutual associations to which banks might belong .
It would be up to individuals to choose a bank in part based on confidence in the mutual association to which the bank belongs .
I think the idea of incremental escape from government is an important and promising one .
The way Arnold frames the approach , though , seems to imply that we need to reform existing political institutions in order to introduce competition .
Given the problems of democracy and the ineffectiveness of folk activism , that ’s unlikely to happen .
The neat thing about seasteading is that we do n’t need to change many minds and can leave existing governments exactly as they are .
Voucher systems , charter communities , and the replacement of the FDA with private companies all lack that important quality .
Another option is a-political incremental secession within the boundaries of existing states .
Instead of seeking to change the state to allow or encourage competition , we simply ignore it and do our own thing .
The problem is , of course , that private provision of many goods has been crowded - out by government .
In some cases , private provison is illegal ; in others , it ’s just difficult due to the fact that those wishing to secede are forced to pay twice for services .
With sufficiently inefficient government , though , people will switch to private providers even in the face of punishment or double - payment .
We see this happening all the time : parents – even very poor ones – enrol their kids in private schools even when they can send them to government schools as zero marginal cost ; residents upgrade their local governance services ; and people who do n’t like product regulation turn to black and gray markets which rely on reputation and trust .
These people are n’t making these decisions out of an ideological commitment to freedom , but because private solutions better meet their needs .
This could provide those of us who do wish to increase freedom with some leverage .
If people are given a concrete example of private provision of some good and the option of switching , they ’re more likely to buy the argument for freedom .
It would take a pretty impressive feat of self - deception to maintain that government is better at providing some good even as you ’ve switched to private provision .
( Of course , humans are capable of some impressive feats of self - deception . )
As private provision increases , there will be some tendency for the demand for government to decrease .
Experimental economists Mark Isaac and Doug Norton call this , in the context of charitable giving , the “ reverse crowd - out ” effect .
They see it as possible that :
a renewed commitment on the part of a citizenry to private institutions of charity and compassion could “ crowd out ” , that is “ replace ” the decades - old predominance of government , especially the federal government , as the primary engine of social welfare .
Isaac and Norton do n’t find any experimental evidence that voluntary provision crowds out coercive provision in the particular lab conditions they use .
Whether we can expect reverse crowd - out to happen in reality is not obvious and depends primarily on the answers to two questions :
Can we create institutions to compete with the state when the odds are so strongly stacked against us ?
Will people really reduce their expressed demand for government when given more efficient voluntary alternatives , or is the human capacity for hypocrisy too strong ?
People are likely to vote with their feet for the best option ; will they also vote this way with their ballots ?
While I see seasteading as the most promising route to governance responsive to individual preferences , I suspect creating voluntary institutions aimed at crowding out government would be a far better use of resources than continued folk activism .
Actively “ forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old ” will be an uphill battle but will have some immediate benefits to those involved .
A- political incremental secession wo n’t produce anything close to a libertarian utopia , but it seems to have a non-trivial chance of making genuine progress .
Best of all , it does n’t rely on changing minds through mere words .
Update # 2 – Okay , NOW the video should be working .
Sorry for the craziness .
There was a server problem apparently .
| Update : Looks like the server died while I was trying to upload the video , but it should work now .
I had the video ready to upload a minute after the show aired , but alas … :(
My second Pokemon assignment in Japan !
Oha Suta , a Japanese variety showed , just showed an extended version of the Black and White trailer that aired on yesterday ’s Pokemon Sunday episode .
In it , they revealed eight new Pokemon .
The video of the advertisement is below , which I recorded myself on my camera .
:D
Screenshots of the new Pokemon are below the video as well .
The first four new Pokemon revealed ( from left to right ) are Ononokusu ( オノノクス ) , Doryuuzu ( ドリュウズ ) , Desukaan ( デスカーン ) , and Denchura ( デンチュラ ) ; they are in the first screenshot below .
Doryuuzu ’s name derives from “ mole , ” Desukaan ’s comes from “ death ” and “ coffin , ” and Denchura ’s name contains the words “ electric ” and “ tarantula . ”
Guess it ’s an Electric tarantula .
We ’re not sure about Ononokusu ’s name , though it seems to derive from “ fear . ”

New attacks are “ Grass Mixer , ” which Tsutaaja used against Mijumaru in yesterday ’s video , and “ Drill Liner , ” which Doryuuzu uses .
In addition to “ Fight , ” “ Run , ” and “ Pokemon , ” there is a new menu option called “ Shooter . ”
We do n’t know what this is yet ( do we get guns now ? : D ) .
Oddly , “ Bag ” is missing in the clip they show .

Here are the recipes ! »
Roasting a whole piglet on a spit is much easier than you 'd probably think , and vastly more tasty than you can imagine .
We roast a pig every year for my sister 's birthday right in her backyard in Brooklyn .
If we can do it in the middle of New York , you can probably do it where you are as well .
Roasting whole animals has an unrivaled celebratory appeal that taps into one or the other of the primal centers of our brains , and nothing comes close to touching a whole young hog .
Shopping
When purchasing a whole pig , plan on having about one pound of dead weight per person , which translates to around six ounces of meat after cooking and discarding the bones .
The best pigs for roasting on a spit are under 90 pounds .
Young pigs have extremely gelatinous and relatively low - fat flesh that practically melts as you cook it , oozing rich , sticky , porky juices .
Older pigs have more fat , but their meat can begin to get drier and tougher , and are better suited for more gentle applications like Southern barbecue .
Since you 're not going to be adding much flavoring to the animal , the quality of the pig is the biggest factor that 's going to affect it 's final flavor .
Look for a happy , naturally raised animal which has had access to pasture .
Ours came from Hemlock Hill Farms in Westchester , just outside of the city .
Buying direct from the farm will save you a lot of money — particularly if you live in a city like NY where butchers will mark up the price around 200 % .
You 'll generally have to place an order for a pig at least a week in advance to allow time for slaughter and proper hanging of the animal .
Young pigs have to be hung after slaughter for a few days in order to allow the muscles to relax after rigor mortis has set in .
Once you 've got your pig , you can store it overnight in garbage bag in a bathtub covered in ice if necessary .
Just remember to remove the pig before showering .
Equipment and Ingredients
The biggest piece of equipment you 'll need is a spit .
I do n't know anyone who owns their own spit , but fortunately many farms that sell small pigs will also rent spits out for a relatively minimal fee .
Call your local farms and inquire .
You 'll also need :
Charcoal briquettes .
You can be all macho and use hardwood coal instead of briquettes , but I find it burns too fast and too hot , and is difficult to maintain the slow , even heat necessary for prolonged cooking .
Plan on at least one pound of coals per pound of pig , but have an extra 25 pounds or so on hand .
You do n't want to make a coal run in the middle of the roast .

The pig will take about an hour and 15 minutes per 10 pounds .
It 's gonna be a long , lazy day of pig - spinning , so make sure you are amply lubricated and the company is good .
The Process
The most crucial step is securing the pig to the spit .
Dead pigs are heavy , and unless they are extremely well secured , they have a tendency to flop around as the spit turns if you do n't secure them properly .
The slideshow will teach you a method that involves strapping the spine to the spit to ensure your pig stays nice and secure .
The cooking itself is a lazy process .
Once you get the coals under the pig and the pig turning ( most spits have an electric motor to rotate the pig automatically ) , you can sit back and relax , tending to it only once every half hour or so to ensure that the coals are still hot and the pig is not over or undercooking .
Low and slow is the goal .
If your pig starts taking on a burnished color within the first hour , you 're going too fast .
Either slow down the rate at which you are adding coals , or raise the pig a few inches from the heat source ( most spits are also adjustable in height ) .
The last half hour is where all the skin- crisping crackly magic happens , and requires high heat , so you 'll want to pile on the coals at the very end , rotating the pig as necessary to expose every inch of skin to the intense blast of heat .
If all goes well , it 'll bubble into blistery pustules that crackle and dissolve in your mouth .
Yum .
If you 've never roasted a whole pig or attended a pig roast , I can't recommend it more strongly .
It 's guaranteed to be the highlight of your summer , and you 'll become a local hero .
Just be sure to keep the invite list under tight control and limit the number of extra guests people are allowed to bring .
Once word of a pig roast starts spreading , you 'll literally have strangers coming in off the street for a sample .
We were unscrupulous with our invite policy a couple years ago and ended up with over 150 guests all trying to eat off of a 70 pound pig .
Needless to say , most went home hungry .
Do n't let that happen to you .

( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp and other U.S. banks may introduce new fees on basic services and eliminate free checking to replace revenue lost to new banking regulations , the Wall Street Journal said .
The move is expected to hurt retail clients who could be asked to pay new monthly maintenance fees on the most basic accounts that do not generate a lot of activity , the paper said .
To avoid a fee , customers will have to maintain certain account balances or frequently use other banking services , such as credit and debit cards , automated teller machines and online accounts , the Journal said .
Banks incur an expense of between $ 250 and $ 300 a year to maintain each of the roughly 200 million checking accounts , the paper said citing industry estimates .
Bank of America may lose more revenue than most other big banks because it is in the process of dismantling its checking - overdraft program in the face of new restrictions .
From this summer , banks must receive customer permission before they can charge for overdrafts .
However , in March , Bank of America announced plans to suspend overdraft fee charges on all debit card transactions from this summer .
Bank of America could not immediately be reached for comment .
The Supreme Court ’s refusal to consider the claims of Maher Arar , an innocent Canadian who was sent to Syria to be tortured in 2002 , was a bitterly disappointing abdication of its duty to hold officials accountable for illegal acts .
The Bush administration sent Mr. Arar to outsourced torment , but it was the Obama administration that urged this course of inaction .
In the ignoble history of President George W. Bush ’s policies of torture and extraordinary rendition , few cases were as egregious as that of Mr. Arar , a software engineer .
He was picked up at Kennedy International Airport by officials acting on incorrect information from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
He was sent to Syria , to which the United States had assigned some of its violent interrogation , and was held for almost a year until everyone agreed he was not a terrorist and he was released .
The Bush White House never expressed regret about this horrific case .
There was only then - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ’s bland acknowledgement to a House committee in 2007 that it was not “ handled as it should have been . ”
Since he took office , President Obama has refused to fully examine the excesses of his predecessor , but surely this case was a chance to show that those who countenanced torture must pay a price .
In Canada , the government conducted an investigation and found that Mr. Arar had been tortured because of its false information .
The commissioner of the police resigned .
Canada cleared Mr. Arar of all terror connections , formally apologized and paid him nearly $ 9.8 million .
Mr. Arar had hoped to get a similar apology and damages from the United States government but was rebuffed by the court system .
A tree grows there , so why not a startup ?
The Brooklyn Public Library has been running its ' PowerUp ! ' program since 2003 , and more than 2,400 entrepreneurs have participated .
That 's a lot of saplings that have started their growth using library resources .
Maud Andrew of BPL's Business Library Programs and Outreach told me their ' Success Council ' came up with the idea and started a competition .
Members of the council gave prize money for the first round , and The Citi Foundation was the largest initial donor .
In subsequent years , Citi has been the primary sponsor .
How is supporting startups part of a local public library 's mission ?
' The mission of BPL's Business Library is to promote economic development for all Brooklyn residents .
PowerUp ! is a real life example of the important role access to information plays in the success of a business venture .
The participants are required to take classes at the library on writing a business plan , doing market research , making financial projections and giving a presentation , ' said Andrew .
' They are required to meet with a pro bono business counselor , get a library card and use the Library 's resources . '
The winners certainly benefited from the competition .
Stacey Toussaint , President and CEO of Inside Out Tours , Inc. won $ 15,000 for having a first place plan to launch a ' cultural tourism company , offering bus and walking tours of NYC , specializing in Brooklyn . '
Toussaint said ' The goal of entering and winning the business plan competition gave us an incentive to take classes at BPL's Business Library and utilize Brooklyn's small business centers rather than just rely on our own resources .
We received training in marketing , creating financial statements , and writing a business plan .
We also made valuable connections with other competition participants that have resulted in strategic relationships . '
Runner up Elissa Olin , Founder & Owner of Green in BKLYN , an eco-friendly home goods & gift shop in Clinton Hill said ' The prize money was the most visible and recognized resource .
I could n't have stopped working my " day job " in the months before the shop opened if I had n't received the award .
But an even longer lasting influence on the success of the business has been the media support and coverage .
It gave us a leg up and created not only a buzz , but momentum , which has been instrumental in the success of the business in its first and , typically , most difficult year . '
Olin described the experience as ' more work than I could 've imagined .
If you can start , write and finish a business plan , you end up feeling like you can do just about anything . '
Both report their businesses are running well , with sales up .
They 're specifically more than 60 % higher year - to - year in Olin 's case .
The future looks bright for library support of entrepreneurs in New York .
The NY Public Library and Queens Economic Development Corp. are following the example Brooklyn Public Library has set , and Citi has funded these programs as well .
There are business plan competitions in each borough of New York that promote the use of public libraries .
Some simple Internet searching turned up libraries all over the US that have resources for start - ups and small businesses as well as plan competitions and connections to college Business Schools .
E-books and the Internet may be slowly eroding the original nature of libraries , but it is good to see the smart ones keeping themselves relevant to their community as places of resource , education and economic development .

Every now and then , we remove applications from Android Market due to violations of our Android Market Developer Distribution Agreement or Content Policy .
In cases where users may have installed a malicious application that poses a threat , we ’ve also developed technologies and processes to remotely remove an installed application from devices .
If an application is removed in this way , users will receive a notification on their phone .
Recently , we became aware of two free applications built by a security researcher for research purposes .
These applications intentionally misrepresented their purpose in order to encourage user downloads , but they were not designed to be used maliciously , and did not have permission to access private data — or system resources beyond permission .
INTERNET .
As the applications were practically useless , most users uninstalled the applications shortly after downloading them .
After the researcher voluntarily removed these applications from Android Market , we decided , per the Android Market Terms of Service , to exercise our remote application removal feature on the remaining installed copies to complete the cleanup .
The remote application removal feature is one of many security controls Android possesses to help protect users from malicious applications .
In case of an emergency , a dangerous application could be removed from active circulation in a rapid and scalable manner to prevent further exposure to users .
While we hope to not have to use it , we know that we have the capability to take swift action on behalf of users ’ safety when needed .
This remote removal functionality — along with Android ’s unique Application Sandbox and Permissions model , Over - The - Air update system , centralized Market , developer registrations , user - submitted ratings , and application flagging — provides a powerful security advantage to help protect Android users in our open environment .
Hey , Ariel .
While my partner is getting married in a lovely gown , I lean more towards the masculine end of the spectrum and would like to get married in a stylin ' suit or maybe even a tux .
Question is , I just can't find any good suits for non-binary folks who might have a female body but a male identity .
Help ?
- Jessica
It turns out that many nonbinary folks , transmen , transmasculine beings , and other festive gender - benders would like to know exactly how a person to whom men's clothes are not traditionally marketed should go about purchasing a well - fitted suit or tuxedo .
The answer , I am cheerful to tell you , is the same as it is for any person of any gender or sex who wants to buy a suit and have it fit well .
First : buy a suit .
A decent–quality suit .
Next : take it to your tailor ( or use the tailoring services of the place where you bought it ) .
If you do n't have a tailor , ask your suit - iest pal where he or she goes .
Those are the key points .
The bad news is that you will not be renting anything , and you will not be getting off the hook for less than $ 300 to $ 400 if you buy the suit new .
The good news is that a good - quality suit will last twenty years if your size remains stable and you care for it well .
A well - fitted suit costs more money — there is no way around it .
Unless you are a perfect size off the rack , you will need a tailor .
Cheap suits cannot be tailored much because they 're not cut for it — they 're all of a piece instead of assembled out of contoured parts , which is cheaper to make but cannot be altered much beyond shortening legs or arms .
Someone who wants a nice suit that fits well should be prepared to go to , say , Men 's Wearhouse at least ( and a department store or specialty shop at best ) .
Men's
Wearhouse also guarantees their tailoring for life , and carries a very wide range of sizes for those of us who are short , fat , or ( like me ) both .
The most important measurements are shoulders for a suitcoat , and hips for the trousers .
This is because they are the most difficult parts of a suit to alter .
Buying a suit that fits you well across the shoulders will mean that it can be let out or taken in at the waist with relative ease ( up to two inches in either direction , no problem .
Maybe three , if the tailor is clever ) .
Ditto , pants .
Pants can be taken in up to four inches at the waist , but nothing will ever eliminate the terrible pockets gaping problem you get when trousers are too tight across the hips – do not let this happen to you .
Pick a pair of pants that fit across your hips .
Sleeves can be shortened , suitcoats can be shortened .
Trousers can be taken up at the rise , the seat , shortened , tapered a bit – whatever is necessary .
Does it cost more to have such exact tailoring ?
Yes .
Will you end up with a well - fit , great - looking suit ?
Yes .
( If money is no object , get a suit custom - made to measure from places like Duchess Clothier or Saint Harridan . )
Learn the language of suit shopping
Suits are called by jacket size , and a regular ( or R ) suit will usually have a jacket size six inches more than the pants size that goes with it ( this is called the drop .
A classic drop is six inches , and an " athletic " drop is usually eight .
A long suit ( or L ) will have arms that are 1 to 2 inches longer in the sleeves , in proportion , and a slightly longer rise ( the rise is the distance between the button and the point of the crotch , in the trousers ) .
A short ( or S ) will be shorter , and a portly ( or P ) will have more room in the gut .
Your dress pants size is probably the same as your jeans size up to a 32 , and one size larger from 34 upwards .
So if you wear a size 38 jeans , you probably wear a 40 in dress pants , and thus your suit size is a 46 .
Start there .
If you 're not ready to ask a salesclerk for help , try a few of the suitcoats in what you guess is probably your size on .
Try buttoning them , and also crossing your arms .
Sit down for a minute .
It 's not going to feel as comfortable as your tracksuit , but you should not feel any binding or bunching across the upper arms or just above the knee , and you should be able to fold your arms across your chest without feeling like the jacket is straining .
If you feel any of those , go up a size .
If you 're swimming , go down a size .
Remember that a double breasted suit is cut rather differently from a single - breasted suit , and your size may vary if you want a double - breasted suit ( they 're better for the skinny , as they add a little bulk ) .
People over , say , a size 50 will sometimes do well in a longer - jacketed suit , because it adds a streamlining effect , and may want to buy a longer jacket and have the trousers taken up .
Two button suits look more conservative than three - buttons ; solids are more conservative than stripes , pinstripes are more conservative than chalk stripes .
Do n't let anyone sell you anything windowpane unless you are sure , really sure , that you can pull it off – and it should never be your only suit if you have any choice in the matter .
In terms of color , black is for funerals and formal weddings only — and is n't as versatile , no matter what any saleperson tells you , unless you are Ryan Seacrest .
The classic choices for most white people are charcoal or a deep , true navy ; most people with darker skin opt for the navy or a lighter grey ( which is about actual skin tone , not racial or ethnic identity — choose what suits you ) .
" Fashion " suits , as opposed to business suits , have tighter armholes , narrower lapels , and a slimmer fit .
The jacket hem will sometimes stop as high as the wrist .
The pants that go with fashion suits are usually tapered as well .
A fashion suit might not look like a fashion suit on you if you are slimmer and shorter , so if you 're a fairly slender person this can be an excellent way to get a jacket that 's proportioned right .
Do n't worry about buying a men's suit — act like it 's perfectly normal and everyone else will , too .
If you 're feeling terrifically uncomfortable or afraid of gender - policing backlash , tell anyone who gives you the stink - eye that you 're in a play .
Be clear about how you want your tailoring : a straight hem or a cuff on your pants ?
Do you like to show more shirt cuff ( as many of us cufflink - wearers do ) or a little less ?
Do you want the pants tapered a little or wider at the cuff to allow for boots ?
Is there too much fabric in the seat ?
Do you need more room in the thighs ?
If you 're not sure , ask the tailor , salesclerk , or other shoppers what they think .
Just like anything , knowing the terms will make you feel more comfortable , and it will make the tailor take you more seriously .
Do n't be shy , do n't be nervous , do take along someone who you are sure will tell you whether you look good if you can .
And buy a damn dress belt .
A suit without a belt just looks unfinished .

Sharper than Hubble
Large Binocular Telescope achieves major breakthrough
The next generation of adaptive optics has arrived at the Large Binocular Telescope ( LBT ) in Arizona , providing astronomers with a new level of image sharpness never before seen .
Developed in a collaboration between Italy ’s Arcetri Observatory of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica ( INAF ) and the University of Arizona ’s Steward Observatory , this technology represents a remarkable step forward for astronomy .
The LBT , with its two 8.4 metre - mirrors , is the largest single optical telescope in the world .
The telescope is a collaboration between institutions from the USA , Italy and Germany .
Germany ’s 25 % participation is represented by the Max - Planck Society , the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam and Heidelberg University .
The test camera for the images shown here was developed by INAF and the Max - Planck - Institute for Astronomy ( MPIA ) in Heidelberg .

Until relatively recently , ground - based telescopes had to live with wavefront distortion caused by the Earth ’s atmosphere which significantly blurred images of distant objects ( this is why stars appear to twinkle to the human eye ) .
While there have been advancements in adaptive optics technology to correct atmospheric blurring , the LBT ’s innovative system truly takes this concept to a whole new level .
In closed - dome tests beginning May 12 and sky tests every night since May 25 , astronomer Simone Esposito and his INAF team tested the new device , achieving exceptional results .
The LBT ’s adaptive optics system , called the First Light Adaptive Optics system ( FLAO ) , immediately outperformed all other comparable systems , delivering an image quality greater than three times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope using just one of the LBT ’s two 8.4 metre mirrors .
As soon as the adaptive optics are in place for both mirrors and their light is combined appropriately , it is expected that the LBT will achieve image sharpness ten times that of the Hubble .
" This is an incredibly exciting time as this new adaptive optics system allows us to achieve our potential as the world ’s most powerful optical telescope , " said Richard Green , director of the LBT .
" The successful results show that the next generation of astronomy has arrived , while providing a glimpse of the awesome potential the LBT will be capable of for years to come . "

Because of atmospheric blurring , the fainter companion of the star cannot be identified in the images taken in standard mode , while it is easily visible when the adaptive module is activated .
A third faint star also becomes visible in the upper right part of the frame , thanks to the increased sensitivity of the telescope in adaptive mode .

The unit of measure for perfection of image quality is known as the Strehl ratio , with a ratio of 100 % equivalent to an absolutely perfect image .
Without adaptive optics , the ratio for ground - based telescopes is less than 1 percent .
The adaptive optics systems on other major telescopes today improve image quality up to about 30 percent to 50 percent in the near - infrared wavelengths where the testing was conducted .
In the initial testing phase , the LBT ’s adaptive optics system has been able to achieve unprecedented Strehl Ratios of 60 to 80 percent , a nearly two - thirds improvement in image sharpness over other existing systems .
The results exceeded all expectations and were so precise that the testing team had difficulty believing their findings .
However , testing has continued since the system was first put on the sky on May 25 , the LBT ’s adaptive optics have functioned flawlessly and have achieved peak Strehl ratios of 82 to 84 percent .
" The results on the first night were so extraordinary that we thought it might be a fluke , but every night since then the adaptive optics have continued to exceed all expectations .
These results were achieved using only one of LBT ’s mirrors .
Imagine the potential when we have adaptive optics on both of LBT ’s giant eyes . " said Simone Esposito , leader of the INAF testing team .
Development of the LBT ’s adaptive optics system took more than a decade through an international collaboration .
INAF , in particular the Arcetri Observatory , conceived the LBT instrument design and developed the electro - mechanical system , while the University of Arizona Mirror Lab created the optical elements , and the Italian companies Microgate and ADS International engineered several components .
A prototype system was previously installed on the Multiple Mirror Telescope ( MMT ) at Mt. Hopkins , Arizona .
The MMT system uses roughly half the number of actuators as the LBT ’s final version , but demonstrated the viability of the design .
The LBT ’s infrared test camera , which produced the accompanying images , was a joint development of INAF , Bologna and the MPIA , Heidelberg .
" This has been a tremendous success for INAF and all of the partners in the LBT , " said Piero Salinari , Research Director at the Arcetri Observatory , INAF .
" After more than a decade and with so much care and effort having gone into this project , it is really rewarding to see it succeed so astoundingly . "
This outstanding success was achieved through the combination of several innovative technologies .
The first is the secondary mirror , which was designed from the start to be a main component of the LBT rather than an additional element as on other telescopes .
The concave secondary mirror is 0.91 metres in diameter ( 3 feet ) and only 1.6 millimetres thick .
The mirror is so thin and pliable that it can easily be manipulated by actuators pushing on 672 tiny magnets glued to the back of the mirror , a configuration which offers far greater flexibility and accuracy than previous systems on other telescopes .
An innovative " pyramid " sensor detects atmospheric distortions and manipulates the mirror in real time to cancel out the blurring , allowing the telescope to literally see as clearly as if there were no atmosphere .
Incredibly , the mirror is capable of making adjustments every one thousandth of a second , with accuracy to better than ten nanometres ( a nanometre is one millionth the size of a millimetre ) .
********
The $ 120 million LBT on Mount Graham utilizes two giant 8.4 metre mirrors and with the new adaptive optics the telescope will achieve the resolution of a 22.8 - metre , or approximately 75 - foot telescope .
Implementation of the adaptive optics is the latest of several major breakthroughs for the LBT in recent months .
For example , in April a near - infrared camera / spectrograph developed by a consortium of German institutes became available to astronomers for scientific observations , allowing them to penetrate interstellar dust clouds and reveal the secrets of the youngest and most distant galaxies .
The new adaptive optics will enable other such versatile instruments to achieve their full potential on the LBT .
The LBT is an international collaboration among institutions in the United States , Italy and Germany .
The LBT Corporation partners are : The University of Arizona on behalf of the Arizona university system , Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica , Italy , LBT Beteiligungsgesellschaft , Germany , representing the Max Planck Society , the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam , and Heidelberg University , the Ohio State University , the Research Corporation , on behalf of the University of Notre Dame , University of Minnesota and University of Virginia .
Are The Environmental Bogeyman 's Days Numbered ?
June 2nd , 2010 by Chris Milton
One of the biggest baddest bogeymen of environmentalists may be about to bite the dust .
No I do n’t mean BP , much as some would wish it , and nor do I mean all the burger munching junkies whose dependence on flatulent cows is pushing climate change over the edge .
I ’m talking about Monsanto , creator of the super weed and screwer of every last cent out of the poor and malnourished .
Sadly though , they ’ve always had a point : if we could somehow boost agricultural yields it would halt escalating food prices , lift millions out of poverty and “ eradicate ” ( but use the word advisedly ) starvation .
The debate rages around Monsanto ’s claims .
Is this really improved yields , asks one camp , or just reduced crop loss ?
Crop loss say some , pointing out pesticides are n’t , um , fertilisers .
Real yield gains , says Monsanto , pointing to studies showing yield increases of up to 50 % .
50 % ?
Pffft .. child ’s play !
For up has popped Ali Zum Mazhar and his revolutionary natural fertilizer , which trials show can increase yields by between 200 and 350 % .
Yeah .. stick that in your combine harvester and smoke it you gene - splicing , poison spreading goblins !
Back in 2000 , Mazhar was researching his doctorate in the forests of Indonesia when he came across some soil microbes which caught his eye .
After years of research he came up with a now patented process called bio-perforation , which translates the microbes into a liquid form .
Once in this form the microbes are called “ Bio P 2000 Z ” and can be used as a naturally biodegradable fertiliser .
Farming trials in Indonesia have produced yields of up to 300 % and showed the fertiliser can return previously infertile areas to agricultural use .
This last has caught the eye of the international agrarian community and Mazhar is currently working on a project to convert desert in Bahrain into farmland .
This should take six months , he believes , by the end of which the first plants and trees should be growing .
Others have seen further possibilities , with Conservation International raising the possibility of using the fertiliser to aid reforestation in Indonesia .
Just in the nick of time too as the recent $ 1bn REDD + agreement between Indonesia and Norway specifically excludes reforestation .
So , a stunning new technology which may help us roll back our rape and plunder of the natural world ? … as long as it does n’t fall into the hands of those who simply want to make gross profits from those who need it most , let ’s hope so .

THE MATHEMATICAL UNIVERSE
The orderliness of nature can be expressed mathematically .
Why ?
JOHN D. BARROW
( From The World & I , 1989 , p. 307-311 )
A Yale professor was once asked to settle a dispute between two rival factions in the university : ‘ What was more important , teaching languages or teaching mathematics ?
“ Mathematics is a language ” was his answer .
In the world of science , mathematics indeed seems to be the language that allows us to talk most effectively and logically about the nature of things .
But mathematics differs from other languages like English or Spanish .
Indeed , it possesses a built - in logic , and is thus more akin to a computer language .
When we write a grammatically correct English sentence like “ All dogs have four legs and my table has four legs , so my table is a dog , ” there is no guarantee the sentence will be logically correct or correspond with events in the world .
Conversely , the grammatical incorrectness of a phrase like “ to boldly go where no man have gone before ” does not render its realization impossible .
One can break a rule of English grammar without falling into meaningless­ness , but break a rule of mathematics and disaster ensues .
If one false mathematical statement is al­lowed , it can be used to prove the validity of any mathematical statement .
When Bertrand Russell once made this claim during a lecture , he was challenged by a skeptical heckler to prove that the questioner was the pope if twice 2 were 5 .
Russell at once replied : “ If twice 2 is 5 , then 4 is 5 ; subtract 3 , then 1 equals 2 .
But you and the pope are 2 ; therefore , you and the pope are 1 ! ”
So mathematics is a language with a built - in logic .
But what is so striking about this language is that it seems to describe how the world works — not just sometimes , not just approximately , but invariably and with unfailing accuracy .
All the fundamental sciences — physics , chemistry , and astronomy — are mathematical sciences .
No phenomenon has ever been discovered in these subjects for which a mathe­matical description is not only possible but also beautifully appropriate .
Yet one could still fail to be impressed .
After the fact , perhaps , we can force any hand into some glove , and maybe we have chosen to pick the mathematical glove because it is the only one available .
It is striking , however , that physicists so often find that some esoteric mathematical struc­ture , invented by mathematicians in the dim and distant past only for the sake of its elegance and curiosity value , is precisely what is required to make sense of new observations of the world .
In fact , confidence in mathematics has grown to such an extent that one now expects ( and finds ) interesting mathematical structures to be deployed in nature .
Scientists look no further when they have found a mathematical explanation .
There are many striking examples of the unex­pected and curious effectiveness of mathematics .
In 1914 , when Einstein was struggling to formulate a new description of gravity to supersede that of Newton , he wished to endow the universe with curved space and time , and to codify the laws of nature in a manner that would apply for any observ­ers no matter what their state of motion .
His old student friend , the mathematician Marcel Gross­man , introduced him to a little - known branch of nineteenth - century mathematics , called tensor calcu­lus , that was tailor - made for his purposes .
Upon adopting this mathematical language , how Einstein would describe laws of nature became clear and ( if one is that clever ) obvious .
In modern times , particle physicists have discov­ered that symmetry dictates the way elementary particles behave .
Particular collections of related particles can behave in any way they choose so long as a particular abstract pattern is preserved .
The laws of nature are superficially the catalog of habitual things that occur in the world while yet preserving these patterns .
With every such catalog of changes one can always find an unchanging pattern , though the pattern is often subtle and rather abstract .
In the last century , mathematicians set about investigating all the possible patterns that one could invent .
These patterns are the subject matter of a branch of mathematics called group theory .
The catalog of mathematical patterns that the early group theorists established has become the guiding force in the study of elementary particles .
So successful were these simple patterns in describing the way the forces and particles of nature behave that phys­icists have taken to exploring all the possible patterns to discover those that give the most interesting insight into the origin of the universe .
In this way the expectation that elegant mathematical ideas will be found in nature allows detailed predictions to be made about the behavior of elementary particles .
Experiments with particle accelerators enable these aesthetic fancies to be tested against the facts .
The search for the “ theory of everything ” has sought the most elegant and all - encompassing pattern into which all the other patterns can be successfully fitted .
The theory of superstrings ( in which the most basic element of nature is not “ point - like ” but line - like ” ) has become a focal point of interest in such a search and has also created a new phenome­non .
Physicists have encountered concepts that re­quire the invention of new mathematical structures and ideas .
For the first time , off - the - shelf mathemat­ics is not enough to unravel all the patterns .
Elsewhere , the development of fractal geometry has given insight into the patterns within a whole spectrum of natural phenomena — from the cluster­ing of galaxies to the structure of snowflakes .
Many superficially chaotic situations possess a deep , under­lying mathematical order .
Again , fractals were once no more than an obscure branch of mathematics investigated for its own sake .
Scientists seem to believe so deeply in the mathe­matical structure of nature that it is an unquestioned article of faith that mathematics is both necessary and sufficient to describe everything from the inner space of elementary particles to the outer space of stars and galaxies — even the universe itself .
What are we to make of the ubiquity of mathematics in the constitution of the universe ?
Is it evidence of a deep logic within the universe ?
If so , where does that logic come from ?
Is it just a creation of our own minds , or is God a mathematician ?
Why does reality follow a mathematical lead ?
The answers to such puzzling questions depend crucially upon what we think mathematics actually is .
There are four clear options — formalism , inventionism , realism , and constructivism .
FORMALISM
At the beginning of this century , mathematicians faced several bewildering problems .
Logical para­doxes like that of the barber ( “ A barber shaves only those individuals who do not shave themselves .
Who shaves the barber ? ” ) or the problem with sets of sets ( “ Consider the collection of all collections : Is it a member of itself ? ” ) seemed to undermine the entire mathematical edifice .
Who knows where the next paradox might surface ?
In the face of such difficul­ties David Hubert , the foremost mathematician of the day , proposed that we cease worrying about the meaning of mathematics altogether .
Instead , he offered , define mathematics to be no more and no less than the tapestry of formulas that can be created from any set of initial axioms by manipulating the symbols involved according to specified rules .
This procedure , it was believed , could not create paradox­es .
The vast embroidery of interwoven logical connec­tions that results from the manipulation of all the possible starting axioms according to all the possible noncontradictory rules fixes , according to Hilbert , what mathematics “ is . ”
Clearly , for Hilbert and his disciples the miracu­lous applicability of mathematics to nature is some­thing about which they neither care nor seek to explain .
Mathematics , for them , does not have any meaning .
The axioms and rules for the manipulation of symbols are not connected with observed reality in any necessary way .
Formulas exist on pieces of paper , but mathematical entities have no other claim to existence .
The formalist would no more offer an explanation for the mathematical character of phys­ics than would he seek to explain why physical phenomena do not obey the rules of poker or black­jack .
Hubert thought that this strategy would create a body of logically valid reasoning and result , free of all possible paradoxes , which would be defined to be mathematics .
Given any mathematical statement , it would be possible in principle to determine whether it was a true or false conclusion from any particular set of starting assumptions by working through the logical network of connections .
Hilbert and his disci­ples set to work , confident that they could encompass all truth within this straitjacket .
Unfortunately , and totally unexpectedly , the en­terprise collapsed overnight .
In 1931 , Kurt Gödel , an unknown young mathematician at the University of Vienna , showed that Hilbert ’s goal was unattainable .
Whatever set of consistent axioms one chooses , whatever set of consistent rules one adopts for manipulating the mathematical symbols involved , there must always exist some statement , even though framed in the language of those symbols , whose truth or falsity cannot be decided using those axioms and rules .
Mathematical truth is something larger than axioms and rules .
Try solving the prob­lem by adding a new rule or a new axiom and one merely creates new undecidable statements .
Check­mate .
Hilbert ’s program cannot work .
If you want to understand mathematics fully you have to go outside of mathematics .
Incidentally , if a “ religion ” is a system of ideas that contains unprovable statements , then Gödel has taught us that not only is mathemat­ics a religion , but it is the only religion that can prove itself to be one !
INVENTIONISM
Inventionism is the belief that mathematics is simply what mathematicians do .
We invent mathe­matics :
We do not discover it .
Mathematical entities like sets or triangles would not exist if there were no mathematicians .
The inventionist is not very im­pressed by the effectiveness of describing the world by mathematics .
The reason we find mathematics so useful is perhaps merely an indication of how little is known of the physical world .
It is only the properties well - suited to mathematical description that we have been able to uncover .
So , although we “ see ” the universe to be mathematical , this does not mean that it really is mathematical any more than the sky is pink because it looks that way when we wear rose - colored spectacles .
If , however , mathematics were entirely a human invention and used by scientists simply because it is useful and available , then one might expect signif­icant cultural differences within the subject .
But whereas there are discernible styles in the presenta­tion of mathematics and in the type of mathematics investigated in different cultures , this diversity is just a veneer .
The independent discovery of the same mathematical theorems by different mathematicians from totally different economic , cultural , and politi­cal backgrounds at different times throughout histo­ry argues against such a simple view .
Moreover , the phenomenon of the independent , multiple “ invention ” of the same mathematical truth sets mathematics apart from music or the arts .
Pythagoras ’ theorem was discovered many times by different thinkers .
It is inconceivable that Shakespeare ’s Hamlet or Bee­thoven ’s Fifth Symphony could be independently recreated .
This contrast argues that the foundation of mathematics lies outside of the human mind and is not totally fashioned by our human way of think­ing .
Kant ’s categories of thought need not place a significant barrier between our understanding of the world and the bedrock of reality .
For our minds and their categories of thinking are the products of the evolutionary process .
Like our other bodily features , they are the products of a natural selection process in which reality ( not perceived reality ) dictates what survives .
Accordingly , our eyes have evolved as effective light detectors in tune with the real proper­ties of light .
Our eyes carry information about the real nature of light , our ears carry information about the reality of sound .
Likewise , our minds should be clear recorders of those aspects of reality that are crucial for the evolution of sentience .
If our mental categories were distorting reality , we would not have survived .
Certain basic mathematical notions like symmetry , geometry , and counting could thus have emerged as innate concepts preexisting in the human mind .
However , even if we believe this argument , we still have to consider those esoteric areas of science and mathematics that could have played no role in our evolution .
Moreover , mathematics uses all manner of concepts that we do not directly experience in reality - irrational numbers , points , or spaces with more than three dimensions .
Nevertheless , although we may have invented some mathematics for our own special purposes , the idea that we have invented it all — so that it does seem to describe observed reality — seems farfetched because we can so often use this same mathematics to predict the existence of new and unsuspected physical phenomena .
REALISM
The most straightforward view of mathematics is to maintain that the world is mathematical in some deep sense .
Mathematical concepts exist , and they are discovered by mathematicians , not invented .
Mathematics exists whether or not there are mathe­maticians .
It is a universal language that could be used to communicate with alien beings who have developed independently from ourselves .
For the realist , the number seven exists as an immaterial idea that we see realized in specific cases , like seven dwarfs , seven brides , or seven brothers .
It is some­times called mathematical Platonism , because it as­sumes that there exists some other world of perfect mathematical forms that are the blueprints from which our particular experience is derived .
Realism of this sort seems tantamount to the view that God is a mathematician .
And indeed , if the entire mate­rial universe is described by mathematics ( as modern cosmology leads us to expect ) , then there must exist some immaterial logic that transcends and per­meates the material universe .
Realism regards the surprising effectiveness of mathematics in describing nature as crucial evidence that supports a realist approach .
Most scientists and mathematicians carry out their work as if realism were true , even though they might be loath to defend it too strongly outside the workplace .
But realism of this sort has a most extraordinary consequence .
One might imagine writing a computer program to simu­late some complex physical process , like the forma­tion of a solar system or the division of a cell .
In principle , a program complicated enough to simulate the whole universe and all the processes that go on in it could exist .
Within such a program , the forma­tion of galaxies and stars would be simulated togeth­er with the biological evolution of animals and human beings .
If the simulation were perfect , then the simulated people would have simulated thoughts and make simulated observations about other things and people in the program .
They would regard all these things to be as real as real could be .
They could not tell from “ inside ” the computer program that they were on the inside .
Being part of the software , they could not tell what sort of hardware they were being run on ( or even if there existed any hardware ) .
Similarly , we cannot tell whether or not we are part of some Superbeing ’s computer simulation .
We might wonder if it is possible , in fact , to write a computer program to simulate everything that happens in nature .
This question leads us to consider the last of our options regarding the interpretation of mathematics .
CONSTRUCTIVISM
The last of our “ isms ” was another response to the uncertainty about logical paradoxes that spawned formalism in the early years of this century .
The constructivists ’ starting point , according to Leopold Kronecker , one of its creators , is the assertion that “ God made the integers ; all else is the work of man .
What he meant was that we should accept only the simplest possible mathematical notions as a starting point , and we should derive everything else from these intuitively obvious notions .
By this conserva­tive stance the constructivists hoped to avoid encountering or manipulating concepts — like “ infinity ” — about which we could have no concrete experience and which have counterintuitive properties ( infinity minus infinity equals infinity , for instance ) .
Mathe­matics consists , then , of the collection of statements that can be constructed in a finite number of deduc­tive steps , taking whole numbers as the starting point .
On this view , the “ meaning ” of a mathematical formula is simply the finite chain of computations that have been used to reach it .
This view may sound harmless enough , but it has dire consequences .
It creates a new category for mathematical statements , which can now be true , false , or undecided .
A statement whose truth cannot be decided in a finite number of constructive steps is given this last limbo status .
The most important consequence of this policy is that a statement is no longer either true or false .
This is reminiscent of Scottish courts of law , where a verdict of guilty , not guilty , or not proven may be returned ( the latter permits a retrial of the defendant on the same charge ) , whereas English or American courts require a verdict of either guilty or not guilty .
Traditionally mathematicians have developed many ways of proving formulas to be true , methods that do not correspond to a finite number of construc­tive steps .
One famous method beloved of the ancient Greeks is called reductio ad absurdum .
If we want to show something to be false , we assume it to be true and from that assumption deduce something contra­dictory ( like 2 equals 1 ) .
From this contradiction we conclude that our original statement could not have been true .
This argument is based on the presump­tion that a statement that is not true is false , an invalid strategy , according to the constructivists ’ rules .
Furthermore , constructivism outlaws the whole body of mathematical theorems that prove that something exists but which do not construct an example of that something .
This philosophy would have interesting consequences if adopted in physics because many important physical theories , like Einstein ’s general relativity or Niels Bohr ’s quantum mechanics , make important use of nonconstructive reasoning in deducing properties of the universe .
To most mathematicians , a constructivist approach seems rather depressing — tantamount to fighting with one arm tied behind your back .
Now what has constructivism to say about the mathematical character of nature ?
We can see that constructivism latches on to what remained of Hil­bert ’s formalistic program following Gödel ’s devastating discovery .
There must always be some state­ments whose truth can neither be proved nor disproved , but what about all those statements whose truth can be determined by any of the traditional methods of mathematics ?
How many of them could the constructivists prove ?
Can we build , at least in principle , a computer that reads input , displays the current state of the machine , and possesses a processor for determining a new state from its present one , and then use it to decide whether a given statement is true or false after a finite time ?
Is there a specification for a machine that can decide for us whether all the decidable statements of mathematics are either true or false ?
Contrary to the expectations of many mathematicians , the answer was no .
Alan Turing at Cambridge , and Emil Post and Alonzo Church at Princeton , showed that there are statements whose truth would require an infinite time to decide .
These statements are , in effect , infinitely deeper than the logic of step - by - step computation .
­ The idealized computer we have described is called a Turing machine ; it is the essence of every computer .
No real computer possesses greater problem - solving ability .
The mathematical operations that a Turing machine cannot perform in finite time are called non- computable functions .
They could have interesting consequences .
If , for example , the action of the ­human mind involves noncomputable operations , then the quest for artificial intelligence cannot succeed in producing computer hardware able to mimic the complexity of human consciousness .
If we return to the puzzle of the applicability of mathematics to nature , we can cast the question into an interesting statement about computability .
If an operation is computable , this means we can fabricate a device from matter whose behavior mimics that operation .
Typical devices might be swinging pendulums or electrical impulses .
Conversely , physical devices like these can be well described by comput­able mathematical operations .
The fact that is well described by mathematics is equivalent to fact that the simplest mathematical operations — like addition and multiplication — and other , more complicated operations used so effectively in science are computable functions .
If they were not , then they could not be equivalent to any natural process , and we would not be terribly impressed by the usefulness of mathematics .
It is fascinating to ask whether the laws of nature contain noncomputable elements .
Already , the quest to find a quantum theory of the whole universe has created this possibility .
If natural laws do contain noncomputable elements , then their consequences cannot be discovered by any systematic calculation that merely applies the same principles over and over again ; each step requires that qualitatively different and novel principles be used .
Whereas some sequences are simple in the sense that a brief formula can be given to generate the sequence , others are so complex that no abbreviation of the sequence can contain enough information to generate it .
We might expect the universe to be such an entity : one ultimately irreducible to any abbreviated formula and defined most simply by nothing less than its own unfolding sequence of events .
The universe may or may not be intrinsically mathematical .
If it is not , then we are extremely fortunate in that mathematical language works in areas it was never designed to cover .
If the universe is mathematical in some deep sense , then the undecidabilities demonstrated by Gödel and Turing are part of the fabric of the universe rather than merely products of our minds .
They show that even a mathematical universe is more than axioms , more than computation , more than logic — and more than mathematicians can know .

The Hamas government in the Gaza Strip plans to raze another 180 Palestinian houses , on top of the 20 it recently demolished in the southern town of Rafah , the Palestinian Center for Human Rights charged on Thursday .
The 20 houses already destroyed were home to some 150 people , who are now homeless and living in tents , the organization said .
The government said it razed the houses because they were built illegally on government land .
The organization said that Hamas plans to use the same pretext to demolish houses in Khan Yunis and other towns .
Most of these houses ' inhabitants are poor , the organization said , and several saw their previous houses demolished during the years of fighting with Israel .
Palestinians sources told Haaretz that the area in question , comprising around 200 dunams ( some 50 acres ) , had been given by the Hamas government to a charitable organization called Fadila so that it could build a religious study center there comprising a school , a college and a mosque .
But when Fadila sought to begin construction , it discovered that dozens of houses had been built on the site .
In most cases , these houses were built by owners whose original homes had been destroyed by the Israel Defense Forces .
Fadila applied to the Hamas government , which asked the residents to leave .
When they refused , saying they had nowhere to go , the government went to court , and the court ordered them to leave .
The government then began razing the houses .
Hamas halted the demolitions after they sparked outrage among ordinary Gazans and the Palestinian media .
But the Palestinian Center for Human Rights fears they are slated to resume soon .
This is not the first move Hamas has made recently that sparked an outcry in Gaza .
Another was its decision to impose a hefty tax on the cigarettes that are smuggled in from Egypt via tunnels , and which until then were very cheap .
It has also imposed taxes on various other products smuggled through the tunnels , as well as on market stalls and all shops that sell produce by weight .
The taxes are meant to improve the Hamas government 's financial plight .
Its revenues have recently declined , due to the international community 's efforts to crack down on fund transfers to Hamas from overseas banks , especially in Europe .
In addition , less cash is being smuggled in via the tunnels , due to Egypt 's crackdown on the cross - border smuggling business .
Last month , the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine even warned of a popular uprising against the new decrees - or in other words , an intifada .

Presenter , BBC HARDtalk
The Sri Lankan government has threatened to execute Sarath Fonseka , the army commander who delivered victory over the Tamil Tigers , if he continues to suggest top officials may have ordered war crimes during the final hours of the Tamil war .
General Fonseka wants to testify before an independent investigation
The threat , issued by Sri Lanka 's powerful defence secretary , Gotabaya Rajapaksa , is the latest sign of a bitter and intensifying feud within the Sri Lankan political establishment , little more than a year after the end of the Tamil war .
Mr Rajapaksa , who worked closely with General Fonseka on the aggressive military strategy which crushed the Tigers , told the BBC 's HARDtalk programme that the general had proved himself to be a liar and a traitor .
Gen Fonseka quit the military soon after the final defeat of the Tigers .
He was the main opposition candidate in last January 's presidential election .
Within days of his defeat the former war hero was arrested and is currently in military detention facing a court martial on charges of corruption and politicking while in uniform .
That 's a treason .
We will hang him ( Fonseka ) if he do that
Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gotabya Rajapaksa Gen Fonseka roused the fury of the ruling Rajapaksa clan when he joined the opposition .
The rift deepened when Gen Fonseka suggested there was eyewitness evidence of the defence secretary ordering army officers to shoot and kill surrendering Tamil Tiger leaders at the end of the war .
Government enemy
That eyewitness is said to be a Sri Lankan journalist who is now in hiding overseas .
The very fact that Gen Fonseka has heard the account and gives it credence makes him a dangerous enemy of the current government .
Gen Fonseka told me , in a clandestine telephone interview , that he would be prepared to testify before any independent investigation of alleged abuses during the Tamil war .
" I will not hide anything , " he said .
When I put this possibility to Mr Rajapaksa he responded with an extraordinary tirade .
" He ca n't do that .
He was the commander , " he said .
" That 's a treason .
We will hang him if he do that .
I 'm telling you How can he betray the country ?
He is a liar , liar , liar . "
Political fallout
The suggestion that Gen Fonseka could be executed is likely to cause a political storm in Sri Lanka .
Fonseka is an elected MP and he garnered 40 % of the vote in the presidential election .
Capital punishment has not been used on the island for 34 years .
Defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa also ruled out any possibility of an independent , third - party investigation of alleged war crimes committed by both the Sri Lankan army and the Tamil Tigers in the final phase of the war .
" We are an independent country , we have the ability to investigate all these things , " he said .
Colombo insists that no civilians were killed by the army during their final assault on the Tiger 's last redoubt , despite evidence from the UN and international non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) which points to thousands of civilian deaths .
With a strong electoral mandate and a big majority in Parliament President Mahinda Rajapaksa seems intent on ruling post - war Sri Lanka without heed to critics at home or abroad .
Powerful family
He has turned his administration into something of a family business .
As well as his brother who is the defence secretary , another brother is minister of economic development , another is speaker of the parliament , and his son is a newly elected MP .
In all , the Rajapaksas are responsible for spending more than two - thirds of the state budget .
The dominance of the family is " dangerous and unsustainable , " says Vijayadasa Rajapaksa ( no relation ) , a leading Sinhalese barrister and the president 's former friend and personal lawyer .
Gotabaya Rajapaksa said General Fonseka was " a liar and a traitor "
He joined the opposition after becoming disillusioned with the president 's failure to act on repeated warnings about corruption and waste in the public sector .
Sri Lanka 's budget deficit , at some 8 % of GDP is significantly above targets set by the IMF in return for a $ 2.6 bn ( £ 1.79 bn ) loan package , but the Rajapaksa government is committed to a massive programme of post - war spending .
In and around Kilinochchi , the former capital of the Tamil Tiger northern fiefdom it is easy to see where the money should be going .
Houses are destroyed , farmland is lost to jungle and still swathes of territory are off - limits to civilians as the Sri Lankan army continues to clear mines .
At least the de facto internment camp at Menic Farm , which was filled with almost 300,000 Tamil civilians a year ago is now emptying fast .
Every day families line up for hours in the sticky heat for buses heading to their home villages across the northern Vanni region .
We want to bring normalcy to this country , but we have suffered from terrorism for 30 years , so it has to happen gradually
Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa
But they wait with precious little sense of anticipation .
Farmer and father of three , Thambirasa Karunamurthy , told me : " We came here with one plastic bag of belongings and we 're going home with no money , no assets , nothing .
We have to start life again in a barren land .
We do n't know what we are going to do . "
On every road and around every settlement Sri Lankan soldiers man guard posts and checkpoints .
The government has promised to fully integrate the north into the national economy .
It has ruled out significant Tamil autonomy .
" If there is no political solution the conclusion will be that the government wants to impose military victory on the Tamil people , and that the Tamils will never accept , " says veteran leader of the Tamil National Alliance Rajavarothiam Sampanthan .
He talks of " organising and resisting through non-violent means " .
But Sampanthan speaks from a comfortable office in Colombo .
In the ruined villages of the north resistance of any sort seems like a thing of the past .
New struggle The Tamil Tigers , for years the brutal masters of the Vanni , appear to have been finished for good .
Those that were not killed in the war 's brutal end - game were rounded up and detained .
Just a handful of fighters managed to escape .
I spoke to one man now in hiding who was a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) bomb - maker for more than a decade .
This ex-combatant , who was badly wounded earlier in the war , was twitchy with nerves and deep in denial .
He denied reports that Tiger cadres forcibly held Tamil civilians in their last redoubt .
He denied the irrefutable evidence that the Tigers conscripted child soldiers and ruthlessly silenced Tamil dissent .
And he denied that the war was over .
" You will see , within the next two or three years these very same Tamil people will begin a new armed struggle , " he told me .
" A new war led by a new leadership . "
But before he hobbled away from our covert encounter - he added something else .
" I am not afraid to die , but my only worry is that the Tamil people will slowly disappear . "
Sri Lankans still live under a state of emergency .
The war is over but the government insists Sri Lanka 's security is still at risk , whether it be from Tamil " terrorist organisations " overseas , or " traitors " at home .
" We want to bring normalcy to this country , but we have suffered from terrorism for 30 years , so it has to happen gradually , " says Gotabaya Rajapaksa .
Too gradually , it seems , for his former friend Sarath Fonseka .

The world is slightly less peaceful than it was a year ago , in part as a consequence of the global recession .
But falling military expenditures in the Middle East and shrinking access to small arms in sub-Saharan Africa are two bright spots in an assessment of the world ’s broad trends in peace and violence .
Those are among the findings of the 2010 Global Peace Index , the fourth edition of an annual attempt to objectively quantify peace in a large majority of the world ’s countries .
New Zealand ranks as the world ’s most peaceful country , the survey finds , based on a list of factors ranging from military expenditures ( high is bad ) and participation in United Nations peacekeeping ( high is good ) to social unrest and incarceration rates ( both are not good ) .
IN PICTURES :
The most and least peaceful nations in the world
Iraq comes in last at 149 out of 149 countries assessed – the same ignominious placement it snagged last year .
And the United States ranks right in the middle at 85 , achieving good marks for factors like respect for human rights and relations with neighbors and other countries , but low scores in areas like domestic homicides , military expenditures , and involvement in external conflicts .
Given the criteria , the US not surprisingly comes up as “ less peaceful ” than countries like Austria and Costa Rica , but it also trails Libya , Cuba , and Equatorial Guinea .
“ We work with a definition of peace that is not as the opposite of war but the absence of violence , ” says Clyde McConaghy , board director of the Institute for Economics and Peace – the Sydney , Australia , think tank that amasses the information behind the Global Peace Index , or GPI .
Weighing 23 factors ranging from domestic instability to militarization , the GPI “ provides a snapshot of relative peacefulness among nations , ” he adds .
A research team of peace - studies experts from around the world uses the compiled information to come up with the index .
The GPI ’s conclusion that the world in 2009 was slightly less peaceful than in 2008 is based on the perspective that the global recession has been a catalyst for conditions that lead to violence .
The GPI affirms a “ correlation between economic prosperity and peacefulness , ” Mr. McConaghy says .
Still , he cautions , growing prosperity does not necessarily equate with a rising peace index : Russia has experienced some impressive ( though not necessarily equitable ) economic growth in recent years , but remains near the bottom of the GPI ( No. 143 ) after a recent downturn , conflict with Georgia , and internal violence concerning Chechnya .
Nor do all countries respond poorly to adverse economic straits .
In one of the earliest surveys , Iceland was No. 1 , only to fall to No. 4 last year after the country ’s financial meltdown led to upheaval and political instability .
But this year Iceland rose again , now placing second behind New Zealand .
The GPI ’s goal is to demonstrate that simple priorities lead to peace .
“ Education is a driver of peacefulness , ” McConaghy says .
“ Not so much the quality of education or how much is spent , but just keeping kids in school . ”
The GPI also confirms a trend recently noted by other tabulations of world conflicts :
While cross - border wars and armed disputes have decreased in recent years , the number of internal conflicts such as civil wars has increased .
Many Americans may be suspicious of any peace index that has their country behind Nicaragua and Rwanda , McConaghy acknowledges .
But he reminds observers that gauging peacefulness is not the same as ranking national well - being or happiness , as some surveys do .
“ Ours is not an airy definition ” of peace , but a “ technical definition – it ’s not a state of mind , ” he says .
Why , then , is America ’s contribution to the security of other countries not calculated as a plus for peace ?
McConaghy acknowledges as a “ good point ” that US troops in South Korea may have stopped North Korea from invading , for example .
But , he says , such judgments would push the GPI into making subjective calls .
“ We find it almost impossible to judge which troop deployments are right and which are wrong , ” he says .
“ Russian troops in South Ossetia – is that right or wrong ?
Someone from South Ossetia might very well insist it ’s right . ”
The US “ is an example of a country with complex issues to face , ” he says .
“ So given that , it gets a pretty good score . ”

Enlarge By Jacquelyn Martin , AP A woman gets a Botox injection in Arlington , Va. , last June .
A new study suggests that facial expressions may affect the feelings you have , not just what others ' see , so paralyzing them with Botox could make you feel them less .
FOLLOW @USATODAYHEALTH FOLLOW @USATODAYHEALTH
For Botox users concerned that the muscle - paralyzing injections will rob their face of its ability to show emotion , a new study suggests that people injected with the toxin might end up with less strong emotion to display in the first place .
Researchers at Barnard College in New York City found that facial expressions appear to play a role in how your emotions develop , not just in how you display them for others to see .
The study suggests that facial expressions themselves may influence emotional experiences through a kind of feedback loop .
In short , Botox — a toxin that weakens or paralyzes muscles — not only changes one 's appearance , but also appears to deaden real emotions .
" In a bigger picture sense , the work fits with common beliefs , such as ' fake it till you make it , ' " study co-author Joshua Davis , a psychology professor at Barnard College , said in a school news release .
" With the advent of Botox , it is now possible to work with people who have a temporary , reversible paralysis in muscles that are involved in facial expressions .
The muscle paralysis allows us to isolate the effects of facial expression and the subsequent sensory feedback to the brain that would follow from other factors , such as intentions relating to one 's expressions , and motor commands to make an expression . "
Davis explained that " with Botox , a person can respond otherwise normally to an emotional event , e.g. , a sad movie scene , but will have less movement in the facial muscles that have been injected , and therefore less feedback to the brain about such facial expressivity .
It thus allows for a test of whether facial expressions and the sensory feedback from them to the brain can influence our emotions . "
The study was published in the June issue of the journal Emotion .

Worldwide military spending jumped 5.9 percent in 2009 to $ 1.5 trillion , according to a new report that underscores the long - term decision of many countries to prioritize defense .
This is despite a recession that shrunk the global economy 2.2 percent .
The US remains by far the biggest military spender , followed by China , the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) said in its annual report on worldwide military expenditures , released June 2 .
Last year saw the steepest jump in worldwide military spending since the start of the Iraq War in 2003 .
See the full list : IN PICTURES : World 's Top 10 Military Spenders
But , as the world ’s military spending increased nearly 50 percent over the past decade , the biggest military budget increases were seen in small , oil - rich countries flooded with new wealth .
From 2000 to 2009 , Chad increased its military budget 663 percent , Azerbaijan increased 471 percent , and Kazakhstan increased 360 percent .
“ It creates potential dangers , ” Sam Perlo - Freeman , one of the report ’s authors and the head of SIPRI ’s military expenditure project , said in a telephone interview from Stokholm Thursday .
“ Although there is nothing inevitable about arms races leading to war , it can potentially be a warning sign . ”
Turning oil into arms
Oil discovery often increases military spending , Mr. Perlo - Freeman says , because – unlike taxes – the revenues carry little political cost , the oil and gas infrastructure justifies increased protection , and the development of natural resources tends to exacerbate tension and conflict .
In Nigeria , for example , SIPRI found that “ the massive environmental damage caused by oil extraction and the lack of benefit to oil - producing regions has generated grievances . ”
Chad , as well , has increased military spending in an attempt to quell domestic conflict .
Chad ’s oil infrastructure was built up with cheap loans from the World Bank .
The global lending agency pulled out of the project when it became clear that the government was spending oil revenues on defense instead of development , says Perlo - Freeman .
In Central Asia , Azerbaijan has used oil revenues to beef up forces along its border with Armenia , which has traditionally had a stronger army and enjoys strategic terrain advantages .
The International Crisis Group said in a report last year that Azerbaijan 's stronger military could put the fragile truce with Armenia under threat .
“ Azerbaijan has been playing catch - up with Armenia , ” says Perlo - Freeman , noting their conflict over the disputed Karabakh region .
US and China top spenders
In absolute terms , the US and China increased military spending the most over the past decade .
China , which regards its military budget as a state secret , spent an estimated $ 100 billion on it in 2009 , a 217 percent increase from 2000 , according to SIPRI .
The only other Asian country in the top 15 was India , which spent $ 36.3 billion on its military in 2009 .
The US spent $ 661 billion on its military in 2009 , a 75.8 percent increase from 2000 .
While current US military spending is still a carryover from the years of George W. Bush , President Barack Obama shows no signs of cutting spending .
The Nobel Peace Prize winner excluded security - related expenditure from a planned three - year squeeze in discretionary expenditure .
At a recent hearing before Congress , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates talked about efforts to trim the fat but the proposed Defense Department baseline budget for fiscal 2011 is $ 708 billion .
Engaged in two wars , the US led the decade of increases , but it was joined by 16 additional nations in the G20 .
In 2009 , Timor - Leste led the world with the biggest increase in military spending , upping its budget 54 percent .
Uruguay , Cyprus , and Lebanon were also big spenders , with each country upping their military budget more than 20 percent this past year .
Biggest drops seen in Iraq , Georgia
While oil - rich countries saw big budget increases over the whole decade , 2009 alone saw a decrease in gas prices that therefore somewhat slowed the rising trend of military budgets in oil - dependent economies .
The fall in oil prices in 2009 most affected the military spending of oil producers Iraq ( down 28 percent ) , Venezuela ( down 25 percent ) , and Oman ( down 16 percent ) , according to SIPRI .
" But the long - term trend of oil and other natural resource revenues driving increased military spending in many developing countries seems set to continue , " the report states .
The largest relative real decrease in 2009 was in Georgia , whose military spending fell 39 percent from exceptionally high levels in 2008 due to the conflict with Russia in South Ossetia .
In the decade leading up to the war , however , Georgia had one of the world 's most rapid increases of military spending .
“ Their rapid expansion was building up to a conflict , ” says Perlo - Freeman .
“ Essentially having failed in the war , they would appear to have decided that the military option is n’t going to work anymore . ”

June 1 , 2010  --
A missed deadline by Congress may mean many of the country 's 44 million Medicare patients will have a harder time finding a doctor -- piquing the frustration of many physicians who already care for these patients .
On Friday , the Senate adjourned for its traditional Memorial Day break without eliminating a physician payment cut for treatments to Medicare patients that took effect today , which means that the country 's doctors may soon be paid 21.3 percent less to treat Medicare patients .
In a statement issued Friday , Dr. James Rohack , president of the American Medical Association , expressed outrage .
" The Senate has turned its back on seniors , " Rohack said in the statement .
" Senators are more interested in heading home for the holiday than in preventing a Medicare meltdown for seniors ...
Already , about one in four Medicare patients looking for a new primary care physician have trouble finding one , and Congressional inaction will make it much worse . "
There are signs the Medicare payment will be kicked down the road when the Senate returns on June 7 .
On Friday , the House of Representatives voted 245 - 171 to pass H.R. 4213 , which among other things would freeze the payment cuts until December 2011 -- though the move came too late for the Senate to act to pass the legislation .
If the payment cuts are delayed , it will not be the first time ; Congress has instituted such delays nine times over the past eight years , most recently last April .
Meanwhile , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid told doctors groups in a letter on Thursday that it will hold claims for 10 days after June 1 to allow the Senate to pass the bill .
But for now , doctors were split on how their already struggling practices will deal with the cuts , should they turn out to be longer lasting .
" I honestly do not know what our practice will do , " said Dr. Scott Fields , professor and vice chair of the Department of Family Medicine at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland .
" What I can say is that the easiest thing to do would be to immediately close to new Medicare patients .
This would maintain our commitment to established patients , but limit our risk . "
Physicians Pledge Continued Treatment for Medicare Patients
Other doctors said they would continue to accept new these patients .
" We will continue to treat Medicare patients and will accept new ones despite the chronic reimbursement problem , " said Dr. John Sutherland , program director emeritus of the Northeast Iowa Medical Education Foundation .
For some , sustaining care for these patients has become a moral imperative .
Dr. Richard Colgan , a family medicine physician at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore , said his practice will continue seeing Medicare patients " because it is the right thing to do and we are professionals .
True healers take care of people , irrespective of the fee payment schedule . "
" We wo n't change how we treat Medicare patients of course , because we 're mission - bound to treat everyone equally , " said Dr. Lee Green of the University of Michigan 's Department of Family Medicine .
But , he added , " This will be an absolute fiasco for primary care physicians nationally ...
I can't imagine a more destructive thing for Congress to do in the current state of our health care system .
To be blunt , I consider this a management failure on the part of Congress , irresponsible bordering on reckless . "
Deficit Spending Concerns May Be Holding Cuts in Place
Part of some lawmakers ' ambivalence to support delaying the cuts could be concern over deficit spending .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over the next two years , such a fix would tack an additional $ 22 billion to the federal deficit .
The cuts in reimbursement actually stem from a formula based on the sustainable growth rate , or SGR , a program Congress set up in the 1990s that tied the payments doctors received for treating these patients to the GDP .
But even though the cuts were scheduled to take effect at the turn of the millennium , a series of quick fixes have pushed the schedule back .
In the meantime , under the threat of such cuts , physicians have been forced to balance their duty to serve patients against the pressure not to be the last center available to Medicare patients .
In this game of musical chairs , the last practice standing could get walloped with a flood of low - revenue Medicare patients -- a hit that Fields said could risk destroying a practice .
Medicare Reimbursement Cuts Could Hurt Practices
Some doctors anticipate that this threat will force them to change the way they conduct their practices -- and for some , the changes have already begun .
" I have not taken new Medicare patients for two years in anticipation of this very event , " said Dr. Marsha McKay , a family physician in Twain Harte , Calif .
" If it becomes a permanent 21 percent cut , I will change to no longer taking assignment for Medicare and will be able to balance bill my patients for their visit .
If I do n't , I will be paying about $ 23 to see them each time . "
Dr. Neil Brooks , a geriatrician who works at a nursing home and rehabilitation center in Vernon , Conn. , said doctors like him who treat older patients will be particularly affected .
" In the short term I will continue to see Medicare patients , but if the cut is instituted and maintained I would most likely be forced to discontinue my current practice , " Brooks said .
" That would sadden me because I enjoy what I do and believe that I do it well .
I would suspect that it would also sadden the many patients for whom I care . "
Dr. Randy Wexler , assistant professor of Clinical Family Medicine at Ohio State University , said that he has begun accepting Medicare patients who come from one to two counties away due to the fact that many family physicians have closed down altogether -- not just to Medicare patients .
And he said that doctors ' patience is running out .
" This on - again , off - again , 10 - day , two - week , two - month or whatever delay is very much hurting the ability of physicians to run a practice , " Wexler said .
" This is no longer a Republican or Democrat issue .
Congress and the White House have finally generated bipartisanship .
Physicians are equally angry at both parties . "

ARM ( s ARM ) , IBM ( s IBM ) , ST Ericsson , Samsung , Freescale and Texas Instruments ( S TXN ) are banding together to back a not - for - profit open - source company , Linaro , which will develop tools , packages , processes and a Linux kernel ( aka a core component of the OS ) that will run on any system - on - a - chip currently used by non PC - devices .
They will fund the UK - based company to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and will liberally spend money on hiring crack open - source engineers — nearly a 100 of them .
And their target is none other than world ’s largest chipmaker : Intel Corp. ( s INTC )
The idea behind Linaro is to develop a Linux - based set of tools and software that can be used by anyone , from folks who make operating systems for smartphones and tablets to set - top boxes .
It ’s amazing when you start to think about how many of our consumer electronics devices and newer forms of computers are running on a variant of Linux .
What that means is that there ’s an increasing diversity of operating systems and chips they run on , and this complexity is only going to increase as more always - on , connected devices come to market .
At present , most of the chip vendors ( and hardware makers ) do a lot of the same work internally , costing them a lot of money , argued Tom Lantzsch , executive vice president at ARM .
“ We are at a critical inflection point and it is becoming clear that most of the large Linux - based efforts want to scale to multiple form factors , ” said Lantzsch in an interview earlier today .
The company will release software on a six - month basis , which would in turn allow companies to focus all their energies on developing user interfaces , applications and other enhancements to their operating systems .
And because of the open source nature of the effort , theoretically speaking , everyone from Android to MeeGo can use Linaro ’s software and enhance it .
In reality , however , I do n’t see that happening , given the tight integration Google has done on the Android OS .
Still , there is a merit to the idea -– with an increasing number of consumer devices becoming digitized and connected , there needs to be a semblance of order at the very basic software level .
When I asked Lantzsch who would be impacted by this new effort , he gave me a politically correct answer .
He dismissed the idea that this new effort would impact MeeGo , Ubuntu , Android or anyone else .
I suspect the real target here is Intel .
If you guys remember , last year Intel bought Wind River Systems , a company that had a virtual lock on the embedded systems and related software , for $ 884 million .
With this new effort , these big companies are trying to do an end run around Intel and its Wind River division .
This business gives Intel an advantage when trying to push its low - power Atom processors , which coincidentally compete with ARM - based processors .
In her analysis of the deal , Stacey wrote :
All sorts of electronics ( yes , even your toaster ) are growing more complicated , and more of them are also are getting connected to the web ( not yet on the toaster ) , which means they are able to send and receive data .
Once that happens , they need bigger brains to manage and react to that flow of information .
Hence the need for smarter embedded chips , and Intel ’s efforts to take its brand of x86 general - purpose computing to all devices .
The purchase of Wind River also gives
Intel a customer base that includes the automotive , consumer electronics and industrial companies to which it wants to sell its embedded chips , giving it access to the customer base that buys embedded chips .
Intel ’s move into the market will be highly contested by the likes of Texas Instruments , Freescale and ARM , which are already selling into the embedded and wireless spaces .
It has taken Intel ’s rivals a year to respond -– and the response is called Linaro .
Let the battle begin .
Sally Mann is perhaps best known for the controversy that attended her series Immediate Family when it was first exhibited in America in the early 90s .
It featured black and white images of her three children , often naked or partially naked , as they played and posed in the woods , lakes and rivers around her home in rural Virginia .
The images , some of which are on show here in the 59 - year - old American 's first British retrospective , are by turns beautiful , disturbing and unashamedly sensual .
Perhaps more problematically , all of them are , to one degree or another , staged .
One photograph that is not on show here features her son's torso stained with a blood - like liquid that has dripped from his abdomen to his upper thighs .
It is called " Popsicle Drips " , a title that undercuts the potentially worrying nature of the liquid smear , but does little to dispel the lingering sense of provocation .
" Many of these pictures are intimate , some fictions and some fantastic , " Mann said of the series , " but most are ordinary things that every mother has seen . "
Well , maybe , but not every mother has restaged and then rendered them in such a darkly beautiful and ambiguous ways .
Intriguingly , none of the more outrightly provocative photographs have found their way into this show , which is an edited version of a bigger retrospective exhibition that has already toured Europe .
Whether this is down to lack of space or fear of public – or tabloid – outcry is anyone 's guess , but one could argue that something has been lost in this excised version of the series : the sense that Mann is walking a tightrope between reflecting childhood sexuality in all its lack of self - consciousness and staging it in often dramatic reconstructions .
This , in effect , is where the true power of her art lies .
The photographs of her children are undeniably beautiful in their depth , detail and composition .
Taken over a 10 - year period on a large format 8x10 - inch camera , they make her Virginian backwoods look idyllic in the manner of Victorian landscape prints .
Except , that is , for the more surrealist images : one called " The Alligator 's Approach " has her youngest daughter sleeping by the banks of a river while the predator of the title appears at the water 's edge .
Her daughter is , of course , pretending to sleep and the alligator is an inflatable toy , but nonetheless the photograph exudes a palpable sense of unease .
Even more so an image entitled simply and directly " The Terrible Picture " , in which one of her young daughters appears to be hanging by the neck from a tree .
Death stalks this vision of a childhood idyll as it does all Mann 's photographs , and , ever the artistic provocateur , she seems to summon its presence perhaps as a way of making it less real and threatening to herself .
( One of the great things about her work is the way it brings out the amateur psychologist in the viewer . )
The other , even more disturbing series on show here is entitled What Remains ( 2000 – 04 ) , which approaches death and dying head on .
Mann gained access to the University of Tennessee Forensic Anthropology Centre , a place that would not seem out of place in one of Chuck Palahniuk 's darkly humorous short stories .
Here , bodies that have been donated to science are left outside in the woods so that the process of organic decomposition can be studied by forensic scientists .
Mann 's close - up images of these rotting corpses are not for the faint of heart , but , again , the prints – made by an old - fashioned chemical method called the wet - plate collodion process – have a Victorian feel that is almost painterly .
One does , though , feel like a voyeur when looking at images such as this .
They raise the ethical question of whether a person 's decision to donate their body to science gives scientists the right , at a later date , to grant Mann permission to photograph that – decomposing – body .
( And whether the result should then be displayed as art . )
Over the years , the process of making photographs has become central to Mann 's work .
Her use of old , often unwieldy , plate cameras and old printing techniques is arduous in the extreme but reflects the patience and rigour she undoubtedly applies to her interlinked subject matter .
Her landscapes are pure southern gothic – to the point where you can picture them on the cover of a Penguin Classics reprint of a Faulkner novel .
She captures unreal places where time seems to have stood still since the civil war : overgrown gardens , humid swamplands and dappled creeks that have somehow resisted the thrust of modernity .
In these images , as with her close - up portraits of her children 's faces , the surface of the photograph is often dappled too – with drips , stains , dust motes .
Again , the wet - plate collodion process comes into play , and one can see why it has sometimes been called " painting in light " .
Mann often prints her images in the back of her truck , where dust and humidity do their work , often preventing the chemicals from adhering properly to the glass .
All the resulting imperfections add to the sense of history and decay that , increasingly , seems to be her abiding fascination .
The philosopher Roland Barthes once admitted that his fascination with photography " probably has to do with death " .
One can sense that Mann not only shares that sensibility but has made it central to her work , even her landscape photography .
" Time , memory , loss and love are my main artistic concerns , " she said in 2007 , " but time , among all of them , becomes the determinant . "
Problematically , sometimes provocatively , but always bravely , she has consistently explored these intertwining themes , and her body of work , for all the uncomfortable issues it raises , is testament to her singular and single - minded creative imagination .
The Family and the Land is on until 19 September
Gerald Allan Cohen was a product of the lost world of Canadian communism .
His working class parents were Jewish Marxists who toiled in Montreal ’s garment trade .
In 1945 , when Cohen was four years old , they enrolled him in the Morris Winchevsky School .
Morning classes were taught in English and covered conventional topics .
But in the afternoon the language of instruction switched to Yiddish and the lessons included the history of class struggle .
One day in 1952 , Quebec ’s Red Squad raided the school , hoping to find communist literature .
The political innocence of Cohen and his classmates was preserved by a quick - thinking teacher who put on a happy voice and clapped her hands as the police arrived : “ Children , the Board of Health is inspecting the school and you can all go home early . ”
Cohen and the other delighted students ran outside , unaware they had McCarthyism to thank for their freedom .
The police never found any incriminating documents at Morris Winchevsky .
But a second raid at the office of the organization that sponsored the school turned up some left - wing pamphlets .
The authorities soon invoked Quebec ’s infamous Padlock Law to close the group ’s office .
Parents withdrew their children from Morris Winchevsky in large numbers and it soon closed .
As Cohen would later put it , “ we were cast forth , as far as our formal schooling was concerned , into the big wide non-communist world . ”
Cohen ’s path in that world saw him study philosophy at McGill University and , beginning in 1961 , Oxford .
The image of a staunch Marxist such as Cohen arriving at Oxford that year is incongruous .
Oxford was then a bastion of so - called analytic philosophy , a tradition of thought that traced its roots to British philosophers such as G.E. Moore and Bertrand Russell .
Insofar as analytic philosophy of the 1960s took up political questions at all , as it did in the work of Isaiah Berlin , it was explicitly anti-communist .
Berlin ’s interest in politics however was the exception .
Oxford - style philosophy focused overwhelmingly on the philosophy of mind , logic and , above all , language .
Political philosophy was so marginal that a year after Cohen arrived Berlin published an essay under the morose title “ Does political theory still exist ? ”
Cohen ’s analytic training made him critical of 1960s Marxism , which he came to term bullshit Marxism .
It was a common occurrence during the 1960s for politically committed students to be hostile to analytic philosophy , on the grounds that it was quietist and trivial .
“ If you are young and left - wing , ” Cohen has said , “ and you come to university with a thirst for relevant ideas , and academic philosophy of the Oxford kind is the first system of thought you encounter , then it will be hard for you not to feel disappointed or even cheated by it . ”
But precisely because Cohen was already so politicized , he did not go to class looking for a political system .
As a result Cohen was able to engage analytic philosophy on its own terms and excel at it and , in time , be transformed by it .
The late 1960s saw Marxist ideas gain academic prominence .
Works by French thinkers such as Louis Althusser were translated and widely discussed .
Cohen ’s analytic training made him critical of 1960s Marxism , which he came to term “ bullshit Marxism . ”
Its practitioners claimed to possess their own intellectual method , known as dialectics .
Such claims struck Cohen as an excuse not to observe normal standards of evidence and rigour .
When one read French Marxists closely , Cohen felt , their ideas were often expressed in such a gassy way it was impossible to determine if they were true or false .
Cohen ’s preferred approach was on display in the 1978 book that made his name , Karl Marx ’s Theory of History : A Defence .
It saw Cohen give an intellectually respectable account of Marxism by jettisoning Marx ’s least defensible ideas and setting out the remainder with ruthless clarity .
Cohen soon became a leader of a school of thought known as analytic Marxism .
Analytic Marxism eventually rejected so much of Marx the dialectics , the scientific pretensions , the claims of historical inevitability that it has long been debated whether it really is a form of Marxism .
Cohen thought the question was misguided .
In his view , Marx began a tradition of political and economic equality , and everything else was negotiable .
Cohen once noted that Galileo and Newton founded physics , but physicists are never asked whether they are a Galilean .
“ Physics must contradict ( much of ) what Galileo and Newton said : only so can it be loyal to the tradition which they founded . ”
Whatever the accuracy of the Marxist label in other ways , it is definitely misleading if it is taken to suggest that only a Marxist can agree with Cohen ’s arguments .
If there has never been another breakout work of analytic libertarianism , Cohen ’s cool and unruffled takedown of Nozick is an important reason why .
One example must suffice .
In the 1970s analytic philosophy rediscovered political questions .
A major figure in the reawakening was Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick .
Nozick was like Cohen in that he sought to employ philosophical tools on behalf of a political tradition anglophone philosophers had ignoredonly in Nozick ’s case the tradition was fire - breathing libertarianism .
Nozick ’s Anarchy , State and Utopia argued for counterintuitive political proposals , such as the abolition of all welfare programs , with great ingenuity and force .
Nozick was profiled in The New York Times Magazine and Anarchy won the National Book Award .
A young conservative I once knew said that if you agreed with Nozick ’s premises then all his conclusions followed as a matter of simple logic .
My friend was a social conservative rather than a libertarian , but the fact that he worked until recently in the office of the prime minister of Canada is testament to Nozick ’s relevance and reach .
The genius of Nozick ’s approach was that it made a case for libertarianism based on moral principles most people already accept .
Like many libertarians , Nozick suggested a philosophy of small government was justified by a commitment to freedom .
He also appealed to the idea of self - ownership .
Most of us feel we have a special authority when it comes to decisions involving our own bodies .
If so , Nozick suggested , reason obliges us to take the same view of the fruits of the labour we perform with those bodies .
Redistributing wealth , he concluded , is not far removed from slavery .
Cohen wrote a devastating critique of Nozick that had a wide impact .
One of Cohen ’s simpler points had to do with libertarian - style property rights .
Their enforcement requires limiting a great deal of freedom .
If I pitch a tent in your backyard , for example , you can call the police to drag me away .
If that is the case , libertarianism cannot be justified as a philosophy of pure freedom , as it is actually a complex mixture of freedom and unfreedom , much like other philosophies .
Cohen ’s analysis of Nozick ’s self - ownership argument was more technical , but it showed that more than one arrangement regarding resources was consistent with self - ownership , which was enough to derail Nozick ’s claim that once we grant self - ownership libertarianism swiftly follows .
Introductory texts in political philosophy now routinely direct students to the 1995 book where Cohen ’s critique of Nozick is found , Self - Ownership , Freedom and Equality .
If there has never been another breakout work of analytic libertarianism , Cohen ’s cool and unruffled takedown of Nozick is an important reason why .
Cohen took libertarianism seriously and his attitude toward it was respectful .
For their part many libertarian philosophers , even though they resist Cohen ’s conclusions , regard him as a critic of special insight .
“ Few if any contemporary thinkers can match Cohen in his ability to grasp what is at stake in an argument and to raise devastating objections , ” wrote David Gordon of the libertarian Ludwig von Mises Institute in 2008 .
“ The questions he discusses are of the highest significance and his answers to them often profound . ” I know how Gordon feels .
In 2008 Cohen published a book - length critique of one of my own intellectual heroes , liberal philosopher John Rawls .
Reading Rescuing Justice and Equality , one instantly has the sense that all other challenges to liberalism are secondary , and that one must grapple with Cohen ’s powerful criticisms if one is to maintain any shred of intellectual honesty .
Cohen ’s untimely death in 2009 at the age of 68 was a major loss .
With his passing went one of the great philosophical minds of our time .
Cohen notes that desirability and feasibility are distinct questions , and that all the evidence suggests that a socialist economy is not feasible , at least not yet .
Why Not Socialism ?
first appeared as a chapter in a 2001 anthology on democratic equality edited by former New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent .
In 2005 Princeton University Press published an 80 - page book , On Bullshit , by philosopher Harry Frankfurt , which became a bestseller .
Why Not Socialism ? is a kind of sequel to On Bullshit .
A tiny hardcover , it contains a revised version of Cohen ’s essay that runs to 82 small pages .
Cohen begins with a discussion of a camping trip .
When people are camping it is normal for them to display a spirit of unforced cooperation .
It would be out of place , for example , for one person to charge another a fee for the use of a paring knife or a Frisbee .
In the small - scale context of a camping trip , Cohen writes , “ most people , even most antiegalitarians , accept , indeed , take for granted , norms of equality and reciprocity . ”
Cohen ’s goal is to identify the moral principles that his camping trip example embodies and then to ask two questions about those principles .
Would it be desirable to see them realized on a society - wide level ?
And would it be feasible to realize them on that scale ?
The first principle Cohen discusses is an uncompromising form of equality of opportunity .
Few people today would support a law that said someone born a servant must remain a servant forever .
There is also widespread support for the idea that unchosen social disadvantages should be corrected for , at least to some degree .
Cohen gives the example of the Head Start Program in the United States , which tries to help poor children succeed at school .
The principle of equality Cohen favours endorses those familiar views , but goes further .
He also wants to make an issue of differences in abilities , such as our differences in strength or intelligence .
Cohen ’s concern is not the differences themselves , but the different levels of wealth they can give rise to .
“ The inequality that arises out of native differences [ is ] a further source of injustice , beyond that imposed by unchosen social backgrounds , since native differences are equally unchosen . ”
This view of equality would allow inequalities brought about by choice .

your mortgage payment at the casino and lost your home as a result , that would be too bad on Cohen ’s principle , as you did so knowing the risks . )
Cohen , however , also defends a principle of community that would rule out extreme inequality even when it was the result of choice .
Cohen ’s rationale is that such inequality “ cuts [ people ] off from our common life . ”
Cohen finds both principles — strong community and deep equality of opportunity — desirable .
Cohen ’s vision of community also involves a commitment to reciprocity , whereby people help each other for their own sake .
If you or I fall on the camping trip , we will use the first aid kit on one another even though there is no financial gain for doing so .
Cohen contrasts such “ community reciprocity ” with the inferior version of recipro­city he sees at work in markets .
The key difference is the motivations involved .
“ People can engage in market activity under other inspirations , but the motives of greed and fear are what the market brings to prominence , ” Cohen writes .
“ I serve others either in order to get something that I desire that is the greed motivation ; or in order to ensure that something that I seek to avoid is avoided that is the fear motivation .
A marketeer , considered just as such , does not value cooperation with others for its own sake . ”
Cohen finds both principles strong community and deep equality of opportunity desirable .
But where an old - fashioned socialist agitator would next launch into a discussion of how feasible such principles are , Cohen notes that desirability and feasibility are distinct questions , and that all the evidence to date suggests that a socialist economy is not feasible , at least not yet .
Cohen endorses one of the classic arguments against socialism , made famous by Friedrich Hayek , that central planning is impossible because modern economies cannot function without the information signals contained in prices .
This is what separates a national economy from a scenario such as Cohen ’s camping trip , where people do not need as much information to plan their face - to - face activities .
“ The socialist aspiration is to extend community and justice to the whole of our economic life .
As I have acknowledged , we now know that we do not now know how to do that . ”
Cohen ’s conclusion is thus a mixed one .
We should endorse his two moral principles even though there is no sign they will lead to socialism any time soon .
But perhaps they could have some application here and there , as in the education or health spheres .
Or perhaps one day our circumstance will change and socialism will become possible .
Cohen ’s closing lines refer to markets as systems of predation .
“ Our attempt to get beyond predation has thus far failed .
I do not think the right conclusion is to give up . ”
What are we to make of Cohen ’s curious essay ?
The principle of equality he defends is sometimes called luck egalitarianism .
It has recently been the subject of much debate among philosophers .
Luck egalitarianism is worth taking seriously in precisely the way more philosophically than politically Cohen suggests .
Imagine someone in the ancient world being faced with the question of whether slavery is just .
Slavery was widespread , and would continue to exist for thousands of years .
It would have been futile , if not dangerous , for any individual person to act on an opposition to slavery .
There were thus huge feasibility problems for the anti-slavery view .
Nevertheless , the question of the morality of slavery had a truth that was independent of its practical challenges .
Luck egalitarianism is worth contemplating in a similar way , with the question of its truth carefully separated from the issue of its immediate practical relevance .
Whatever the political implications of luck egalitarianism , discovering moral truth is its own reward .
The dominant view of our society seems to be a kind of part - time luck egalitarianism , as we try to correct for some inborn differences , such as physical handicaps , but not others .
Grappling with a challenging principle like luck egalitarianism can help shed light on whether our everyday view is correct from the point of view of pure justice .
One of the points that is made in the debate over luck egalitarianism is that even if it is true , it is not clear that it leads to socialism .
People often suffer misfortune as a result of their own choices , critics have pointed out , whether it be getting in a car accident without insurance or building their home on a flood plain .
Luck egalitarianism says outcomes that are the result of choice are fair .
By that standard , people who succumb to foreseeable risks can be left to die .
That seems undesirable , and is no doubt why Cohen introduces his principle of community , as a bridge between luck egalitarianism and socialism .
Yet his community principle does not seem as attractive as his equality principle .
Cohen ’s community principle has the worthy aim of ruling out extreme inequality .
But there are other grounds on which we can justify such a goal .
Some studies suggest for example that people at the bottom of the economic ladder suffer health and other problems simply because they are at the bottom .
We could thus potentially invoke a principle of equal respect or harm prevention to help them .
The problem with Cohen ’s strong principle of community is that it opposes inequality in the name of not seeing someone cut off from our common life .
But there are many practices that in some sense cut people off from the larger community .
They include speaking a minority language , practising a minority religion or having a minority sexuality .
A strong commitment to community of the kind Cohen proposes may counter economic injustice only at the expense of creating injustice in other spheres .
If Cohen had written a book called “ Why Not Luck Egalitarianism ? ” it would have seen him playing to his philosophical strengths .
As it is , however , his desire to say something about socialism sees him addressing more real - world subjects in a less persuasive way .
Nowhere is this truer than his discussion of markets .
Reading Why Not Socialism ?
I wondered if Cohen ’s real gift was criticizing other philosophers .
References to the “ repugnant motives ” and the “ moral shabbiness of market motivations ” appear frequently in Cohen ’s essay .
Yet business books often note that the hardest product for any salesperson to sell is one he or she does not believe in , and the surest path to business failure is to think only of your own needs , not your customers ’ .
Cohen ’s one - sided rhetoric contains a strong element of prejudgement , of a kind that will be obvious to anyone who has ever worked in sales or run his or her own business .
But let us say for the sake of argument that Cohen is right .
The problem with his focus on motives can be seen by noting the experience of Population Service International , an aid organization working in Africa .
PSI distributes mosquito netting to prevent malaria .
When the nets are given away people do not use them , as they do not value things they receive for free .
So PSI sells the nets at a below - market rate .
Doing so has ensured that people actually use the nets , and lives have been saved as a result .
The difference between PSI and an organization that gives away mosquito nets is not one of motivations .
Both groups want to help .
But the two approaches one involving market transactions , the other not have different consequences .
And surely we should judge market exchanges by a standard that puts consequences first .
Putting consequences before intentions would mean praising some things about markets and condemning others .
The entry of large numbers of women into the labour market since the 1960s , for example , has made them less economically dependent on men .
That is a moral gain even though few firms hired women with that goal in mind .
Corporations undermining the democratic process through campaign financing , destroying the environment or becoming price - gouging monopolies are less appealing outcomes of capitalism requiring strong regulation .
Cohen ’s emphasis on intentions is unhelpful because it blurs together good and bad market outcomes .
What explains Cohen ’s dark view of market motivations ?
I believe it stems from his definition of greed as any desire that is self - directed rather than other - directed .
This view admits no difference between self - interest and selfishness .
It will be self - interested of you not to mail your next paycheque to me .
But is it really selfish ?
You worked for it , and so surely you have a more legitimate claim to it than I do .
Selfishness implies not merely acting in self - interest , but doing so to a degree that exceeds what you actually deserve .
Cohen seems to think market motivations are selfish simply because they are self - interested , but that does not follow .
If a group of factory workers goes on strike to protest dangerous working conditions the workers are asking for something that is in their immediate interest .
Cohen ’s standard would suggest their action is thereby selfish .
That not only seems wrong , but it is also a view no self - respecting leftist should flirt with .
Reading Why Not Socialism ?
I wondered if Cohen ’s real gift was criticizing other philosophers whether Marxists , libertarians or liberals rather than presenting his own diagnosis of modern politics .
The book also sees him writing at a lower level of abstraction than usual , and is , of course , very short .
Whatever the precise reason , Why Not Socialism ?
is a disappointing book that does not exhibit the same level of insight as his more sustained works .
It is as the author of those books that G.A. Cohen will rightfully and permanently be remembered .

Readers of We Love DC , I present to you : your DC Metro Dancer , Bob Grannan .
Bob , we salute you .
What was the song that compelled you to dance ?
We ’ve had showtunes and Lady Gaga suggested .
Is it a favorite song or just one that happened to come on ?
I was listening to a song from Hairspray ; either Ca n’t Stop the Beat , Without Love , or Run and Tell That .
The dancing session went on a lot longer than that video , so I ’m not sure what section the videographer caught .
What time of day was it ?
The train did n’t look too crowded , and I ’m wondering if it was the beginning or the end of your day : were you trying to psych yourself up for something , or just chilling out on a long ride ?
That particular dance session was , I believe , at the end of a night out , on my way home .
It ’s actually hard to narrow it down because I do it almost all the time .
How long have you been in DC ?
What do you do when you ’re not dancing ?
I ’ve lived in DC for two years .
I am currently an apartment leasing agent in the Van Ness area .
Did you know you were being taped ?
Does that make you wish you had n’t done it ?
I did realize , during the taping , that I was being taped .
It does n’t really make me regret doing it , though I did n’t really expect anything to come of it .
I ’ll be continuing to do it , if that says anything .
You seem like a man capable of having fun on Metro .
So many others approach it with dread .
What ’s your secret ?
I do have fun on the metro , because I dance when I get on there .
The trains can be really boring if you just sit there , and the music I listen to is not the type to let you just sit down .
It seems like a shame so many people get on there , take a seat and shut down or just get frustrated .
Especially people in a rush .
It ’s funny to me ; they ’re stressed out about being late or on time to something while on the train , like that can help them in any way .
And finally , what would you like the world to know about the mind of the Man Who Dances On Metro ?
I ’m not sure how to answer that question .
I do n’t know that the world wants to know my mind ; just enjoys the momentary glimpse of an oddly placed dance .

LAROSE , Louisiana ( Reuters ) -
The first time shrimp boat captain Louis Buteaux filed a claim with BP Plc to recoup oil spill losses , he was told he did n’t have enough paperwork to prove he actually was the skipper .
So he only got $ 2,500 for the month , rather than the $ 5,000 captains receive and nowhere near what he needs to pay his bills while the worst oil spill in U.S. history fouls his fishing grounds .
After driving three hours to get more paperwork , Buteaux marched into a BP claims center in Belle Chasse , Louisiana , with an inch - thick folder filled with tax returns and trip tickets to prove he actually owns a shrimp boat .
“ Fishermen should be first in line , ” said Buteaux , 69 .
“ We need the money . ”
Here in southeastern Louisiana fishing country , Buteaux ’s comments are echoed widely .
More than two months after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico , many area residents say the claims process is getting somewhat better , but bureaucracy still reigns supreme .
Adding to the red tape is that neither BP nor the government distributes the money .
ACE Ltd ’s ESIS , which helps reduce “ claims frequency and loss costs ” according to its website , mails checks from centers as far away as Delaware .
Sonia Mackey , an oyster boat deck hand , said her first check was eight days late .
“ I think it was just delayed because of the postal system , ” she said .
‘ BP’S POLICY IS NO FRAUD ’
Kenneth Feinberg , an attorney and President Barack Obama ’s newly appointed oil fund czar , has promised to streamline the process and even let some victims file claims online .
He is open to paying lump sums for several months up front , rather than monthly , which would help fishermen who tend to receive most of their annual income during the busy summer months .
Feinberg ran the compensation fund for victims of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , so he ’s no stranger to Herculean tasks .
But his latest job will force him not just to parse money , but to reform a claims process that seems intrinsically difficult to master .
Many of the claims centers BP has set up are hidden away with little signage to distinguish them .
The Belle Chasse center is behind a fast - food restaurant in a small strip mall , with only two small signs in the window and nothing on the street .
One of the signs reads : “ BP ’s policy is no fraud . ”
Feinberg said he will hire more local workers who understand the fishing and oil cultures .
He is also changing the physical signage to reflect the program ’s new name : the Gulf Coast - Feinberg Fund .
Under the new process victims will first receive emergency funding -- much like Buteaux , the shrimp boat captain , did .
Once the oil leak is stopped , claims officials will sit down with victims and determine a long - term damage amount , Feinberg said .
If victims accept the second pot of money , they have to agree not to sue BP or the government .
“ If you decide you want to litigate , go ahead , ” Feinberg said .
“ Is it a good idea ?
Absolutely not . ”
SOME OUT OF LUCK
Earl Hebert , who owns three fishing boats , said he ’s had no problem getting his $ 5,000 check each month from BP .
“ If you come with the right documents , you wo n’t have a problem , ” said Hebert , 72 .
But that document requirement is thwarting many .
Mackey , the deck hand , is worried that a second month ’s check of $ 2,500 wo n’t come because she is paid in cash and does n’t have detailed paperwork .
“ Every time we went back to the claims center , it was something new , another problem , ” she said .
Feinberg said he will require precise documentation , but promised to work with those paid in cash .
However , for workers paid under the table -- a way of life for some fishermen , especially immigrants -- there is no such luck .
“ There ’s nothing wrong with getting paid in cash , ” said Feinberg .
“ When you say ‘ under the table ’ that sounds to me like a violation of the federal tax laws and I cannot be distributing money in violation of federal law . ”
Image caption Iran says its nuclear programme is aimed solely at peaceful energy use
European Union leaders have approved a new set of sanctions against Iran that go further than the latest United Nations measures .
The fresh EU sanctions include a ban on investments , technical assistance and technology transfers to Iran 's key oil and gas industry .
On Wednesday , the US announced its own fresh sanctions , implementing the UN measures approved last week .
Western powers suspect Iran is seeking nuclear weapons - which Tehran denies .
The new EU sanctions were approved on Thursday by a summit in Brussels .
In a statement , the leaders expressed regret " that Iran has not taken the many opportunities which have been offered to it to remove the concerns of the international community over the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme " .
Iran 's shipping and air cargo companies will also be banned from operating in EU territory , and new visa bans and asset freezes will target Iranian Revolutionary Guards .
Russian objections
The new EU sanctions will now be passed on to experts who will work out which companies and products would be targeted .
We are extremely disappointed that neither the United States nor the European Union is heeding our calls to refrain from such steps Sergei Ryabkov , Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Correspondents say the move will put strong pressure on Iran , which is the world 's fifth - largest oil exporter , but has limited refining capability .
On Thursday Russia criticised the EU 's planned sanctions .
" We are extremely disappointed that neither the United States nor the European Union is heeding our calls to refrain from such steps , " Russian news agencies quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying .
The US sanctions announced on Wednesday ban Americans from trading with a number of firms and individuals , including Iran 's Post Bank , Defence Minister Ahmad Vahidi and the air force and missile command of the Revolutionary Guard Corps .
On 10 June the Security Council endorsed a fourth round of UN sanctions on Iran , including tighter financial curbs and an expanded arms embargo .
The US has banned most trade with Iran since 1979 , when Iranian student stormed the American embassy and took diplomats hostage .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissed the vote as " a used handkerchief " fit for the dustbin .
Tehran has rejected calls by the Security Council to halt uranium enrichment - which could have military as well as civilian uses .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is solely designed to produce energy .

Who ’s in ?
" The dispute at this point is really narrowed down to the basis for the city 's decision to end its lease , and whether that 's the same rule they apply across the board , " said Mary Catherine Roper , a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union , which filed a brief endorsing the city 's position .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Congress on Wednesday took major steps to rein in Big Oil ’s offshore drilling practices , as one Senate panel voted to lift all caps on liability in oil spills and another moved to deny offshore leases to companies with poor track records .
The action on Capitol Hill comes 72 days after an explosion involving a BP oil rig , which has left millions of gallons of oil pouring into the Gulf of Mexico from a ruptured deep - water well .
Action kicked off on Wednesday in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , where Democrats pushed through a bill eliminating the $ 75 million cap on liability that oil companies currently enjoy for damages from offshore spills , like the one devastating the U.S. Gulf coast .
The committee ’s vote would open the oil industry to potentially unlimited compensation for economic losses suffered by local businesses and communities and for damages to natural resources .
The change , if approved and made law , would apply retroactively to BP Plc ’s massive Gulf of Mexico spill , although the company has already said it would cover all costs , which will run into the billions of dollars .
As the environment panel worked on its legislation , the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved a separate bill to tighten rules on offshore oil drilling projects .
It would increase civil and criminal penalties on the industry for illegal practices and would tie those penalties to inflation .
Notably , it also would limit lease sales to companies with good track records -- a move that could hurt future operations for companies like BP .
The panel ’s legislation also ratchets up safety requirements , such as mandating redundant blow - out preventers for wells and additional permits for deepwater projects .
On the other side of Capitol Hill , Democratic Representative George Miller said he will offer legislation in the House to deny BP new offshore oil and gas drilling leases for up to seven years because of its “ extensive record ” of worker safety and environmental violations .
Miller is a close confidant of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and chairs the House Education and Labor Committee .
Drew Hammill , a spokesman for Pelosi , said she has not yet reviewed the details of Miller ’s bill “ but shares his concerns about BP ’s poor record . ”
While lawmakers in both the Senate and House of Representatives have made the liability legislation a top priority following the BP spill , a senior Democrat , Senator Max Baucus , expressed reservations about imposing unlimited liability on the oil industry .
Before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved its bill , Baucus said that a $ 10 billion cap that had been kicked around in May , “ made some sense to me ” and he questioned whether the removal of all caps would hurt some U.S. firms while helping foreign ones .
It was unclear whether Baucus would try to amend the bill later in the legislative process .
The liability and offshore drilling safety bills could be combined with other energy and environmental measures being queued up for passage as early as next month , or they could move through Congress individually .
Both are expected to have President Barack Obama ’s backing .
Whitney Stanco , an analyst at Concept Capital ’s Washington Research Group , predicted the full Senate would make some significant changes to the liability bill .
“ We continue to believe the language will likely be moderated on the Senate floor to allow for some risk - adjusted liability limits for shallow - water facilities , ” Stanco said .
BP has agreed to establish a $ 20 billion compensation fund to pay claims from its spill in April , which continues to devastate communities and the environment along the Gulf coast .
But total liabilities could eclipse that sum .
Kenneth Feinberg , the official overseeing the fund , said he expects to complete the first phase of work in setting up the claims facility within the next 30 days .
REPUBLICANS CALL IT COSTLY
Republicans said lifting the liability cap would prevent smaller companies from offshore drilling projects in the Gulf of Mexico , which holds the most promising untapped crude oil reserves in the United States .
It could open the door to more foreign operators , such as Chinese firms , they said .
“ Drilling will be so costly that only a few will be able to afford it , ” said Senator James Inhofe , the senior Republican on the committee .
“ Who are those ?
Big Oil , ” he said .
Instead , he offered an alternative , which was blocked by Democrats , that would have given the president the discretion in setting liability limits , tied to the type of offshore projects .
Deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico has been the biggest hope for growth in U.S. domestic oil production over the last decade .
A string of major discoveries over the past decade by companies including BP have rejuvenated investment in deeper and more difficult waters .

His diocese has denied that Archbishop Zollitsch was at fault
Prosecutors say they are investigating the leader of Germany 's Roman Catholic bishops on suspicion of aiding and abetting the sexual abuse of children .
Archbishop Robert Zollitsch of Freiburg is suspected of allowing the re-appointment of a priest accused of child abuse in 1987 .
Archbishop Zollitsch was in charge of personnel in Freiburg at the time .
The archdiocese rejected the charge , accusing prosecutors and the media of " sensationalism " .
In a statement , it said Archbishop Zollitsch had nothing to do with the case because he did not know about any allegations of abuse involving the priest .
It also said that the archbishop had not been responsible for the re-appointment , which was decided independently by the priest 's religious order .
Image problem
Prosecutors say the accusation is based on a single abuse complaint and investigations are at a very early stage .
" We did not check the accuracy of the claims , " Prosecutor Wolfgang Maier said .
" We only checked whether the claims are sufficient to justify an initial suspicion .
We then started preliminary proceedings . "
Mr Maier said details had been passed on to the authorities in Konstanz in southern Germany , which had already begun an investigation into the priest 's activities .
Church officials said there had been at least one case of suspected sexual abuse at Birnau monastery in southern Germany in the 1960s , where the priest was working .
They said they had only found out about the incident in 2006 .
They added that they immediately reported it to the priest 's religious order - the Cistercians - and the man involved had long since left the monastery .
The BBC's Tristana Moore in Berlin said the fact that the archbishop has been drawn into the abuse scandal is another blow to the image of Germany 's Catholic Church .
Germany is one of a number of European countries where the Catholic Church has been hit by a wave of child abuse accusations .
Last week it emerged that more than 200 former students claimed they had been abused at Jesuit schools across Germany .
In May Pope Benedict accepted the resignation of the German Bishop Walter Mixa , after he was accused of beating children at an orphanage and sexually abusing a boy .
The Pope himself has been accused of being part of a culture of secrecy , and of not taking strong enough steps against paedophiles when he had that responsibility as a cardinal in Rome .
However , his supporters say he has been the most pro-active pope yet in confronting abuse .
The Catholic lay organisation We Are Church has said it is likely there are many other abuse victims who are yet to come forward .
In recent months , Archbishop Zollitsch , who heads the German Bishops ' Conference , has apologised to victims of abuse , saying the Church had failed to help them .
BP has collected 6,000 barrels of oil in the first 24 hours of pumping it from a leaking well up to a drill ship , Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen said Saturday at a press conference .
The 6,000 barrels is equivalent to about 252,000 gallons , CNN reports .
Allen said the goal is to gradually increase the amount being captured by the cap into a ship on the sea 's surface .
The aim is to push production to 15,000 barrels a day , the New York Times reports .
" We got a lot of people out doing oil cleanup on the beach , " Allen said .
" We 're trying to find unemployed people to train to assist in the cleanup effort . "
Over the weekend , BP said it planned to shut four vents on top of a containment cap in an effort to reduce the crude oil still spewing into the gulf , the story says .
Obama pledged to fight alongside the people in the Gulf Coast during his Saturday radio and Internet address .
" We will fight alongside them , until the awful damage that has been done is reversed , people are back on their feet , and the great natural bounty of the Gulf Coast is restored , " Obama said , during his third visit to the Gulf since April 20 .
Obama added that the government would make sure BP paid all the money owed to the people along the Gulf .
BP CEO Tony Hayward said Saturday on a company Twitter account that the energy giant would pay all legitimate claims , the Associated Press reports .
BP estimates it would spend about $ 84 million this month .
The oil has already spread to coastal areas of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama .
A moving slick arrived with the tide in the Florida Panhandle 's beaches Friday as BP continued its cap method , according to the AP .
Six weeks after the rig explosion that killed 11 workers ; the well has leaked between 22 million gallons and 47 million gallons of oil , according to government estimates , AP reports .

Peshawar , Pakistan – Security officials in Pakistan are still questioning an American claiming to be a bounty hunter on the trail of the world ’s most wanted man — Osama bin Laden .
Three teams of civilian and military intelligence officials have been questioning Gary Faulkner , in Peshawar city .
An intelligence official in Chitral , who asked not to be identified , said Faulkner shouted “ do n’t come closer to me or I ’ll open fire ! ” when approached while being detained .
Pakistani investigators plan to conduct psychological tests on Faulkner , an investigator said Wednesday .
Pakistan conducted psychological tests Wednesday on an American construction worker arrested on suspicion of wanting to hunt down and kill Usama bin Laden .
Gary Brooks Faulkner was detained Monday in the remote mountains of Chitral , once a rumored hiding place of bin Laden , near Afghanistan ’s Nuristan province , armed with a pistol , dagger , sword and night - vision equipment .
He was taken to Pakistan ’s northwestern city of Peshawar , to be interrogated by intelligence agents and investigators , officials said .
“ They are asking him a lot of things , especially about the sword and dagger that look like ceremonial weapons .
He said he wanted to kill Usama but killing Usama with a sword and dagger is not child ’s play , ” one investigator told AFP .
“ Carrying a pistol and such a long sword is definitely a crime but we need a lot more clarifications .
Police officer Mumtaz Ahmad Khan said the 50 - year - old long - haired and bearded American from Colorado , who suffers from kidney problems and high blood pressure , was sane but “ frustrated . ”
“ A doctor examined the American and spent about 30 minutes with him , ” an intelligence official in Peshawar later confirmed to AFP .
“ The doctor told us he has some psychological problems but said he is not a mad man , ” the official added .
Earlier , Faulkner ’s brother said the would - be hitman — whom the U.S. press quickly dubbed “ the American Ninja ” — was “ not crazy ” .
Scott Faulkner said his sibling was motivated by patriotism and a belief in God rather than the prospect of the $ 25 million bounty for bin Laden , the world ’s most wanted man .
After the Sept. 11 attacks , Scott Faulkner said his brother began visiting Pakistan to try to find bin Laden because he felt the U.S. military was not “ doing enough , ” The Wall Street Journal reported .
“ Who says , ‘ Why do I rob banks ?
Because that ’s where the money is , ' ” Scott Faulkner asked , saying the brothers went to Pakistan because “ that ’s where Usama is . ”
Scott Faulkner said his brother carried no weapons when he flew out of Denver , but “ he took wire ties ( for use ) as handcuffs .
If he could take ( bin Laden ) alive , he would , ” Scott Faulkner told Fox News Channel .
Hugo Corral , a barber in Greeley , Colo. , told the New York Post he cut Gary ’ Faulkner ’s hair in March and days afterward saw “ him marching down the street with army pants on and cussing .
He would stop and salute . ”
“ He was a pretty weird guy , ” Corral said .
Police in Pakistan said Faulkner arrived as a tourist in Chitral on June 3 , checked into a hotel , was given the customary security escort , then vanished .
The U.S. embassy in Islamabad said American consular officials were working with the Pakistani authorities to gain consular access to the man .

MAJ 11 avril : les attendus sont disponibles
C’est un jugement historique que vient de rendre le tribunal de grande instance de Paris .
Les huit prévenus ayant barbouillé 5 panneaux publicitaires sur les Champs - Elysées en janvier 2008 ont tous été relaxés .
Le Collectif des déboulonneurs de Paris annonce un moratoire sur ses actions de barbouillage .
La balle est maintenant très clairement dans le camp des pouvoirs politiques .
A la sortie du tribunal , quinze membres du collectif se sont immédiatement rendus à l ’Hôtel de Rocquelaure ( secrétariat d’Etat à l’Ecologie ) .
Nous avons été reçus par le cabinet de Mme Jouanno .
Alors que l’examen de la loi Grenelle II est actuellement en cours au sein des commissions de l’Assemblée Nationale , et alors que de nouvelles dérogations pour les afficheurs ont été votées au Sénat en octobre , le gouvernement a ici une occasion parfaite de mettre en oeuvre ce qu’il clame publiquement .
Nos revendications à très court terme sont les suivantes :
abandon pur et simple des dérogations votées au Sénat
reprise des discussions sur le pouvoir de police de l’affichage et sur les sanctions encourus pour dispositifs illégaux
ouverture de discussions sur tous les nouveaux dispositifs publicitaires profitant actuellement d’un vide juridique ( écrans animés , écrans espions avec caméras cachées , …)
nous demandons au gouvernement de s’exprimer publiquement sur la question et de justifier ses choix et orientations
Le cabinet de Mme Jouanno s’est engagé à mettre en place une réunion de travail avec les associations sur ces points avant le début de l’examen du texte à l’Assemblée Nationale le 4 mai .
La date de cette réunion sera communiquée la semaine prochaine .
A plus long terme , nos revendications restent inchangées :
ouverture d’un large débat sur la place de la publicité dans l’espace public
reconnaissance de la liberté de réception ( réduction des formats et densités des dispositifs )
interdiction des dispositifs consommant de l’énergie Cette victoire est dédiée à David .

On the second day of the month - long meeting at the United Nations , Arab countries were reiterating calls for a nuclear - free Middle East with criticism of Israel 's unacknowledged nuclear arsenal and failure to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
The first day of the conference was dominated by rhetorical crossfire between the United States and Iran , as Washington pushed for the UN Security Council to approve new sanctions against Iran .
On Tuesday , Jordan 's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh expressed frustration at the lack of progress on implementing a nuclear - free Middle East , a goal that was declared in a resolution of a previous meeting of NPT signatories
He said that Israel 's failure to sign the NPT and allow international monitoring of its nuclear program renders the NPT a source of instability in the Middle East .
Egypt has proposed that this 2010 NPT conference back a plan calling for the start of negotiations next year on such a Mideast zone .
The proposal may become a major debating point in the month - long session .
The United States has cautiously supported the idea while saying that implementing the idea must wait for progress in the Middle East peace process .
The position reflected a middle ground as the Obama administration sought to satisfy Arab countries while keeping the spotlight of the conference on Iran 's nuclear program .
Meanwhile , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad continued his campaign to stall the U.S. push for new sanctions .
He scheduled a news conference Tuesday afternoon .
On Monday , addressing the conference , he rejected the U.S. allegations about Iran 's nuclear program , saying Washington has offered not a single credible proof that Iran was seeking nuclear weapons .
Iran says it only wants the technology for producing nuclear power .
The debate about Iran dominated the first day of the month - long conference on how to improve the NPT .
The treaty is formally reviewed every five years at a meeting of treaty members - all the world 's nations except India , Pakistan , Israel and North Korea , all of which either have confirmed or are believed to have nuclear weapons .
The review conference is meant to produce a final document pointing toward ways to better achieve the NPT 's goals of checking the spread of nuclear weapons , while working toward reducing and eventually eliminating them .
Because it requires a consensus of all parties , including Iran , any final document would be highly unlikely to censure the Tehran government , which would block consensus .
U.S. officials have said they will be looking to isolate Iran at the conference and to produce an unofficial document calling for stricter enforcement of the NPT that could be signed by the overwhelming majority of signatory countries .
As delegates assess the state of the NPT in UN conference halls , American and European diplomats will be working elsewhere to reach agreement with the sometimes reluctant China and Russia on a fourth round of UN Security Council economic sanctions against Iran .
CHICAGO 
After months of worrying over hints and signs and DNA traces suggesting that Asian carp , a voracious , nonnative fish , might be moving perilously close to the Great Lakes , the authorities here have uncovered the proof they did not want .
They caught a fish .
One bighead carp  a 19.6 - pound , 34.6 - inch male  became entangled Tuesday in a fishing net about six miles from Lake Michigan , in part of a waterway that connects the Mississippi River system to the Great Lakes .
The authorities have searched for nearly a half - year with nets , chemicals and electrofishing equipment , but the fish was the first actual Asian carp to be found beyond an elaborate electric fence system officials spent years devising to avoid this very outcome .

The question state and federal authorities here are now racing to answer is whether the fish was somehow traveling alone  a prospect some environmental advocates consider absurd .
It 's well known that Kansas City Fed Chief Thomas Hoenig is the one major voice of dissent on the Federal Reserve .
He 's called for a change to the dovish language , a rate hike in short order , while warning that cheap money would inevitably create another bubble .
But he does n't want to just stop at a 1 % hike he said at a business lunch in Bartlesville Oklahoma today .
Reuters :
Thomas Hoenig , president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank , has called for a modest increase in borrowing costs before , but he went further on Thursday by before , but he went further on Thursday by suggesting it should happen over the next several months and by calling for an increase in borrowing costs to 3 percent in rapid order .
Is that going to happen ?
Heck no .
BUT it does show just how far he is out of the mainstream .
And if this is what it 's going to take to kill the next bubble , the help us all .
The launch of Microsoft 's new Kinect games system , which allows players to run , jump , punch and shoot without having to wear strange clothing or hold any kind of controller , has got technology and cinema buffs alike thinking of Tom Cruise again .
Specifically , the moment in the film Minority Report when Cruise , playing police chief John Anderton , tries to figure out film footage and computer data by waving his hands around in mid-air to manipulate it : turning it , shrinking it , pushing it aside , revolving it .
Give it time : in a few years , we 'll more than likely be controlling our computers in a similar way .
When Minority Report came out in the summer of 2002 – the iPod was less than a year old and the iPhone and iPad were n't even gleams in Steve Jobs 's glinting eyes – its technological visions of the future seemed mind - bogglingly cool .
The film was set in 2054 ( Philip K Dick 's short story , on which it is based , is n't so specific ) , so director Steven Spielberg presumably reckoned he was giving it plenty of room for the array of cutting - edge technologies to become part of our daily life .
What Spielberg did n't count on , though , is what might be called " the Star Trek effect " .
If you show off imaginary cool technology in a film or TV series , then kids , teenagers and enthusiastic technologists of all ages will try their damnedest to make it come true .
When James T Kirk beamed down to an alien planet and flipped open his communicator , when Spock waved his tricorder over strange life forms and murmured " intriguing . . . " , when the crew of the Enterprise teleported , carried phasers , communicated with their computer by voice and carried data around on little plastic sticks , a generation looked at it and thought : that 's a future I want to live in .
And so with Minority Report .
In the manner of all the best science - fiction , it included numerous gadgets but did n't rely on any of them as the key to its plot , which still revolved ( as was Dick 's predilection ) on people 's ability to deceive themselves about truth , lies and reality .
For a lot of geeky fans , however , the plot was incidental to the possibilities offered by the technologies on show .
And there were plenty : pre-crime ( predicting that a particular person will commit a crime ) ; iris recognition ( picking you out from a crowd on the basis of the unique pattern of your iris ) ; personalised advertising ( where what you see on hoardings is targeted specifically to you ) ; e-paper ( electronic paper , for newspapers with moving images that people can read on trains ) ; 3D video ( do we have to explain this ? ) ; computer - guided cars ( which follow preset patterns ) ; spider robots ( for tracking people ) ; jetpacks ; and some rather unpleasant police restraint technologies – including the sick stick ( makes you sick on contact ) and " the collar " ( which effectively paralyses you once fitted ) .
Things such as gesture computing were still way off ( though a jetpack had been used in the opening ceremony of the 1984 Olympic Games ) .
But , eight years on , Spielberg and his technical advisers look as though they were too cautious . . .
Gesture - based computing
John Underkoffler , the MIT scientist who created the gesture - based computing that Cruise used in Minority Report , has developed his own company – Oblong Industries – to make it real and market it .
But he has already been overtaken by companies such as Apple with the iPhone , offering " pinch " and " pull " and " swipe " for pictures and text since 2007 .
And of course by Microsoft , both with its new Kinect games system and its table - sized , touch - screen Surface , which lets you move things around with your hands .
Dynamic iris recognition
Your iris has a unique pattern , and is already used to identify you ( so long as you are standing still in front of a camera ) by border control agencies in the UK , Netherlands , United Arab Emirates , US and Canada .
In the film , people 's irises are read while they 're on the move , presenting the extra challenge of movement and resolution .
But with cameras and computers improving all the time , do n't bet against this not being ready way before 2054 .
Personalised ads
In Minority Report , the iris recognition then led to personalised ads bombarding you on hoardings everywhere .
That does n't happen offline , but you do get them – to some extent – on the net : DoubleClick , the huge advertising company owned by Google , tracks any sites you visit that use its adverts , and can tailor what ads you see to an agglomeration of your interests .
Attempts by the UK web - tracking company Phorm to let internet service providers do similar things with ads , by tracking where you went online , ran into privacy problems .
And do n't forget Facebook , which is spookily good at targeting ads – because it has access to everything you have told it about yourself ( though it insists it does not share that with advertisers ) .
Computer - guided cars
Arguably , the closest we will get to this is satnav systems , which are actually pretty pervasive ; the market is nearly saturated , at least in the UK .
However , the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( which gave us the internet ) has had an " autonomous car " competition – and entrants are getting better .
Would n't it be nice if your car could drive you home after a night on the booze ?
Pubs would cheer .
3D video
Have you seen Avatar ?
Up ?
Sky 's new 3D TV service ?
The new Nintendo 3DS ?
Done .
E-paper
Apple 's iPad and Amazon 's Kindle are a bit bulky , but lots of news organisations think they are just the ticket for electronic reading .
But real " electronic paper " – bendy , able to retain an image , electronically rewriteable – is getting closer all the time .
In January , the Korean company LG showed off a 19in flexible e-paper , and companies such as Plastic Logic and E Ink are getting electronics that look closer to paper all the time .
Perhaps it will be a hit when newspapers stop printing .
So , 2054 then .
Or perhaps 2015 ?
Pre-crime
In the film , " pre-cogs " can look into the future and inform the police ( they have got no choice – they are stuck in baths in the basement ) .
In 2008 , Portsmouth city council installed CCTV linked to software that would note whether people were walking suspiciously slowly .
University researchers had already realised in 2001 that , if you recorded the walking paths of people in car parks , you could spot the would - be thieves simply : they did n't walk directly to a car , but instead ambled around with no apparent target .
That is because , unlike everyone else in a car park , they were n't going to their own car .
That 's not the end : Nick Malleson , a researcher at the University of Leeds , has built a system that can predict the likelihood of a house being broken into , based on how close it is to routes that potential burglars might take around the city ; he is meeting Leeds council this week to discuss how to use it in new housing developments , to reduce the chances of break - ins .
So although pre-crime systems can't quite predict murder yet , it may only be a matter of time .
Spider robots
The US military is developing " insect robots " , with the help of British Aerospace .
They actually have eight legs ( so , really , arachnid robots ) and will be able to reconnoitre dangerous areas where you do n't want to send a human , such as potentially occupied houses .
" Our ultimate goal is to develop technologies that will give our soldiers another set of eyes and ears for use in urban environments and complex terrain ; places where they cannot go or where it would be too dangerous , " Bill Devine , advanced concepts manager with BAE Systems , told World Military Forum .
Give it 10 years and they will be there .
Sick sticks
These have already been the object of some research : Pennsylvania State University researchers developed a system to emit ultra - bright light pulses that induce " temporary blindness , disorientation , nausea and blindness " .
And a company called Intelligent Optical Security has built and sold it for the US 's Homeland Security organisation – so feel worried .
There 's no sign of restraint collars yet , although watching England play football has been known to have the same effect .
During a radio interview once the host asked me to explain fungal sexuality .
My answer was a bit too intricate and long to make it into the broadcast –I got bogged down in the details .
It ’s not that you need a PhD to understand how fungi have sex , it ’s just that it ’s a most unfamiliar kind of system , in which analogies to human sexuality will get you in trouble .
People occasionally ask me about this , and I ’ve really never come up with a solid , succinct answer .
So I thought I ’d have a try at a kind of introduction to the sex life of fungi–at least the part that has to do with sexual compatibility .
My gift to you : 2.5 days worth of emergence by the dog stinkhorn , Mutinus caninus .
It is here mainly to provide an outlet for your anthropomorphizing .
The spores of this stinkhorn are its sexual offspring .
They are produced in the stinky green goop on the head of the thing .
Further words elude me , but for more stinkhorn sauciness , have a look at Michael Kuo ’s Stinkhorn Hall of Fame and our own other stinkhorn posts .

The trickiest concept for discussing fungal sex is “ gender . ”
In humans , there are men and there are women ( from a strictly reproductive point of view ) , and it takes one of each to make a baby .
The male donates some genetic material ( a gamete , the sperm ) , which is received by a female gamete ( the egg ) , and those gametes get together to form a new human .
We trust you ’re all familiar with this scene .
Among fungi , any individual can donate or receive genetic material–so you can already see we need to let go of the concept of gender .
Let ’s talk instead in terms of what mycologists call mating types .
A fungus simply needs to find a mate of a different mating type .
Of the fungi you might be familiar with , hmm , most species have only two mating types ( they ’re bipolar ) , and some have four or more possible mating types ( they ’re tetrapolar ) .
Any particular individual of a species is just one mating type , of course .
Most molds have two ; many mushrooms and bracket fungi have four or more .
A few fungi , like the unassuming split gill , Schizophyllum commune , have more than ten thousand !
In the same way that our genders are controlled by our genetics ( Kathie has two X chromosomes ; Bradford has an X and a Y ) , mushroom mating types are determined by genes .
In mushrooms , either one or two sets of genes control the ability to mate .
Mating type genes in fungi do n’t confer secondary sexual traits like facial hair or Adam ’s apples ; they do control 500 to 1000 genes involved in the development of sexual structures and spores .
Shockingly , either fungus partner can get pregnant ( by making a mushroom ) , or be a dad ( by delivering a gamete ) , or both .
The whole division of labor thing is an animal quirk .
Now here is where it gets really crazy .
If you have n’t shed your attachment to gender , now ’s the time .
In many large , charismatic fungi , genes at two different locations on the chromosomes control what ’s called a tetrapolar mating system .
In these fungi , two individuals must differ at both loci to make a good match .
Now let ’s say you ’re one of these fungi .
If at location MAT - A you have the A2 mating type allele , and at location MAT - B you have the B1 mating type allele , then your mating type is A2B1 .
You must find a partner who is different than you at both locations ( may I suggest A1B2 ? ) .
Your beautiful baby spores will be this mix : A1B1 ; A2B2 ; A1B2 ; and A2B1 .
If your babies should get together and try to mate ( perish the thought ) , they will only succeed 25 % of the time .
Hello ?
You with me ?
It got a little complex there , did n’t it ?
The deal is , a fungus just has to find a mate of a different mating type .
So actually , when a species has a lot of mating types , it ’s EASIER for an individual to find a mate , because the odds go up .
In contrast to humans–a human can typically mate successfully ( have kids , I mean ) with about half the people in the room .
But a fungus might find that nearly everybody on the dance floor is a potential mate .
See ?
Homosexual fungi ?
Well , not exactly .
At least in the human version of homosexuality nobody ’s going to get pregnant without some outside input .
But there are some fungi that are self - compatible ( homothallic ) –they can have offspring without a partner .
There are two ways to do this .
One is to have copies of all the needed mating type alleles in each nucleus ( in the majority of mushrooms , a spore contains only a single nucleus , and a haploid one at that ) .
The other way to go is to pack two different , compatible nuclei into a spore , ready to mate .
This latter method is how the common supermarket button mushroom does it .
I know !
It seems like such an ordinary mushroom .
The other kink of fungi ( best friends forever ? ) is that even if they are not sexually compatible ( because they are of the same mating type ) , different individuals of a species may be vegetatively compatible .
An entirely different genetic compatibility system dictates whether they can fuse their mycelia to share resources , even though they ’ll never have sex .
Intriguingly , there are no sexually transmitted diseases among fungi , but there are myco-viruses that can be spread through vegetative compatibility .
I ’m sure there ’s a “ nonsexual STD ” joke trapped inside this paragraph …
It ’s all horribly interesting .
There ’s much more to say .
But it is hard to get our minds around some of this stuff , just because we ’re so used to the silly but familiar animal model .
p.s. Were you really expecting me to tell the joke ?
I ’m not telling the joke .
Smash and grab raid fails as burglar hit by own rock
He tried once , he tried again , he tried a third time - but each attempt to break the shop window rebounded on him .
The still unidentified burglar was throwing a rock at a shop in Wellington , New Zealand , which sells skateboards and streetwear .
But the rock just kept bouncing back and knocking him on the head until he , and a watching accomplice , gave up .
Police say they hope the experience has knocked some sense into the burglar .
Detective Sergeant Mark Scott said the two offenders were caught on camera trying to smash a window of Empire Skate , in Herd Street , Chaffers Marina before dawn .
" We can see from the CCTV images , one of the offenders is seen throwing a rock at the window which then comes down and hits him on the head , at which point they flee the scene . "
Police are now asking for witnesses to come forward as they continue to try to identify the failed burglars .
The decision to upgrade to a newer version of a smartphone platform needs to be driven by practicality , not for sheer " gotta have it " factor or because your carrier or the fanboys tell you that you need it .
A whole seven months ago , back in November of 2009 , I bought myself a Motorola Droid .
At the time , the phone was considered to be absolutely state - of - the - art , with a high - resolution display , advanced Android 2.0 software , voice recognition , integrated GPS , 600 Mhz OMAP processor , and a nifty slide - out keyboard design .
In those seven months Google 's Android OS has advanced at a pace equivalent to bacterial gestation in a petri dish .
Seemingly overnight , the platform has exploded , spawning many new phones from all the major carriers and TWO major OS upgrades , " Eclair " ( 2.1 ) which debuted on the Nexus One and now " Froyo " ( 2.2 ) , which was announced at the recent Google I /O conference .
In addition to the base OS upgrades themselves , the various handset manufacturers have been rolling out their own software and hardware enhancements with the phones , trying to outdo each other with each new handset release .
It 's almost as if the minute a handset is released , within days , another one from a competitor makes it obsolete .
Someone else always has a better , bigger , higher resolution screen , or a faster processor , better camera , more RAM , more integrated storage , or better user interface integration .
Heck , it 's not unusual to see this happen within the same handset manufacturer between two different carriers .
HTC is one of the biggest offenders in this area .
I 'd liken this activity to an arms dealer supplying weapons to opposing third world nations , watching them exchange fire , collecting the proceeds from the sales , and then selling them both new and improved weapons to kill each other .
Except that it 's happening on what seems to be a month to month basis , or even faster .
All of this is just fine , as capitalism and revenue generation is a good thing .
Spending money is good as it improves the economy .
However , from a consumer perspective , this seems rather frustrating , as the constant " what 's coming next ? " factor is always in play , and if you are someone who is at the end of a contract cycle or between contracts , it 's always a question of when the right time is to upgrade or to jump on a new platform .
Unless you are someone who has a very , very close eye on the industry -- like our own Matthew Miller and Andrew Nusca -- and have good contacts with the handset manufacturers or the carriers who are willing to brief you or leak information -- the answer is , nobody really knows when the right time to make a move is .
This holds true even for more evolutionary , iterative platforms like the iPhone or even the BlackBerry , which releases in one year cycles .
Getting one of these phones STILL interrupts your typical contract term if you want to get the new one each time it is released , and the penalty is considerable if you switch between contracts .
I consider myself something of an armchair observer of the mobile industry who understands the platforms a great deal , but there 's no way even as a very knowledgeable consumer who reads the cellphone / gadget blogs voraciously that you 've made the right purchasing decision .
Your average consumer is far more uniformed and confused by this rapid obsolescence than someone like myself .
I get numerous emails from readers and friends about what phone they should buy when they end contracts , and I 'm usually at a loss as to advise them what phone they should get any given date .
At some point you have to throw your hands up and say to hell with it , I bought this phone , and I 'm sticking with it until the contract is up .
Because unless your carrier gives you some kind of discount or incentive to switch phones during your contract period , it makes absolutely no sense to upgrade , especially if the improvement is incremental .
Sure , the Droid 2 and the Droid X -- both of which will replace the original Droid only seven months after its introduction -- look really nice , but do I really need one ?
Maybe if the upgrade cost was $ 200.00 , but since I 'm not even halfway through my two year contract period , I know I wo n't be eligible for any kind of subsidy .
Those phones will probably cost me $ 500.00 if I were to pick one up without any incentives or discounts .
[ NOTE : A word to the wise -- the second you buy a new smartphone , make sure you get your carrier 's device coverage / replacement plan added to your monthly service , because if your device dies mid-contract past its warranty period ( which is almost in every case only a single year ) and you do n't have that coverage , you are HOSED .
I learned my lesson on my last carrier , the hard way . ]
And what am I really getting for that $ 500.00 if I upgrade early ?
Froyo 2.2 with Flash support ?
Supposedly , Motorola is going to be upgrading the original Droids to Froyo 2.2 over the summer ( as they did with Eclair 2.1 ) and if they keep their promise , I 've got that covered without any additional cost to me .
Should Motorola re-neg on their promises ( which would be highly inadvisable given Verizon 's loyal customer base that just bought a ton of original Droids in the last seven months ) it 's not like I wo n't be able to run other mainstream Android 2.x apps .
Sure , I wo n't get the performance enhancements , and I wo n't get Flash , but so what ?
And okay , I wo n't get a faster 1 Ghz processor .
But still , it 's not like my Droid works slowly .
What would that 1 Ghz really give me , a 30 percent improvement in application response time if I get the Froyo upgrade on my current unit ?
And yeah , the screen wo n't be higher resolution or bigger , but look , we 're talking about a cellphone here , not a tablet .
If I want the big screen , I 'll use my iPad or my PC .
Just about the only thing I really want that 's in the Droid 2 that is n't in the current Droid is a better designed keyboard .
C'est la vie .
But the biggest reason why upgrading at this point in time does n't make any sense ?
The network .
Yes , Verizon has an excellent network , but what would be the point of sinking $ 500.00 on a new phone if my mobile network speeds are n't improved ?
When Verizon goes LTE in 2011 , maybe I 'll consider a new phone that runs on that new network before my contract ends .
Maybe .
For all you folks with iPhone 3GS units on AT&T , you might want to consider the network aspect before you upgrade early to the iPhone 4 .
Have you too become sick and tired of the Smartphone upgrade arms race ?
Talk Back and Let Me Know .
ANCHORAGE ( Reuters ) - A legal defense fund for former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was illegal and must repay nearly $ 400,000 to donors , according to a settlement with a state - appointed lawyer announced on Thursday .

But Palin , the feisty former Republican vice presidential candidate who has become a fixture of the conservative Tea Party movement , probably violated a state ethics act without knowing she was doing so , independent counsel Tim Petumenos said .
While governor , Palin faced some two dozen ethics complaints , which she said left her with a legal bill of more than $ 500,000 .
Her political action committee raised a fund to pay for her defense .
A preliminary ruling by another independent counsel last year said the fund was illegal because it used her official position as governor to raise money for her personal gain .
Petumenos confirmed the decision and said no such legal defense fund had ever been set up before for a state official in Alaska .
Palin violated the ethics rules because she was a beneficiary of the fund but probably relied on bad advice from out - of - state lawyers to conclude it was above board , Petumenos said at a news conference .
He added that Palin should have checked with the state attorney general before pursuing the fund .
“ It is the responsibility of every public official to make sure they are personally compliant with the ( Alaska Ethics ) Act , ” he said .
The deal requires Palin ’s fund to give back to donors $ 386,856 collected while she was in office .
A further $ 33,546 collected after she resigned will not be affected by the deal .
Palin , no longer a public official , has launched a new defense fund .
She is now independently wealthy but her lawyer , Thomas Van Flein , told reporters he still believed she ran up the legal costs in her capacity as governor and so a new fund was justified .
The former chief executive of a British chemical company faces the prospect of extradition to the US after the firm admitted million - dollar bribes to officials to sell toxic fuel additives to Iraq .
Paul Jennings , until last year chief executive of the Octel chemical works near Ellesmere Port , Merseyside , and his predecessor , Dennis Kerrison , exported tonnes of tetra ethyl lead ( TEL ) , to Iraq .
TEL is banned from cars in western countries because of links with brain damage to children .
Iraq is believed to be the only country that still adds lead to petrol .
The company recently admitted that , in a deliberate policy to maximise profits , executives from Octel – which since changed its name to Innospec – bribed officials in Iraq and Indonesia with millions of dollars to carry on using TEL , despite its health hazards .
The firm 's Lebanese agent , Osama Naaman , was extradited and agreed this week to plead guilty and co-operate with US prosecutors .
Although the US department of justice has run much of the case , the Serious Fraud Office is keen to claim jurisdiction .
Senior Iraqi oil ministry officials are accused of taking British bribes throughout the UK - US occupation , up until 2008 .
Ahmad al - Shamma , the deputy oil minister in Iraq , told the Guardian he would investigate the charges .
He strongly denied courtroom allegations that he himself had taken a free holiday in Thailand .
He said he had never been to Thailand and that a middle man involved , now under arrest in the US , may have pocketed the alleged payment himself .
Both Jennings and Kerrison are identified in court statements by the US department of justice , which is conducting an expanding corruption investigation and may seek Jennings 's extradition to the US , according to legal sources .
Jennings says he is not free to comment on the allegations against him .
Kerrison , who left the firm five years ago , denies wrongdoing and says he is being made a " fall guy " by his old company .
The firm agreed to pay relatively small corporate fines of $ 40 m ( £ 26.7 m ) .
It said the matter was a " deeply regrettable chapter of our history " and " nothing like this will ever happen again " .
Both Jennings and Kerrison separately obtained multi-million pound payoffs from their company .
Jennings stepped down in March 2009 , and the board said it had now " replaced members of senior management who were involved in , aware of or who should have been aware of the criminal conduct , including Innospec 's CEO " .
Jennings , now finance director of the Birmingham - based waste firm Biffa , said he could not comment because " there are currently investigations in the UK and US into the conduct of a number of individuals connected with Innospec " .
Kerrison bought a wine estate near Cape Town , South Africa .
Photos in local magazines show him relaxed in shorts , with a celebratory glass of his own Doolhof Sauvignon in his hand .
"
It is not the case that I have in some way been living off ill - gotten gains . "
He had no indication that he faced prosecution or extradition , he said .
US prosecutors say multi-million dollar bribes to Iraq were agreed in 2001 - 3 , when Kerrison was chief executive .
A formal sentencing document said : " Innospec admits its former chief executive officer … approved payment of the kickbacks . "
Kerrison says these are " false accusations " .
He told us : " Obviously there has been a serious fall - down in how Innospec has done business , including illegal transactions , and as an ex-CEO I feel a degree of responsibility as some of it was on my watch . "
But he said that he had not been personally aware of it : " I have not authorised any bribes , backhanders , or other illegal or dubious payments . "
A decade ago , Octel decided to remain the world 's only manufacturer of TEL for cars , after it was banned in the US and Europe .
They used high profits from non-western countries to diversify into other products and to pay back investors , mainly US hedge funds run by Connecticut billionaire Jeffrey Gendell .
According to prosecutors , the strategy included the corrupt blocking of health campaigns .
In Iraq , bribes were paid in 2007 to sabotage field trials of MMT , a non-lead alternative additive .
In Indonesia , money was poured into a " defence of lead " campaign to pay off local politicians .
The phase - out of TEL was successfully delayed for five years .
One Octel executive wrote : " As you are aware , Indonesia was planning to go lead free in 2000 … this obviously did not happen for a number of reasons and since 1 January 2000 until the present , we have supplied 28,390 tons of TEL … generating $ 277 million in revenue . "
The leniency of the corporate plea bargain caused protests from Lord Justice Thomas this year at one of the corporate sentencing hearings in London .
He said " No such arrangement should be made again . "
US and UK prosecutors agreed the firm could not afford to pay more .
But the company allegedly handed out $ 26 m in dividends when it knew it was under investigation , according to the US department of justice .

Ellen Degeneres : Converting pop 's hopefuls one McCartney tune at a time
by Jeremy Hooper
There 's a sweet moment in 1978 's An Unmarried Woman where Jill Clayburgh 's character sits at the piano and sings a few verses of " Maybe I 'm Amazed " alongside her daughter ( played by Lisa Lucas ) :
A very real moment .
From a good flick , by the way .
And I say that not just because it was shot in my neighborhood -- it 's really a special film .
Kind of like an Abe Beame era Sex And The City , but with a bit more grit and a lot more panty hose .
Check it out .
But the reason why I bring you here is not to stealthy promote SATC2 ( in theaters May 27 ) , but rather to make a point about how ridiculous the Concerned Women For can be .
Especially when it comes to America 's favorite lesbian and the " agenda " she 's supposedly trying to foist upon poor , vulnerable " American Idol " contestant Crystal Bowersox :

No , no -- Janice says it was all a lez - conspiracy , dontcha know ?
Now , never mind that contestants on this show are constantly gender - bending the songs , especially when theme weeks demand it of them .
Never mind that Crystal herself chose " Come To My Window " for her other performance of the night , even though that one is a love song written by a lesbian , and Crystal is herself straight - identified .
Never mind that the most lauded performance all season long came from a young man singing " Straight Up , " a relationship made famous by a female .
Never mind that the mother and daughter in the An Unmarried Woman clip so how easily this tune can travel along the chromosomal spectrum .
NEVER MIND THAT THIS IS F*** ING RIDICULOUS !
In CWA world , it only takes a lesbian existing in public to create " concern . "
Maybe I would be amazed .
Unfortunately , this stuff is just par for the course .

Copa Mundial 2k10 kicked off today in grand fashion , with host South Africa taking a point off of heavily favored Mexico .
Tomorrow ’s featured match ( featured here , anyway ) sees the US taking on an even more heavily favored England side that , despite having some of the best talent on the planet , has been lackluster in its pre-Cup tuneups .
Of course , the US has been inconsistent , as well – looked good beating Turkey , vulnerable in the back in a loss to the Czechs , and absolutely terrible in an inexplicable win over the Aussies ( who played like they were winding up a three - day bender ) .
So grab a beer and we ’ll see which teams show up .
A lot rides on the outcome , and not just of this one game .
In general , World Cup 2010 is a watershed moment for soccer in the US , and billions of dollars hang in the balance .
On the pitch , this American team is as capable as any we ’ve had , perhaps ever .
And our infrastructure is improving daily , with better youth programs , better intermediate development programs and academies , a rapidly improving pro league and more and more of our top players finding their way into European sides – and the ability to succeed in top - of - the - table sides in England , Italy , Spain , Germany , France and Holland is the real measure of where you stand in the global food chain .
So you can expect American teams to keep getting better and better , regardless of the result in South Africa .
The reason Copa 2010 is so important , though , is money .
If the US gets out of the group stage ( not guaranteed , but we should ) and perhaps wins in the round of 16 , that sends a message to the American sports fan that the US is a serious player in the world ’s game .
As I noted several years ago , people carp about soccer for a number of reasons ( low scoring , for instance ) , but when push comes to shove , what really keeps us away from MLS parks and televised games is the fact that , well , a lot of pissant little countries are better than we are .
And from the limited and jingoistic perspective of the typical American sports fan , if Wherethefuckistan beats you at something , that something is n’t a valid game by definition .
And make no mistake , Americans like to win .
We insist on it .
We ’re used to being the best and at some level we probably feel it ’s our right .
And frankly , we do n’t much trust any sport where godforsaken France is better than us .
Think about it .
What sports will Americans plop down their money for ?
Football ?
You betcha – and we ’re the best at it ( of course , that ’s pretty much by default , is n’t it ? )
Baseball ?
Our game , and we ’re the best in the world at it .
Hoops ?
Ditto , although the rest of the world is slowly catching up .
Hockey ?
Ummm , well , we ’re # 2 right now , and to be honest , our fourth most popular sport draws pathetic TV ratings ( which sucks , because I feel like you ca n’t possibly not love the game if you know a little about it ) .
What else ?
Well , to a lesser extent , tennis , golf , maybe even a little track and field .
Boxing .
Stock car racing .
And these are all sports where if we are n’t the best at the moment , we were recently enough and fully expect to be again in the near future .
In fact , to the best of my knowledge , there is pretty much no sport that Americans care enough to watch in significant numbers that we are n’t a world power in .
Lately , though , something has been changing where the American sports consciousness is concerned .
About three weeks ago I woke up one morning , flipped on SportsCenter to find that the top story was … not the NBA playoffs .
Not the previous evening ’s MLB results .
Not even – gasp !
– the LeBron James free agency soap opera .
Nope .
It was that the injury to German captain Michael Ballack ( he ’d been chopped down in an egregiously dirty play in Chelsea ’s FA Cup final win against Portsmouth ) was going to keep him out of the Cup .
Think about that for a second .
It ’s SportsCenter .
The top story is that the German captain has been ruled out of the World Cup .
This was certainly the 7th Sign .
All across America walls were bleeding , velvet Elvises were crying , storm clouds were gathering over deserted soccer fields , fallen angels were materializing in truck stop restrooms with cryptic messages for the Earth ’s leaders …
Still , if you ’ve been paying attention , you realize that most American media outlets have been taking futbol a lot more seriously of late , and ESPN never misses a chance to inject some goal or another into its plays of the day .
ESPN ’s interest is obvious – they televise MLS and have picked up the contract to carry Premiership games in the UK ( some of which make their way onto ESPN2 HD ) , and we can probably expect more of this during the coming season .
If the US team earns some glory on the field in South Africa , then perhaps it justifies some of the hype in the mind of Joe Footballfan ( who probably even played soccer as a kid , and who ’ll perhaps watch a team that makes him feel good about himself before he will one that finds a way to lose to a nation he can’t even find on a map ) .
If the Americans flame out ( like they did four years ago ) , though , ESPN is going to realize a lot less from its investment that it might otherwise .
So best of luck to Landon and Gooch and Jozy and Tim and the Bradley family and the rest of the boys wearing those goddamned awful Nike uniforms .
The fate of American marketers rests with your speed , your power and your courage .
Okay , maybe that ’s a tad snide .
We all know that if soccer ever becomes the national pastime , it wo n’t be anytime soon .
But there ’s plenty of room in this country for the growth of such an engaging sport , and I can easily imagine soccer being a bigger deal in terms of revenues and ratings than hockey is ( not hating on hockey here – I wish it were a bigger deal nationwide , as well ) .
I love the game , and do n’t see any reason why you have to choose between soccer and football .
We can love all of it , you know ?
( Is n’t that what America is about ?
All of it .
Hell , that ought to be in the Pledge of Allegiance . )
And American success in South Africa moves us a few more steps down that road .
So best of luck to our team – may they stand us all proud over the next couple of weeks …
It 's that glorious time of year again — Girl Scout cookies are back on sale and you can stock up .
If you end up eating them all by June again , though , food blog Chow has some recipes for making your own .
Advertisement
Making the cookies is n't super hard , but it probably is n't for the baking novice — not only will you need the standard baking arsenal including parchment paper , a rolling pin , cookie cutters , baking sheets , and wire racks , but you 'll need to be pretty organized and familiar with standard baking techniques .
If you 've done a fair amount of baking though , this will probably be a cakewalk ( or cookie walk , as it were ) .
The recipes are pretty detailed , and include links to articles about more advanced baking techniques like tempering chocolate if you do n't already know them .
The cookies , depending on which ones you 're making , should n't take much longer than 4 or 5 hours ( although you 'll only need to be working with them for about 2 of those ) .
Best of all , they have recipes for a few of the most popular cookies , so even if you prefer Thin Mints to Samoas or Tagalongs ( or whatever they 're making us call them these days ) , Chow 's got you covered with their versions .
Hit the link for the full recipe , or stash it away for the sad day that you finish off that last box nine months too early .

Make Your Own Girl Scout Cookies [ Chow via Wise Bread ]
STRIKING a balance between personal and religious freedom , and the ideals of common citizenship , is proving to be an enormous test for all European countries with large Muslim populations — especially when some seem determined to assert , or even caricature , the practices of their homelands .
Certain things are easily settled : virtually everybody in Europe agrees in abhorring female genital mutilation , as practised in bits of Africa ; or the harsh punishment of children in Koranic schools , which has occurred in Britain .
But in recent months a third controversy has shown up contrasts between European countries and within them .
This is over female headgear — and in particular , forms of dress in which all , or virtually all , the face is hidden .
These include the head - covering burqa ; and the commoner niqab , in which only a slit is left for the eyes .
The burqa , imposed on Afghan women by the Taliban , has become a catchall term for headgear in which the face is wholly or mainly concealed .
Last month 136 of Belgium 's 138 lower - house legislators ( who agree on little else , leaving their country near paralysis ) voted to outlaw the burqa .
Belgian police already have the right to stop people masking their faces , under an old security law ; and in some cities this right is invoked to issue warnings to burqa - wearers , who number only a few dozen in the country .
So it is hard to see what need the law serves .
But a parliamentarian in Brussels said it created a rare moment of “ pride in being Belgian ” by “ smashing the lock that has left quite a lot of women in slavery . ”
He hoped at least four European countries would follow .
This week France 's parliament approved a resolution deploring full - face cover , and legislation is due shortly .
In Switzerland one of the 26 cantons has voted to work for a nationwide ban ; the justice minister , Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf , backs a ban , at least in cantons that want it .
The Dutch authorities considered outlawing the burqa , then stepped back .
But in Europe as a whole , the idea of making people show their faces is no longer a xenophobic fantasy , but a mainstream political project .
With a fresh election due in June , Belgium 's law is on hold ; but it may be the first of many European bans on “ all clothing hiding the face totally , or mostly . ”
Belgian women who wear the burqa in public will risk a modest fine or even seven days ' jail .
In Italy a woman was fined € 500 ( $ 630 ) last week for wearing the burqa in a town where the Northern League mayor had barred clothing that hinders police checks .
The resolution passed by French legislators has no legal force but it has huge symbolic impact .
Recalling the 1789 Declaration of Human Rights , it says the all - over veil “ puts women in a relationship of subordination to men ” .
On grounds of “ dignity ” and “ equality between men and women ” , it judges the garment “ contrary to the values of the republic ” .
A law to ban the burqa will go to cabinet on May 19th .
In some places such moves have been promoted by the far right .
Italy 's Northern League , which wants a national burqa ban , is xenophobic .
In Britain the anti-European United Kingdom Independence Party is the only party to agitate for a burqa ban .
Ed Balls , a minister in the outgoing Labour government , said it was “ not British ” to tell people what to wear in the street .
Jack Straw , a senior Labour figure who once voiced dismay over women who hid their face when meeting him , is still “ fundamentally opposed ” to a ban .
And Barack Obama said in Cairo last year that Western countries should not be “ dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear ” .
In France , by contrast , the backers of a ban are neither extremists nor fringe feminists .
It was first mooted by Nicolas Sarkozy , the centre - right president , who said last year that the burqa was “ not welcome ” on French soil .
The first to call for a parliamentary motion was André Gerin , a Communist .
This week 's resolution won broad support , including from the Socialists .
In many ways , the French move is the most intriguing test .
France is home to Europe 's biggest Muslim minority , numbering 5 m to 6 m .
It expects immigrants , or their offspring , of all faiths to adapt to French ways , not the other way round .
France holds dear the ideal of laïcité , a strict ban on religion in the public arena that emerged from anticlerical struggles in the 19th century .
It was in the name of laïcité that France banned the Muslim headscarf ( and other “ conspicuous ” religious symbols ) in state schools in 2004 .
But France 's leaders do not cite laïcité as a reason for the burqa ban ; to do so , they note , would mean accepting that hiding female faces is mandated by Islam .
Most influential Muslims in France , including the French Council of the Muslim Faith ( CFCM ) , an official body , and Fadela Amara , a female Muslim minister , reject that reading .
Mohammed Moussaoui , head of the CFCM , says “ no Koranic text prescribes the wearing of the burqa or niqab . ”
So the upcoming law — stating that “ nobody may wear clothing that masks the face in any public place ” — has been justified on two other grounds .
One is security , and the need to be identifiable .
( There was consternation earlier this year when two men clad in burqas robbed a post office near Paris . )
The other is human dignity and equality between the sexes .
“ This is not a religious question , ” argues Jean - François Copé , parliamentary leader of the ruling UMP party .
Most French people view the burqa as a clear token of oppression ; if libertarians defend it , this is seen as implying softness on ills such as domestic violence .
Recent news has reinforced that view .
This week , in a town west of Paris , police arrested a man suspected of forcing his wife to wear the burqa , and of raping and beating her .
( With such cases in mind , the upcoming French law would reserve the harshest penalties for a man found to have made his wife wear the burqa . )
Mr Copé firmly rejects the idea that France is unjustifiably curbing liberty .
He notes that : “ On Fifth Avenue , you do not have the liberty to walk down the street completely nude . ”
The motives of young French Muslim women — sometimes more inclined to hide their faces than their mothers were — are hotly contested .
Many French analysts say a “ re-veiling ” trend among young girls reflects manipulation by zealots .
Although no more than 2,000 women in France cover their face , the phenomenon is growing .
Dounia Bouzar , a French Muslim anthropologist , told a parliamentary inquiry that many of the women were young .
Intelligence sources say two - thirds are French nationals , and nearly a quarter converts .
Many come from North Africa , where there is no face - covering tradition .
So France 's leaders are determined to press ahead .
Two risks stand out .
First , the ban , which some see as a ruse by Mr Sarkozy to woo far - right voters , may stigmatise Islam and create a defensive reaction .
( This is why Mr Moussaoui , who dislikes the burqa , opposes a ban . )
As the debate took off , a mosque in south - east France was sprayed with gunfire .
Second , it is unclear how the ban would work in practice .
The Conseil d'Etat , the highest administrative court , has questioned the legal basis for the ban .
And what about foreigners ?
Mr Copé says that the ban would apply to visitors too : but would women from the Gulf states be hauled away from smart boutiques ?
And then there are other problems : how could one prove that a woman wore a burqa under orders from her menfolk ?
And is n't there a risk of such women facing further isolation in the home ?
That would be an odd result for a law designed in part to ensure sexual equality .

Move your mouse over the volume control applet and scroll
Hit whatever keyboard combination you have set to do the task
If you 're a music fan like me , you 're listening to music almost all the time whilst browsing the web / working / studying .
Often an interuption requires you to quickly lower the volume or mute the music so that you can , for example listen to what a colleague has to say .
By default you have two options :
The reason I do n't like these two options are that they require me to look at the screen / keyboard , instead of looking at whoever 's talking to me , and when my laptop is closed ( While I'm " studying " )
I have to first open the lid to do this .
In old Ubuntu you had a third option , move the volume control applet to one of the corners .
Then you could simply move your mouse to that corner with a flick of the wrist , and scroll to change the volume .
In lucid however the new Indicator Applet system prevents you from customizing the location of the particular applets .
As such I use CompizConfig Settings Manager to achieve the same result .
First install it :
sudo apt - get install compizconfig - settings - manager
From its main menu , select the Commands option
Set the first two commanad lines to :
amixer -c 0 sset PCM,0 20 +
amixer -c 0 sset PCM,0 20 -
Then you can set the corresponding button bindings , selecting whichever corner is comfortable for you , along with Mouse Button4 ( Scroll up ) for the first command and Button5 ( Scroll down ) for the second .
You should now be able to quickly change volume without looking .
Note you may want to play around with different values , and also different channels .
For example changing the command to " amixer -c 0 sset Master,0 5 - " changes the Master channel by 5 ( out of 255 ) .
You could also customize other buttons in other corners to do other commands , but I leave it to you to explore the near infinite possibilities .

The name of international terrorist and fugitive Al Qaeda boss Osama Bin Laden has surfaced in an unlikely spot , and apparently he 's flying British Airways first class to Washington .
It seems that somebody in London with a bad sense of humor is causing the U.K. airline a bit of a headache after inserting a graphic of a boarding pass bearing bin Laden 's name into a company - run magazine .
A cover story in LHR News -- a British Airways staff magazine covering London 's Heathrow Airport -- about a new service allowing passengers to download paperless boarding passes to their iPhones includes close - up cover photo a white boarding pass emblazoned with the name " Bin Laden / Osama . "
Stay Up to Date on the Latest Travel Trends from ABC News on Twitter
Apparently bin Laden likes to fly -- or at least knows the value of loyalty -- because the boarding pass features a frequent flier number .
And do n't worry about his leg room .
The world 's most - wanted man is apparently flying pretty up in first class , seat 7C .
It is unclear how the name of the leader of al Qaeda , the organization responsible for enlisting the Sept. 11 hijackers to steal commercial planes , got on the faux British Airways boarding pass .
The company acknowledged that the magazine graphic was a mistake and said it is investigating its source .
" A mistake has been made in this internal publication and we are working to find out how this occurred , " spokeswoman Michele Kropf told ABC News .
Bin Laden Boarding Pass In British Airways Mag
British Airways is currently in the middle of a prolonged labor dispute with some of its unions , and some travel bloggers have speculated that the insertion of bin Laden 's name may have been a prank by a disgruntled employee or former employee .
" You would think they would know better , " said John DiScala , a blogger known as Johnny Jet .
" Someone who worked there was obviously leaving the company or they were not thinking . "
" It has to be a disgruntled employee .
That person is an idiot , " DiScala added .
" What 's wrong with John Doe or Joe Smith ?
They could have even put the queen 's name on there .
That would have at least been funny .
There 's nothing funny about Osama Bin Laden . "
Richard Feynman ’s father taught young Richard the way I ’d like to teach my own children ; whether I do it nearly as well , I can only hope .
One day . . . my father took me to the forest again and said , “ In all this time we have been looking at the forest we have only seen half of what is going on , exactly half . ”
I said , “ What do you mean ? ”
He said , “ We have been looking at how all these things grow ; but for each bit of growth , there must be the same amount of decay–otherwise , the materials would be consumed forever : dead trees would lie there , having used up all the stuff from the air and the ground , and it would n’t get back into the ground or the air , so nothing else could grow because there is no material available .
There must be for each bit of growth exactly the same amount of decay . ”
There then followed many walks in the woods during which we broke up old stumps , saw frizzy bags and funguses growing ; he could n’t show me bacteria , but we saw the softening effects , and so on .
[ Thus ] I saw the forest as a process of the constant turning of materials .
This is a deep idea , a powerful idea .
There is wonder in this idea , the idea that the atoms inside me were once in a tree , and that , once they leave me , they might find their way into another tree , or a bit of fungus , or even just a patch of soil .
We are connected to the universe in so many different ways .
But there is also danger here .
The danger is in being carried away into what Richard Dawkins called “ bad poetic science . ”
When I look at the forest , noticing , as Feynman ’s father did , that there is no waste of materials , that everything is used , what I see is not a story of cooperation and sustainability , a ecosystem - wide hand - holding kumbaya session .
Instead , I see the unbridled avarice of capitalism left unchecked .
Wherever there is a resource , something will exploit it .
Wherever there ’s a living to be made , however meager , something will eke it out .
Interesting , no doubt , but a model for the life we want to live ?
No thank you .
Is nature wasteful ?
Of resources , not so much , perhaps ( though I ’d argue that nature is incredibly wasteful of one resource , energy .
So much light energy impacts the Earth every day , and life makes use of only an insignificant fraction .
But why worry – the Sun will always rise tomorrow . )
But in other ways , nature is utterly and irretrievably wasteful .
And these are ways that really matter to us .
Nature is wasteful of individual life .
How many times , in Disney nature flicks , do we learn that predators bring down the old and weak , thereby keeping the species strong ?
Nothing could be further from the truth !
Predators overwhelmingly take the very youngest , long before they have the opportunity to show whether they ’re weak or not .
Consider that of 1000 sea turtle eggs laid on a beach , only one will grow into an adult turtle .
What happens to the other 999 ?
Down the gullet .
999 lives wasted , the vast majority eaten before they ’re more than a few days old .
And do n’t believe that the one is the strongest .
So much of this is chance – did the raccoon find the nest , did the seagull or crab grab me or my sister , did the game fish snap up me or my brother ?
The same is true for virtually every species .
Far more young are born than could ever reach maturity .
If any human society treated its young in this way , I think “ wasteful ” would be the kindest word we ’d give it .
Nature is wasteful of innovation .
For the most part , unique solutions to life ’s problems are wiped out by natural selection .
Natural selection is deeply conservative – until the environment changes .
Then , suddenly , the rudimentary lung or the ability to digest lactose that was just a hindrance before is suddenly the key to survival .
But how many innovations are wasted because the environment is unfavorable ?
Nature is wasteful of its own “ mistakes ” , and it makes them freely .
The HIV virus is in part so dangerous because it is so bad at copying itself .
Eacn new generation will be loaded with mutations .
Most of these are useless or fatal .
But a rare few , totally by chance , make the virus better able to survive – and more deadly to its hosts .
And we should recognize this same danger in our own lives .
Our genomes are sturdier than that of HIV .
But they are n’t perfect .
What ’s more , our sexual way of reproduction is a rolling of the dice .
With each generation , we take the chance that two recessive genes will come together and be expressed .
Rarely , such a combination leads to a better adapted individual .
But much more commonly the result is a birth defect that leads to pain , misery , early death .
This waste is the direct consequence of life ’s history of taking the 1 in a million chance that this next innovation will actually help .
The 999,999 times it does n’t ?
Well , we ’ll just try again .
When we speak of finding solutions in nature , we should be very careful to avoid bad poetic science .
Yes , our way of life is unsustainable .
But can anyone point to anything we humans have done that goes against the lessons taught by nature ?
Is there a single creature out there that , given the chance , would have the wisdom to avoid our same mistakes ?
Male gorillas and lions kill babies that do n’t belong to them , in order to speed females into estrus .
Should we , as well ?
Elephants destroy trees , turning forest into savanna and savanna into grassland .
Is this a model for our survival ?
Nile perch released ( yes , by humans , but do the perch care ? ) into Lake Victoria gobble up the cichlids , thereby destroying biodiversity .
Do the perch stop to think what they ’re doing ?
Parasites such as HIV kill their hosts , then die themselves .
Sharks , victimized by humans who cut off their fins and leave them to die , in their own behaviors bite off the flippers of sea turtles , leaving the rest of the turtle ( too big and too hard to swallow ) alone to bleed to death .
There is much to learn from nature , but much of it is a lesson in what not to do .
If we as a society are to survive on this planet , it will not be by reproducing a more “ natural ” way of life .
Instead , it will be through a denial of our inbred and selected “ nature , ” that drive that tells us to reproduce in large numbers ( at least a few will survive ) , kill our enemies , take what we can get when we can get it and do n’t worry about tomorrow .
Nature is a wasteful mess .
Only by learning not to behave as nature would urge can we hope to build a better world .

What 's the perfect escape vehicle ?
For members of a special forces group wrongly accused of a crime in The A - Team , out June 11 , it 's a military C - 130J airplane .
But for filmmakers who planned to shoot the pivotal escape sequence on a Canadian air force base in Cold Lake , Alberta , that posed a bit of a problem .
" There were a lot of F - 18s in the background that we incorporated into the scene , but we did n't actually have a C130 , " VFX supervisor James Price says .
" So we decided to go with a visual - effect solution . "
The minute - long escape sequence called not only for an establishing shot of the fully digital C - 130J , but also for the plane to engage in a game of chicken with a Mercedes Benz SUV and move in front of — and , in some cases , between — real F - 18 s .
Plus , director Joe Carnahan wanted close - ups .
" Usually there 's a threshold for how close you want to get to digital objects , " Price says .
" But we took ours to full frame and beyond . "
Carnahan thinks he had good reason to go above and beyond .
" If you 're going to make a movie like this and you 're not audacious about your choice of stunt or what you 're trying to do , then what 's the point ? " he says .
" I do n't want to rehash something that 's been done a billion times .
I want people to come out and say , ' I 've never seen anything like that . '
If you 're able to do that , you 're giving people their money 's worth . "
Price 's team could n't get access to a real C - 130 J to photograph for reference , so they used the next best thing : Pictures and video provided by the film 's military advisor , plus reference on graphics and markings on the plane from the art department , which they sent to the visual - effects experts at Weta Digital in New Zealand .
As the live - action sequence was being shot — with all of the background action but none of the scene 's visual - effects elements — animators were building the entire C - 130J , including fully functional landing gear .
" Although we never did a shot where the landing gear had to retract , we built it and rigged it so that it could do the natural things that an airplane would do as it was going down the runway , " Price says .
Animators built the wings to flex so there was motion on the wing - tips as the plane moved down the runway , added special texture to the propellers so the blades would n't disappear as they started to turn , and added exhaust coming out of the engines .
Because Carnahan wanted extreme close - ups , special attention was paid to the texture of the materials on the plane .
border= " 0 " cellspacing = " 0 " cellpadding = " 0 " >
The C - 130 was n't the only thing visual - effects artists had to create .
One part of the sequence — which VFX artists came up with while they were out on location — called for the wings of the C - 130 to shear off the canopies of the surrounding F - 18s so the A - Team could n't be chased .
" We asked the Air Force personnel to raise all the canopies to the F18s , and then we [ filmed ] them , " Price says .
" We ended up painting them all out and replaced them with digital ones .
Then we rigged them with dynamics and glass so that they would shatter as the wings of the digital C130 impacted them going down the runway . "
Initially , the animators constructed each element of the scene to the numbers , but they always had to walk a fine line between what was accurate and what was most interesting visually .
The canopies of the F - 18s , for example , had three times as much glass as real life canopies to create a more dramatic shatter .
The C - 130J was tweaked , too .
" It will look to the audience like it 's the same plane going down the runway in every shot , " Price says .
" But if you were to look at all the measurements in the computer , you would find that the plane is moving left or right or being scaled up a little bit from shot to shot , or even moving at different speeds in order to make each individual shot dramatic . "

OK this might be me being paranoid but I started playing with Garmin Connect last night and noticed a real issue with privacy and security with the service .
To start with , when you upload your ride data by default Garmin Connect shares your data with the world unless you specifically change the privacy settings .
So all things being equal the average user wont give this a second thought and will leave the settings on public access .
Furthermore even if you do change the default settings it wont change the settings for any rides you have already uploaded , you ’ll have to go back and manually change the setting for each ride .
So what ’s the problem I hear you say with sharing my ride data .
In a word “ profiling ” .
As an anonymous user I can go the Garmin Connect site , search on my area of interest and find riders in that area .
All the following screen shots were taken without logging on to the service .
Here are a couple of riders I have picked at random .
As you can see it ’s not going to be to hard to figure out where they live
From here I can zoom in on their activities and see when they are out riding , walking etc .
From here I can quickly look for patterns as to when the user will be out of the house and for how long .
As a thief this is wonderful news and I ’m going to guess that if you have a Garmin your a reasonably keen cyclist and as such you ’re probably going to have a couple of bikes ( btw I can also find out what type of Garmin you have ) .
So I know where you live , what time you go out and how long you will be out for , thank you the bike shop is open .
As you can see from this user I just need to go around to their place on a Saturday or Sunday morning and I will have about an hour to do what I like .
I do n’t mean to pick on Garmin Connect as I ’m sure other services probably have the same issue but if you are going to use these services this is probably something you want to keep in mind .

My younger brother , Brandon , had been visiting for a week and it was time to bring him to the airport for his flight home .
But not wanting him to fly to L.A. on an empty stomach , I took him to one of my favorite ethnic hamburger places , Hamburgão in Newark .
As I documented in earlier post(s ) about Brazilian Sanduiche and Brazilian Hot Dogs , Brazilians are quite serious about their junk food .
They love to stack sandwiches high with all sorts of toppings you and I might think as weird or excessive — but once you ’ve had a Brazilian sandwich , you ’re going to be hooked .

Today sees the release of the Top 500 list of the world ’s fastest supercomputers , and the BBC has collapsed all that data in one handy infographic .
The results are shown in a treemap –the size of each box shows the relative speed of each supercomputer , and you can mouse over each one to get more details .
What ’s more , you can look at the map from lots of different views .
Above , the list has been ordered by country .
Which makes you realize that the amount of supercomputing power a country has roughly corresponds to its GDP .
For example , the U.S. ’s GDP is about three times that of China and five times that of the U.K. – which is in the ballpark of the data you see above .
You can also re-order the list , to see , for example , who ’s making those supercomputers , what they ’re running on , and what they ’re been used for :
In short , the graph is a summary of everything you ever wanted to know about the world ’s supercomputers .

Peter LaVelle ’s “ CrossTalk ” at Russia Today has Professor Norman Finkelstein , Chris Guiness and Mitchell Barak on the panel ( 26:02 ) :
The program begins with a report from Chris Guiness , the U.N. Relief and Works Agency ’s director in Gaza , before the panel discusses Israel ’s denial of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the flotilla hijacking itself .
“ There is no question here that we have a serious humanitarian problem , there is no question here that Israel is purposely creating a serious humanitarian problem , ” Professor Norman Finkelstein remarked .
“ This is not an accident .
Israel is not trying to avoid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
Israel wants a humanitarian crisis in order to encourage the people of Gaza to dispose of a regime it does n’t like — and Israel has not made any secret of this [ calling the blockade ] ‘ economic warfare ’ . ”
Mitchell Barak , the Israel apologist on the panel , notes that “ if Israel really wanted to create a humanitarian crisis , they would not allow any ” goods through the border .
Another way would be to incinerate women and children over a 22 - day span while engaging in “ wanton destruction ” of their homes — to collectively “ punish ” and “ terrorize ” the population , according to the Goldstone Report — as you force the exchange “ economy to its knees ” enforcing a blockade that , according to Amnesty International , is “ suffocating ” the Gazan people
Mr. Barak also refutes the “ occupation ” of Gaza because Israel removed its troops , but also tries to sell the legitimacy of its blockade .
Mr. Guiness quickly points to the fact that controlling foreign borders and seashores define an occupation .
To which , Mr. Barak says is purely “ semantics ” .
Lunacy , dammit .
The reason why the occupation is denied , as Mr. Guiness indirectly points out , is that occupation legitimizes resistance , according to international law .

By Ron Ridenour , Cochabamba
May 15 , 2010 -- Presenting the People ’s Agreement — “ Mother Earth does not belong to us , we belong to it ” — worldwide was the first act of the Global People ’s Movement for Mother Earth .
This was carried out in May by Bolivia ’s President Evo Morales and representative activists from five continents .
Representing 35,000 people from 147 countries , they presented the conclusions of 17 workshops — held April 19 - 21 at the World People ’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth ( WPCCC ) — to United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , to the Non-Alignment Movement ( now 130 Third World countries ) plus China ( the world ’s second greatest polluter ) , and then to leaders of the European Union .
President Morales initiated the people ’s conference as a response to the failed COP15 held in Copenhagen , Denmark , in December 2009 .
The so - called “ Copenhagen Accord ” was strongly biased in favour of the rich governments and transnational capitalist corporations that continue business as usual : extracting unlimited profits from human labour and natural resources while contaminating Mother Earth with its gaseous emissions and devastating wars .
Although conference delegates decided to take their analysis and proposals to COP16 to be held November - December in Cancun , Mexico , President Morales warned , at a May 6 news conference in New York , that there are only two choices : “ Either save capitalism , or save Mother Earth .
If Cancun is the same as Copenhagen , then unfortunately the United Nations will lose its authority among people in the world . ”
He implied that peoples ’ movements might replace the UN .
Key points of the final document arrived at in 17 workshops include :
“ Live well ” ( Indigenous philosophy ) not “ live better ” ( capitalism ’s creed ) .
This enhances the environment holistically and encourages meeting everyone ’s basic needs while the latter requires greed and destruction of the planet , and war among men and between nations over the Earth ’s natural resources .
Demand the United Nations force the rich states ( capitalist West , global North ) to reduce their CO2 emissions 50 % of 1990 levels by 2017 , the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol .
These states must use at least 6 % of their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , much less than they use for wars , for mitigation of and adaptation to climate changes in the developing world .
Recognise the universal rights of Mother Earth — the right to life , clean water and air , free from contamination ; every human being is responsible for respecting and living in harmony with her ; guarantee peace and eliminate nuclear , chemical and biological weapons ; decolonisation of the atmospheric space .
Conduct a worldwide referendum on five points concerning how to protect nature : agree or not to eliminating the capitalist economy ; transfer all financing for wars to finance the defence of Mother Earth ; our territories be freed of troops and military bases ; create an International Climate and Environmental Justice Tribunal to judge and sanction contaminating states and firms .
“ Capitalism as a patriarchal system of endless growth is incompatible with life on this finite planet … the alternatives [ to both capitalism and the Soviet experience with a predatory production system ] must lead to a profound transformation of civilisation ” -- Workshop 1 : structural causes .
Unique climate conference amidst tumultuous transition
Mother Earth angrily erupted just as the first world conference seeking to protect her was about to begin .
Iceland ’s volcanic ash darkened European skies and prevented the arrival of hundreds of would - be delegates to the celebration of Mother Earth .
Seventeen - thousand flights were cancelled in the first days and in some countries there were no flights for a week .
In the same period , BP , a major contaminator , could not control an oil drill in the Gulf of Mexico , one of many which the US president had allowed against his campaign promises , and the greatest ecological catastrophe in US history had just got underway .
Even with 1 million litres of oil daily spreading over an area that quickly grew to the size of Puerto Rico , Obama continued to issue executive exceptions to the freeze on oil well drilling in the seas to his buddies in the oil business .
As Morales told Amy Goodman of Democracy Now ! , the only difference between oil millionaire George W. Bush and Barack Obama is the colour of his skin .
The people ’s conference was held in Bolivia ’s central Cochabamba department at Tiquipaya ( place of flowers ) .
And as it was being prepared and then underway , the revolutionary transition clashed with reactionary intransigence emboldened by the ubiquitous Yankee empire .
However , the empire ’s Enjoy Coca - Cola warring falsetto is now challenged by the descendent of Inca empire President Evo Morales with his Coca - Colla natural coca energy drink .
From early April to early May , the time of my stay , I witnessed regional elections in which President Morales ’ party , the Movement towards Socialism ( MAS ) , won overwhelmingly in more areas than ever before .
However , MAS was accused of fraud in some electoral districts of La Paz by other left - wing political parties , whose members are largely the same ethnic people as Morales , Aymaras .
In Ancoraimes , for instance , the province where Eugenio Poma was born and raised , four left - wing parties contested for city power .
Poma is Bolivia ’s ambassador to Denmark , a man I work with .
When I visited his hometown , I discovered Aymara against Aymara within the left .
Besides MAS , there is the social - democratic MSM ( Movement Without Fear ) , MACA ( Ancoraimes Movement for Community Action ) and the current mayoral party , SFCATK ( Your Ancoraimes Peasant Tupak Katari Federation ) .
SFCATK is just a local party and shares power almost equally with MAS , yet the former accused the latter of electoral fraud , and there was serious anger between the two Evo-supporting parties .
In the richest eastern department of Santa Cruz , and in adjoining Beni and Pando departments , the right - wing parties favouring secession were found culpable of stacking fictitious votes in several municipalities hoping to diminish the fast - encroaching MAS party .
This led to daily protests and calls for new elections .
Upon the day of my arrival in La Paz , I witnessed a long protest march pass in front of the Methodist John Wesley guest house where I stayed .
Down the street in the very centre of the city stood the departmental electoral court , and before it groups of Indigenous inhabitants in La Paz and upper El Alto shouted against the court ’s decision not to allow re-elections in their particular voting district .
The doors were guarded by heavily armed riot police , who were of the same people .
The departmental electoral courts did decide to have new elections in 154 voting districts in 45 municipalities of four of the nine departments .
This would affect 52,000 voters .
New elections were held within the month and did not affect the original outcome .
MAS took six of the nine governorships , with s two - thirds majority in five of them .
In the other three departments , right - wing opposition parties won , yet in all departments the voters for MAS greatly increased over the 2005 election .
In 2005 , MAS had 33 % of the regional vote , nearly 1 million , while in this year ’s MAS ’ vote nearly doubled to 1.83 million or 50.4 % .
MAS also won the majority of council seats in 229 — up from 101 — of the country ’s 337 municipalities .
MSM took second place , with 14 % , a significant increase , and it won key mayoral spots , including La Paz and Oruro , Morales ’ hometown .
The rightist Verde party took Santa Cruz .
Its new governor , Rubén Costas , is under investigation by the attorney general for possible conspiracy to secede .
He is one of 300 members of the secret Caballero ( Gentlemen ’s League of the East ) club , some of whose members allegedly stood behind an attempt to murder President Morales , in April 2009 .
Three of the conspirators were killed in a battle with police .
Among them was Eduardo Rózsa , a former mercenary with in the Yugoslav war .
Two witnesses to the conspiracy , which would have included other mercenaries in Argentina , the Painted Faces , spoke before the Senate at the same time as the outcry about the elections .
They named names and linked leading capitalists and politicians to the conspiracy .
The state investigation continues with probable charges forthcoming in some months .
Amidst elections and re-elections , assassination and coup d´ètat plans , a dispute broke out in the western province of Caranvá over where a citrus - fruit plant should be located .
For some unknown reason to me , inhabitants were quite violent about the authorities ’ decision and began smashing things , including using dynamite and refusing trash collection .
Two people died violently .
Thirty were arrested .
At the same time , in eastern Santa Cruz , a large group of people without land seized parts of a sugar plantation where 800 workers earn a decent living .
Many of the hard labourers were attacked by the “ homeless ” , or peasants without land .
Suffering some injuries , the workers then defended the owners ’ land , because this gave them a stable income .
Marginals pitted against workers !
If that was n’t enough for the country to bear at once , at the end of April , the public sector workers ’ unions , along with the important and powerful miners ’ union , first called for spot strikes against the government ’s proposal for a meager 5 % increase in wages and then an “ indefinite strike ” was called by the federation of unions ( COB ) , on May 7 .
Besides the wage issue , the government ’s offer for pensions and changes in the labor code were far less than the workers expected and demanded .
Many unions did go on strike ; others did not , including the largest of peasant organisations , the United Confederation of Bolivian Peasant Workers ( CSUTCB ) , the coca growers ’ union from Chapare and others .
But the strike was initiated by the public workers ’ unions because the government decides their wages and conditions , while private employers set conditions for unions whose members are their employers .
There was a great deal of internal tension and varying views on how to approach worker discontent .
Within a couple of weeks , the strikes were effectively ended with concessions granted by the government over pensions .
For a closer view of this issue , see Federico Fuentes piece : http://links.org.au/node/1700.
North - South tensions , the boiling national class conflict , sad struggles within the working class as well as between campesinos and jungle - dwelling Indigenous tribes over Mother Earth usage — to live well or to live better contradictions within the lower and middle classes — in addition to rightist attempts to secede and to murder the provoking leader .
This is one busy man , this president , who comes from Indigenous coca leaf farmers .
Evo hails as well from grassroots movements , from the war for water and for coca .
He is a natural leader .
He made promises , spiritual and practical .
His activist brothers and sisters remind Evo of his promises and make him stick to them .
Often there are contradictions , even conflicting interests amongst the peoples .
He stresses unity , participatory democracy and equal rights .
Already , half the ministers are women .
Yet no matter where he looks , the president is under critique .
He must not go back on his word .
He must not rest , this activist president Evo Morales .
Seventeen workshops
The Minister of Foreign Affairs David Choquehuanca coordinated with the renowned private university at Tiquipaya , Univalle , to host the unique climate conference .
Classes were suspended and many students helped with logistics .
We were accredited with a photo and number , which had to be checked each time we entered the campus .
The final program included more than we had anticipated .
Aside from the workshops , there were three important speeches by President Morales and others by visiting presidents .
In addition , there were several panel discussions on the main themes that ran during our work sessions .
At times , there were three panels at once .
Then there were the outdoor stands where groups sold their wares , mostly information and propaganda , but also textiles .
The new Coca - Colla drink , complete with a bag of coca leaves , was on sale for 10 bolivianos ( $ 1.40 ) for a half - litre .
At that price , four times ’ the drink of the death squads , Coca - Cola did not have to worry .
There were also outdoor speeches and music during the day to distract those weary of workshop concentration .
I concentrated on workshops 1 and 16 , structural causes of the climate changes and activities to protect Mother Earth .
I wanted to assure the presence of language about and activities against the wars .
In addition , there were workshops on Mother Earth ’s rights , Evo ’s proposed five - point referendum , the 50 million climate migrants , Indigenous peoples , climate debt and adaptation , financing , harmony , an international climate tribunal , development and transfer of technology , carbon market dangers , the Kyoto Protocol , agriculture and food sovereignty , compared visions , and the forests .
Each workshop was to have two presidents selected by the participants .
One was usually a Bolivian .
There was also a secretary and two local organisers , who kept notes and drew up a draft of commentaries during the evening to be read the next morning .
This took place for three days and on the third day we were to decide on a final draft to be edited and approved by the workshop presidents .
The overall People ’s Agreement was read from the podium on April 22 , the day of closure and celebration of Mother Earth .
Then the workshop resolutions were to be edited and written in both Spanish and English .
The latter was published on May 3 by the government newspaper Cambio as a 16 - page supplement .
All documents can be read on the conference webpage , www.cmpcc.org.
Preparations for the conference were extensive and well done , yet no one foresaw that there would be twice as many people as expected , despite the fact that some hundreds could not arrive from Europe due to the volcanic eruption in Iceland .
Some workshops had to be closed to would - be delegates for lack of space .
The largest room could hold perhaps 200 people but many rooms held less than 100 .
Not everyone thought that their ideas were taken into account , and some expressed the opinion that workshop resolutions were basically decided by Bolivian organisers or leaders beforehand .
My own take on this is that participatory democracy was the order of the week , yet with textual help prepared by Bolivians beforehand .
It would not have been possible to take into account all discussions and debates and wrap them into one resolution , times 17 , in just three days .
No mention of `war ’
But I have one major criticism about the process in regards to the lack of any mention of “ war ” in Workshop 16 ’s declaration .
The wars were part of the discussion — I had sent in a two - page proposal with argumentation to both workshops 1 and 16 .
Yet not one activity concerning the damage that wars cause to humanity and Mother Earth was adopted .
This baffles me especially since Morales speaks of the wars as a major cause of Mother Earth damage , and wars were included in the declaration of structural causes and other workshops .
In Morales excellent “ 10 commandments to save the planet , humankind and life ” , the first one is “ To end capitalism ” ; followed by “ Renounce war ” with figures of damage to Mother Earth , which I used in my presentation .
I also provided evidence of this in Cambio , April 16 , “ The wars of the Empire kill Mother Earth ” .
Nevertheless , I had to fight three days running in Workshop 1 to get a few lines included in the resolution about causes and even then the most important facts and figures were left out .
I sent this in to organisers several weeks before the conference , and then argued for it :
Besides the daily murder , maiming and torturing of the invaded peoples of Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan , the US government - military is contaminating the entire environment and the globe with its weapons of aggressive and “ preventative ” war .
We , united in Bolivia at the World People ’s Conference on Climate Change and Mother Earth ’s Rights , declare that wars , especially those instigated and perpetuated by the United States of America , the self - styled policeman of the world , is the single major cause of pollution , the major cause of destroying Mother Earth .
We hereby pledge to act in multifarious ways to end these wars .
The anti-war movement must be revived and linked internationally .
Anti-war activities must take number one priority for all of us who wish to preserve human life and the planet .
I included supportive evidence .
Co-director of the US - based International Action Center , Sara Flounders , recently wrote , “ Pentagon ’s role in global catastrophe ” .
The Pentagon , as Flounders wrote , “ is the largest institutional user of petroleum products and energy in general .
Yet the Pentagon has a blanket exemption in all international climate agreements . ”
In 2006 , the CIA Factbook stated that only 35 countries , out of 210 , consume more oil per day than the Pentagon .
Officially , that is 320,000 barrels a day but that does not include fuel consumed by contractors or consumed in leased and privatised facilities , nor the fuel energy used to produce and maintain their “ death - dealing equipment or the bombs , grenades or missiles they fire .
See http://www.iacenter.org/o/world/climatesummit_pentagon121809/
and
http://climateandcapitalism.com/?p=1534#more-1534, January 9 , 2010 .
“ The Pentagon wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ; its secret operations in Pakistan ; its equipment on more than 1000 US bases around the world ; its 6000 facilities in the US ; all NATO operations ; its aircraft carriers , jet aircraft , weapons testing , training and sales will not be counted against U.S. greenhouse gas limits or included in any count . ”
How can that be ?
The Pentagon demanded during the Kyoto Accord negotiations that “ all of its military operations worldwide and all operations it participates in with the UN and / or NATO be completely exempted from measurements and reductions ” .
It secured this concession and then had the audacity to refuse to sign the accords .
Yet to this day , the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ignores all US military emissions of CO2 and all other lethal toxics and radiation .
That means that when it is written in Workshop 1 ’s declaration that the United States increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 16.8 % from 1990 to 2007 ( while the rich bloc as a whole increased emissions by 11 % ) , this does not include GHG emitted by the Pentagon and its wars .
This is certainly a major factor when arguing to retain the Kyoto Protocol as does Evo and Workshop 10 .
Besides spreading CO2 , US weapons include depleted uranium , which “ have spread tens of thousands of pounds of micro-particles of radioactive and highly toxic waste throughout the Middle East , Central Asia and the Balkans ” , notes Sara Flounders .
“ The US sells land mines and cluster bombs that are a major cause of delayed explosives , maiming and disabling especially peasant farmers and rural peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America .
For example , Israel dropped more than 1 million US - provided cluster bombs on Lebanon during its 2006 invasion ...
“ The US war in Vietnam left large areas so contaminated with the Agent Orange herbicide that today … dioxin contamination is 300 to 400 times higher than `safe´ levels , ” causing high rates of cancer and birth defects . ”
Environmentalists Against War activist Gar Smith wrote that the US dropped 25 million bombs and 72 million liters of chemical weapons on Vietnam between 1960 and 1975 .
Additional millions of bombs and liters of chemicals were also dropped on Cambodia and Laos .
Fourteen per cent of Vietnam ’s forests were ruined forever ; 15,000 square kilometres of land destroyed ( www.rainbowwarrior2005.wordpress.com/2008/10/09).
Smith added that in the 1991 US war against Iraq , 80,000 tons of climate - warming gases were dropped by the Pentagon in just a few weeks .
In 2003 , the US hit Iraq in the first few weeks with 28,000 rockets , bombs and missiles , many using toxic depleted uranium .
The Pentagon wars in Iraq and elsewhere include the use of lead , nitrates , nitrites , hydrocarbons , phosphorus , radioactive debris , corrosive and toxic heavy metals .
The US spends half the world ’s expenditures of $ 1.3 trillion on wars and defence .
The US and Europe just gave their major capitalists $ 3 trillion to bail them out of their self - made financial crisis .
These rich governments offer 0.03 % of that for developing countries to “ adapt ” to climate changes .
Yet Workshop 1 used only the following text about war in a three - page declaration of causes of climate change :
Capitalism responds through militarization , repression and war to the resistance of the people .
It requires a potent military industry , the militarisation of societies and war as conditions necessary for its process of accumulation as well as for its control over territories , mineral and energy resources , and to suppress the struggles of the people .
Wars , through their direct impact on the environment ( massive consumption of combustible fossil fuels , oil spills , GHG emissions , impoverished uranium contamination , white phosphorus , etc. ) have become one of the primary destroyers of Mother Earth .
No facts and figures and no encouraging call to action .
The four - page “ action strategies ” of Workshop 16 call for scores of actions during the rest of 2010 .
They include days and weeks of “ mobilisation in defence of Mother Earth ” yet nothing about capitalism ’s wars .
I am simply at a loss to understand this neglect especially given that this Global People ’s Movement could unite environmentalists with a revived anti-war movement , currently dormant , and with the strong addition of an anti-capitalist analysis as the core problem for humanity and Mother Earth .
Then there was the controversy about “ Workshop 18 ” .
One of Evo ’s strongest supporting groups , the Indigenous Conamaq , wanted a workshop on national preservation of the Earth including banning or curtailing the extraction industry from removing petroleum and minerals .
In a closing interview with Democracy Now ! , Amy Goodman asked Morales of this dilemma , given that a fourth of national income comes from this industry .
He replied that while studies had to made , and controls utilised , “ of what are we going to live ” if this demand is accepted ?
Before the conference began , Conamaq leader Tata Quispe asked for the workshop to be included but Evo said no .
There would be no workshops on national issues of Mother Earth protection .
Nevertheless , Foreign Affairs Minister Choquehuanca later announced that “ Workshop 18 ” would be allowed to proceed as a separate event two blocks outside the university grounds .
It was well attended and referred to in most of the national media .
The mining and petroleum industries , as well as deforestation , were criticised , and the participants asked Bolivia ’s government to take into consideration its own contamination of Pachamama ( Aymara for Mother Earth . )
Running parallel to this controversy over national contamination , Indigenous Trinitario Mojeño people from the Isiboro Sécure Park in northern Cochabamba and Beni provinces attended the people ’s conference and learned that a peasant group living outside the jungle had approved government plans to build a major highway that would cut through their virgin territory .
According to these jungle dwellers , their lifestyle would be ruined ; many animals , such as jaguars , deer and many unique bird species would disappear .
Native leader Antonio Ignacio Moya said his people , who live off the land hunting and gathering , were not even consulted about the plans .
And it was at this conference that he learned that Evo Morales had recently signed a law for the construction of the highway , which should cost $ 415 million .
Bolivia ’s new constitution , chapter 4 regarding the rights of Indigenous peoples , requires that any alteration of their territories must be approved by them .
Yet the only public hearings on this highway were held outside their territory and attended by farmers who would benefit from a highway connecting eastern and western provinces .
Furthermore , no environmental impact study had been conducted .
The April 25 edition of Opinion pointed out that in the last 18 years since the first law aimed at protecting the environment was signed , no contaminator has been penalised .
And , according to environmentalists , nothing has changed since Morales became president .
Workshop 14 on forests concluded that : “ The Peoples are ancestral protectors , conservators , and dwellers of their native forests and jungles ; they are autonomous and sovereigns of inalienable , indefeasible , unatachable , and nontransferable territories . ”
But progressive governments in countries where capitalism is still the dominant economy , such as Bolivia , Venezuela and Brazil , deforestation and extraction of fossil fuels is still going strong , and jungle dwellers are still being ignored .
Who is to shake these resolution words in the face of this still popular Indigenous president ?
“ The direct involvement of organised peoples in the management and administration of protected areas must be promoted in all countries as part of policies integrating peoples and directly relating native forests and jungles , territory and water basins …
Institute a new process where peoples who depend on forests and jungles participate fully and effectively in all actions to mange and conserve forests . ”
That `chicken speech '
Screwing back a couple days to the inauguration , April 20 , I must speak of Evo’s “ chicken speech ” since in many countries this was the only mention in the mass media of the people ’s conference , and they got it wrong .
Some 25,000 people , including representatives from 56 governments were present .
We listened to various musicians and watched native dancers .
A ceremony of permission from Mother Earth to conduct our conference was performed .
A woman singer gave a tremendous representation of Pachamama and a shaman stroked the air with incense and asked us all to stand for Mother Earth .
The first speakers were activist representatives from the five populated continents .
Then the United Nations representative , Alicia Barcena , offered greetings from the UN secretary - general .
I felt a commotion run through the audience , then whistles and boos .
The UN spokesperson ’s voice cracked .
“ We represent the people too ” – that was met with more boos .
“ If you do n’t want us here , we ’ll retreat ” – which was met with whistles .
She sat down .
Evo came to the podium amidst a standing ovation .
He did not refer to the UN woman but launched right into his speech keeping his eyes on us .
No notes .
He spoke of United Nations ’ doublespeak , but COP15 was not a failure because it was a triumph of people ’s movements , and it led to this historic conference and celebration .
We will construct a new system , one of harmony among us and between us and Mother Earth , he said .
Then Evo explained how the capitalist economy seeks to turn humans into consumers , and without sufficient or good nutrients .
He spoke of transgenic elements that the transnational corporations put into our food , of GMOs , and female hormones inserted into industrialised chickens , and “ therefore when men eat these chickens , they experience deviances in being men ” .
Evo suggested , instead , that we only eat home - grown chickens , criollos , which are only fed naturally .
The fact is that Evo is right .
Men can experience reduced testicles and develop “ sports tits ” -- enlarged breasts -- just as can women from eating products stuffed with GMOs and quick - growth medicines .
Nevertheless , the national right - wing media twisted Evo ’s words and his meaning .
He was misquoted as saying that men who ate industrialised chickens could become “ sexual deviants ” , clearly a reference to homosexuality .
This was picked up by international news bureaus , and gay groups in some countries , such as Spain , protested .
Evo sent a letter to Spain ’s federation of homosexuals and lesbians explaining he meant no disrespect .
Evo also recommended naturally grown foods to prevent baldness .
Evo put down Coca - Cola as well .
He told a story about plumbers using Coca - Cola to unplug blocked up toilets because it has so much acid in it .
He recommended instead that we drink chica , a fermented corn drink .
I thought he missed an opportunity here to plug Coca - Colla .
And I also thought that Evo could have mentioned other good reasons to boycott Coca - Cola , such as its hiring paramilitaries in Colombia and Guatemala to murder its workers who seek better working conditions , and who join unions , and in India where its firms ’ drain the soil of water and nutrients and causes hundreds of thousands of farmers to quit their land .
Evo Morales concluded his talk by explaining how capitalism invents wars in order to accumulate more and more , and when people resist they are murdered in wars .
But , he noted optimistically , the voice of the United States is heeded less and less .
And our presence in such great numbers from so many lands shows that capitalism is at a crossroads .
On April 22 , our last day , the sun was so hot that firefighters sprayed the audience of 25,000 + with water .
Seeing so many banners naming the true enemy of humanity and the planet — capitalism — made me happy and reminded me of my young activist days in the United States .
After the inspiring 1960s turned into Reaganism , it seemed to me and many other revolutionaries that the vanguard for socialism would not come from the most industrialised — and thus most pacified — workers but rather from some of the most exploited and oppressed , namely , from Latin America , and where Che Guevara is still revered .
Now there are the eight ALBA countries in Latin America united in a socialistic network , and the tens of thousands gathered here had understood that we cannot advance the spiritual aspects of humanity ; we cannot eradicate hunger and poverty , nor maintain a lively planet with this depraved economy .
A sign showed us that “ Bolivia is the capital of dignity ” .
We were happy and felt dignified chewing on coca leaves and listening to the People ’s Agreement being read by a Bolivian woman and a man from the US .
Then Tomas Borge , one of the best of the Nicaraguan Sandinista leaders in my opinion , spoke of the revolutionary tide rising in Latin America , a wave started by Cuba and under the leadership of Fidel Castro .
He was followed by one of the many vice - presidents from that island - nation , Esteban Lazo , who read a rather tiresome speech .
Then came fiery Hugo Chavez .
Chavez recalled that , in 2001 , Fidel had told him that ALCA ( the US - led “ free trade ” pact first with Mexico and Canada , and later attempts to corral all of Latin America ) would fail .
No one could have believed him then , but four years later it was dead and ALBA was begun .
ALBA , Chavez told us , would include the people ’s conference declarations and proposals .
And we will all go to Cancun “ with more fury ” .
Evo Morales ’ closing speech had no chickens in it .
He spoke seriously about obligating the rich nations to respect and adopt our resolutions .
“ If they do n’t then the peoples will do it . ”
Evo referred to progress in his own land since his presidency .
For the first time in many decades , there has not been a budget deficit , and the country is “ better off without the IMF and the United States ” , which had just cut out its aid to the country .
“ Fidel began the fight for our Mother Earth in 1992 when he told us Latin Americans not to pay the ever - rising debt to their banks .
And he told us it is they , the rich countries and their rich banks , who owe a climate debt .
We have to defeat capitalism and imperialism , fight their military bases in Latin America .
We can do it . ”
The next day , hundreds of activists and Bolivian students and soldiers planted 10,000 trees on one side of Kötu Mayu mountain , in Tiquipaya .
The president planted Tipas ( the tall Rosewood tree ) .
I planted the Jacaranda , which sprouts lovely fragrant trumpet - shaped blooms .
This was the beginning of reforestation planned with planting 10 million seedlings each year for five years .
For these days , we 35,000 people were of one common mind : unity against capitalism and its depravities .
We hope that environmentalists and others around the world will listen to our conclusions and draw from them the understanding that as long as capitalism exists , our planet will continue dying and one day no life will awake .

French - born American sculptor Louise Bourgeois has died in New York , at the age of 98 .
Based in New York since 1938 , Bourgeois gained fame late in her long career and kept working to the end of her life .
Her giant spider sculptures have been exhibited around the world and earned her the nickname of Spiderwoman .
Her abstract explorations of themes such as birth , sexuality and death made her one of the world 's most influential contemporary artists .
Bourgeois suffered a heart attack two days ago .
Although she had long been regarded by her contemporaries as one of the world 's most important artists , it was not until her 70s that she began to attract a wider audience .
Bougeois titled this 30 - ft ( nine - metre ) tall spider " Maman " Her spider sculptures - some of which are three storeys high - have been exhibited around the world , including the Tate Modern in London .
In a statement , the gallery said : " We were deeply saddened to hear of the death of Louise Bourgeois this weekend .
Always at the forefront of new developments in art , she pursued a wholly personal path and was powerfully inventive , working in dialogue with the major avant - garde movements of her time .
" Her death is a great loss . " Bourgeois ' vast installation , I Do , I Undo , I Redo , was the first commission in The Unilever Series for Tate Modern .
Her sculpture of a giant spider , Maman , was part of the Unilever Series at the gallery which greeted the very first visitors in 2000 .

Ann Coxon , assistant curator at Tate Modern , said : " Apart from its overwhelming physical presence , the interesting thing is that Louise associated the spider with her mother - a tapestry restorer - a very industrious woman always spinning or weaving .
" So for Louise , the spider is a very positive feminist statement . "
' Enormously significant '
The artist said her main inspiration came from her childhood in France , where her father had an affair with her governess , which her mother refused to acknowledge .
She also used her own clothes as the basis for a series of bronzes .
Bourgeois ' Three Horizontals was shown at the Pompidou Centre in 2008 .
Artist Richard Wentworth , from the Royal College of Art , called the sculptor " enormously significant " .
He added : " She connected the intensely private act of being an artist with the intensely public act of developing a worldwide audience .
" To have worked constantly for so long and so publicly - is in a field of its own .
There are very few female artists who make it to later life and it's very tough to be a woman artist or sculptor . "
Conceptual artist Jenny Holzer said she " orbited Bourgeois " and that " my artist friends and I are crying today " .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy also paid tribute to Bourgeois , calling her " a very great artist " who " never stopped creating and renewing herself in her art " .
Bourgeois had been able to " reach a higher truth , rich in its contradictions , avoiding the trap of the latest trends , " he added .
French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand spoke of his sadness , saying in a statement that the world had lost " a great artist , indomitable and universal " .

Fort Walton Beach , Florida ( CNN ) --
It 's sort of like they 're all dressed up with no place to go .
But preparing for oil on your shore is not exactly a night out on the town .
Florida Gulf
Coast counties say they 're frustrated beyond belief , after putting in elaborate , exhaustive plans to stop the oil , only to find that BP 's check is n't even in the mail .
" We 've got our permits .
We 've got everything signed off and ready to go , " said Dino Villani , director of public safety in Okaloosa County .
" The holdup now is BP .
We have no money to do the protective measures . "
Okaloosa County has created a multi-layered plan to try to stop the oil from coming onto its beaches and to protect the Destin Pass waterway , an area enjoyed by boaters and beachgoers .
County officials plan on using barges , containment boom and an air net to stop the flow of crude , but they need all of these things in place for their plan to work .
And the thing they need most is $ 2.8 million up front and $ 2.5 million a month to stay operational -- money they 've filed for with BP .
Are you there ?
Send us your images
" We 're virtually operating on a credit card .
This is a county that 's reserves are low .
We 're impacted by a reduction in ad valorem taxes , " said Villani .
Florida Sen .
Bill Nelson says he 's seen the same thing happen all throughout this process .
" You had the Coast Guard doing one thing and you had BP doing another thing and this is why I 've been raising cane for weeks , " said Nelson .
Nelson met with Okaloosa County officials who asked for his help in getting their check .
" This county and a lot of these other little counties that simply do n't have the financial wherewithall to be paying all of these bills , and they 've got to have some relief .
So , yes .
they will get their money . "
After the meeting , CNN questioned BP 's community cupport coordinator assigned to Okaloosa County , Jay Prothro .
Asked if checks were coming and how soon , Prothro responded , " I can't speak to how soon they will get it , but I can tell you , there is a process in place and we 're working to get those refunds . "
" This whole process is new and everybody is learning as they go and trying to figure out what makes the most sense , and that 's what they 're working on . "
Pressed on the delay in the counties receiving funds , Prothro responded , " Like I say , they 've set out some guidelines on how to get the reimbursement and the county has filed , is my understanding , and I have to run some traps to figure out where it is in the process and see what the answer is to that .
I just ca n't tell you right now . "
But the counties say there is no real process , and what does exist has been painful for everyone staring at the same problem .
" I kind of make a joke .
We 're on plan F .
We 've already gone through plans A through E , " says Amy Lovoy , bureau chief for management and budget services in Escambia County .
" A check or money order , or a wire .
Anything they want to give us is fine . "
Escambia County has a $ 9.1 million claim with BP for its oil protection including booms , reconnaissance flights , and operations .
The county says it also needs $ 4.8 million a month to maintain the plan , for as long as the oil remains a problem .
Lovoy says the good news is that BP is returning her phone calls , but the bad news is what she 's hearing is n't helping .
" We 're definitely hearing back from them , but they keep saying that the process has changed .
They say , ' We know you 've submitted a claim , ' but they say , ' The process has changed and you have to re-submit the claim and paperwork . ' "
And in the eastern Panhandle , Bay County , which includes Panama City , has had the same problem .
County officials say they need $ 3 million to build a more robust boom system , and about $ 8,300 per day to maintain it .
Other costs , like workers ' overtime pay , are estimated at $ 10,000 per day .
Officials of the Florida Association of Counties and emergency managers are scheduled to meet on Wednesday with U.S. Coast Guard representatives and BP officials because , they say , they need the claims process to be fixed right now .
The chairman of the Okaloosa County Commission , Wayne Harris , went right to the point .
" We just need them to show me the money , " he said .
" If they give us an American Express diamond or black ( card ) , I 'm happy with it . "
San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , the Citizen Media Law Project ( CMLP ) , and Public Citizen Monday urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to consider the critical First Amendment questions at issue in a case asserting " hot news misappropriation " -- a doctrine that a federal court used to put time limit restrictions on the reporting of facts .
The defendant in the case , TheFlyOnTheWall.com , had gathered stock recommendations from investment banking firms like Merrill Lynch , Morgan Stanley , and Lehman Brothers and reported them on its website .
The firms sued TheFlyOnTheWall.com , claiming that the information was " hot news " and the website was free - riding on the firms ' work in creating the recommendations .
A federal court agreed with the investment banks and ordered TheFlyOnTheWall.com to delay reporting of the information for two hours after the reports are released .
" Surprisingly , no court has carefully explored the tension between the so - called ' hot news misappropriation ' doctrine and freedom of speech and freedom of the press , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Corynne McSherry .
" We 're asking the appeals court to recognize the elephant in the room and analyze the ' hot news ' doctrine in light of the strong First Amendment protections developed by the Supreme Court to encourage the expression of truthful statements on matters of public concern . "
Applying heightened First Amendment scrutiny is especially important now , as the Internet is increasingly allowing Americans to publicly gather , share , and comment on the news of the day .
Misuse of the " hot news " doctrine could stifle this extraordinary growth of free expression .
" It 's not hard to see how new and vital forms of social media could get caught in a ' hot news ' dragnet , " said McSherry .
" The court must ensure that this doctrine is not used to quash online commentary and information - sharing . "

A one - time intelligence analyst with the Pentagon , Aimee Mullins is an athlete , model , and activist .
And she does it all using a collection of experimental prosthetic legs .
She says her special " cheetah " legs give her superpowers .

On her website , Mullins gives a quick background on how she got where she is today :
Born without fibulae in both legs , Aimee 's medical prognosis was bleak ; she would never walk and indeed would spend the rest of her life using a wheelchair .
In an attempt for an outside chance at independent mobility , doctors amputated both her legs below the knee on her first birthday .
The decision paid off .
By age two , she had learned to walk on prosthetic legs , and spent her childhood doing the usual athletic activities of her peers : swimming , biking , softball , soccer , and skiing , always alongside " able - bodied " kids .

When Mullins was in college at Georgetown :
She set her sights on making the US Team for the 1996 Atlanta Games .
She enlisted the expertise of Frank Gagliano , one of the country 's most respected track coaches .
Through this partnership , she became the first woman with a " disability " to compete in the NCAA , doing so on Georgetown 's nationally - ranked Division I track team .
Outfitted with woven carbon - fiber prostheses that were modeled after the hind legs of a cheetah , she went on to set World Records in the 100 meter , the 200 meter , and the long jump , sparking a frenzy over the radical design of her prototype sprinting legs .

Several other athletes have used the legs developed for Mullins , and they have set a new standard for prosthetic legs that allow the wearer to participate in sports .

Here 's an incredibly interesting video where Mullins talks about how her legs give her superpowers :

What makes Mullins posthuman is her attitude toward her prosthetics .
She does n't view them as " fixing " something , but rather as augmentations .
She wants them to be beautiful , to give her superpowers , to be parts of her body that people look at with admiration .
With her public speaking and athletics , Mullins has popularized the idea that synthetic body parts are something to show off , rather than hide .

Unmanned aircraft have proved their usefulness and reliability in the war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq .
Now the pressure ’s on to allow them in the skies over the United States .
The Obama Administration has stepped up the use of drones in Pakistan and Afghanistan , killing hundreds , but concern to date about their use in the United States has focused on their potential collision threat to civilian aircraft .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Federal Aviation Administration has been asked to issue flying rights for a range of pilotless planes to carry out civilian and law - enforcement functions but has been hesitant to act .
Officials are worried that they might plow into airliners , cargo planes and corporate jets that zoom around at high altitudes , or helicopters and hot air balloons that fly as low as a few hundred feet off the ground .
On top of that , these pilotless aircraft come in a variety of sizes .
Some are as big as a small airliner , others the size of a backpack .
The tiniest are small enough to fly through a house window .
The obvious risks have not deterred the civilian demand for pilotless planes .
Tornado researchers want to send them into storms to gather data .
Energy companies want to use them to monitor pipelines .
State police hope to send them up to capture images of speeding cars ’ license plates .
Local police envision using them to track fleeing suspects .
Like many robots , the planes have advantages over humans for jobs that are dirty , dangerous or dull .
And the planes often cost less than piloted aircraft and can stay aloft far longer .
“ There is a tremendous pressure and need to fly unmanned aircraft in ( civilian ) airspace , ” Hank Krakowski , FAA ’s head of air traffic operations , told European aviation officials recently .
“ We are having constant conversations and discussions , particularly with the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security , to figure out how we can do this safely with all these different sizes of vehicles . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
There are two types of unmanned planes : Drones , which are automated planes programmed to fly a particular mission , and aircraft that are remotely controlled by someone on the ground , sometimes from thousands of miles away .
Last year , the FAA promised defense officials it would have a plan this year .
The agency , which has worked on this issue since 2006 , has reams of safety regulations that govern every aspect of civilian aviation but is just beginning to write regulations for unmanned aircraft .
“ I think industry and some of the operators are frustrated that we ’re not moving fast enough , but safety is first , ” Krakowski said in an interview .
“ This is n’t Afghanistan .
This is n’t Iraq .
This is a part of the world that has a lot of light airplanes flying around , a lot of business jets . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
One major concern is the prospect of lost communication between unmanned aircraft and the operators who remotely control them .
Another is a lack of firm separation of aircraft at lower altitudes , away from major cities and airports .
Planes entering these areas are not required to have collision warning systems or even transponders .
Simply being able to see another plane and take action is the chief means of preventing accidents .
The Predator B , already in use for border patrol , can fly for 20 hours without refueling , compared with a helicopter ’s average flight time of just over two hours .
Homeland Security wants to expand their use along the borders of Mexico and Canada , and along coastlines for spotting smugglers of drugs and illegal aliens .
The Coast Guard wants to use them for search and rescue .
ADVERTISEMENT
The National Transportation Safety Board held a forum in 2008 on safety concerns associated with pilotless aircraft after a Predator crashed in Arizona .
The board concluded the ground operator remotely controlling the plane had inadvertently cut off the plane ’s fuel .
Texas officials , including Gov. Rick Perry , Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn , and Rep. Henry Cuellar , have been leaning on the FAA to approve requests to use unmanned aircraft along the Texas - Mexico border .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has told lawmakers that safety concerns are behind the delays .
Cornyn is blocking a Senate confirmation vote on President Barack Obama ’s nominee for the No. 2 FAA job , Michael Huerta , to keep the pressure on .
ADVERTISEMENT
Other lawmakers want an overall plan to speed up use of the planes beyond the border .
A bill approved by the Senate gives FAA a year to come up with a plan ; a House version extends the deadline until Sept. 30 , 2013 , but directs the transportation secretary to give unmanned aircraft permission to fly before the plan is complete , if that can be done safely .
Marion Blakey , a former FAA administrator and president of the Aerospace Industries Association , whose members include unmanned aircraft developers , said the agency has been granting approvals on a case by case basis but the pace is picking up .
Some concerns will be alleviated when the FAA moves from a radar - based air traffic control system to one based on GPS technology .
Then , every aircraft will be able to advise controllers and other aircraft of their location continually .
However , that ’s a decade off .
Michael Barr , a University of Southern California aviation safety instructor , said the matter should not be rushed .

“ All it takes is one catastrophe , ” Barr said .
“ They ’ll investigate , find they did n’t do it correctly , there ’ll be an outcry and it will set them back years . ”

Back in January , we got pretty excited about the Parrot AR .
Drone Quadicoptor .
The Parrot AR .
Drone remote control quadricopter is controlled by creating its own WiFi network that either an iPhone or an iPod Touch connects to .
The Parrot AR .
Drone is then maneuvered using the accelerometers of the iPhone combined with a video feed from the forward facing camera on the drone itself .
A smart piloting system intelligently compensates for wind and other environmental conditions , and utilizing a second camera which faces the ground can perform a stationary flight on its own .
We had some hands - on time with it back at CES , and were impressed :
Of course , the big question on everyone ’s mind was “ when " and “ how much " .
Ars Technica reports that the Parrot AR .
Drone will finally go on sale this September at a price of $ 299 .
The device itself is only so exciting on its own , but combined with its open SDK , Parrot is hoping that developers will take advantage of the device ’s controls and cameras to create augmented reality games .
At least a couple of these titles are said to be available at launch .
This was the week that Democrats cried and Republicans cackled .
An NBC News / Wall Street Journal Survey released this week was chock - full of bad news for the left .
More people disapproved of President Obama ’s job performance than approved of it .
And the percentage of Americans who thought that the country was headed in the wrong direction topped 60 percent for the first time since the Bush years .
According to a Gallup poll released on Friday , the percentage of Americans who identified themselves as conservatives rose to 42 percent .
As the report noted , “ Should that figure hold for all of 2010 , it would represent the highest annual percentage identifying as conservative in Gallup ’s history of measuring ideology with this wording , dating to 1992 . ”
For the record , the percentage identifying as liberals fell to 20 percent .
There are many factors contributing to these polls .
From the very beginning , the far right assailed this president with calumnious attacks .
He was both a craven defender of the country and its borders and a crazed tax - and - spend liberal hell - bent on growing the government and destroying our democracy , one death panel at a time .
It seems to have stuck .
About
The Fantasy Cheaters League is a purely for fun endeavour .
It ’s been created by the advertising agency Host and doggedly pursued by a bunch of dreamers there who love the beautiful game and look forward to the Tournament like a kid looks forward to getting a new replica kit at Christmas .
Like all football fans we harboured dreams of representing our country at football , but only succeeded in reaching the dizzy heights of playing for our school or Sunday League team .
But we love the beautiful game .
In all its guises ; the skill , goals , athleticism , rivalry , trivia …and the dirty , conniving cheating !
Because if we ’re honest with ourselves , it ’s the diving , injury feigning , yard stealing , time wasting gamesmanship as much as anything else that makes every tournament exciting , controversial and memorable .
So we ’ve decided to celebrate this side of the game by creating The Fantasy Cheaters League .
Because even though we only managed to play on football ’s lowest rung , we ’ve tasted victory .
We know the primitive competitive instinct it gives rise to .
We ’ve felt the injustices and dare we admit it , indulged in some of it ourselves !
Jogo Cheato Bonito !

Let me describe the scheme .
Grounded - Grid design has been chosen because it is simple , easy to matching to coaxial impedance , provides the necessary level of amplification and typically requires no neutralization .
After several experiments with triodes and double triodes I 'd chose a 6N7S ( 6H7C ) valve - Russian glass shaped version of well known 6N7 vacuum tube .
I know that there was a 6N7G and 6N7GT American glass tubes , but as I heard these ones was not as common as metal 6N7 .
Anyway , pair of tied in parallel triodes inside this vacuum tube in the grounded - grids amplifier circuit offers more than six times power amplification and accurate input impedance matching via the 1:4 autotransformer .
Maximal plate power dissipation of these twins is 12 watts , so you can got more than 25 watts output power without overheating - it should be interesting if you have Yaesu FT - 817 , Elecraft K2 , Icom IC - 703 or any other QRP transceiver , if you need some , but not too much extra power and , of course , if you love the magical glow of valves .
By the way , about a glow - in this amplifier I managed to use an automatic bias circuit stabilized by two LEDs .
As said one of my friends : " I love that Christmas Tree biasing ! " , but in my case these LEDs are red , so we can rather speak about the deer 's noses , I think .
This shiny circuit provides a stabilized 2.5 volts bias and it is very easy to move the triode deeper into the " C " class - you just have to add more LEDs .
Input impedance matching transformer T1 is wound on a little ferrite tore found in the IF stage in some solid state radio - not so important , just try to find the ring ( one for the Dark Lord on his dark throne for example ) and wind 7 turns of the double twisted wire , then connect the beginning of one winding to the end of another as shown .
Seems that that 's all about the scheme , you 're ready to Do It Yourself .
Oh , yes , L1 is a common RF choke , it should be possible to use a homebrew one , dozen coils of enameled wire on a ferrite rod .
All capacitors are mica or ceramics , C3 must be HV type , 500 volts at least .
Pi -network data see below .
I 've made this amplifier for 30 meters band , Pi-network coil was wound with enameled wire on the pill bottle , 12 spaced turns , ~ 30 mm diameter .
If you plan to tune an amplifier to other bands , use following table :
6N7 QRP Amplifier Pi-network Data Freq , Mc 1.82 3.55 7.055 10.12 14.05 18.08 21.05 24.91 10 Coil , uH 34.5 16.5 8.3 5.8 4 3 2.5 2 1.7 Plate , uuF 231 130 65 45 34 27.5 24.5 22 20.5 Load , uuF 988 673 339 236 189 161 150 144 140
And yet another one note about the glow - I 've installed a low voltage tiny neon bulb into the Pi-network 's coil , so that I got one extra Glowing ( pill ) Bottle in the QRP amplifier .
This neon lamp shining brightly when output circuit is tuned to resonance .
It can be seen at picture below :
Once upon a time I 'd decided to join a Big Guns Gang and made a Super - Duper Powerful Vacuum Tubeamplifier for my 800 mWhomebrew telegraph vacuum tube transceiver " 3T " ( I promise to write a separate article or two about this three tube transceiver project later ) .
It was not an easy decision to me because for that legendary time I 'd almost a year used thepower of less than a watt , but there was a rainy spring day , I 've calledagain and again without any takers and , at very last , somebody took over myrock bound frequency .
" That 's all " - I said - " Enough ! " .. and turned on my Soldering Iron .
The " Banksy " claimed he wanted to make up for using the band 's name and promised to paint them a new backdrop for their gigs if they agreed to change their name .
So I got an absolutely amazing gift for Arbitrary Day : a Starly plush toy , a plastic banana , G.I. Joe season 1.3 ( 4 disks of episodes of the animated series and bonus features !
:D ) and an awesome letter from Starly !
Why is this such an absolutely fantastic gift ?
Well , little - known secret about me : Starly is by far my favorite gen 4 Pokemon ( and a contender for my favorite Pokemon ever ) .
I 've had a few Pokemon plushies over the years , most of them gen 3 ( hooray for Minun ! ) , but I have yet to get any from the current generation .
I 'm 99 % sure that my match figured out that I 'd love Starly from a post in which I commented on my love for Starly .
I 'm not sure if there was any X - TREME LOGIC to the banana or the DVDs , but they are both also absolutely awesome !
My best guess for the banana is that it's in reference to my usage of " I am a banana . " in response to a series of spoon - related posts , but that 's just a guess and possibly wrong !

Further evidence of criminal negligence by BP and US government in Gulf disaster
By Hiram Lee
22 June 2010
Evidence of the criminal negligence of BP and the US government in the run-up to the April 20 Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion continues to mount .
BP ’s decision to ignore important safety warnings for the sake of profit and repeated regulatory green lights from the Bush and Obama administrations made a disaster like that presently overtaking the Gulf of Mexico all but inevitable .
Central to the new revelations are flaws in BP ’s blowout preventer ( BOP ) system .
The blowout preventer is a device that acts as a measure of last resort to prevent an uncontrolled release of oil .
The BOP at the Deepwater Horizon site was five stories tall and contained a shear ram that was designed to cut through the pipe connected to the well on the ocean floor and clamp off the flow of oil in an emergency .
The BOP had two control pods containing electronics and hydraulic valve systems that power the device .
Engineers working on the Deepwater Horizon rig have reported a failure in the BOP system during the April 20 blowout .
Pressure gauges revealed hydraulic fluid was not flowing into the BOP , leaving the shear without power .
Both BP and the Obama administration have claimed that the failure of the blowout preventer was an unforeseeable event .
Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen has declared , “ It ’s hard to write a plan for a catastrophic event that has no precedent , which is what this was . ”
This is simply a lie .
Studies conducted by independent companies , the US government as well as BP and Transocean , reported Monday by the New York Times , reveal significant problems with blowout preventers in general and the equipment at the Deepwater Horizon rig in particular .
( “ Regulators failed to address risks in oil rig fail - safe device ” June 20 ) .
The Times cites a study by a Norwegian company , Det Norske Veritas , examining 15,000 wells drilled off the coast of North America and in the North Sea between 1980 and 2006 .
“ It found 11 cases where crews of deepwater rigs had lost control of their wells and then activated blowout preventers to prevent a spill , ” the Times reports .
“ In only six of those cases were the wells brought under control , leading researchers to conclude that in actual practice , blowout preventers used by deepwater rigs had a ‘ failure ’ rate of 45 percent . ”
The problems surrounding failures of BOPs were “ common knowledge in the drilling industry , ” the Times comments .
Measures that could have improved BOP reliability were simp ly ignored by corporations and the government .
A 2001 study of 83 wells requested by the federal Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) found 117 instances of BOP failures .
It concluded that “ all subsea BOP stacks used for deepwater drilling should be equipped with two blind - shear rams , ” in case one of them fails .
The MMS refused to act on the information .
No new standards or regulations were put into place .
The Deepwater Horizon blowout preventer had only one shear ram .
Not only were BOPs in general considered faulty but specific concerns were repeatedly raised about the BOP used by the Deepwater Horizon rig .
An internal document from 2001 belonging to Transocean , the corporation in charge of operations at Deepwater Horizon , was discovered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in May .
It revealed the Deepwater Horizon blowout preventer contained an alarming 260 “ failure modes ” and should have been replaced .
In 2005 , West Engineering Services conducted an assessment of the Deepwater Horizon well control system for Transocean using a checklist of over 250 items for examination .
No less than 72 items on the checklist went unexamined , including important tests of the blowout preventer .
Already considered defective in 2001 , the BOP now went untested four years later .
Also in 2005 , a Transocean document assessing problems at the Deepwater Horizon rig found that the “ hot line , ” a hose on the BOP carrying hydraulic fluid which is described as “ critical when running and pulling the BOP stack ” needed to be replaced due to “ frequent failures ” and found that the line “ was observed to be leaking badly during a rig move . ”
The report says the leak was not repaired during the investigation because it could not be reached .
Deepwater Horizon worker Tyrone Benton spoke with the BBC in an article published Monday and revealed he had also observed a leak in the rig ’s blowout preventer just weeks before the April 20 explosion .
Benton is now suing both BP and Transocean for negligence .
“ We saw a leak on the pod , so by seeing the leak we informed the company men , ” Benton told the BBC , “ They have a control room where they could turn off that pod and turn on the other one , so that they do n’t have to stop production . ”
If hydraulic fluid had leaked from the system , the cutting force of the shear would have been compromised or the shear ram would have been unable to operate entirely .
The BBC quoted Tad Patzek , a petroleum expert at the University of Texas , who said the decision not to fix the leak was “ unacceptable .
If you see any evidence of the blowout preventer not functioning properly , you should fix it by whatever means possible . ”
With numerous reports indicating serious problems with the Deepwater Horizon BOP system , BP and Transocean , facing no pressure from government regulations , did not halt drilling and production for essential repair and replacement work .
Millions of dollars in profits would have been lost had they done so .
Instead , the companies continued to cut corners , utilizing a poor well design which would do little to manage high - pressure “ kicks ” of natural gas shooting up from beneath the ocean floor .
A final test of the integrity of cement seals put in place by Halliburton was also ignored .
While the Times documents a litany of evidence of negligence in the run-up to the disaster , it seeks to whitewash the role of the Obama administration , claiming that the new government “ failed to grapple with either the well - known weaknesses of blowout preventers or the sufficiency of the nations drilling regulations even as it made plans this spring to expand offshore oil drilling . ”
It was not a matter of “ failing to grapple , ” or , as the Times puts it later , a “ false sense of security . ”
In fact , the administration deliberately sought to undermine attempts to halt offshore oil drilling or increase regulation , as the Bush administration had done before it .
This included intervening in a 2009 court case that ruled that Bush ’s 2007 - 2012 Gulf oil drilling plan did not include sufficient environmental studies and safeguards .
The administration specifically cited the BP Deepwater Horizon project as one that had to go forward .
It succeeded in getting the court ’s approval .
( See , “ Obama administration helped BP quash environmental challenges to Gulf drilling ” ) .
Later , as problems mounted in the weeks preceding the explosion , the MMS under Obama gave repeated waivers and approvals to BP ’s decisions , sometimes within minutes of their submission ( See , “ Obama signals no end to deep - sea oil drilling ” ) .
While Obama has publicly claimed he will crack down on the abuses of oil companies and do whatever is necessary to prevent another disaster of this kind , his administration continues to approve new leases for offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico without adequate analysis of the dangers presented to the environment by such projects .
According to a study carried out by McClatchy Newspapers , since the beginning of June , the Minerals Management Service has approved five offshore drilling projects for the Gulf of Mexico .
In three of these cases , the MMS agreed to waivers , or “ categorical exclusions , ” which allow the oil companies preparing to drill in the Gulf to avoid undergoing detailed environmental safety reviews .
The MMS granted the same waiver to BP ’s Deepwater Horizon project prior to the oil spill .
Overall , 198 deepwater leases have been approved by the MMS for the Gulf of Mexico since April 20 .
Ten of these leases were sold to BP .
This gift to the oil companies , including the very company responsible for the worst environmental disaster in US history , exposes the real relationship between the administration and the oil giants .

Saturn and its Moons
Saturn is notorious for its resplendent rings , which can even be seen in the telescopes of amateur astronomers .
These rings consist of rock and / or ice debris , a few pieces of which are as large as a house , and most smaller .
Image processing of the Voyager flyby images of the rings can make these stand out in beautiful ( though artificial ) colors which facilitate their separation into individual ring units ( identified by letters ) .
Saturn has since been visited by the Cassini spacecraft .
Saturn also has a large number of satellites ( 34 ) of which seven are big enough to have evolved into spherical shapes .
While sharing an icy composition , there are notable differences among the seven : Mimas , Enceladus , Tethys , Dione , Rhea , Titan , and Iapetus .
Saturn and its Moons Now , on with the Tour !
Both Voyager spacecraft observed the second largest planet , Saturn ( diameter 84.3 % that of Jupiter and 10 % shorter at the poles ) .
Voyager 1 flew past Saturn in November 1980 ; Voyager 2 passed by in August of 1981 .
When the first spacecraft was slightly above the rings , on the sunlit side , this planet presented a stunning image : Cassini , the largest spacecraft ever to be sent to planet , was placed in orbit around Saturn on July 1 , 2004 .
The seven major rings begin about 7,000 km ( 4,350 miles ) beyond the planet 's discernible atmospheric edge and continue for another 74,000 km ( 45,984 miles ) , to the faint F ring ( discovered by Voyager ) , a diameter of greater than 260,000 km ( 161,564 miles ) .
But , the entire system is only about 1.5 km ( about 1 mile ) thick .
The rings have been named using alphabet letters , arranged in the order of their sequence from closest to farthest from Saturn 's gaseous surface ( but the letters relate to the order of discovery ) : D , C , B , A , F , G , E .
This can be shown diagramatically , in which the specific rings and the major satellites are shown in their relative positions :
The E and G rings are usually not imaged .
This composite mosaic made by the Cassini spacecraft when it was 3 million kilometers away shows these two and their relation to the inner rings :
The rings are in fact very thin ( less than a kilometer ) .
This is suggested by this Cassini image , which also shows one of the saturnian satellites , which indicates how small these are relative to Saturn 's size : Let 's reexamine Saturn 's inner rings .
The Cassini Division ( also referred to as a Gap ) separates rings A and B , and the Encke Division lies within the outer part of A .
This image made by the Cassini spacecraft is the closest to the true color of the rings :
Note the details of the ring structure in this color - enhanced version , made by assigning red , green , and blue to clear , orange , and ultraviolet image frames , respectively .
We chose it for its esthetic quality and to help further to distinguish its ring divisions :
The inner blue region marks the C ring .
Beyond it is the B ring , whose inner part is orange and outer is greenish - blue .
There is a large dark area known as the Cassini division ( a gap ) that separates the B ring from the outer ( purplish ) A ring .
A smaller gap , named the Encke gap , subdivides the A ring .
Although not visible in this image , parts of rings ( mainly in B ) contain " spokes " , which are narrow darker linear " shadows " that lie perpendicular to the bands .
These may be density discontinuities or clusters of small particles levitated above the residual larger particles in the rings by electrostatic charging .
Note the many dark bands , which are gaps with lower densities of particles .
This Cassini image shows examples of the spokes : The Ultraviolet Spectrograph on Cassini has produced images whose colors indicate compositional differences .
In this next image , of the B ring , the red bands have a higher proportion of " dirt " ( rock / dust ) whereas the blue bands are mostly just water ice .
One model for the origin of the rings considers the band components with more dirt to be older than the blue bands .
The visible rings consist of mostly ice and ice / rock fragments that ( although spread apart ) reflect sunlight .
Most particles fall within the millimeter to several meter - size ranges .
A few chunks attain sizes up to 100 meters .
Here is an artist 's conception of the objects within one of the rings :
The actual ring particles were imaged just once , when the Cassini spacecraft actually passed through the gap between the F and G rings as it was about to enter its orbit around Saturn .
This image shows that the particles in the F ring are mostly around meter - sized :
The origin of Saturn 's rings is still unsettled .
The materials may be even now in the process of organizing into a satellite or could be residual materials around Saturn that never succeeded in building into a single large body .
Or they might be debris from a large impact that shattered an earlier satellite .
Or they could be the residue of a pre-existing satellite that moved so close to Saturn that the planet 's tidal forces disrupted it ( the distance at which such break up must occur is called the Roche Limit ; for Saturn this is 1.5 times the planetary radius ; for the Earth - Moon system it is 2.44 times Earth 's radius ) .
Recent discovery of small moonlets ( typically 100 - 200 meters ) has supported the idea of the rings being residuals from the destruction of a larger satellite moon .
One generality : only the Giant planets seem capable of maintaining rings once formed , owing to the ability of their strong gravitational attraction to keep the rings from dissipating over time .
One line of evidence considers the saturnian rings to be no older than 100 million years .
At least the outer rings , A and F , are kept from drifting apart by the action of three small satellites orbiting close to them .
Called " Shepherd Satellites " , their gravitational focusing acts to push straying particles back in line .
Their action also may cause the braiding observed in the A ring .
The F ring is controlled by the small satellites Prometheus and Pandora .
Prometheus appears in this Cassini image :
As each satellite moves along , it deflects particles inward or outward depending on its position inside or beyond the ring .
This diagram is relevant : Saturn has about the same composition as Jupiter , namely Hydrogen and some Helium , but lower internal pressures and temperatures ( up to about 12,000° C ) may limit the extent of the metallic Hydrogen zone .
Helium makes up about 7 % of Saturn 's atmosphere ( on Jupiter He was 11 % ) .
Saturn 's density , ~ 0.7 gm/cm3 , is the lowest of any planet .
Saturn 's thin surficial atmosphere , which is responsible for the visualization of an " apparent " surface , although moderately banded , lacks the reddish coloration typifying Jupiter 's belts , but its yellowish color is similar to the Jovian zones .
Circulation patterns , driven by jet streams , are also similar , including oval spots , cyclonic storms , eddies , and swirls .
Winds can exceed 300 km / hr .
The depth of atmospheric circulation may be as much as 2000 km ( 1200 miles ) .
The atmospheric bands differ somewhat in composition ( which has been investigated further when the spacecraft Cassini arrived there in 2002 ) .
The NICMOS camera on the Hubble Space Telescope ( Section 20 ) has taken an interesting multispectral image of Saturn ( including IR bands ) in which the belts are assigned contrasting colors ( like what was done on the rings above ) based on spectral variations to help emphasize the significant differences that do not stand out in true color images .
This trio of images compares Saturn 's gaseous surface and rings as seen in three spectral regions : UV , Visible , and near Infrared .
Again , color assignments are somewhat arbitrary :
The various cloud bands and decks on Saturn leap out when viewed in the Infrared by the Cassini spacecraft .
The white dots in this image are warm clouds arranged in a pattern described as a " string of pearls " .
When Voyager looked at parts of the cloud surface in detail , some interesting fine structures were evident : Compare these with the next two images of saturnian atmospheric bands obtained during the Cassini mission ( next page ) : Similar to Venus , Saturn has a well developed vortex of swirling clouds at each pole .
Here is the one formed over the south polar region :
These clouds reach different heights , producing a topographic - like effect : Cassini 's sensors caught remarkable images of clouds above the North Pole .
In the image below , note the general circular pattern , but the inner clouds have formed into a hexagon shape ; this feature is more than 40000 km across and 200 km high .
Why this distinct shape has developed is without any explanation .
This next image pair compares the two polar cyclonic systems side by side ( North is on the left ) : Like Jupiter , Saturn can have huge storms in its atmosphere .
This next image shows what may be the biggest " hurricane " ( 8000 km ; 5000 miles across ) ever found in the Solar System , as it developed on November 7 , 2006 in Saturn 's southern hemsphere .
The white cloud heights reach to about 60 km ( 40 miles ) ; note the conspicuous central " eye " : Voyager observations also indicated the possibility that , like Jupiter , there are auroras at each of Saturn 's poles .
This was confirmed in the '90s by the ultraviolet measuring capability of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer ( STIG ) on the Hubble Space Telescope .
In the STIG image below the auroral torus is in orange tones , representing atomic hydrogen emission as the solar wind interacts with the saturnian magnetic field .
As might be expected , active atmospheres such as on Saturn can have severe electrical storms .
This next image captures a cascade of lightning as large in area as the United States : Saturn has a strong , albeit conventional magnetosphere , as shown in this diagram : Saturn has 34 known satellites .
Eighteen of these ( all small ) are located beyond the rings .
The two diagrams below name these but their location on the charts is not really their actual positions in terms of distance :
All but one ( Iapetus ) , orbit close to the planet 's equatorial plane .
Seven of the interior moons are spherical , ranging in diameter from about 400 km to 5,100 km ( 249 mi3,169 mi ) .
Their names , in orbital - position order , starting at the innermost , are Mimas , Enceladus , Tethys , Dione , Rhea , Titan , and Iapetus .
The remainder are smaller and have irregular shapes ( although Phoebe is nearly spherical ) , and are mixtures of ice and water .
Of the larger ones , six appear to consist almost entirely of water ice , but interior compositions are unknown .
The seventh and largest , Titan , seems completely different , as we describe below .
Most of the satellites have synchronous , prograde ( orbiting in the direction of the planets rotation ) orbits , locked by Saturn 's gravity that causes each satellite 's rotational period and revolution ( about Saturn ) to coincide .
That means the same hemisphere always faces the inner planet ( as the Moon faces the Earth ) .
We will look at one or two representative images of each of the big seven , describing the satellite briefly .
Mimas is only 392 km ( 244 mi ) in diameter .
Its surface holds innumerable small craters .
Because of the 136 km ( 84.5 mi ) - wide crater , Herschel ( approaching a size where disruption might have occurred ) , with its cyclopean eye - like visage , it has gained a special mystique because of its resemblance to the Death Star ship in the Star Wars movie series .
The larger ( 501 km [ 311 mi ] diameter )
Enceledus is the brightest object , in terms of albedo , in the Solar System .
This brightness suggests regions of fresh or uncontaminated ice .
This Voyager 1 image has been contrast - stretched to enhance major features which do not show well in the high albedo versions .
When examined from the multiple images returned , five distinctive terrains are visible on this satellite : 1 ) Smooth Plains ( craters sparse ) 2 ) Cratered Plains ( relatively few craters ) ; 3 ) Cratered Terrain ( more craters but still less than the other ice satellites , implying a rather young surface ) ; 4 ) Ridged Plains ( subparallel ridges ) ; 5 ) Grooved Terrain ( including graben - like , straight to curvilinear depressions ) .
Some of these features are indicative of tectonic stressing of a brittle crust underlain by liquid , with the energy to fracture it coming from bulging in response to tidal interaction with Dione , which orbits in resonance with Enceladus .
Several linear scarps are faults that show offset of lines crossed by them .
Tethys is a heavily cratered satellite ( diameter = 1,060 km [ 659 mi ] ) , on which appears a very large ( about 400 km [ 249 mi ] diameter ) impact structure called Odysseus .
A close look at Odysseus indicates both its rim and central peak have diminished in height under viscous flow .
Because of this , its depth to diameter ratio is lower than normal for craters of this size .
A huge valley , 2,000 km ( 1,245 mi ) long , 100 km ( 62 mi ) wide , and up to 5 km ( 3 mi ) deep , known as Ithaca Chasma , suggests that the ice cracked at some stage , perhaps when rifting occurred , as water converted to contracting ice that redistributed tension .
It is hard to see in this next image but look for the long , broad " slash " in the upper left quadrant .
The slightly larger ( 1,120 km [ 696 mi ] )
Dione has two dissimilar hemispheres : on one side , the leading hemisphere ( because of synchronous locking , where the same side always faces the direction of the advancing orbit ) , the surface is heavily cratered and fractured , with a uniformly medium bright tone .
The other side , the trailing hemisphere , is darker , has a much lower crater density , and contains broad , very bright streaks in a diffuse network .
Planetologists believe this strange pattern is frost and ice , expelled or extruded from fissures , and possibly from ice volcanoes , in which the water is the " lava " in an otherwise frozen structure .
Rhea ( 1,530 km [ 951 miles ] in diameter ) is very similar to Dione , in having a leading hemisphere that has crater densities comparable to the Moon and Mercury , as is hinted at in this full disk view , and a trailing hemisphere with few craters , streaks ( ejecta rays ? ) , and fractures .
This is the heavily cratered side of Rhea :
This same theme repeats at Iapetus ( 1,460 km [ 907 miles ] in diameter ) , which is further from Saturn .
The leading hemisphere has a very low albedo ( 0.03 - 0.06 ) , in sharp contrast to previously described satellites , and with abrupt boundaries , against the trailing edge terrain ( albedo about 0.5 ) , which is heavily cratered .
The reason for this dichotomy within this satellite is still uncertain .
This trailing - edge material may have emerged from within Iapetus during crustal foundering .
But , the dark terrain is consistent with silicates that have high carbon content , such as those that comprise carbonaceous chondrite meteorites .
Thus , this part of Iapetus could have formed as ejecta , which came from another satellite or more likely from infall of a similar , asteroid - like body onto Iapetus .
Typical of the 23 smaller satellites is Phoebe ( 200 km ] 134 miles ] diameter ) , orbiting nearly 4 x as far out as Iapetus .
The first look at this tiny moon was taken by Voyager ; later , much better views were obtained by Cassini .
Slightly larger ( 286 km ; 179 miles ) than Phoebe is the more angular Hyperion :
As a preview of the extent of improvement that Cassini has provided for the saturnian satellites , compare the above view with this view of Hyperion made by Cassini :
Now move to the next page which covers Titan and the still incoming views of Saturn and its satellites being obtained by the Cassini - Huygens mission .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. stocks staggered to the end of a dismal second quarter on Wednesday in another low volume session as investors found little reason to take on risk after conflicting economic data .
Wednesday ’s session ended like many during the quarter , with a late - day sell - off as buying interest waned and investors sold underperforming stocks in the worst quarter since the market meltdown triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
“ Just pushing all the garbage off the side of the ship , ” Peter Kenny , managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City , New Jersey , said of the late sell - off .
The S&P 500 fell below the 1,040 level that it had held since February , breaking out to the downside from what chartists call a very bearish “ head and shoulders ” price pattern and suggesting a major fall could come in the next five months .
To make matters worse , leveraged short ETFs , widely blamed for a portion of Tuesday ’s losses , were also cited for the late sell - off as managers piled on bets the market will fall .
Those funds shorted the market to keep up with customer demand .
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 96.28 points , or 0.98 percent , to 9,774.02 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX slid 10.53 points , or 1.01 percent , to 1,030.71 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 25.94 points , or 1.21 percent , to 2,109.24 .
For the second quarter , the Dow fell 10 percent , the S&P 500 lost 12 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 12 percent as worry about Europe ’s sovereign debt and the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery caused investors to pull back from the most recent closing highs hit in late April .
These losses put Wall Street in correction mode as the second quarter ended .
Technology shares were among the hardest hit , with Google Inc GOOG .
O off 2.1 percent at $ 444.95 and Apple Inc AAPL.O down 1.8 percent at $ 251.53 .
Data on Wednesday showed Midwest business activity grew slightly more than expected in June , but a private - sector report showed weakness in employment , a critical part of the economic recovery .
The PHLX Oil Services Sector index .OSX was among the few bright spots , inching up 0.02 percent , aided by a 1.8 percent gain in Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N to $ 41.57 .
The index has fallen 20.3 percent for the quarter and 22.4 percent since the BP Plc BP.LBP .N oil spill .
“ If you want to go bottom fishing , you do it in the oil services sector .
There is going to be consolidation in that group , ” said Cliff Draughn , president and chief investment officer of Excelsia Investment Advisors in Savannah , Georgia .
“ With this moratorium on offshore drilling , they are a dead business . ”
Even with the accelerated volume heading into the close , volume was tepid , with about 9.21 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange , the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq , slightly below last year ’s estimated daily average of 9.65 billion .
Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones on the NYSE by a ratio of about 2 to 1 , while on the Nasdaq , about nine stocks fell for every five that rose .
With the federal deficit a growing political liability , lawmakers in Congress are backing off plans to send more aid to financially strapped states , putting in jeopardy billions of dollars that California and others were counting on to balance their budgets .
The potential loss of funds is a significant setback for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state lawmakers , who may not see nearly $ 2 billion in federal assistance that they intended to use to help bring California out of the red .
The money was to be California ’s share of $ 24 billion in proposed assistance , mostly to cover healthcare spending , spread among all states .
Budget experts say that is enough to wipe out about one - fourth of the combined state budget shortfalls .
In California and elsewhere , officials thought the funds were a sure thing .
The money was one of the few elements of Schwarzenegger ’s budget plan on which there was bipartisan agreement .
But House Democratic leaders last week stripped the money out of legislation amid election - season jitters .
“ This is a serious problem , ” said Jean Ross , executive director of the California Budget Project , a Sacramento - based nonprofit .
“ The fear of deficits seems to be overtaking Washington .
They are not realizing the bigger threat is the economy could slide back into recession as a result of state and local budget cuts . ”
In California , the governor has already proposed eliminating the state ’s welfare program , cancelling state - subsidized day care for hundreds of thousands of low - income children , freezing school spending and making a number of other deep cuts to close a $ 19.1 - billion budget gap .
Failure to get the federal money would surely force more drastic proposals .
But even if the state eliminated its entire home healthcare program , which serves 440,000 elderly and disabled Californians , it would n’t make up for the $ 1.9 billion the state is now scrambling to secure .
The states have launched a frantic lobbying effort to persuade the U.S. Senate to provide the assistance .
“ You ’ve got virtually every governor in the country calling on Congress to do this , ” said H.D. Palmer , deputy director of the California Department of Finance .
“ This is not just a California issue .
It is a national issue . ”
The states ’ efforts come as the Democrats who control Congress face resistance to increased spending from fiscally conservative members of their own caucus , many of whom face tough reelection campaigns in districts where they campaigned on pledges of fiscal discipline .
Republicans , meanwhile , have highlighted the federal budget deficit , which could reach $ 1.5 trillion , in this year ’s mid-term election campaigns .
Michael Bird , federal affairs counsel for the National Conference of State Legislatures , said securing the funds would be a challenge .
“ We ’ve got our work cut out for us , ” he said .
Thirty states have been counting on the additional Medicaid money in their budgets , according to the conference .
The money was originally provided in last year ’s economic stimulus bill — but only through the end of this year .
With unemployment still high , a bipartisan group of governors , with President Obama ’s support , has sought to extend the funding through mid-2011 .
The $ 24 billion was stripped from a package of unemployment aid and tax breaks by House Democratic leaders in response to the demands of fiscally conservative members of their party to reduce the bill ’s overall cost .
The bill was approved by the House last week and is awaiting action in the Senate .
A spokesman for Rep. Chellie Pingree ( D- Maine ) , a leader in pushing for extension of the Medicaid funding , said that the congresswoman has been assured by Democratic leadership that the issue will come back before the House .
Schwarzenegger has aggressively pushed the California congressional delegation to extend the federal aid to states .
He expressed confidence in January that Washington would step forward with as much as $ 7 billion in new federal assistance , which could be used to close more than a third of California ’s budget gap .
By May , he acknowledged that was unlikely but suggested the state could safely assume it would receive half that amount .
Now the state is facing the prospect of getting barely more than $ 1 billion .
Among those resisting the governor ’s push for more assistance are his fellow Republicans in the state ’s Congressional delegation , who say Washington has its own budget problems .
While the loss of Medicaid funds would hit California hard , the House bill does include provisions that would benefit the state .
Among them is an extension of the Build America Bond program that has been used in California to fund infrastructure projects .
There is also $ 400 million in increased Medicare payments to doctors in a wide swath of the state to address longstanding complaints that low reimbursement rates have discouraged them from taking on new patients .

We assembled our brain trust of film geeks and put together 25 of the genre 's best films .
Our criteria included the films ' impact on pop culture , story quality , legacy , filmmaking style and our favorite " Get Out of Jail Free " card , Editor 's Choice .
After you read our favorites , tell us a few of yours in the comments along with those movies you love and wish we did , but did n't .
( Sorry , Bebe 's Kids fans . )
Before Batman Begins , this animated theatrical release was the Dark Knight 's best big screen story .
And some fans can still make the argument that it is the best ever made .
While we might not make that argument ourselves , we can understand why a few brave fanboys would .
Bruce Wayne 's past takes center stage as Batman must stop a new rogue on the block , Phantasm , from killing Gotham 's local mob population .
The crimes and the perpetrator are connected to Bruce 's first – and last – shot at true love , a relationship he was willing to give up the cowl for if it meant he could be happy .
So it 's a comedy , clearly .
Tragedy and Batman are meant to be together , and when you throw Mark Hamill 's Joker into the mix , you have one of the most heartfelt and dramatically satisfying stories DC has ever told .
The Phantasm is a great nemesis , and the reveal of who is behind the mask is both surprising and justified .
The climax , set at an abandoned Gotham World Fair ground , is truly epic and , moreover , violent as hell , thanks to Joker challenging Batman to the fight of his life .
Each character , good or bad , is connected by an event their pasts could not have avoided .
The movie does n't shy away from exploiting the consequences of that event , especially the toll it takes on Bruce .
With his films , Nolan nailed who the Dark Knight is .
But Phantasm did it first .
Fritz Lang 's Metropolis is one of the true classics of the silent film era .
Many decades later , this Metropolis is now considered a classic among animated films .
This 2001 movie is an adaptation of Osamu Tezuka 's manga series , which itself adapted Lang 's film .
The anime presents a conflict between two societal classes , but also offers a very personal exploration of what it means to be human .
Metropolis is chock full of amazing visuals and pure , unbridled imagination .
Is there any silent movie that can't be improved through liberal application of lush animation and Japanese robots ?
Nine years later , Metropolis certainly holds its own against classics such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell
Not number one , you say ?
Walt Disney 's ultimate creation ?
His piece de resistance ?
That 's right , it 's not number one in our book .
Yes , Fantasia is pretty cool , great stuff -- a Disney masterpiece , sure , and a milestone in animation and cinema as a whole .
But let 's be honest here …
It can also be kind of boring at times , cheesy at others , and dated in the worst way here or there ( Those freakin ' unicorns ?
Seriously ?
And baby unicorns ?!) .
And yet , there is still so much to praise for the film , even now 70 years since it was released .
The episodic , mostly non-narrative epic is of course set to various pieces of classical music , resulting in sequences like the climactic " Night on Bald Mountain " ( featuring the awesome demon- creature Chernabog ) that are hallmarks of the genre .
Technically peerless , featuring animation that is still among the best ever created , the film should be much higher on this list .
But those damned unicorns …
Mamoru Oshii's feature - length film , adapted from the manga by Masamune Shirow , helped launch a massive , worldwide franchise that now includes several sequels , a couple of television series , videogames , novels , toys and more .
James Cameron has praised it , the Wachowski brothers have credited it as being a major influence on The Matrix and a Steven Spielberg - produced live - action film is currently in the works .
Essentially a crime thriller set in the future , the original 1985 film introduced cyborg security officer Major Motoko Kusanagi on the trail of a criminal hacker known as the Puppet Master .
The film explores such deep , existential themes as the nature of identity and what it is that makes us human .
It also includes hot naked chicks .
So take from it what you will …
When writer - directors Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach combine their unique filmmaking talents , they bring about arguably their best work – despite the confines of some very old - school , very fun stop - motion animation .
Fox , based on the novel by Roald Dahl , features George Clooney voicing the titular character , a columnist who can't resist going back to his sly , chicken coop - robbing roots to feed his family when three big corporate chicken farmers threaten to tear down Fox and Friends ' home .
The setup is pretty basic , but the content and interplay between these animal characters is inspiring , witty and most of all pure fun .
Our heroes , made of arts and crafts supplies , feel more alive than most live - action characters .
And Anderson and Baumbach , operating outside of their usual wheelhouse governed by all - too - smart , upper - class people with upper - class problems , seem to bring out the best in each other here , giving the film many opportunities to be one of the most underrated films of 2009 .
Tillman mother sought to warn Obama of McChrystal
The mother of the slain football player and Army Ranger Pat Tillman sought to warn President Obama against making General Stanley McChrystal his commander in Afghanistan .
Mary Tillman said in an unpublished interview this year that she wrote to Obama and called Senators and members of Congress seeking to block McChrystal 's appointment when she learned that he was under consideration for the post .
She called the lack of deliberation leading to his appointment " disgusting " in the interview , given before today 's Rolling Stone article spurred intense tension between the general and the White House .
An audio recording of the interview was provided to POLITICO by the interviewer , who asked to remain anonymous .
McChrystal has been accused of involvement in covering up of the fact that Tillman had been shot by his own comrades , having approved a citation for a posthumous medal that attributed his death to " enemy fire , " though the general also penned a memo warning the White House against describing the circumstance of Tillman 's death for fear of future embarrassment .
An official investigation blamed McChrystal for “ inaccurate and misleading assertions ” in the formal recommendation of Tillman for a Silver Star .
Mary Tillman said she emailed Obama a short letter saying that McChrystal was not what he seemed .
She received no response to the letter and little response to her contacts with members of Congress , she said in the interview , though Senator John McCain called her to seek suggestion for questions to ask at a hearing with McChrystal .
Tillman declined to provide them because she 'd read that McCain had already decided to back McChrystal .
Mary Tillman did n't respond to a request for comment through the the Weinstein Company , which is distributing a documentary about her son and the circumstances surrounding his death and the subsequent alleged cover-up .

Analogies are lies which reveal the truth .
Israel is an apartheid state .
Zionism is an exclusivist and racist ideology in its vision and practice .
In this world view Palestinians are lesser humans .
They have no rights to their land .
The 20 percent of the Israeli population who are Palestinian are second class citizens .
They sit at the back of the bus .
They are poorer , less well educated , have less health care and higher rates of unemployment .
Israel has deliberately created bantustans of the Palestinian areas under its control .
Its aim is to expel all Palestinians from the country , a country which has no fixed boundaries .
To date they have been stunningly successful in this dispossession – a process of genocide .
This map shows that reality .
Like apartheid South Africa , Israel is a limited democracy .
It is democracy built on the imprisonment of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and the wider region and the second class status of Palestinian Israelis .
It is a democracy built on the exclusion of Palestinians .
The analogy falls down in working out the way to defeat apartheid Israel but is instructive nevertheless in seeing the general outlines of the potential for challenging the Israeli dictatorship .
The black working class in South Africa – the vast majority of the country – created the wealth the white ruling class depended on .
Its growing consciousness and action as a politicised working class using strikes to fight for freedom shook apartheid to its core .
The white ruling class compromised with the democratic forces arraigned against it .
It traded off its political dictatorship to save its economic dictatorship .
The Palestinians are not the black working class equivalent in Israel .
The ruling class in Israel survive on the wealth created by 3 different working classes – the Israeli working class , the Palestinian working class and the American working class .
( In fact it may be that the Israeli working class creates no surplus value , but that is a question for a more theoretical journal than this Daily Telegraph of revolution . )
The Israeli working class depends for its privileged position on the existence of the current arrangements .
It is a bastion of reaction ( much as the white working class in South Africa was ) .
The Palestinian working class in Israel is not in an economically strong enough position to fundamentally challenge the rule of Israeli captial .
The privileged position of Israel economically depends in large part on US aid of between $ 5 and $ 6 billion a year .
Without the military and economic aid and political support the US state provides Israel could not survive .
The US provides this munificence because Israel performs a vital function for American imperialism in the region .
It is much cheaper to fund Israel than have a large permanent US military presence in the region costing tens if not hundreds of billions a year to ensure US control of the most vital product to the world economy – oil .
So in any campaign for Palestinian freedom a successful fight in America against US support for Israel is an important component .
Indeed every strike in the United States , every campaign for justice ( e.g. against Arizona ’s juan crow laws ) is objectively a blow for Palestinian freedom .
Success in other areas – e.g. in breaking the blockade of Gaza or in overthrowing US puppet Mubarak in Egypt and more generally against the US war machine in Afghanistan – opens up a space for Palestinian freedom .
In 2008 workers and the rural poor challenged Mubarak .
Their economic and political discontent cannot be stifled forever .
The Egyptian masses have the power to overthrow the US backed dictatorship .
The power of workers and the support and activity of the rural poor provides the basis for a successful revolution .
Even if that revolution remains within bourgeois capitalist terms ( and the dynamic of workers ’ power driving the fight for freedom means it may not ) it will fundamentally alter the politics of the region .
By its very existence a popular regime in Egypt challenges Israel .
Such a regime cannot come to power without an agenda for freedom for Palestine .
If there are popular and democratic forms of rule it cannot resile from its tasks .
The success in ridding the world of another American dictator will be an inspiration to the masses in other countries in the region and in Palestine in particular .
It will shake the grip of US power in the region , weaken its resolve and create challenges to US rule throughout the area .
Israel will be weakened .
Therein lies hope for Palestine .
The road to Jerusalem runs through Cairo .
In the next article , John will look at North Korea and Israel .
Paying back the taxpayer might also help RBS with its stickiest issue : how can it justify paying £ 1.3 bn bonuses to its investment bankers after being bailed out with £ 45.5 bn of taxpayer money and being 84 pc state - owned ?
Sir Philip last week admitted to the BBC that it is " difficult to defend the massive differential " between bankers ' pay and that elsewhere in the economy .
But , as Hester has stressed , RBS is " a part - prisoner of the market " .
Repaying the Government from profits largely generated by the investment bank would be the clearest proof yet that the unholy alliance of a state bank awarding outrageous bonuses is , perversely , in the country 's best interests .
It would relieve some of the political pressure on Hester and his team .
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Tuesday Turkey and Brazil would continue to press for a deal with Iran to swap part of its nuclear material despite new U.N. sanctions against Tehran .
Western powers voiced deep misgivings about a plan brokered by Brazil and Turkey for Iran to send abroad 1,200 kg of its low - enriched uranium in return for reactor fuel , and supported a fourth round of sanctions this month .

Turkey and Brazil voted against the resolution .
Brazil 's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said on Monday he still hoped an earlier outline agreement could serve as the basis for further talks with Tehran .
KABUL , Afghanistan  American taxpayers have inadvertently created a network of warlords across Afghanistan who are making millions of dollars escorting NATO convoys and operating outside the control of either the Afghan government or the American and NATO militaries , according to the results of a Congressional investigation released Monday .
The investigation , begun last year by the House Subcommittee for National Security , found that money given to these Afghan warlords often amounts to little more than mafia - style protection payments , with some NATO convoys that refused to pay the warlords coming under attack .
The subcommittee , led by Representative John F. Tierney , Democrat of Massachusetts , also uncovered evidence suggesting that American taxpayer money is making its way to the Taliban .
Several trucking company supervisors told investigators that they believed the gunmen they hired to escort their convoys bribed the Taliban not to attack .
The warlords who are paid with American money , the investigators said , are undermining the legitimate Afghan government that Americans soldiers and Marines are struggling to build , and will most likely threaten the government long after the Americans and NATO leave .
Many people are a bit scared of frisée .
They worry that it will be too frizzy , too bitter , and too overwhelming to use as a salad green .
This fear might arise from bad experiences with store - bought frisée , which can be woody and extremely bitter .
But there ’s no reason to fear this chicory when you ’re getting it from a farmers market or CSA .
It ’s in season from spring through early summer .
Frisée adds a wonderful spiciness and a gorgeous feathery appearance to salad mixes .
It ’s also tasty enough to be the star of a filling dinner salad .
Here are a few recipes to help you conquer your frisée fear .
[ social_buttons ]
Frisée is the star of a classic French bistro salad .
The traditional version includes thick - cut bacon , but the vegetarian version is just as great without the meat .
For a vegan frisée salad , try topping the greens with a few chopped , sun-dried tomatoes and my Garlic - Walnut Dressing :
1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil
6 cloves of garlic , peeled
1/2 cup of walnuts
2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice
1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard
1/4 cup of walnut oil ( or extra virgin olive oil )
Sea salt and freshly - ground black pepper , to taste
1 . Put oil in a skillet over medium - low heat .
When it is warm , add the garlic and cook until fragrant and beginning to soften ( about 6 min ) , stirring occasionally .
Add the walnuts and continue to cook until they just begin to color ( about 4 min ) .
Let the mixture cool slightly and then put in a small food processor .
2 . Process the walnut mixture until you have a relatively smooth paste .
Add the orange juice ( to taste ) , Dijon mustard , walnut oil , salt and pepper .
Run the food processor again .
If necessary , add more oil to thin your dressing .
This dressing will keep in the fridge for up to two weeks .
Frisée can stand up to heavier , creamier dressings than can delicate salad greens , making it a good candidate for a green - goddess dressing .

Arsenal winger Theo Walcott was the surprise omission from Fabio Capello's 23 - man England World Cup squad .
Walcott , 21 , who has 11 caps , started both of England 's recent friendly victories against Mexico and Japan .
Darren Bent , Adam Johnson , Scott Parker , Michael Dawson , Leighton Baines and Tom Huddlestone also miss out .
Gareth Barry is included after a fitness test on his ankle injury , while Stephen Warnock , Michael Carrick and Ledley King also make the squad .
Walcott was a shock member of former England boss Sven - Goran Eriksson 's 2006 World Cup squad , having never started a Premier League game but he did not feature in the tournament and the then - 17 - year - old 's inclusion was widely criticised .
PHIL MCNULTY BLOG Capello has been a big Walcott supporter , but the player 's failings were evident against Mexico at Wembley last week
The right winger has since scored three international goals , all coming in a 4 - 1 World Cup qualifying victory against Croatia in Zagreb on 10 September 2008 .
But after suffering with shoulder , back , knee and hamstring problems he has been restricted to 15 starts for Arsenal last season , with his form suffering as a result .
Walcott said in a statement : " I am very disappointed not to be included in the squad going out to South Africa , but completely respect Mr Capello 's decision .
" I would like to wish the team the best of luck and hope they have a really successful tournament . "
Former England captain Alan Shearer was not surprised by Capello 's decision to select tried and tested players to take to South Africa .

" It was inevitable but I think Fabio said some months ago when he first took the job that players must be in form and playing regularly for their clubs , " Shearer told BBC Radio 5 live .
" Joe Cole is n't playing well and has n't played regularly for Chelsea and Emile Heskey has n't played well for Aston Villa but on the other hand I can understand why he has done it because they are tried and trusted in his formation and in his squad . "
Tottenham skipper King , 29 , has been plagued by a chronic knee problem that restricts his ability to train and play back - to - back games in quick succession .
But after proving his fitness with Spurs towards the end of the season , he featured for the first time under Capello against Mexico on 24 May , scoring with a first - half header .

King had previously been named in a Capello squad in March 2009 but withdrew after being assessed by the England medical staff .
Warnock 's only England appearance came as an 84th minute substitute in a friendly against Trinidad & Tobago in May 2008 .
The Aston Villa defender , 28 , has previously played for Liverpool and Blackburn as well as loan spells at Bradford and Coventry , and has been preferred in the squad to Baines , who played against Mexico last week and Egypt in March .
Tottenham defender Dawson and West Ham midfielder Parker did not feature in either of the games against Mexico and Japan while Manchester City winger Johnson only got a run out as a late substitute .
606 : DEBATE
Is Walcott 's exclusion Fabio Capello 's biggest mistake ?
Sportsboy Huddlestone was impressive in Tottenham 's midfield as they finished the Premier League in fourth place .
The 23 - year - old came on as a substitute against Mexico and started against Japan but did not force his way into the final 23 .
Sunderland striker Bent was the third highest scorer in the 2009 - 10 Premier League season with 24 goals and he expressed his disappointment at missing out .
" I feel really disappointed .
I 've always said to myself - if you play well and do your best for Sunderland then there 's a chance you can go to the biggest tournament in the world , " he told Sunderland 's website .
" Obviously on this occasion it has n't worked out .
" Of course I still want the boys to do well .
I 've got a lot of friends in the England set up .
They 're a great bunch of lads and even though I wo n't be there , I 'll be supporting them . "

However , former England winger Chris Waddle suggested Bent 's omission was understandable given the way England play .
" It 's hard for Darren Bent , " Waddle told BBC Radio 5 live .
" He got 25 goals for Sunderland but England always play with a target man so Rooney and Defoe are always ahead of Bent .
Barring injury I never thought he'd be on the plane . "
Manchester City midfielder Barry , 29 , has not played since he picked up a ligament injury in a Premier League match against Tottenham on 5 May and had an extensive test on his injured ankle on Tuesday morning .
ENGLAND SQUAD - MOST CAPPED PLAYERS Steven Gerrard - 80 caps Rio Ferdinand - 78 caps Ashley Cole - 78 caps Frank Lampard - 78 caps John Terry - 60 caps Wayne Rooney - 60 caps Emile Heskey - 58 caps Joe Cole is now fully fit after a serious knee ligament injury and produced an impressive second - half cameo during Sunday 's 2 - 1 win against Japan .
And Waddle , who played for England at the World Cup in 1990 , said Cole had benefitted from Johnson 's inexperience after Capello decided to leave the Manchester City man at home .
" Adam Johnson has played very well , " said Waddle .
" He looked very good in the five minutes in the friendly and I think it was between him and Joe Cole and he 's gone for Cole . "
England travel to South Africa on Wednesday evening .
The World Cup begins on 11 June , with England 's first game coming a day later against the United States in Rustenburg .
England 's 23 - man squad for the World Cup finals : Goalkeepers : Joe Hart ( Manchester City ) , David James ( Portsmouth ) , Robert Green ( West Ham ) .

CHICAGO / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Officials in Arkansas are investigating a shipment of 40 to 60 human heads found by Southwest Airlines employees at a cargo facility last week in Little Rock , the Pulaski County coroner said on Thursday .
The shipment of three separate containers was discovered last Wednesday at the facility after employees saw the package was “ not labeled properly , ” Southwest spokeswoman Ashley Rogers said .
“ Although it is common to transport human specimens for medical purposes , a longstanding Southwest cargo customer attempted to transport a shipment without following policies in relation to labeling , packaging , and properly declaring the contents , ” the company said in a statement on its website .
Southwest employees opened the box last Wednesday evening , found the heads and contacted local police , who turned the heads over to the local coroner .
“ They were basically in plastic containers with lids that are not air - sealed , ” Coroner Garland Camper said .
“ They were duct - taped with minimal information to disclose what was inside . ”
The heads were being shipped to a Medtronic Inc facility in Fort Worth , Texas .
They were for educational training for neurosurgeons studying ear , nose and throat procedures , said Medtronic spokesman Brian Henry .
Camper said there were between 40 and 60 heads packed in three containers .
Henry said the company had ordered four heads and 40 skull parts , or the portion of the head with the ear .
“ In this particular instance , they were going to be used for educational training , which is routinely and commonly done , ” Henry said .
It is not uncommon for heads used for research and educational training to be shipped commercially , he said .
“ It ’s a common practice , ” Henry said .
“ This is a very uncommon result . ”
Medtronic , the world ’s largest independent medical device company , employed Arkansas - based JLS Consulting to supply and ship the head and head parts .
Calls and an e-mail to JLS Consulting were not immediately returned .
The 24 - hour Southwest cargo facility is one of 70 operated by the low - cost airline and typically handles shipments of items like flowers and seafood , Rogers said .
Camper , the Pulaski Country coroner , said his office took possession of the heads after being contacted by officials in Little Rock .
“ Since then we have learned that the paperwork that we have asked for does not quite meet the same description of the specimens that we have , ” he said .
“ So we ’ve got some discrepancies there . ”
Camper said he wanted to confirm that the heads were not being shipped as part of a black market for human body parts .
“ We definitely want to make sure this is not a part of something like that , ” he said .

One of Nevada ’s top political reporters , who just happens to work for the Fox affiliate in Las Vegas , is mocking this morning ’s interview of Senate candidate Sharron Angle by “ Fox & Friends ” hosts Steve Doocy , Gretchen Carlson , and Brian Kilmeade :
LAS VEGAS — Harry Reid may not need to spend millions of dollars to marginalize his opponent in the U.S. Senate race .
He can just let “ FOX & Friends ” handle it .
Republican nominee Sharron
Angle appeared on the cable news program Monday morning in an interview rife with inaccuracies , softball questions and poor research on the part of the producers and hosts .
Let ’s get one thing straight , Brian Kilmeade : it ’s not pronounced “ Nev-ah - da . ”
You ’d think that ’s something he would have picked up , being the host of a national news show .
Brian , here ’s a link to a Facebook group that can help you overcome your speech impediment .
Kilmeade ’s error wo n’t hurt Angle , but the rest of the interview might .
It must have stung when Gretchen Carlson opened by asking the four - term assemblywoman and former minority whip about the “ whirlwind experience ” she ’s having as “ someone who really has not been in politics before . ”
What the what ?
Fortunately , Angle quickly corrected her .
However , instead of apologizing , Carlson laughed just as Angle was asking supporters to donate money to her campaign .
If Angle was upset , she did n’t show it .
But no doubt her campaign team was furious that their candidate was being treated like some political novice who accidentally won the nomination , like the high school senior who runs for mayor and wins .
Carlson ’s co-host Steve Doocy also left some audience members scratching their heads when he said Angle has been endorsed by Sarah Palin .
She has n’t .
Reid ’s team will feast on the interview , especially Doocy ’s final question , one of the few that asked Angle about her platform .
“ Perhaps it ’s a misinformation or mischaracterization , but some have said you are out to get rid of Social Security .
That ’s not true , right ? ” he said .
Angle called it “ nonsense ” and said she wants to “ personalize ” Social Security , so the government cannot “ raid ” it .
Her website advocates free market alternatives and transitioning out Social Security .
( CNN ) -- Gary Coleman 's living will called for the actor to be kept alive unless he was in an irreversible coma for at least 15 days , according to a court document .
Coleman 's ex-wife Shannon Price ordered his doctor to disconnect life support just a day after he fell into a coma last month , according to the Utah Valley Regional Medical center .
Coleman divorced Price in 2008 , but they were living together in Santaquin , Utah , when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage at the Provo , Utah , hospital .
" Decisions to terminate life support for patients are not made by physicians , " a spokeswoman for the hospital said Monday .
" They are made by family members or legal representatives of patients in consultation with health care providers . "
Coleman's " advanced medical directive " signed in October 2006 named Price , 24 , as his agent to make medical decisions for him .
" If I am unable to give informed consent to medical treatment , I want my agent to give or withhold such consent for me based upon any treatment choices that I have expressed while competent , whether under this Power of Attorney or otherwise , " the living will said .
" If my agent cannot determine the treatment choice I would make under the particular circumstances , then my agent should make the choice based on what my agent believes to be in my best interest . "
The document , which was attached to a petition Price filed in probate court , included guidelines Coleman wanted followed .
Life support should be ended , he said , after two doctors decided " my condition is incurable , terminal and expected to result in my death within 12 months " or if doctors " have diagnosed that I have been in a coma for at least 15 days and that the coma is irreversible , meaning that there is no reasonable possibility of my ever regaining consciousness . "
" Then , my agent is authorized to require that medical treatment which would prolong irreversible coma or delay my inevitable death ... not be instituted , or if previously instituted , to require that it be discontinued , " the directive said .
A spokesman for the Utah Medical Association said a family member 's wishes have more weight than what 's written in a living will .
" It 's not going to trump a family member that comes in and says ' I want you to do something different than what 's here in the advance directive , ' " said Mark Fotheringham .
Living wills are only involved when a patient is already going to die , Fotheringham said .
" It 's soley a question of how fast or what care is going to be given in the interim between then and the time of death , " he said .
Coleman 's remains are at a Utah mortuary , awaiting direction from Utah District Judge James Taylor as to who can decide what happens to the body .
Judge Taylor denied Price 's request Monday to be named as special administrator to control Coleman 's estate and instead appointed Provo lawyer Robert Jeffs .
Coleman 's former manager Dion Mial , who had been named special administrator , withdrew from the legal battle Monday after a will written in 2005 surfaced , Mial attorney Kent Alderman said .
A 1999 will named Mial as executor .
" Based upon the most recently proffered will , it does n't look like we have a dog in this fight , " Alderman said .
Mial 's withdrawal left Price and Anna Gray , a Coleman friend , as the only parties contesting for control of the estate .
Gray , a Portland , Oregon , resident , was named by Coleman as executor in the 2005 will , according to a petition filed by Gray .
Price filed a handwritten 2007 will along with her claim that she was still legally married to Coleman as his common law wife , despite the divorce .
" Notwithstanding the divorce decree , Price and the decedent continued to have a romantic relationship and engaged in romantic and sexual relations , " the petition said .
CNN 's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report .
Steve Fielding 's buffoonery in the paid parental leave debate has given way to something altogether more offensive .
Labor has a special responsibility to put him last this election .
There ’s never been any doubt Steve Fielding is a prize idiot .
His idea of senatorial behaviour has chiefly revolved around ludicrous stunts , apparently random voting and trying to inject himself into any debate going , frequently on the most offensive terms .
None of which would , under most circumstances , be an obstacle to a successful political career .
Yesterday , however , he managed to reach a new low beyond buffoonery , reaching into malice and gender hatred that appalled even right - wingers in the Senate .
Fielding , interviewed by the ABC this morning , showed a remarkable gutlessness in insisting he had n’t been the first to suggest that women might become pregnant and then have abortions entirely for the purpose of accessing paid parental leave .
Wrong .
Fielding was the first to raise the issue .
“ Drug addicts and welfare cheats can get pregnant , then after 20 weeks have an abortion and still pocket the government ’s cash , ” he said in his speech before the bill had gone into committee .
He was the first person to raise the issue despite numerous senators on all sides debating the bill on Tuesday and before him yesterday .
And in fact , Fielding has been spouting malicious garbage about paid parental leave since at least Tuesday morning when , on the doors , he said the government ’s scheme “ is putting prisoners and prostitutes ahead of stay - at - home mums ” .
The line did n’t really get the sort of media run Fielding is used to , so he had another go yesterday , tweeting :

About to talk in the Senate about PPL .
The govt is giving prisoners and prostitutes the payment while stay at home mums get nothing
Welcome to Steve Fielding ’s version of the Madonna - whore complex : stay - at - home mums and prostitutes and prisoners .
Quite how people in prison or on welfare or in marginalised employment are going to get access to parental leave was n’t something Fielding offered to explain .
Even more conservative members of the Coalition have woken up to what Joe Hockey understood several years ago when he was workplace relations minister — that paid parental leave is a workforce participation measure , not a social policy .
It ’s about the fact that we desperately need to maximise the number of skilled people in our workforce ( or as Hockey put it more simply “ we ’re running out of workers ” ) .
Support for stay - at - home mothers , whatever the rationale for it might be , is a wholly separate issue .
Not , apparently , for Fielding , who happily equates working women with prostitutes and prisoners .
But it was n’t on such fraught and admittedly complex gender and social issues that Fielding made his stand , but on the line that women would deliberately get pregnant and then abort in order to obtain benefits under the scheme .
Sarah Silverman has a joke : “ I want to get an abortion .
But my boyfriend and I are having trouble conceiving . ”
Fielding must have heard her and thought she was serious .
And just to show he has real class , Fielding did it in the context of debate around access to the scheme in the event a baby is stillborn .
Even strong pro-life advocate Barnaby Joyce ( who , unlike a lot of conservatives , takes his pro-life convictions seriously enough to be a dogged opponent of the death penalty ) , was outraged :
What are your motives on this one , Senator Fielding ?
What are you trying to do here today ?
What is your motivation ?
Is this a sincere and honest approach on which you have spent a period of time lobbying people , discussing the issues and going through the proper mechanisms and processes ?
Have you done that , Senator Fielding ?
Or have you just brought in a highly emotive issue without actually consulting or doing the footwork ?
What is your primary motivation ?
Can you tell the chamber about all the people that you have discussed this with ?
Can you tell the chamber about all the lobbying you have done on this issue ?
Or is this merely a political ploy of yours ?
If it is , I think it is absolutely disgusting .
We do n’t know what Stephen Conroy thinks of Fielding ’s efforts yesterday .
Which is a pity , because Conroy , in particular , and the Victorian Labor Party more broadly , are the Dr Frankensteins responsible for this creature , stitched together in 2004 from half - baked political smart - arsery and anti-Green sentiment .
True , other parties can claim a bit of the credit — both the Australian Democrats and Meg Lees ’ political deathbed lash at her old party , the ‘ Australian Progressive Alliance ’ — preferenced Family First ( candidates : Fielding and Danny Nalliah ) as well .
But Labor can claim credit for ensuring Fielding was elevated with Labor preferences ahead of the Greens ’ David Risstrom .
Labor has a special responsibility for Fielding .
His malicious intervention yesterday shows he is no longer simply a buffoon , he seems eager to incite hatred of women .
Labor should now face the same demand that the Liberals faced in relation to Pauline Hanson and One Nation back in the early years of the Howard Government .
They must put Family
First last on all how - to - vote cards in the forthcoming election .
The Liberal Party — some quickly , some like John Howard not so quickly — eventually did the right thing in refusing to preference One Nation .
Labor should show it has similar resolve to put Fielding last .

Formula 1 teams have voted in favour of a ban on F - ducts for next season , after teams rejected a plea by McLaren not to outlaw the blown wing concept .
McLaren stole a march on the opposition at the start of this season by introducing the F - duct onto its car - which provides a straight - line speed advantage through drivers diverting air to help stall the rear wing .
Rivals teams have worked hard to try and copy the system , but have found difficulties incorporating it because chassis have to be homologated for this season .
Although Sauber , Ferrari , Williams and Mercedes GP have managed to run blown rear wings already , a majority of teams were concerned that designs could get out of control for next season - both on cost and safety grounds .
During the Formula One Teams ' Association ( FOTA ) meeting in Barcelona on Sunday morning the matter was brought up , and the majority of teams voted in favour of it being outlawed for 2011 , even though McLaren tried to convince teams not to ban it .
Red Bull Racing boss Christian Horner , whose team is still looking into the concept , thought that safety aspects were a big concern .
" It is a clever piece of engineering and hats off to the guys who invented it , but some of the solutions this weekend look a bit marginal when you see drivers driving with finger tips and no hands , " he explained .
" So I think there is a safety issue and a cost issue to take into account . "
Mercedes GP CEO Nick
Fry told AUTOSPORT that he supported the ban on F - ducts because the designs brought little to the sport .
" I personally think that it is sensible to nip in the bud technologies that , on the face of it , do n't really have a relevance for use outside of F1 , " he said .
" By the end of the year I know we , and I am sure most of the other teams , will have an F - duct on their car and that neutralises the advantage of having it .
" The engineers have already come up with ideas for next year that are zany in the extreme , and it is difficult to see how they would be used elsewhere .
Plus they would be expensive . "
He added : " I know it is disappointing for those who invent these ideas , but I think what people have to get used to is , like the double diffuser idea , they may be fairly short lived .
" You get your pay back for the year when you have got it and other people have n't - and if it is n't a useful technology then it comes off .
" What we should be encouraging is stuff that we can be using elsewhere , and I am personally a big proponent of KERS because of that . "
FOTA agreed earlier this season to outlaw double diffusers as well for next season because of fears that the designs were getting out of control , and they did little to improve the racing .
Most of us do our best to limit the amount of non-nutritional junk sitting around the house , especially those of us with kids .
The St. Petersburg Times , in Florida , has just published the results of an investigation they undertook to discover the arsenic levels of popular apple juice brands found in grocery stores .
The newspaper had an independent third - party laboratory carry out the actual tests .
Altogether , there were 18 samples of apple juice examined .
More than one - fourth of the tested apple juice brands showed arsenic levels ranging between 25 and 35 parts per billion .
These are concentrations high enough to warrant the US Food & Drug Administration 's official " level of concern " rating for arsenic .
For the most part ,
The products tested were the very same ones you see every time you visit the grocery store : Mott's , Tree Top , Minute Maid , and Nestle 's Juicy Juice brand , as well as Target and Walmart generics .
Some of the less well - known names marketed primarily to schools and similar organizations were also sampled .
If you think shopping organic keeps you off the hook , unfortunately , this time you 're mistaken .
One of the samples taken from Apple & Eve's Organic Apple Juice contains some of the highest levels of arsenic found in the entire study .
Equally alarming was the whopping range of arsenic found in different bottles of the same brand juice .
For example , while one batch of Walmart 's Great Value label juice contained almost undetectable levels of the toxin , another contained more than 25 parts per billion .
The same goes for samples taken of Juicy Juice and several others .
Arsenic : No Amount Is Safe
While the news may come as a shock to much of the general public , many of us in the natural health and science community are not surprised .
We 've been warning the public about the dangers of arsenic overburden for many years .
Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid element commonly used in pesticides and herbicides , as well as a wood preservative and in the manufacturing of numerous metal alloys .
It 's also one of the most dangerous poisons known to man .
While the FDA does have an unacceptable level , I believe that no level of arsenic exposure should be considered safe .
Because it is found in nature , a healthy adult human body can cope with trace exposure here and there .
But as levels of arsenic accumulate in the body , they can have devastating effects .
To help ensure your body 's ability to keep heavy metal and metalloid levels in check , I recommend doing a heavy metal cleanse at least once a year .

Nearly 20 thousand Americans die each year due to complications that stem from Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or better known as MRSA .
This " super Staph " has received a lot of media coverage , and for good reason , it 's scary .
A regular Staph infection is n't remarkably dangerous or difficult to treat .
In fact , it 's perfectly normal for a healthy person to have some Staphylococcus bacteria living on their skin or inside their nasal cavity at any given time .
The only time it becomes a serious issue is if it 's somehow able to penetrate the skin through an opening such as a cut or a surgical incision , at which point it can require medical attention .
What is MRSA ?
MRSA is not regular Staph .
It does n't respond to the normal treatment methods that work with other species of Staphylococcus bacteria , and because of this , it is much more dangerous .
Because of it's increased tenacity , MRSA is much more likely to eventually work its way below the skin into parts of the body where it can cause serious damage .
Once under the surface , MRSA can quickly contaminate the bloodstream and other systems such as the urinary tract .
If left untreated , it can eventually work its way into the heart , lungs and other internal organs , where it can create a life - threatening situation even in otherwise healthy individuals .
The overall impact on people with weakened immune functions ( such as children and the elderly ) can be obviously much more severe .
Staph is a remarkably resilient bacteria .
It 's also able to quickly adapt to new antibiotics .
In fact , less than half of today 's infections respond to the commonly used antibiotic , methicillin .
Hence the name " Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus . "
Less than 10 percent of the bacteria is believed to still be responsive to traditional penicillin - based antibiotics .
These adaptations have forced many doctors to recommend much more powerful and potentially toxic antibiotic drugs to treat infections .
That is , until recently ...
New Study Offers Surprise Treatment for MRSA
A new study presented in the International Journal of Essential Oil Therapeutics shows how simple thyme oil could be the solution the medical world has been searching for .
A research team at the University of Brighton , East Sussex tested the effects of essential thyme oil on cultivated staphylococcus with great success [ 1 ] .
Their goal is to now determine its usefulness in actual patients infected with the resistant bacteria in order to develop better long - term treatment options .
The secret to the success of essential oils in treating MRSA may be the fact that no two batches of oil are exactly the same .
The minor variations in plant chemistry are believed to make adaptation more difficult for bacteria .
Certain other botanical oils , such as geranium , tea tree and oregano oil , are also thought to be helpful in fighting resistant Staph .
Some researchers theorize that some sort of cocktail treatment may offer the best overall solution to this ongoing concern .

The causes of water scarcity are varied .
Some are natural and others are as a result of human activity .
The current debate sites the causes as largely deterministic in that scarcity is a result of identifiable cause and effect .
However , if water scarcity is the point at which water stress occurs ( the point at which various conflicts arise , harvests fail and the like ) , then there are also less definable sociological and political causes .
Many of the causes are inter-related and are not easily distinguished .
Some of the main physical causes are listed below ( see Socio - Political Causes of Water Scarcity )
Population growth
The main cause of growing water scarcity is the growing demand resulting from population increase .
The population growth rate for each country in southern Africa varies between 2.2 and 3.8 % .
The major increase in demand is due to the development needs of the growing population and , primarily , from the need to grow sufficient food to feed the increasing population .
Food production
The region is already experiencing considerable problems in relation to food security .
None of the countries in SADC were able to weather the droughts of the early 1990s without outside assistance or the importing of considerable quantities of cereal .
As the demand for food increases with increasing population , the position is reached where even in good years there will be insufficient water to meet the demands .
This raises the debate of food security and self - sufficiency .
Some countries in the region – notably Botswana – having realised that there is insufficient water available to ensure self - sufficiency in food production and have consequently opted to ensure food security through economic growth .
In time of need , food is imported .
This constitutes a reliance on “ virtual water ” which is the water required to produce the food at its point of production rather than needing that water to be available at the point of consumption .
South Africa can be regarded as both requiring internal transfers of food stuffs when regions within the country are unable to meet local needs , and requiring the import of food stuffs when there is a net shortage throughout the country .
Climatic change and variability
There is a great deal of debate regarding the issue of global climate change .
Whilst there is a wide - spread view that global warming is happening , this is yet to be conclusively scientifically proven and the effect of this phenomenon on water resources is unknown .
The consensus is that the effect will be to accentuate the extremes with more pronounced droughts and more severe flooding .
Land use
Land use changes have a variety of impacts on water resources .
Whilst reduction of vegetation cover may result in greater run off , it reduces groundwater infiltration and the storage capacity of dams and lakes through siltation .
The draining of large scale wetlands or large scale deforestation may change the micro-climate of a region .
The need for improved farming methods and greater understanding of the soil / water interface is evident in many parts of the country .
The consequences of poor land management and farming methods is to push communities ever closer to the point of vulnerability where even small changes in conditions can have disastrous effects .
Another issue related to land use is the development of “ thirsty ” crops , particularly in sensitive areas such as mountain catchments .
An example is forestry development .
Whilst this can offer employment and a variety of other benefits , there are cases where the runoff from such areas is substantially reduced causing water scarcity for down stream users .
Water quality
Pollution of water supplies reduces the availability of water for use .
This is particularly severe during times of water shortages .
In times of plenty the ability of a river to accept a given pollution load is greater because of greater dilution factors .
As water becomes more scarce , therefore , rivers and streams become increasingly sensitive to the effects of pollution , as do those human and other living organisms which depend on the water .
Water contamination can result from a variety of causes including agricultural return flows , industry , and domestic uses .
Pollution can take the form of both point source and diffuse contamination .
Both surface and groundwater are often affected .
Destruction of the riverine environment reduces the natural ability of the river to cope with pollution .
Water demand
A growing and mismanaged demand for water will hasten the arrival of conditions of scarcity .
The widespread misconception by many people that there is plenty of water and that the only problem is getting it to the right place at the right time still persists as a residue from the era of supply driven water resources management .
Moving to a deliberate and purposeful policy scenario of demand management is urgently required of South Africa and other governments in the SADC region , although this may not be politically palatable in the short term .
Reducing and managing the demand for water , enforcing greater efficiency of use and introducing water conservation measures requires policy and legislative attention .
Source : excerpts from The Water Page
Water demand and supply for a region , country or local municipality requires a high standard of management .
Unfortunately , the standard of water demand management is suspect and suitably qualified staff are severely lacking in South Africa .
An integrated approach that takes all the above causes into account is required ; communication between all the local authorities involved is paramount .
The increase in population is seemingly uncontrollable so with every day that passes , more pressure is being applied to our already shaky water management systems .
There are of course certain municipalities that are on top of the situation .
Individuals feel helpless and frustrated with the inefficient , bureaucratic public service that we are currently burdened with .
One way of gaining more control of your water requirement is to be become more water self - sufficient .
Individuals and businesses can start by saving more water where possible and by recycling water on their properties , e.g. grey water irrigation systems .
Harvesting rain can take you a step further towards water self - sufficiency ; once the rainwater harvesting systems are installed , the rain collected off your roof is free water and stored in water tanks .
Water Rhapsody has 16 years of experience in water conservation and is currently number 1 in water saving systems in South Africa .

BONO has cancelled his appearance at Glastonbury forcing
organisers into a last minute hunt for some other twat .
For more than 120 years the headline spot at the white collar hippy festival has been filled by some of music ’s biggest arseholes , including the one with all the hair , the whiny American chap and that ridiculous Mancunian who has taken to selling t- shirts .
But now Michael Eavis , the simple multi-millionaire farmer who runs Glastonbury from his upside down head , has appealed to managers all over the world to check their schedules and see if one of their twats is available .
He added : “ Obviously we ’re disappointed .
Bono truly is a once in a generation bellend .
“ But perhaps this year will see the emergence of a new breed of utterly hellish prick who will prance around thinking he ’s Jesus in front of a load of London - based media and marketing executives who ’ve paid way too much for their funghi .
“ Meanwhile , I ’ve got to find something to do with this 200ft wide backdrop of Bono blessing Pope Benedict .
I suppose we could make it into a duvet cover for a blue whale that really likes The Joshua Tree .
My God , can you imagine anything worse ? ”
U2 were forced to cancel after Bono ruptured his back while trying to reconcile his support for third world debt relief with his Cote D’Azur mansion and his army of highly skilled tax accountants .
Coldplay have been suggested as a replacement , but even U2 fans have threatened to petrol bomb the main stage if Chris Martin is spotted so much as a foot inside the Somerset County Council boundary .
“ The global temperature “ savings ” of the Kerry - Lieberman bill is astoundingly small — 0.043 °C ( 0.077 °F ) by 2050 and 0.111 °C ( 0.200 °F ) by 2100 .
In other words , by century ’s end , reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 83 % will only result in global temperatures being one - fifth of one degree Fahrenheit less than they would otherwise be .
That is a scientifically meaningless reduction . ”
Senators John Kerry and Joseph Lieberman have just unveiled their latest / greatest attempt to reign in U. S. greenhouse gas emissions .
Their one time collaborator Lindsey Graham indicated that he did not consider the bill a climate bill because “ [ t ] here is no bipartisan support for a cap - and - trade bill based on global warming . ”
But make no mistake .
This is a climate bill at heart , and thus the Kerry - Lieberman bill sections labeled “ Title II .
Global Warming Pollution Reduction . ”
So apparently someone thinks the bill will have an impact on global warming .
But those someones are wrong .
The bill will have no meaningful impact of the future course of global warming .
That is , unless the rest of the world — primarily the developing nations — decide to play along .
In fact , the United States and the rest of the developed countries have little role to play in the future course of global warming except as developers of new energy technologies and / or as guinea pigs of making do with less fossil fuels .
Our attempts at domestic emissions savings will have only minimal direct climate impact , but instead they will serve as an example for the developing world of what , or what not , to do .
So if Kerry and Lieberman were interested in directly tackling the climate change issue , they would be working with China ’s National People ’s Congress to draft legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , not the U. S. Senate .
But , everyone already knows this , as we demonstrated the non-impact of U.S. emissions reduction efforts in Part I and Part II of our analysis of last summer ’s Waxman - Markey offering .
And as far as the global warming goes , Kerry - Lieberman ’s The American Power Act of 2010 is similar to Waxman - Markey ’s American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 .
Kerry - Lieberman ’s domestic greenhouse gas emissions reduction schedule is 17 % below 2005 emissions levels by 2020 , 42 % below by 2030 , and 83 % below by 2050 .
Compare that to Waxman - Markey ’s 20 % reduction in emissions ( below 2005 levels ) by 2020 , 42 % by 2030 , and 83 % by 2050 .
Except for a bit of relaxation of near term targets , the bills ’ long - term intentions are identical .
The impact of this slight emissions difference on the resulting future global temperature savings is not manifest until the third digit past the decimal point — in other words , thousandths of degrees C. Climatologically , in other words , the bills are identical .
As in our prior analyses , we use the same techniques employing a climate model simulator to derive global temperature ( and sea level ) projections from the greenhouse gas emissions scenarios .
We use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s ( IPCC ) “ business - as-usual ” scenario ( A1B ) as the baseline , and then modify it to take into account the Kerry - Lieberman emissions targets for the U.S .
Figure 1 compares the global temperature projections from the business - as - usual ( BAU ) scenario with the Kerry - Lieberman adjustments .
The BAU scenario produces a temperature rise ( over the 1990 global average temperature ) of 1.584°C by the year 2050 and 2.959 °C by 2100 .
The Kerry - Lieberman adjustments produce a temperature rise of 1.541 °C by 2050 and 2.848 °C by 2100 .
Figure 1 . Projected global temperature rise from the IPCC ’s business - as - usual ( A1B ) scenario ( black curve ) and the Kerry - Lieberman emissions scenario ( red curve ) .
The global temperature “ savings ” of the Kerry - Lieberman bill is astoundingly small — 0.043 °C ( 0.077 °F ) by 2050 and 0.111 °C ( 0.200 °F ) by 2100 .
In other words , by century ’s end , reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 83 % will only result in global temperatures being one - fifth of one degree Fahrenheit less than they would otherwise be .
That is a scientifically meaningless reduction .
Figure 2 shows that the impacts on future sea level rise projections are equally insignificant .
Instead of a projected sea level rise of 15.1 cm by 2050 , the Kerry - Lieberman bill produces a rise of 14.9 cm .
By 2100 , the BAU projected rise is 37.1 cm and the Kerry - Lieberman rise is 36.0 cm .
A century ’s end sea level rise savings of 1.1 cm , or 0.43 inches .
Too small to be of consequence .
Figure 2 . Projected global sea level rise from the IPCC ’s business - as - usual ( A1B ) scenario ( black curve ) and the Kerry - Lieberman emissions scenario ( red curve ) .
As I mentioned previously , the real impact of the Kerry - Lieberman bill only emerges if it is applied to the rest of the world , and in particular the world ’s developing nations .
Figure 3 shows the global temperature projections from the BAU scenario , along with the successive adherence to the Kerry - Lieberman emissions schedule by the U.S. , the OECD90 countries ( industrialized countries including the U.S. , Western Europe , Australia and Japan ) , and the entire world .
Basically , unless the developing world comes on board , the world ’s future temperature pathway will be largely unchanged .
Figure 3 . Projected global temperature rise from the IPCC ’s business - as - usual ( A1B ) scenario ( black curve ) and the Kerry - Lieberman emissions scenario as applied to the U.S. ( red curve ) , the OECD90 countries ( magenta curve ) , and the entire world ( blue curve ) .
Granted , all my numbers may change a bit if different assumptions are made about the baseline scenario , the particulars of international cooperation , or the various parameters of the climate model simulator ( for example , I used a climate sensitivity of 3.0 °C ) .
But the bottom line will remain the same — climatologically , the Kerry - Lieberman American Power Act , in and of itself , is a meaningless bill .
To make it effective , it must involve the world ’s developing counties .
Image caption Early treatment with TXA could combat the effects of serious bleeding
Up to 100,000 lives could be saved every year if a known drug were given to seriously bleeding trauma patients , says a report from a global trial .
The research reported in The Lancet shows that tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , which helps blood to clot , could lower the risk of dying by 15 % .
Developing countries would benefit most from this treatment , say researchers after studying 20,000 patients .
Each year 600,000 injured patients bleed to death worldwide .
World Health Organisation figures show that nearly six million people die each year from injuries , which accounts for 10 % of the world 's deaths .
Most of those injury deaths occur in developing countries , where deaths from road traffic crashes and homicide have been steadily increasing .
Almost half of those deaths are caused by bleeding .
Although previous smaller trials had shown that TXA reduced bleeding in patients undergoing major surgery , this was the first trial to test its effect on injured patients with severe bleeding .
Drug injection
The trial involved patients from 274 hospitals across 40 countries .
These included victims of traffic accidents , shootings , stabbings or land mine injuries .
The patients were injected with 1g of TXA within a few hours of being injured , followed by another 1g in a drip over the next eight hours , or a matching placebo .
Tranexamic acid is one of the cheapest ways to save a life there is Professor Ian Roberts , London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
After studying the numbers of deaths in hospital within four weeks of injury , researchers found that TXA reduced the chances of death , due to massive blood loss , by one sixth .
Ian Roberts , professor of epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , led the CRASH - 2 international trial .
He said it showed a " highly significant reduction in risk of dying " .
" The large number of patients treated in very different healthcare settings around the world means we can be sure that prompt use of TXA will be of benefit to trauma patients in all kinds of facilities , " he said .
The trial also showed no evidence of complications or unwanted clotting , which doctors had feared .
Researchers estimate that TXA could prevent up to 100,000 deaths every year across the world .
In countries like India and China it could save about 12,000 lives each year , they predict .
Two thousand deaths a year could be saved in the United States and more in Europe .
In the UK , where about 1,800 people die from bleeding after injury each year , researchers say TXA could cut this figure by about 280 .
Addressing the practicalities of making the drug available worldwide , Professor Roberts said : " TXA is one of the cheapest ways to save a life there is " .
The poverty problem
TXA costs about £ 3 per gram ; it is easily administered and does not need to be refrigerated , he says .
It can also be manufactured by a number of different companies .
The authors of the trial report recommend that tranexamic acid , should be available to doctors treating trauma patients in all countries , and should be considered for inclusion on the WHO List of Essential Medicines .
Dr Etienne Krug , director of violence and injury prevention and disability at the World Health Organisation , said that doctors needed to be aware of the trial results .
" We want to avoid injuries happening in the first place but we also need to strengthen the trauma response .
Death and serious injury throw families into poverty , so the problem affects hundreds of millions every year worldwide . "
The trial was jointly funded by the National Institute for Health Research , part of the Department of Health , the drug company Pfizer , the BUPA Foundation and the JP Moulton Charitable Foundation .
UK health minister Earl Howe said : " This is a great example of how important research can help the NHS save more lives and spread best practice around the world . "

Following up on Alex ’s piece last night about the Obama Administration ’s decision to back an effort by Japan and other nations to lift the international ban on whaling , the Sunday Times of London reveals this morning that Japan has engaged in questionable conduct as part of it ’s effort to get the ban lifted :
A SUNDAY TIMES investigation has exposed Japan for bribing small nations with cash and prostitutes to gain their support for the mass slaughter of whales .
The undercover investigation found officials from six countries were willing to consider selling their votes on the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) .
The revelations come as Japan seeks to break the 24 - year moratorium on commercial whaling .
An IWC meeting that will decide the fate of thousands of whales , including endangered species , begins this month in Morocco .
Japan denies buying the votes of IWC members .
However , The Sunday Times filmed officials from pro-whaling governments admitting :
– They voted with the whalers because of the large amounts of aid from Japan .
One said he was not sure if his country had any whales in its territorial waters .
Others are landlocked .
— They receive cash payments in envelopes at IWC meetings from Japanese officials who pay their travel and hotel bills .
– One disclosed that call girls were offered when fisheries ministers and civil servants visited Japan for meetings .
Barry Gardiner , an MP and former Labour biodiversity minister , said the investigation revealed “ disgraceful , shady practice ” , which is “ effectively buying votes ” .
The reporters , posing as representatives of a billionaire conservationist , approached officials from pro-whaling countries and offered them an aid package to change their vote .
The governments of St Kitts and Nevis , the Marshall Islands , Kiribati , Grenada , Republic of Guinea and Ivory Coast all entered negotiations to sell their votes in return for aid .
The top fisheries official for Guinea said Japan usually gave his minister a “ minimum ” of $ 1,000 a day spending money in cash during IWC and other fisheries meetings .
He said three Japanese organisations were used to channel the payments to his country : the fisheries agency , the aid agency and the Overseas Fisheries Co-operation Foundation .
How to make handmade udon noodles — it ’s easier than you might think !
I am in love with this udon noodle bowl I got from the company Flavour Design Studio .
Is n’t it gorgeous ?
I love the way it ’s designed to be easy to hold , with a hole for your thumb to fit through , and I love the grooves and holes cut out for your chopsticks to sit in so they do n’t roll away from you !
I decided that I needed to make some homemade udon noodles to properly break in the bowl .
It would have been a shame to eat store bought noodles out of such a gorgeous handmade vessel !
Udon noodles are one of the many varieties of noodles found in Japan .
Udon are the thickest of the noodles and are made by kneading wheat flour , salt , and water together .
Udon can be eaten hot or cold and are cooked in a variety of ways .
We love udon , and while living in Japan we often visited our favorite udon restaurant in Tokyo .
My favorite bowl of udon was nabeyaki udon — udon noodles in a flavorful broth made from dashi and chicken stock , and filled with lots of vegetables , poached chicken , tempura shrimp , and a poached egg .
Mr. Fuji ’s favorite bowl of udon was “ creamy udon ” — the noodles were served in a creamy white soup .
For my handmade noodles , I decided to make Kake Udon — udon served in a broth , made from dashi , soy sauce , and mirin , and topped with sliced scallions .
This is a simple preparation that celebrates the wonderful flavor of the handmade noodles .
Handmade noodles are like homemade bread — they are SO MUCH BETTER than the store bought version .
Take it from me , homemade udon makes for a very happy family !
How To Make Handmade Udon Noodles
Making udon noodles is a simple process .
You start by mixing wheat flour ( I use a combination of bread flour and all - purpose flour ) , water and salt in a bowl .
The dough at this point is very rough and shaggy .
Then you begin to knead the dough by hand .
The dough will slowly come together into a more cohesive ball .
Then you put the dough in a large ziploc bag , and wrap the bag in a thick towel .
This is where the fun really begins .
Now you get to do the rest of the kneading with your feet !
If you have kids that are anything like Squirrel , they will love helping with the kneading .
You could continue kneading with your hands , but the stiff dough becomes soft and pliable much quicker through using your feet !
The kneading helps give the noodles their wonderful chewy texture .
You knead the dough this way by walking on it with your whole foot ( not just your heel ) and turning as you go , so that all of the dough is worked on .
You alternate kneading and then rolling the dough out ,
and folding it .
The more you knead and fold , the smoother and neater your dough will become , and you can work towards forming it into a rectangle .
Then you knead it one more time and leave it in the bag , wrapped in the towel , to rest for 3 to 4 hours .
After the dough has rested , you shape the dough into a ball ,
put it back in the bag and knead it one last time .
Then you roll out the flattened dough , trying to make it roughly rectangular in shape .
Then you fold it into thirds , and use a sharp knife to slice it into1/8 ″ – 1/4 ″ ribbons .
I made our slices a bit thicker because Mr. Fuji loves thick chewy noodles .
Then you add the noodles to a pot of boiling water , using some chopsticks to lightly stir the noodles and help separate them .
After the noodles have cooked for about 6 minutes , and are translucent and firm without a hard core , drain the noodles and then rinse them under cold running water so that they cool rapidly , and continue rinsing them to ensure that all the starch is removed from the surface .
Do n’t worry if your noodles are n’t perfect — they will still look beautiful and be delicious !

“ What I was trying to say  that BP understands how deeply this affects the lives of people who live along the gulf and depend on it for their livelihood  will best be conveyed not by any words but by the work we do to put things right for the families and businesses who ’ve been hurt , ” he said in a statement .

Mr. Svanberg said the BP board , which met in emergency session on Monday in advance of the White House meeting , had agreed not to pay further dividends to shareholders this year .
Faced with mounting criticism of his company , including from within the oil industry , he denied reports that BP had taken safety shortcuts on the Deepwater Horizon rig , where an April 20 explosion killed 11 workers and set in motion the leak that Mr. Obama has called the worst environmental disaster in American history .
Still , Mr. Svanberg said he wanted to “ apologize to the American people on behalf of all the employees of BP . ”
The resolution of both the $ 20 billion fund , to be held in escrow , and the looming controversy over as much as $ 10.5 billion in dividends BP had been prepared to pay out provided the first triumphal moment for Mr. Obama since the disaster .
Weeks of bad news about failed attempts to plug the well and ever - increasing estimates of how much oil was leaking were creating a political crisis for a president who had promised to restore competence to government .
The agreement , by settling much uncertainty about BP ’s ultimate liabilities , also gave the company a boost on Wall Street .
After the announcement , markets regained ground lost earlier in the day and finished the day mixed .
BP shares , which had been down as much as 4.6 percent , closed up 1.4 percent , or 45 cents , to $ 31.85 .
Mr. Obama ’s announcement and subsequent information from the White House and BP was in effect a response to some critics , including normally supportive commentators , who had faulted him the night before for being short on specifics about the disaster in his first address to the nation from the Oval Office .
Nonetheless , as the administration also disclosed this week , new government reports suggest that oil is gushing at far greater volume than many had thought , as much as 60,000 barrels a day .
BP does not yet have the capacity to capture that much oil in ships stationed above the leak , a mile down on the ocean floor .
By now most people do n’t need to be told that the B.P. oil spill is mammoth , gargantuan , Big Mac big .
It has gotten so large , in fact , that it can be hard to conceptualize .
We used the nifty Web site If It Was My Home to compare the spill in the Gulf of Mexico to some of the world ’s other bodies of water .
The result was quite eerie ( well actually , larger than Erie ) .
The BP oil spill is now

A rare species of bird , restricted to a small area of the biologically rich island of Madagascar , has gone extinct , thanks in part to the introduction of a carnivorous fish , a conservation group has announced .
The now - extinct bird — called the Alaotra Grebe ( Tachybaptus rufolavatus ) — was a wetland - dweller that was one of many endemic and unique species to the island off the east coast of Africa .
The species saw a rapid decline after carnivorous fish were introduced to the lakes in which it lived .
Also contributing the birds ' extinction were fisherman 's nets , in which the birds would be caught and then drown , according to BirdLife International , a conservation group that is a member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
" No hope now remains for this species .
It is another example of how human actions can have unforeseen consequences , " said Leon Bennun , BirdLife International ’s Director of Science , Policy and Information .
" Invasive alien species have caused extinctions around the globe and remain one of the major threats to birds and other biodiversity . "
Another wetland bird species , this time in Cuba , is also suffering from similar threats , BirdLife International reports .
The Zapata Rail ( Cyanolimnas cerverai ) has been bumped up to a Critically Endangered listing on the IUCN 's Red List of Threatened Species .
Threats to this bird come from mongooses and exotic catfish introduced into its native habitat .
An extremely secretive marsh - dwelling species , the only nest ever found of this species was described by James Bond , a Caribbean ornithologist and the source for Ian Fleming ’s famous spy ’s name .
Other wetland bird species around the world are also under duress from pollution and drainage of coastal wetlands .
In Asia and Australia , numbers of once common wader species such as Great Knot ( Calidris tenuirostris ) and Far Eastern Curlew ( Numenius madagascariensis ) are dropping rapidly .
" Wetlands are fragile environments , easily disturbed or polluted , but essential not only for birds and other biodiversity but also for millions of people around the world as a source of water and food , " said Stuart Butchart , BirdLife 's Global Research and Indicators Coordinator .
It is easy to pick on Paul Krugman .
So easy in fact , that it is not even fair sport .
However , if you can separate the wheat from the chaff , sometimes there are nuggets of truth in what Krugman writes .
For example , please consider The Third Depression .
We are now , I fear , in the early stages of a third depression .
It will probably look more like the Long Depression than the much more severe Great Depression .
But the cost — to the world economy and , above all , to the millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs — will nonetheless be immense .
And this third depression will be primarily a failure of policy .
" governments are obsessing about inflation when the real threat is deflation "
" And who will pay the price ... "
" The answer is , tens of millions of unemployed workers , many of whom will go jobless for years , and some of whom will never work again . "
Krugman Also Correct About Inflation

The Price We Pay For Budgetary Murder

" There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit ( debt ) expansion .
The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit ( debt ) expansion , or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved . "
- Ludwig von Mises
Greenspan and Bernanke combined to stave off paying what was due in 2001 - 2002 .
The result was a massive housing bubble that ultimately collapsed .
Congress and the Fed added to the misery by wasting trillions of taxpayer dollars bailing out banks and Wall Street while leaving the private sector in shambles , and millions of homeowners debt slaves to their houses .
Each time the day of reckoning is put off , the bigger the price down the road .
Thus , we should all be fearing more Keynesian and Monetarist attempts to forestall the inevitable collapse .
Attempting to stave off further debt writedowns and another recession is like attempting to stave off a hangover by drinking more whiskey .
How Policy Errors Cause Depressions
Was Krugman a Housing Bubble Proponent ?
To fight this recession the Fed needs … soaring household spending to offset moribund business investment .

How Policy Errors Cascade
As long as the ECB 's " extend and pretend " policy is in play , Greece , Spain , and Portugal will remain wrecked while burdened by loans they will eventually default on anyway .
In that timeframe , European growth will be anemic at best .
Indeed , it is far more likely that Europe will slide back into a deep recession than simply sputter along .
As long as European growth is weak , China will be weak because Europe is China 's largest trading partner .
If China 's exports decline , China will need fewer imports from Australia and Canada .
If China and Europe are weak , there will not be tremendous demand for US exports .
Global job growth will remain weak .
Fiscal stimulus measures will fail .
Earnings estimates will surprise to the downside and the global equity markets will be extremely vulnerable to further losses .
Further equity losses in conjunction with absurd pension benefit assumptions will bankrupt many city , state , and municipal pension funds .

Bubble , Bubble , China ’s in Trouble
The Chinese dream , like the American dream , has taken shape around the promise that each new generation will live better than the one before it .
In recent years , that has meant more job options , more material comforts , and increasingly , home ownership .
Last fall 80 percent of respondents to a China Youth Daily online poll said that home ownership was a prerequisite for happiness .
Today ’s frenzied housing market in China ’s top - tier cities is rattling that aspiration , threatening to create a generation of agitated young people who work hard , play by the rules , but feel angry at the system and priced out of their chance at the Chinese dream .
With residential prices and commercial prices in top - tier cities jumping 11.7 percent over the last year — and jumping more than 50 percent in some particularly hot eastern cities — the government in Beijing is worried .
Chen " Aggie " is a 20 - something marketing professional in Beijing .
The daughter of shopkeepers , she hails from a small village in the western province of Guizhou .
She came to Beijing for college , and has since made the great leap forward that so many families in China hope for their children : moving from blue - collar to a white - collar job .
Stories like hers are regular fodder for state - run media .
But real estate is where the vision of upward mobility smashes against unhappy reality .
Ten years ago , even five , her salary would have made buying an apartment feasible , but not now .
" I was born too late , " she says .
" I missed the train . "
According to the investment bank Goldman Sachs , in recent years housing prices in Beijing have risen 80 percent faster than wages .
Chen ’s friends from well - to - do families — " second - generation wealthy , " as they ’re called — have been able to borrow money for hefty down payments ; her friends from humbler backgrounds cannot .
When I met her at a Beijing Starbucks , she was dejected and making plans to leave the city .
In some senses , her struggles mean the Chinese capital is just like any other world - class city — London , Paris , New York — where only the wealthiest and most established can own homes .
But this realization is crashing hard on a generation of little emperors and empresses that have been told they could have everything .
The agitation of China ’s young professionals is a politically sensitive subject .
Recently the government banned one of the most popular shows on television , Wo Ju ( Narrow Dwelling ) , a sort of Chinese Friends set in a city much like Shanghai .
The show chronicles the exploits of a young couple with good jobs and degrees from China ’s finest universities who still can’t afford a home , until a young woman has an affair with a well - connected government official .
Wo Ju drew millions of viewers and sparked controversy ; prominent Chinese writer Xiao Fuxing has denounced the show ’s equation of home ownership with happiness as a " thorn " in Chinese society .
( In big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai , it ’s a truism that a man who ca n’t afford a home is n’t worth marrying . )
The fact that Wo Ju was deemed so dangerous by the censors only reveals how deeply it struck a chord with China ’s aspiring classes .
Last month , a representative of the Communist Youth League told a gathering of Chinese reporters that the government was launching a propaganda campaign to convince young people to lower their expectations for success .
The message : Let them rent .
" Everyone worries about the 1980s generation — the young generation , " says Yang Xiao , a reporter with Beijing Youth Daily newspaper .
" What if they become cynical or have no dream ? "
Meanwhile , it ’s not only the young and restless in China for whom real estate represents a source of frustrated ambitions .
Economists say one significant driver of China ’s soaring real estate prices has been wealthy investors in China snatching up property , because they have few other investment options .
Current laws — based on longstanding Chinese economic doctrine that regards capital inflow as good , outflow as bad — forbid Chinese citizens from making most kinds of overseas investments .
Meanwhile , stock markets in China are unstable and immature , and there are few tax incentives for philanthropy .
As a result , the wealthiest in China are faced with a problem unimaginable a generation ago : what to do with their money .
The answer , for many , has been to invest in one of the few options available to them — an asset whose value , within their lifetime , has only gone up and up : real estate .
" Property is being held by many as a store of value , like gold , " explains Patrick Chovanec , a professor at Tsinghua University ’s School of Economics and Management .
" This bids up prices and also skews development toward high - end properties , as opposed to affordable housing . "
Ms. Wang , the wife of a successful Beijing businessman who gave only her surname , has purchased four homes in recent years .
There ’s the apartment she and her husband live in , and three others they hold as investments .
All three are vacant ; she ’s making no attempt to rent them out .
No property taxes are assessed in China , and so there ’s no financial penalty for simply buying and holding .
The rental market in Beijing , in comparison to the red - hot real estate market , is fairly weak , and besides , renting out those apartments — putting them to use and risking some wear and tear — could diminish their value .
So they remain pristine and empty .
Ms. Wang ’s thinking is not unique .
Many of China ’s wealthiest see empty apartments as their best investment option .
China ’s nouveau - riche , which have benefited from the country ’s rising tide , are now bumping up against its limits .
The economy has n’t diversified enough to afford them many options for building their wealth .
Privately , some are beginning to grumble ; as one corporate tax analyst in Beijing told me : " The government is to blame . "
Massive immigration into China ’s fast - growing cities , as well as emerging investment pressures and lingering housing - welfare programs favoring government employees , all combine to drive up both residential prices .
In the case of commercial properties , additional forces are at work ; with an underdeveloped credit and risk - assessment system in China , business loans are issued not on the basis of expected earnings , but on collateral — usually property .
Companies have multiple incentives to acquire property , and commercial realtors have an incentive to keep the asking price for office space high , even if offices remain vacant , because lowering prices ( and thus the value assigned to a property ) could bring unwanted scrutiny of outstanding loans .
Across from the vaunted Olympic Aquacube in northern Beijing sits an impressive five - tower commercial property ; it was built three years ago , but many of the offices remain empty .
Still , several new commercial properties are under construction not far away .
Beijing is worried about both the economics and the political implications of the real estate frenzy , and has lately announced several measures to cool off the market .
The government is walking a tightrope — on the one hand wanting to prevent a total meltdown ( " The government has to move before the bubble bursts and destroys the overall economy , " said private - sector economist Zuo Xiaolei in unusually frank comments to state - run China Daily newspaper ) , and on the other hand not quite wanting to slow down an economy so heavily dependent on construction , property - rights sales , building materials , and other construction - related jobs .
There are holes in the new regulations .
Efforts to limit the purchase of multiple homes are easily circumvented : Ms. Wang , for instance , purchased one of her homes in her daughter ’s name ( using easily obtained false documents about her daughter ’s place of employment ) .
Higher down - payment requirements wo n’t ward off wealthy investors who pay in cash up front .
True reform wo n’t be easy because it involves a painful re-examination of core aspects of the Chinese economic system , Chovanec argues : " The government is dealing in terms of edict , not root causes — but it ’s not easy to just order water to stop flowing downhill . "
Over time , some regulatory holes will likely be closed , but reining in local governments and corruption pose additional challenges .
With many city governments deriving between one - quarter and one - third of their annual revenues from the sale of land - use rights for development , it will be hard to wean localities across China from such a giant cash cow .
The incentives for graft are high .
Zhang Xin is co-president of SOHO China , Beijing ’s largest property developer , and has made her fortune on the property boom .
Yet the former Goldman Sachs investment banker , who last year made Forbes magazine ’s " Top Ten " Billionaire Women We Admire " list , admits she is worried about the engine of her wealth .
As she told China International Business magazine in January : " We do have a view that this is a bubble .
Real estate is very much driven by government policy …
I am sure the government is worried about it , but what do you do ?
They want the stimulus and if you want to create jobs then this is a by - product . "
She finds the empty apartment syndrome troubling : " These buildings are not fully occupied and people should be worried about it … Because of where China is with asset bubbles , people want to buy the assets regardless of whether they can be leased out or not .
People just want to hold [ property ] , even if it is empty . "
Of course , if China ’s real estate is a bubble scenario , it wo n’t necessarily pop in the same way as the U.S. housing market , or as immediately — residential borrowers are n’t as highly leveraged ( down - payment requirements are relatively higher ) , and state - run banks wo n’t call in bad loans as quickly .
Some observers , such as hedge - fund guru Jim Chanos , see an immediate danger ( " What we ’re talking about is a world - class — if not the world - class — property bubble , " he recently told PBS host Charlie Rose , adding that he expects a dramatic slowdown in China within a year ) .
Some argue the danger is overstated ; others think the day of reckoning may be 5 or 10 years off .
But one thing is clear now :
The political frictions are already evident — and both China ’s haves and its have - nots are fuming .
In 1834 , Thomas Babington Macaulay , the British historian and statesman , arrived in Madras .
He travelled north to Calcutta , then India ’s capital , to assume the role of Law Member of the Governor - General ’s Council .
“ We know that India cannot have a free Government , ” Macaulay had written to the Scottish philosopher James Mill the year before .
“ But she can have the next best thing : a firm and impartial despotism . ”
A few months later , Macaulay wrote a memo on Indian education , which stated , “ It is impossible for us , with our limited means , to attempt to educate the body of the people .
We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern ; a class of persons , Indian in blood and colour , but English in taste , in opinions , in morals , and in intellect . ”
The implication was obvious : Indians must learn the language of their occupiers .
Robert McCrum Illustration by Paul Hamlyn
With Macaulay ’s backing , schools instructed Indian students in English , a language that offered “ ready access to all the vast intellectual wealth , which all the wisest nations of the earth have created and hoarded in the course of ninety generations , ” whereas Sanskrit and Arabic offered only “ false taste and false philosophy . ”
By 1840 , according to Macaulay ’s biographer Robert E. Sullivan , “ English was the dominant language in Calcutta . ”
In 1857 , English - speaking universities opened in Madras , Bombay , and Calcutta .
Macaulay ’s vision of an independent class of Anglophone Indians was being realized .
But this development was not without irony : 1857 was also the year that Indian soldiers rebelled against the East India Company ’s century - long rule .
The uprising was ruthlessly put down , but the shock it provoked in London brought about the dissolution of the East India Company and the establishment of the British Raj .
The rebellion is now regarded by many Indians as the first war of independence .
What ’s more , the generations of independence leaders who emerged in the wake of the rebellion tended to be educated English speakers — from precisely the “ class ” that Macaulay had sought to create .
In 1950 , the Indian constitution was ratified ; it was written in English .
The story of English in India epitomizes its strange history .
English has been a language of occupiers and imperialists , but also one of insurgents and democrats .
It has often been shaped by populations upon whom it was imposed ; a large number of common English words ( “ jungle , ” “ nirvana , ” “ bungalow ” ) were , for instance , taken from Indian languages .
English has also become , as Robert McCrum asserts in “ Globish ” ( Norton ; $ 26.95 ) , the “ world ’s language , ” and it is a merit of his book that he is alert to the many dichotomies of English ’s rise .
“ Is this revolution a creature of globalization , ” he asks , “ or does global capitalism owe some of its energy and resilience to global English in all its manifestations , cultural as well as linguistic ? ”
“ Globish ” is not quite the same as global English .
The term was coined by Jean - Paul Nerrière , a French former I.B.M. executive , who noted that non-native English speakers were able to communicate with a minimal , “ utilitarian ” vocabulary of English words .
McCrum , a British author and editor who has co-written several editions of “ The Story of English , ” explains that Globish is an overwhelmingly economic phenomenon — the language of Singaporean businessmen closing deals with the help of a small arsenal of English words , and of European officials calming financial markets by uttering stock phrases on television .
He offers a journalistic account of its worldwide use in tandem with a historical one of the development of English as it made its way around the world .
This history shows the depth and complexity of the role of English in the political and cultural evolution of the societies to which it spread .
Globish ’s influence is unlikely to be as revolutionary or as lasting .
McCrum begins with the birthplace of English , which , as George Orwell observed , has always had several overlapping denominations : “ We call our islands by no less than six different names , England , Britain , Great Britain , the British Isles , the United Kingdom and , in very exalted moments , Albion . ”
The history responsible for this diversity — one of successive invasions — also insured that the language developed in an unusual way .
The Roman occupation , from 43 A.D. to the early fifth century , accustomed Celtic - speaking islanders to Latin , which soon became the language of the Romano - British élite .
The influence of this is still evident in English topography ; for example , the Latin word for camp is castra , which is the reason that so many British place names end in “ - chester ” or “ - cester . ”
The departure of the Romans was followed by the incursions of Germanic speakers from what is now northern Germany and Denmark , leading to the emergence of Anglo - Saxon , or Old English .
McCrum explains , “ Everyone who speaks or writes any kind of English in the twenty - first century is using accents , grammar and vocabulary , which , with several modifications , can be traced in a direct lineage to the old English of the Anglo - Saxons . ”
In the ninth century , Alfred the Great saw the language as a way of uniting various Anglo - Saxon kingdoms against the threat of Viking invasions .
He ordered up translations of a number of Latin texts into English , recognizing , like Macaulay , the importance of inculcating young people in his tongue of choice .
In 1066 , the Norman invasion established French as the language of government , but it did not dislodge English .
Instead , the assimilation of elements of French into English produced Middle English and , with it , the basic profile of the language we still speak : a large vocabulary of Germanic and French - derived words organized with a simplified Germanic grammar .
From here on , changes were incremental .
In the sixteenth century , the wide circulation of English Bible translations and the Book of Common Prayer brought a new degree of standardization .
The evolving national literature bears witness to this transformation .
As McCrum notes , Chaucer is difficult for contemporary readers , but Shakespeare , two centuries later , is much more intelligible .
What ’s more , the great linguistic flourishing exemplified by Shakespeare and his contemporaries coincided with Britain ’s arrival as a significant sea power .
A language of the conquered was now used in the service of empire , not least in the thirteen colonies across the Atlantic .
British colonialism firmly established English in the territories that now make up the United States , but the distinctions between American and British English are as important as the shared heritage .
Writers in England have tended to play these differences for laughs .
Wilde wrote , “ We have really everything in common with America nowadays , except , of course , language , ” and Shaw spoke of “ two nations divided by a common language . ”
Behind the jokes , however , lies a radical history .
McCrum shows how disgruntled North American subjects of British rule deliberately forged a distinctively American English .
Thomas Jefferson wrote , “ New circumstances call for new words , new phrases , and the transfer of old words to new objects . ”
According to Benjamin Rush , American English was a language that avoided “ the turgid style of Johnson , the purple glare of Gibbon . ”
In 1789 , Noah Webster pushed for the reformation of spelling and vocabulary , writing that “ Great Britain , whose children we are , and whose language we speak , should no longer be our standard ; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted , and her language on the decline . ”
The new American style , self - consciously direct , was adopted by the Englishman Thomas Paine in his pamphlets .
The Constitution , with what McCrum calls its “ triumph of synthesis , ” is another example of the enduring impact of American English .
But is English somehow inherently democratic and accommodating to liberty and creativity ?
Would the Constitution be so liberal a document if the people of Britain had been Spanish or French speakers ?
McCrum tries to have it both ways : “ Language becomes more than just an essential means of communication ; it embodies a contemporary aspiration , expressing a willingness to innovate with new ideas , to adapt old uses and to enfranchise new people .
Language , it cannot be stressed too strongly , is intrinsically neutral , but it is no contradiction to claim that English — by virtue of its origins and history — is unique . ”
Yet there is a contradiction here , and it reëmerges later when McCrum writes that English is “ on the side of the individual , ” and quotes Voltaire ’s praise of its “ naturalness , ” “ energy , ” and “ daring . ”
If languages are “ intrinsically neutral , ” then English simply ca n’t be all these things .
Some have argued that English has certain properties — a flexible grammar , a lack of masculine and feminine forms — that make it easier to learn , and thus to export .
These qualities , though , are offset by arbitrary spelling , and , besides , there are other languages , such as Russian , that have spread despite being difficult to master .
Armies and navies are ultimately more important than syntactic mechanics in establishing a language ’s dissemination .
Most likely , English was just in the right place at the right time .
McCrum follows his history with a worldwide survey of Globish .
There are accounts of call centers and outsourced jobs , and a well - reported visit to a Beijing university ’s informal “ English corner , ” where pupils spend Friday evenings discussing everything from Tiananmen Square to Hugh Grant films .
These stories are appealing , but they tend to conflate rudimentary , utilitarian Globish with English .
The Chinese students who gather to discuss Hugh Grant are seeking a linguistic and cultural competence far greater than that required by call centers .
The problem recurs in McCrum ’s discussion of India .
He writes perceptively about the Indian - born novelist Kiran Desai , but a Commonwealth writer ’s attainments in literary English clearly have little to do with the contemporary phenomenon of Globish , and it is hard to avoid the feeling that McCrum simply has more interest in the former .
Nerrière , the coiner of the term “ Globish , ” tells McCrum that Globish ’s greatest impact will be to “ limit the influence of the English language dramatically ” ; people wo n’t need to learn English when they can get by with Globish .
This would please linguists who fear that the spread of English imperils the survival of other languages .
But the idea is questionable .
It ’s true that linguistic history is full of pidgin languages , which facilitated basic communication among disparate parties but did n’t keep anyone from speaking his own language .
However , pidgins typically evolve in situations where speakers of specific languages — Portuguese and Tamil , say — need to communicate for a clearly defined purpose , usually trade .
Maybe Globish is just a worldwide pidgin , but the ease of modern travel and the huge reach of electronic media have vastly increased the kinds of interactions now possible .
For many people , Globish wo n’t be enough .
They ’ll want to learn English .
On a recent trip to India , I spent a few days in Chennai ( formerly Madras , the city where Macaulay landed ) , where the ubiquity of English - language bookstores testifies to a kind of symbiotic relationship with Anglo - American enthusiasm for Indian literature .
Both Globish and English are thriving , but it was the latter that registered .
Many young people are now reared to speak only English , and one teen - age student told me that even adults who once spoke only Tamil , the local language , were beginning to speak Tanglish with their children .
When I said that people in America refer to Spanglish , he seemed disappointed that so - called “ code - switching ” was not an exclusively Indian phenomenon .
I asked a teacher how she communicated with non-Tamil - speaking Indians — all one billion of them .
“ English , of course , ” was the reply .
Macaulay remains a much disputed figure in India , but he understood where his policies would lead .
He knew that Indian independence could not be postponed forever , but he wanted to insure that what he considered the right class of people gained power when the British departed , and sought to leave behind “ the imperishable empire of our arts and our morals , our literature and our laws . ”
In 2006 , a prominent activist for India ’s dalit underclass lauded Macaulay ’s educational initiatives , arguing that the English language had the power to emancipate Indians of low caste .
Of course , the opposite argument can be made : the lack of an English education may perpetuate the misery of many of India ’s poor .
Still , to the extent that India , with its many languages and cultures , persists as a cohesive national entity , the language of Macaulay plays a large role .
And the Indian story , like the American one , is not about Globish ; it is about English . ♦
Two of the most - buzzed - about parts of Laura Bush ’s new memoir Spoken From The Heart have to do with her speaking about the 1963 car crash where she killed a classmate ( something she ’s never opened up about publicly before ) and a decently startling revelation that during a trip to Germany , when she and President GWB fell ill , they believed they might have been poisoned .
Oh , and then there ’s the part where she plays Ultimate Marriage Defender to that husband of hers .
“ In 2004 the social question that animated the campaign was gay marriage , ” she writes .
“ Before the election season had unfolded , I had talked to George about not making gay marriage a significant issue .
We have , I reminded him , a number of close friends who are gay or whose children are gay .
But at that moment I could never have imagined what path this issue would take and where it would lead . ”
That ’s clearly not enough to gauge whether she acted to stop Bush from pursuing the constitutional amendment , or even whether she thought that was her responsibility .
We hope she felt it was , the same way we hope Michelle Obama finds reason to confront her husband about his own LGBT issues .
Probably the two biggest complaints about Facebook are about how the site handles privacy and how it 's near - impossible to customize .

Four students at New York University 's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences , despite being members of the Millennial generation ( who are assumed to not give a whit about privacy ) got tired of not having control over their personal information .
Daniel Grippi , Maxwell Salzberg , Raphael Sofaer and Ilya Zhitomirskiy say they were inspired by a talk by Eben Moglen ,
So they started the Diaspora project , which they aim to release in its first iteration by September , under a GPL license .
They explain on their Kickstarter project description ( Note :
They have raised more than four times their initial goal of $ 10,000 since posting the project April 25 ) :
We believe that privacy and connectedness do not have to be mutually exclusive .
With Diaspora , we are reclaiming our data , securing our social connections , and making it easy to share on your own terms .
We think we can replace today 's centralized social web with a more secure and convenient decentralized network .
Diaspora will be easy to use , and it will be centered on you instead of a faceless hub .
The idea is that Diaspora itself wo n't hold your personal information - your own " seed " will - and only people to whom you give a " key " to ( the Diaspora equivalent of " friending " ) will be able to see the information you share with them .

In real life , you do n't give a message to a third party , who then shares it with your friend .
You talk to your friend directly .
The site aims to be the electronic equivalent of that .
All the information in your " seed " is yours , not owned by a third party , and it 's heavily encrypted .
More than 1200 people have funded the project - most of them pledging $ 5 , $ 10 or $ 25 - to the tune of more than $ 42,000 as of Wednesday .
The project is quite timely .

People want to share what 's going on in their lives with their family friends .
Facebook offered a unique - and initially rather private - way to do that .
But , as a friend who started on Facebook when it was only open to college students explained , many people posted things on there they never imagined would be visible to the public , mainly because members of the general public could n't even start an account .
And now there are relatives posting embarrassing childhood photos and tagging you in them , too .
And now , unless they are constantly checking their privacy settings , any stranger on the Internet could see them .
The one nit some might have about Diaspora 's open - source credibility is that the first iteration will not be done in a public source repository .
In responding to one commenter on Kickstarter , Salzberg explained the team " struggled " with that issue , but in the end decided to wait until the first iteration was released in September because they wanted to take the time to hunker down and create a solid interface on Ruby on Rails .
Then , all code would be released and everyone encouraged to add nodes and customize to their heart 's content .
They promised to post lots of updates on their progress and release libraries as they went along , too , to be more open in the initial stage .
Oh , and why " Diaspora " ?
The root , as they show on their
Everyone 's been wondering what the next stage in social networks would be , as Facebook has been growing exponentially and continually making more and more data public .
Perhaps this is the new direction - both more open and more closed at the same time .
You say you 've heard it all ?
Maybe not — the company that controls over 92 percent of the worldwide operating system market is all but accusing Google of being a monopoly .
In assessing the diversity of the media landscape , the Federal Communications Commission should pay particular attention to the impact of online search engines , says the Microsoft Corporation .
Especially the biggest one .
" If a single search engine serves as the dominant gateway between consumers and content — there is a greater risk that economic forces will not exert sufficient discipline to prevent the dominant search engine from altering search results to favor its own interests or viewpoint , " Microsoft warned the FCC last week .
" Also , because consumers will lack competitive options , it may be impossible for them as a practical matter to determine whether the results reflect hidden biases or whether there is other speech that is not being conveyed . "
The company filed the comments in response to the FCC's Future of Media in a Digital Age inquiry , in which the agency asks if " there [ are ] search engine practices that might positively or negatively affect Web - based efforts to provide news and information . "
Although the G - Word is mentioned in several footnotes , Microsoft 's filing gingerly avoids identifying the search engine giant in its prose .
But we 're going to go out on a limb and assume the obvious .
Google now handles over 70 percent of searches in the United States .
No doubt this post will be tweeted with numerous LOLs , ROFLs , and LULZ .
Still , Microsoft is joining a chorus of voices who , in one context or another , say that the search engine market should be carefully watched by regulators .
That , of course , means keeping an eye on Google .
" For Internet - based media , the existence of a dominant search provider raises the risk that consumers will be exposed disproportionately to the content and views of the dominant provider or its preferred partners , " Microsoft continues .
Do n't get too excited about this statement .
It 's not like the commentary calls for the Department of Justice to get the antitrust whip out .
But it pretty much reads like a template for the concerns we 're picking up from many directions — thus worth a look .
What is less clear
Microsoft notes that most search engines offer two kinds of results , " natural " and " paid . "
The " natural " results flow from some kind of algorithm designed to identify websites .
The " paid " flow from clients who , well , paid the engine to see their service appear in the search .
Most consumers understand that the paid content is there not just because of relevance , but because somebody forked some cash over to the search service .
But " what is less clear , " Microsoft warns :
... is whether users understand that even natural search results invariably reflect value judgments by the search provider .
These judgments — such as what factors influence determinations regarding which results are more relevant than others , whether to promote popular views or websites over unpopular ones , whether to exclude adult or hateful speech , and many others — are reflected in the search results that the provider generates from queries .
A search engine could promote the content of publishers that it favors by placing it high in the search results it returns .
It also can demote content from disfavored publishers by placing it low in the rankings it returns — or even by eliminating such content from the results entirely .
Thus , search engines by necessity play a certain editorial function in the online experience of most consumers , and they therefore inherently and inevitably influence what most consumers experience on the Internet .
And the search provider in question could also establish dominance through its superiorly positioned advertising network , and " suppress , or even eliminate , smaller speakers who cannot sustain themselves without advertising revenue , or simply return less advertising revenue to all of them in order to enrich its own position . "
Shout outs
Microsoft 's problem with this ( it appears ) is not that Google may engage in these practices , but that it controls so much of the market , while the public does n't know what those practices are .
The Internet is a " diversity of channels , " the software behemoth suggests .
" When a dominant channel makes a value judgment about what content to display without disclosing that judgment to its users , the diversity of voices that is the centerpiece of the Commission ’s media policy may be at risk . "
This would be less of an issue if " competition existed among several search engines , " the filing continues ( there is n't much at this point , unless you consider the 15.04 percent and 9.62 percent Yahoo ! and Microsoft's Bing engine respectively enjoy a competitive threat ) .
" In the absence of effective competition , however , a dominant provider has the ability to push consumers to content that competes with an existing offering from a competitor and then ' shout over ' the competitor simply by causing its search users to believe that its own content is the most popular or relevant . "
Microsoft lists two precedents in which Congress moved on similar concerns over the dominance of one or a few media providers .
First , the FCC's now defunct Financial Interest and Syndication Rules ( FynSyn ) , which blocked television networks from owning prime time content .
Second , the agency 's very much alive must - carry / retransmission consent rules , which require the cable companies to hook up local television stations .
The status of both of these regulations are in flux .
Indie filmmaking groups want the return of FynSyn , and at least one United States Senator thinks their repeal was a mistake .
Meanwhile Time Warner Cable and other groups want reform of the retransmission consent rules .
But Microsoft is n't calling for anything on this scale .
What the company does say it wants seems pretty vague — something in the form of " transparency , " which would " allow users and other actors in the online ecosystem to know whether a vertically - integrated , dominant search engine is favoring its own content or that of preferred partners in natural or paid search results over competing , unaffiliated content . "
The dominant engine in question could do this without publishing its algorithms , the filing claims .
But whatever means Google adopted , " the goal would be for users and the government to understand what factors are and are not influencing the dominant provider ’s search results and advertising placements and the extent to which the dominant provider makes judgments that could impede diversity in the future of media . "
Incentives and abilities
There 's absolutely nothing in the Communications
Act , of course , that authorizes the FCC to require or even nudge Google to release this sort of information .
Google is n't a common carrier or cable company .
We 're not even sure the agency has the power to send Google a letter of inquiry about its online practices .
The DoJ , on the other hand , has antitrust authority , and is keeping a close eye on negotiations between Google and various publishing groups over Google Books .
The Federal Trade Commission has powers in this area too — but it just authorized Google 's buyout of AdMob , viewing it as competition for Apple 's iAd mobile network .
So it 's unclear who is going to do what about this issue in the near future , or how they 're going to receive the Godzilla of operating systems warning about unfair trade practices on the ' Net .
" When a single entity achieves dominance and thereby becomes a gatekeeper , " Microsoft warns , " there is an inherent risk that it may have both the incentive and ability to place its own interests above consumers ' interests in access to a broad and diverse range of content , services and viewpoints . "
Yeah , we know — a 64 - bit pot calling the digital kettle black .
But this issue clearly is n't going away any time soon .

Date : Wed , 16 Jun 2010 18:20:18 +0100 ( BST ) To : eugen [ at ] leitl.org Subject : WikiLeaks inspired " New media haven " proposal passes Parliament FYI : Reykjavik , Iceland ; 4:00 UTC , June 16th 2010 .
The WikiLeaks advised proposal to build an international " new media haven " in Iceland , with the world 's strongest press and whistleblower protection laws , and a " Nobel " prize for for Freedom of Expression , has unaminously passed the Icelandic Parliament .
50 votes were cast in favor , zero against , one abstained .
Twelve members of parliament were not present .
Vote results are available at http://www.althingi.is/dba-bin/atkvgr.pl?nnafnak=43014
One of the inspirations for the proposal was the dramatic August 2009 gagging of of Iceland 's national broadcaster , RUV by Iceland 's then largest bank , Kaupthing : http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Financial_collapse:_Confidential_exposure_analysis_of_
205_companies_each_owing_above_EUR45M_to_Icelandic_bank_Kaupthing,_26_Sep_2008
Two changes were made to the proposal from its original form as per the opinion of the parliament 's general affairs committee [ http://www.althingi.is/altext/138/s/1329.html].
The first of these altered slightly the wording of the first paragraph so as to widen the arena for research .
The second of these added two new items to the list of tasks for the government : - That the government should perform a detailed analysis , especially with respect to operational security , for the prospect of operating data centers in Iceland .
-
That the government should organize an international conference in Iceland regarding the changes to the legal environment being caused by expansion of cloud computing , data havens , and the judicial state of the Internet .

The ' recall ' covers both the F and C series Vaio laptops
Authorities in the US have instructed Sony to conduct a recall of its Vaio laptops , after problems with overheating were reported .
Sony said the problem affects more than half a million of its F and C series laptops sold since the start of 2010 .
The American Consumer Product Safety Commission said that " the computers can overheat , posing a burn hazard . "
But Sony said that this is " not a recall " and that the problem can be rectified with a software patch .
Although there are no reports of any users suffering burns , Sony say it has received a number of reports of its laptop overheating , distorting keyboards and casings .
Sony says 260,000 laptops in the US , 103,000 in Europe , 120,000 in South East Asia and 52,000 in Japan need to be fixed .
" The word recall has been used by the CPSC in the States , but we are not calling it that , " Nick Sharples , Sony 's European communications director told BBC News .
" It is possible to update the firmware online , which will rectify the problem , " he added .
Yet again
Tim Danton , editor of PC
Pro magazine , told BBC News that hardware recalls were nothing new and he was surprised there had not been more this year .
" Laptops are particularly susceptible to overheating ; hardly surprising when you are cramming so much hot running hardware into such a small space , " he said .
" One firm who may be concerned is graphics card manufacturer nVidia as its chipset is featured in a laptop that is overheating , even if we do n't yet know the exact cause .
" In 2008 Hewlett Packard recalled tens of thousands of their Pavilion laptops due to overheating issues and that also used an nVidia chipset , " he added .
Sony have also conducted product recalls in the past .
In 2006 the firm recalled over 100,000 batteries after concerns they were overheating and , in a few rare cases , exploding ; while in 2008 it recalled 400,000 Vaio laptop computers worldwide because of wiring faults .
" We do n't yet know how many people are actually suffering from overheating issues , " said Mr Danton .
" So we do n't yet know how many people will actually return their laptops or patch their computer .
" The only real risk to Sony is damage to their reputation , but that - like other recalls - swiftly diminishes over time . "

Most videogames these days pack some sort of post - ending content , whether that be additional levels , tougher difficulty settings or collectible objects you did n’t pick up the first time through .
The more punctilious game reviews give these bonus options a grade under the heading “ replay value . ”
The extras are usually extraneous , though — little rewards for truly devoted fans who want to keep playing in the game ’s world .
Everybody knows the good stuff is all before the ending .
Not so in Super Mario Galaxy 2 , the stunning new sequel to the imaginative 3 - D platformer that first launched Nintendo ’s plumber into space .
In fact , the Wii game trots out its most complex and creative challenges after the final credits roll .
If you have n’t seen them , you have n’t truly finished the game .
( Spoiler alert : Details about Super Mario Galaxy 2 follow . )
As you complete levels in Super Mario Galaxy 2 , you add to your collection of Power Stars .
With only 70 stars , Mario can complete his perennial task of saving the Princess from the Koopa king .
But after this , there are another 50 stars to collect , both by doubling back and finding more stars in previous levels — and by entering the secret World S that opens up after the credits .
Picking up the rest of the stars is n’t just a matter of looking for hiding places in levels you ’ve already played .
Each Power Star is a reward for completing a distinct level of the game .
Sometimes these are unique spins on a previous level , but often they are totally discrete challenges .
Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a game packed full of surprises — each level is different than the last , with some unique twist on the simple mechanics that will feel brand new even to people who played the hell out of the original .
You might be forgiven for thinking that those surprises might slow down toward the end , but they do n’t .
In fact , the game does n’t let up for a second — right up until you collect the 120th Power Star you ’re constantly being asked to do new , different things .
There ’s a new design choice in Galaxy 2 that adds another layer onto the challenge of finding all the stars .
In the first world of each level , there ’s a Comet Medal hidden somewhere .
To cause Prankster Comets , and thus more levels , to appear , you have to find these medals inside the levels before you finish them .
If you do n’t grab one the first time , you have to get it and complete the level again .
This adds an interesting twist , since you ’re constantly trying to complete this secondary objective so you do n’t have to do the level over .
Appropriately enough , the levels you unlock by collecting medals are some of the hardest in the game .
Some might send you back into a tough level and ask you to finish it without taking a single hit .
Others might place a hundred purple coins in a level and task you with collecting most or all of them within a time limit .
These , too , are n’t just busywork — it ’s not as if the purple - coin levels are forcing you to traipse over every square inch of a level in the name of reusing assets .
These are testing your ability to perform perfectly — to get Mario to go exactly where you need him to be .
Previous levels give you lots of fudge factor ; the comet challenges require perfection .
This is a lot less onerous than it sounds because Galaxy 2 ‘s controls are so perfect .
A Whole New World(s )
New twists on old levels are all well and good , but the back half of the game is also full of brand new experiences .
One of my favorites is a level built entirely around the “ bowling ” mechanic that the game introduces for one brief instant in the first level in which Rock Mario appears .
This moment at first appears to be a throwaway joke , but hours and hours later it turns into a challenging level in its own right .
Another galaxy is made up of boss encounters from the first Galaxy , strung together in one lengthy gauntlet .
And the last level of them all uses walls that only appear when you spin in the air , meaning that you have to wall - jump over a gaping bottomless pit , spinning to turn the walls on and off .
Most of these concepts are used exactly once in the game .
Many game designers would use them over and over until they became boring , but the Mario team gives us one perfect version of the concept , then moves on to something else .
Super Mario Galaxy 2 does have lots of that more traditional sort of post - game bonus content .
Once you get 120 stars , three Green Stars are dumped into each level .
These are quite different from the Power Stars — they are n’t markers of a completed level , they are collectible objects scattered hither and yon in hard - to - reach or hard - to - see places .
This , I ’m going to skip .
The Green Star gameplay incorporates some elements I do n’t really like about adventure games — pixel - hunting and collect - a- thons .
So for me , the allure is n’t there .
Apparently , there ’s one final master - class level that you can play after collecting all 120 Green Stars .
No thanks .
I mean , I ’d love to play it , but I do n’t see myself doing the work it would take to get there .
I have little desire to putter around in levels I ’ve already played .
Yes , the Green Stars are well - executed bonus content , but it ’s still clearly bonus content — not the main game .
Just do n’t make the mistake of thinking that everything following the credits is bonus content .
If you stop after the first 120 Power Stars , I wo n’t blame you .
But if you stop before that mark , you have n’t really finished Galaxy 2 .

A Swedish court is looking into one of the strangest file - sharing cases we 've ever heard of .
With a Pirate Bay username as the prime evidence , a Swedish man is suspected of distributing a film about moose hunting .
The filmmaker , who hunted down the alleged infringer by himself , is demanding $ 15,000 to compensate his losses .
Tor Lundberg , the maker of ‘ Löshundsjakt i norr ’ was furious when he found out that his film could be downloaded for free on The Pirate Bay and other torrent sites .
Instead of going to the police directly , he took the matter into his own hands .
Lundberg called in a friend who assisted him with his investigation , and they eventually managed to track down the person who allegedly uploaded the torrent file based on his Pirate Bay username .
The username of the uploader apparently gave away enough information to link it directly to a real life person , a man in his thirties , also a Swedish resident .
The filmmaker and his partner Lars Öderyd then decided to contact the alleged uploader to confront him with his actions .
What was said exactly during that phone conversation remains unclear , but for the maker of the film it was enough to get the police involved .
Without much technical evidence the case is now under review by the court , where Tor Lundberg has demanded $ 15,000 as compensation for his losses .
The Pirate Bay user in question admitted that the torrent was uploaded through his account but denied that he was the one who distributed the film .
He later told the police that someone might have used his account to publish it , but that he himself did n’t even own a copy of the film .
The case in itself is quite unique since the only evidence in the case seems to be a Pirate bay username , the torrent itself can no longer be found on The Pirate Bay .
Despite the lack of technical evidence , prosecutor Henry Rasmusson is confident that he can get a conviction out of it .
Filmmaker Tor Lundberg claims that the Pirate Bay user ‘ destroyed ’ him and feels that he is entitled to be compensated for the claimed losses .
“ It ’s another thing to share Madonna ’s work , who is multi-millionaire .
Or Apple products , for example .
But when you make something yourself , it ’s your own money you have invested in it .
So the effects are much more severe for an individual , ” he said .
Peace at last ?
Quite possibly as the BBC says 'we can silence the vuvuzelas '
Red button would strip out crowd noise
Ronaldo leads players ' protests over match noise
Sepp Blatter defends fans who blow ' horn of Africa '
British supermarkets sell a vuvuzela every two seconds
Internet download offers TV fans some respite
TV viewers could soon be able to cut out the annoying sound of the vuvuzela when they watch World Cup matches .
The BBC is thinking about the possibility of offering ‘ vuvuzela free ’ coverage via its red button after hundreds of complaints .
Fans say the droning sound of the plastic horns , which has been likened to the buzzing of millions of angry bees , is drowning out coverage and leaving them with aching eardrums .
[ caption ]
Vuvuzelas can generate a drone of up to 144 decibels inside stadiums , which is louder than fireworks , a plane taking off or a rock concert .
Now the BBC is looking into providing ‘ clean ’ coverage , which would strip out most crowd noise .
A BBC spokesman said last night : ‘ We have already taken steps to minimise the noise and are continuing to monitor the situation .
If the vuvuzela continues to impact on audience enjoyment , we will look at what other options we can take to reduce the volume further . ’
The BBC ’s plans emerged after World Cup officials said yesterday that the vuvuzela will stay at the tournament , despite earlier claims that the horns could be banned .

[ caption ]
Spokesman Rich Mkhondo said : ‘ Vuvuzelas are here to stay and will never be banned .
Look at them as part of our culture in South Africa to celebrate the 2010 FIFA World Cup . ’
He said the noise is part of the fabric of football in Africa , similar to English rattles , the football flares of Italy , the air horns of Holland and the ticker tape that greets teams in South America .
But football fans in Britain are buying vuvuzelas at a rate of one every two seconds .
Some suppliers claimed the UK had been gripped by ‘ vuvuzela fever . ’
Sainsbury 's sold 22,000 red vuvuzelas in 12 hours before England 's game - one every two seconds .
The supermarket chain has ordered 25,000 extra horns but thinks it may run out before Friday 's game against Algeria .
Online retailer Amazon said sales of the horn had increased by 1,000 per cent .
Those who can't get hold of a real vuvuzela can now download a virtual version of the trumpet - like instrument to their mobile phones .
Vuvuzela ' apps ' are storming the Apple iTunes charts , allowing users to turn their phone into a virtual trumpet .
There are around 11 vuvuzela apps available from Apple 's App Store .
One named ' Vuvuzela 2010 ' has been downloaded more than 750,000 times , and is currently the most popular free app in the entertainment category , while another , Virtual Vuvuzela , is the seventh most popular free sports app .
Many fans have been surprised by the noise created by the £ 2 plastic horns – which are blasted by thousands of supporters during games – with some forced to wear ear plugs to combat the din .
To TV viewers the trumpets simply sound like a constant buzzing through 90 minutes of football .
Mr Mkhondo ’s confirmation that vuvuzelas would continue to be allowed into World Cup stadia followed weekend reports that officials were considering banning the horns .
Yesterday the England Supporters ’
Band backed the use of the vuvuzela , arguing that ‘ when in Rome ’ the local culture should be respected .
Sheffield - based trumpeter John Hemmingham – who leads the eight - man England orchestra which has not missed a game since 1996 – said the horns were a good thing .
‘It ’s the way South Africans express their joy and pleasure at the tournament being here , ’ he said .
[ caption ]
A recent survey found that the sound emitted by a vuvuzela was the equivalent to 127 decibels - louder than a drum's 122 decibels , or a referee 's whistle at 121.8 decibels .
Vuvuzelas are modern spin-offs of traditional instruments made from spiralling kudu horns .
Van Schalkwyk said he decided to develop a plastic version after spotting the original versions of the horn being blown at games .
They are sold by vendors outside the grounds for the equivalent of £ 2.50 .
The company says it had sold 1.5 million vuvuzelas in Europe since October in addition to the millions it has sold in South Africa .
MUSICAL DESCENDANT OF THE 'KUDU HORN '
The vuvuzela 's musical ancestor is said to be the kudu horn ( pictured ) - ixilongo in isiXhosa , mhalamhala in Tshivenda - blown to summon African villagers to meetings , according to South African tourism chiefs .
Later versions were made of tin .
The trumpet became so popular at football matches in the late 1990s that a company , Masincedane Sport , was formed in 2001 to mass - produce it .
Made of plastic , they come in a variety of colours - black or white for fans of Orlando Pirates , yellow for Kaizer Chiefs , and so on .
There 's uncertainty on the origin of the word ' vuvuzela ' .
Some say it comes from the isiZulu for ' making noise ' .
Others say it 's from township slang related to the word ' shower ' , because it ' showers people with music ' .
Or , more prosaically , looks a little like a shower head .
The announcement , on 15 May 2004 , that South Africa would host the 2010 Fifa World Cup gave the vuvuzela a huge boost , to say the least - some 20 000 were sold on the day by enterprising street vendors .
It 's a noisy thing , so there 's no surprise some do n't like it .
Journalist Jon Qwelane once quipped that he had taken to watching football matches at home - with the volume turned low - because of what he described as ' an instrument of hell ' .
Masincedane Sport expects the tournament will generate sales of up to 20 million rand ( around £ 1.8 million ) .
South African shopkeepers have also reported a boom in earplug sales as visiting fans try to avoid the noise at matches .
Portugal 's Cristiano Ronaldo was the latest World Cup star to voice unease about the trumpet , telling reporters that it affected players ' focus .
' It is difficult for anyone on the pitch to concentrate , ' the Real Madrid star told a press conference .
' A lot of players do n't like them , but they are going to have to get used to them . '
France captain Patrice Evra has blamed the noise for waking the team in their hotel and stopping the players from hearing each other on the pitch .
And Argentina 's Lionel Messi complained they made it impossible for players to communicate on the pitch .
But England defender Jamie Carragher said he 's been asked to take some back .
' My kids have been on the phone and they want two .
I 've got two in my bag already , ' Carragher added .
The vuvuzela also secured support from the England Supporters '
Band as the travelling musicians vowed to compete with the deafening sound of the vuvuzela .
The brass orchestra , which has not missed an England game home or away since 1996 , promised ' the band will play on ' despite the din of the South African horns .
After England took on the US in Rustenburg on Saturday , football pundit Chris Kamara complained the noise was stopping fans from generating chants around the ground .
But Mr Hemmingham said : ' We did n't have any problem .
The fans around us were all singing along .
And a lot of our fans were joining in with us using their vuvuzelas .
It all added to the atmosphere .
' There was definitely a different vibe about the place .
' The South Africans are loving it .
And when in Rome , you just have to go along with it .
' I bet there is not a single South African player complaining about the vuvuzela .
They see it as more than just a noise , it 's about the whole spirit of the thing . '
He added : ' They have certainly created a great new market in ear plugs . '
Travelling England fans are subjected to the vuvuzela not just at the stadiums but also around town , early in the morning and late at night .
Mr Hemmingham said : ' You hear them when you land at the airport , you hear them in the shopping malls , and the streets are full of them - it's a 24 - hour a day experience . '
But England fans at home are being turned off by the annoying buzz .
Research revealed six out of ten fans who watch games at home are now doing so with the volume turned down to cut out the incessant horn - blowing .
[ caption ]
One in four said the noise was ruining their enjoyment of the tournament and seven out of ten want the vuvuzelas banned completely from stadiums .
A string of vuvuzela tales also emerged from the study , including one old lady who rang her cable provider to complain about the ' loud buzzing ' coming from her television .
Another pensioner called pest control in over the weekend amid fears her house was being attacked by a swarm of bees as she watched England draw with the USA .
It also emerged thousands of husbands have been asked to turn the volume down by long - suffering wives due to the infuriating hum which accompanies every game .

In the run-up to the World Cup experts revealed the noise from the vuvuzelas is similar to that generated by a chainsaw
A spokesman for OnePoll.com , which carried out the research said : ' The Vuvuzelas are even more unpopular than Robert Green at the moment .
' They are incredibly annoying .
Walking around the strees you can hear the buzz coming from people 's houses .
' They really are spoiling the enjoyment of the competition for millions of viewers .
' Women are finding them particularly annoying and they are causing people who would have liked to watch games to avoid them because of the noise .
' One respondent said he had watched every game so far with the sound turned down . '
OnePoll carried out the study among 3,000 fans via their iPhones .
Meanwhile , help could be at hand for TV viewers put off by the constant droning - an internet download promises to eliminate the sound from broadcasts .
Fans play the £ 2.45 MP3 file on their HiFi or computer while watching football and it uses ' active noise cancellation ' to silence the horns .
The download generates a series of inverted sound waves that ' clash ' with the waves of the vuvuzela to effectively cancel each other out .
[ caption ]
The download lasts 45 minutes - enough for one half of football - and can be put on repeat for the second half .
The website , antivuvuzelafilter.com , says : ' This is your chance to enjoy the FIFA World Cup 2010 WITHOUT the annoying vuvuzela noise !
' Get rid of the vuvuzela noise through active noise cancellation . '
For maximum effect , antivuvuzelafilter.com say their download should be played through a speaker placed next to the television and set to the same volume .
If done properly it should make the vuvuzelas ' so faint as to be inaudible to human ears ' .
NISKAYUNA , NY — With summer officially beginning this week , the nation 's boyfriends groaned Thursday in anticipation of yet another " Free Event in the Park " season .
" Kelly already wants us to go see some Brazilian horn player and these people who use puppets to make fun of politicians .
I 'm sure they 're fine , but we just got AC this summer , " said Jason Evans , a boyfriend .
" Plus , we go out all the time . "
A spokesperson for the nation 's girlfriends countered that it would be a shame not to take advantage of the tons of cool - sounding cost - free events , which include a craft fair , an outdoor screening of The Wizard Of Oz , and the appearance of a modestly successful mid-90s alternative band at the Tulip Festival .

The softening of a policy criticized as collective punishment of Gaza ’s 1.5 million Palestinians to weaken their hardline Islamist leaders follows an Israeli raid on a blockade - running flotilla in which nine activists died .
The United States quickly welcomed the shift and said President Barack Obama would hold a delayed meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington on July 6 .
Israel ’s old rules banned everything it chose not to let in .
Netanyahu said Israel would “ as quickly as possible ” publish a list of banned goods and all items not on it would be allowed in to the Palestinian territory run by the Hamas Islamist group .
“ Israel seeks to keep out of Gaza weapons and material that Hamas uses to prepare and carry out terror and rocket attacks against Israel and its civilians , ” he said .
“ All other goods will be allowed into Gaza . ”
Israel has been under pressure to ease its blockade since the May 31 raid on ships bringing aid to Gaza .
Israel says the nine Turkish activists killed were waiting to attack Israeli commandos but the outcome sparked an international outcry .
Israel ’s allies , including the United States and the European Union , said the blockade was a failing policy that had become counter - productive and difficult to defend .
Welcoming the change , the White House announced the new date for the U.S. and Israeli leaders to meet .
Netanyahu was supposed to see Obama at the White House on June 1 after of a trip to Canada but canceled to return home after the flotilla raid .
“ Implementation of the policy announced by the government of Israel today should improve life for the people of Gaza and we will continue to support that effort , ” the White House said .
Hamas said the Israeli announcement fell short of international demands to lift the blockade completely .
“ Hamas rejects this decision .
This is an attempt to sap international anger over the blockade on the Gaza Strip , ” Hamas official Ismail Radwan told Reuters by phone from Gaza .
Under the new rules Israel will let in building materials for housing projects approved by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) and supervised by international organizations .
Hamas does not recognize the legitimacy of the PA , based in the West Bank .
The projects included deal with schools , health facilities , water treatment and sanitation , the Israeli statement said .
But it said it would keep the right to ban “ dual-use ” construction materials that it says could be used by Hamas to manufacture weapons and to rebuild its military facilities .
BLAIR
Netanyahu announced the plan together with international Middle East envoy Tony Blair , who had been lobbying Israel to limit its open - ended embargo to a list of specified items .
Blair represents the Quartet of international powers seeking Middle East peace -- the United States , European Union , United Nations and Russia .
He said the best response from Hamas would be to stop attacking Israel and free Gilad Shalit , an Israeli soldier captured and held for four years .
Blair said the increased flow of goods into Gaza would allow for the “ expansion of economic activity ” there .
The United Nations says the blockade has not only deprived the poorest in Gaza of basic needs but suffocated the enclave ’s chances of trading .
It insists building materials be allowed in .
The coastal strip , where 1 million Palestinians depend on aid from the United Nations and other international relief agencies , suffered severe damage in a three - week Israeli offensive launched in December 2008 .
There has been practically no reconstruction since thousands of homes and factories were wrecked .
Israel said it would expand operations at border crossings controlled by its army to allow more goods into Gaza .
It said it would consider opening more border crossings and allow more people in and out of Gaza , if calm persisted along the border .
Israel ’s 2008/09 winter offensive was triggered by incessant rocket fire into Israel from Gaza , which caused few casualties but struck fear into southern Israeli communities .
Israel says it will maintain a sea blockade on Gaza to prevent ships ferrying longer - range rockets to Hamas from its main backer , Iran .
Hamas , which refuses to recognize Israel , seized control of Gaza in 2007 after routing forces loyal to the Fatah movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , who heads the PA .
Hamas is opposed to the current indirect peace talks with Israel , mediated by the Obama administration .

T- Mobile ’s bringing a great gift for Dads and Grads ( I sound like a Target commercial ) this Saturday by offering all of their phones free , but there were still some unpleasant hoops you had to jump through to be eligible .
For the most part , you had to open a new line on a family plan or start a new family plan to get the phone , but Radio Shack ’s got you covered .
They ’ve gone ahead and matched T - Mobile ’s offer , and even made it more lucrative .
You can get all T - Mobile phones for free from their store , too , but you do n’t need to be on a family plan , you do n’t need to deal with rebates , and you do n’t have to deal with any activation fees .
Their only catch is that the offer stands for up to two lines , so adding a third line will cost you .
Regardless , it ’s still a great alternative to T - Mobile ’s official offering .
Radio
Shack ’s really been stepping their game up lately after wanting to boost their presence in the electronics retailer game .
Following their addition of a nickname and an image makeover , they ’ve become a great source for some of the best deals you ’ll find ( in regards to mobile phones , anyway ) .
So what Android phone would you pick up from the Shack this weekend ?
Jio laptop , yes you heard it right .
After the success of new telecom company , broadband , and even Jio phone , now Jio will enter the market with all new Jio laptop .
It has been rumored for a long time but now it will be soon happening .
So what is special about this Jio laptop ?

Israel ’s ambassador to Ireland has postponed a planned appearance at an Oireachtas committee to answer questions about the aid flotilla controversy .
Dr Zion Evrony today cited “ unforeseen circumstances ” for his decision to decline an invitation to address tomorrow ’s scheduled emergency meeting of the Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee .
Committee chairman Michael Woods described the ambassador ’s " eleventh hour volte - face " as “ most disappointing ” .
He said the committee had been anxious to seek answers from Dr Evrony about the Israeli actions against the Gaza aid flotilla .
“ We were also particularly eager to question him regarding his Government ’s intentions concerning the Irish - owned ship the Rachel Corrie , ” he said .
“ This u-turn by an ambassador is almost without precedent and as a committee we are extremely dissatisfied with this action , ” the Fianna Fáil TD said .
“ We feel the ambassador has a responsibility to answer questions in an open and democratic forum .
People want answers , however , unfortunately this opportunity has been lost . ”
Dr Evrony had accepted the invitation on Monday after the Israeli assault on the Turkish aid boat , the Mavi Marmara during which nine people were killed .

Apple 's iOS SDK rules for iPhone developers have relaxed the restriction of section 3.3.2 pertaining to interpreted code , enabling Apple to forbid Flash and other middleware platforms while still enabling popular game engines and libraries .
When the 3.3.2 rules were first published , the restriction stated that iOS apps must be originally written in Objective -C , C , C++ or JavaScript , and that " no interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Appleâs Documented APIs and built - in interpreter ( s ) . ﻿ "
Apple 's goal seemed to be limited to stopping third parties from shifting iPhone developers from using Apple 's own Xcode development tools and instead making them dependent upon their own middleware meta-platforms .
The most obvious example of this was Adobe 's efforts to turn its Flash Professional CS5 application into a product that could export iPhone apps , facilitating cross platform development centered on Flash as a platform rather than Apple 's own Cocoa Touch .
Apple 's 3.3.2 restriction made it clear the company would refuse to sell such apps in its iTunes Store , an insistence the company 's chief executive Steve Jobs later explained as an effort to avoid third party middleware from coming between Apple and its developers and slowing down the pace of the iPhone platform 's ongoing development .
What about Lua ?
However , the wording of the restriction appeared to also target any iOS apps that might include any interpreted code , including a large number of games that make use of general purpose , reusable code engines or libraries to expedite development .
Adobe latched onto this idea to spread fears that any iOS restrictions on development with its
Flash tools would also halt the use of popular game engines or libraries such as Unity 3D and Lua .
Such a situation would imperil many popular iPhone games that Apple has already approved ( and often singled out for targeted promotion ) , including Tap Tap Revenge and Rolando .
The latest modifications to the 3.3.2 section indicate Apple wo n't be forced to dump popular , existing titles just to block middleware meta- platforms as a threat to iOS development .
The most recent wording of the iOS SDK , published by Matt Drance of Apple Outsider , articulates an additional option Apple can invoke when choosing to approve apps :
" Notwithstanding the foregoing , with Appleâs prior written consent , an Application may use embedded interpreted code in a limited way if such use is solely for providing minor features or functionality that are consistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application . ﻿ "
Employees are generally a selfish lot , are n't they ?
They all want more money .
They want more praise and more perks .
They 're really all about themselves , are n't they ?
Well , not really .
Not according to the results of Top Workplaces 2010 .
This website is The Plain Dealer 's first attempt to identify the top places to work in Northeast Ohio , based strictly on the opinions of employees .
It does n't rank companies based on size or revenue or stock price or any other cold , institutional measure .
It 's based only on what employees think about the places they spend most of their lives .
To assess our region 's employers , we enlisted an independent workplace consultant , WorkplaceDynamics of Exton , Pa .
The company surveyed any employer willing to participate ( 50 employees or more ) and selected the top 75 places to work .
What did employees say ?
They said their chief concern is their employers ' health and direction in one of the most challenging economic periods many of us remember .
Sure , employees want to feel appreciated .
But more than that , they want to feel that the people leading their organizations know what they 're doing , that their companies are honest and forthright , and that the future is hopeful .
Perhaps this reflects the economic despair in our region .
When times are tough , you may worry more about keeping your paycheck than you do about the size of it .
In our 25,710 surveys , employees most often used words like " goals , " " respect " and " sharing " to describe what they valued .
Pay , benefits and training , while important , ranked lower .
There 's a lesson here for employers .
Bosses who recognize that employees seek confidence and reassurance will create a happier , more productive work force .
Show employees your plan and stress how important they are to getting there .
One person wrote about an employer , " There is an overwhelming sense of team and working toward a common goal of sharing the future of this company and its success . "
Another wrote , " I feel I am finally at a place where I am proud and happy to come to work and love to tell others about my job . "
When we began Workplace 2010 , we set out first of all to find the best places to work .
But we also wanted to see what they have in common -- how they communicate with employees , the type of environment they create , the way they deal with financial turmoil .
The top employers in Northeast Ohio are a diverse lot : big and small , public and private , new and old -- proof that a desirable workplace has less to do with the type of business and more to do with the people in charge of it .
Those leaders all have one thing in common .
They have found ways to make employees happy to come to work .
Congratulations to all of the employers in Top Workplaces 2010 and to all of the people who work there .

" I know with Russians we always hear about their character issues , but it 's the same for other kids , too , in this draft .
For sure , Kabanov has some issues .
You better do your homework before pulling the trigger on drafting a guy like that . "
-- Gordie Clark
Gordie Clark obviously was n't going to let the world know who the New York Rangers wanted to take with the 10th pick in the 2010 Entry Draft during a conference call Wednesday , but he certainly perked up when Russian right wing Vladimir Tarasenko became the topic of conversation .
The Rangers ' director of player personnel has shown during his eight seasons with the team that he's not afraid to use an early pick on a Russian prospect , despite the looming threat of his selection deciding to play in the KHL .
Clark has overseen the Rangers ' drafts since 2005 - 06 and was instrumental in the team taking center Artem Anisimov in the second round in 2006 , right wing Alexei Cherepanov in the first round in 2007 and left wing Evgeny Grachev in the third round in 2008 .
While Cherepanov died shockingly in 2008 at the age of 19 during a KHL game , Anisimov just completed his first season with the Rangers , and Grachev joined the AHL Hartford Wolf Pack this season .
Clark does n't have the magic recipe for figuring if a Russian player will cross the pond and play in the NHL , but his track record is evidence he has some mind - reading ability .
" We think quite a bit of Tarasenko , " said Clark , who credited Rangers scout Vladimir Lutchenko as one of the biggest reasons for the franchise 's success in Russia .
" You never know .
That 's the thing you have to deal with with Russia .
( Lutchenko ) will have the most updated information on what these guys might be thinking of doing , if they 've signed over there , how many years have they signed for , when do they want to come over .
" As of today , Lutchenko has been ( right ) on Anisimov , on Grachev , and unfortunately we never got to see Cherepanov , but everything he had heard and everything Cherepanov had said , he was on his way over .
He 's been on , so whatever information he 'll have will be the information that we 'll go with .
" Mock drafts vary wildly , but Tarasenko likely will be available when it 's time for the Rangers to make their pick .
Tarasenko will continue to meet with Lutchenko in Russia before Lutchenko flies to New York to meet with Clark and Jeff Gorton , the Rangers ' assistant director of player personnel .
All three will fly to Los Angeles for the Draft , which will be held at Staples Center on June 25 - 26 .
One Russian who has fallen off the first - round radar -- if not the entire draft board -- is forward Kirill Kabanov , who left the Moncton Wildcats during the team 's second game of the QMJHL playoffs , a game Clark and Gorton attended .
According to Clark , Kabanov 's teammates were yelling at him on the bench and he never came back out for the third period .
He was a healthy scratch the next game , and then returned to Russia .
" There 's a lot of talent there , and like all kids here in the draft , we have to do our due diligence about their character , " said Gorton .
" I know with Russians we always hear about their character issues , but it 's the same for other kids , too , in this draft .
For sure , Kabanov has some issues .
You better do your homework before pulling the trigger on drafting a guy like that .
" Should Tarasenko not be available at No. 10 or should the Rangers decide to go in a different direction , perhaps fellow right wings Nino Niederreiter Jeff Skinner or Brett Connolly could be the answer .
Niederreiter is a Switzerland native who played in the WHL this season in an effort to improve his chances of being drafted .
The move worked , as he 's projected as a top - 10 pick after his 36 - goal season with the Portland Winterhawks .
" He 's a goal - scorer and a big body ( 6 - foot - 2 , 203 pounds ) and he 's going to be a good player , " said Gorton .
Connolly dealt with injury issues this season , otherwise he could be in the conversation with likely top two picks Taylor Hall and Tyler Seguin , according to Gorton .
The 6 - foot - 2 , 181 - pounder still produced 10 goals and 9 assists in 16 games with the Prince George Cougars of the WHL .
Skinner , a 50 - goal scorer with the OHL's Kitchener Rangers this season , improved his game by leaps and bounds after scoring just 27 goals in his previous season .
The left - handed shooter is 5 - foot - 10 and 182 pounds , perhaps the only knock on him .
" Skinner 's a goal scorer that 's had a great career in junior and he had a great year , " Gorton said .
" He 's a very good player , a little bit undersized but he 's got pure offensive talent and he 's a natural scorer , maybe one of the best scorers in the draft , so he 's going to be a pretty high pick .
" According to Clark , the Rangers are n't simply entering the draft with the idea of taking the best available player .
They will have a list of " A - rated players " from which they 'd like to draft .
Should those players not be there when it 's time to pick , only then will they instead consider filling a positional need .
" Clearly the two names you hear are Hall and Seguin , for sure are A - players , " said Gorton .
" Then there 's a bit of a fall - off .
It depends on your definition of ' A . '
For us , sometimes there are four , five or seven guys , then it falls off .
I would say there 's two guys clearly better than everybody else , then depending on who you 're talking to , which I guess is us , there 's another 10 guys you can throw a blanket over .
"
If Tarasenko steps off the Rangers ' plane after it lands in Los Angeles draped in a red and blue blanket , fans can get ready for yet another Russian to be brought into the fold .
Apple boss Steve Jobs has defended conditions at a Taiwanese electronics firm that produces the firm 's popular iPhone , following a spate of suicides .
" Foxconn is not a sweatshop , " he told a conference in the US .
Mr Jobs said that Apple representatives were working with Foxconn to find out why 10 workers had killed themselves at a factory in Shenzhen , China .
An eleventh worker recently died at another factory in northern China .
In total , there have been 13 suicides and suicide attempts at Foxconn factories this year .
" We 're all over this , " said Mr Jobs at the All Things Digital conference in California .
You go in this place and it's a factory but , my gosh , they 've got restaurants and movie theatres and hospitals and swimming pools Steve Jobs , Apple CEO
Foxconn has said that it will give its assembly line workers a 30 % pay rise .
The firm had previously said that it would offer a 20 % pay increase to its Chinese workers , who earn 900 yuan ( £ 90 ) per month at entry - level .
" We hope the hike in wages will help improve the living standards of the workers and allow them to have more leisure time , which is good for their health , " an official of Foxconn 's parent company Hon Hai precision told AFP .
Hon Hai Precision is the world 's largest maker of consumer electronics , and employs 800,000 workers worldwide , mostly in China .
Foxconn makes a range of products for manufacturers including Apple , Dell and Nokia .
The deaths have shone a spotlight on working conditions at the factory , where workers - often from rural China - work up to 12 hours a day , six days a week .
But Mr Jobs defended the conditions .
" You go in this place and it 's a factory but , my gosh , they 've got restaurants and movie theatres and hospitals and swimming pools .
For a factory , it 's pretty nice , " he said .
Surreal moment
Mr Jobs addressed a number of other issues at the All Things Digital conference .
Last week , Apple overtook Microsoft to become the world 's largest technology company by market value .
" For those of us that have been in the industry a long time , it 's surreal .
But it does n't matter very much , it 's not what 's important , " Mr Jobs said .
" It 's not what makes you come to work every morning . "
He also claimed that Apple 's controversial move to block Adobe Flash animation and video technology from its popular iPhones and iPads was " a technical decision " .
" We did n't start off to have a war with Flash or anything else , " he said .
The comments are the latest step in a long - running dispute between Apple and Adobe over the Flash platform .
If you give people enough incentive to cheat , people will cheat :
Of all the forms of academic cheating , none may be as startling as educators tampering with children ’s standardized tests .
But investigations in Georgia , Indiana , Massachusetts , Nevada , Virginia and elsewhere this year have pointed to cheating by educators .
Experts say the phenomenon is increasing as the stakes over standardized testing ratchet higher — including , most recently , taking student progress on tests into consideration in teachers ’ performance reviews .
The two biggest barriers I see for people choosing to ignore green principles and continue in a throw away mentality is 1 ) Education 2 ) Ease of change .
People need to understand and it has to be cheep and easy to do --- guess what , It is !!!!!!
Lectures , pamphlets , workshops -- these are all good things -- but seriously lets stop yapping and just start doing and showing .
There is no better way of understanding what and how things can be done then by actually doing it .
By sight , by touch and by participating .
Lets build a demonstration centre on a vacant lot which aims to discover and use alternative building practices .
Elements such as compost toilets , rammed earth , straw bale housing , permaculture principles , biodiesel , mushroom inoculation .
community gardens and home grown food .
We could host events which showcase businesses which recycle certain materials - how do we find them , where can we go , can they come to us ...
We could use rammed earth as our structure and reclaimed wood .
We should develop the centre as a whole community .
It should be open to the public to help build it .
Build events , parties , and festivals at the centre could take place which bring us together in a safe and fun place for people to go .
It should be a Green school - a place for all people to learn , to share , and to understand how to live it , not talk it .
Jubilant Americans mock England goalkeeper Rob Green in virals sweeping the Net
If England goalkeeper Rob Green feels he is n't beating himself up enough over his horror gaffe during last night 's World Cup match , all he has to do is look on the internet .
Gleeful Americans have already began to take the mick out of the hapless keeper in a series of internet virals .
One such viral has Green scrambling to save the ball as it trickes over the line , with the caption : ' Soccer and oil spills : England just can't contain them . '
Green issues : A picture of English keeper Rob Green scrambling for the ball is linked to BP 's handling of the oil spill crisis
Another show 's TouTube celebrity ' OMG Cat ' watching Green 's error with its increasingly horrified expression .
Some others , however , are a little less amusing .
One viral shows a series of idyllic photos of American life - a day at the beach , a pretty woman cooking , cute animals - against images of riots in Britain and burning buildings .
What ?
YouTube sensation OMG Cat , who has been equally astounded by such things as the Tiger Woods scandal and the iPad launch , watches Green 's gaffe
The caption , for reasons known only to the viral artist , reads ' It 's a tie : nobody care here ' .
Rob Green 's nightmare started when Clint Dempsey cleverly spun away from Gerrard on 38 minutes , and sized up to shoot , and drove the ball towards the goal .
As it was not the sweetest strike in the world , most believed Green would scoop it up with little effort .
Not so funny :
This particular viral apparently highlights the difference between lifestyles in the U.S. and Britain
Inexplicably , however , Green fumbled the ball and it trickled into the back of the net .
Green was left to collapse on the ground , his head in his hands , as Dempsey wheeled away in celebration .
It will be an often replayed moment of this year 's World Cup , and one that Green will have to live with - but one that Americans will savour with each viewing .
The American press , for example , went so far as to say that last night 's match was one of the best in World Cup history .
In a breathless critique , The New York Post said : ' In true revolutionary style , the underdog Americans came from behind and blasted the powerful Brits to a nail - biting 1 - 1 draw yesterday , in one of the all - time great World Cup soccer battles . '
And this is only one day after the gamer .
Expect the virals to continue .

Okay , it really would n’t help me score less than a 35 handicap , but this Batman golf cart would definitely cheer me up the next time I four - putt , or ca n’t hit past the ladies ’ tee box .
This his undeniably great Tumbler - inspired golf cart was recently spotted on the Warner Bros. studio lot .
Originally thought to be owned by Christopher Nolan , it turns out the cart is actually the work of a serious Batman superfan , who just happens to work at the studio .
Still , Nolan should be duly impressed with the build quality of this mutant golf cart , which looks very much like Batmans ’ Tumbler vehicle .

The sleek and sexy - looking GOCE satellite has provided a new , finely detailed look at Earth ’s gravity – in high definition .
This is the first - ever global gravity model and is based on just two months of data from the low - flying GOCE .
“ GOCE is delivering where it promised : in the fine spatial scales , ” GOCE Mission Manager Rune Floberghagen said .
“ We have already been able to identify significant improvements in the high - resolution ‘ geoid ’ , and the gravity model will improve as more data become available . ”
GOCE stands for Gravity field and steady - state Ocean Circulation Explorer .
The geoid is a measure of the lumps and bumps in Earth ’s gravity , and shows how the surface would look if an ocean covered the earth , also known as surface of equal gravitational attraction and mean sea level .
Scientists say it is a crucial reference for accurately measuring ocean circulation , sea - level change and ice dynamics – all affected by climate change .
The GOCE team presented their initial data at ESA ’s Living Planet Symposium .
ESA launched GOCE in March 2009 , and the data is from November and December 2009 .
“ Over continents , and in particular in regions poorly mapped with terrestrial or airborne techniques , we can already conclude that GOCE is changing our understanding of the gravity field , ” said Floberghagen .
Over major parts of the oceans , the situation is even clearer , as the marine gravity field at high spatial resolution is for the first time independently determined by an instrument of such quality . ”
This will greatly improve our knowledge and understanding of the Earth ’s internal structure , and will be used as a much - improved reference for ocean and climate studies , including sea - level changes , oceanic circulation and ice caps dynamics survey .
Numerous applications are expected in climatology , oceanography and geophysics .
“ The computed global gravity field looks very promising .
We can already see that important new information will be obtained for large areas of South America , Africa , Himalaya , South - East Asia and Antarctica , ” said Prof. Reiner Rummel from Technische Universität München , Chairman of the GOCE Mission Advisory Group .
“ With each two - month cycle of data , the gravity model will become more detailed and accurate .
I am convinced that the data will be of great interest to various disciplines of Earth sciences . ”
The spacecraft can measure accelerations as small as 1 part in 10,000,000,000,000 of the gravity experienced on Earth .
GOCE flies in orbit at just 254.9 km ( 158 miles ) mean altitude – the lowest orbit sustained over a long period by any Earth observation satellite , but the lower the altitude , the better the data .
The residual air at this low altitude causes the orbit of a standard satellite to decay very rapidly .
So , to counteract the drag , the satellite fires an ion thruster using xenon gas , maintaining its orbit .
This ensures the gravity sensors are flying as though they are in pure freefall , so they pick up only gravity readings and not the disturbing effects from other forces .
To obtain clean gravity readings , there can be no disturbances from moving parts , so the entire satellite is a single extremely sensitive measuring device .
The new map is just from the first data , and more information will be forthcoming .
In May , ESA made available the first set of gravity gradients and ‘ high - low satellite - to - satellite tracking ’ to scientific and non-commercial users – and much more will come in the following months .

JOHANNESBURG , South Africa — Irene Mokwatu , 53 , wears a plastic garbage bag wrapped around her waist to protect her dress from the dust she is sweeping off the street .
" I was born here , " says Mokwatu , 53 .
" This World Cup will not benefit us , they wo n't even let us sell mautuana during the cup . "
She leans over , with a big smile , to make sure I spell the word right .
" Mautuana is what we Africans like to eat when we see football .
It is salted chicken 's feet and livers , " she says with a conspiratorial gleam in her eye .
She is sweeping in the shadow of Ellis Park stadium , where several of the World Cup games will be played in the center of Johannesburg .
Despite some obvious makeovers , the neighborhood looks poor , even slightly dangerous .
A few shops are open , others are shuttered .
Some homeless people are gathered around a sidewalk can fire to ward off the chill from the Southern Hemisphere winter .
In six weeks the kickoff will happen at Soccer City and South Africa is busy getting ready to host the World Cup .
Accommodation is filling up and nearly every ticket for the matches has been sold .
For the first time since the United States hosted the tournament , every game is sold out .
But many local business owners feel they have been left out in the cold over the World Cup .
The nearby shopkeepers are worried about reports that the Federation of International Football Associations ( FIFA ) and the Johannesburg city council will not permit shops to be open during World Cup game days .
They have not been contacted by the Johannesburg city council or FIFA about trading during game - days , according to several shop owners .
Some , like Rene Edropia , who runs the Edropia and Grace Trading shop , opened their businesses with the express purpose of catering to football fans .
At his shop , fans can use the internet , call cheaply all over the world , buy snacks and fix their cell phones .
" If they wo n't let us trade during the World Cup , then we can't pay our rent .
It 's that simple , " he said , putting his elbows on the glass counter , looking concerned .
" When they decide if we can trade or not , they have to send us an official notice , we have received nothing so far . "
It 's a rough neighborhood , and the police stand close together as if fearful of their safety .
The officers say they have no idea if the area will be closed to trading during games , but outside of this poor and depressed neighborhood , a national debate is taking place .
Front - page stories in South African newspapers reported about recently published by - laws that FIFA required the government to pass .
The wide - ranging regulations surrounding World Cup games restrict everything from hanging laundry out to dry , to who can ride a horse and whether someone like Mokwatu can sell her mautuana .
Behind this situation on a poor urban street is another , more disturbing picture of FIFA 's strict policy it is exerting over this country , even at the highest levels .
In the report , “ Player and Referee : Conflicting interests and the 2010 FIFA World Cup , ” published in April by the Pretoria - based Institute for Security Studies , is a book written by six investigative journalists that uncovers some of the back - room dealings in the run-up to Africa 's first World Cup .
The report alleges that officials indulged in questionable business practices including overpricing of services for visitors .
It charges that a lack of transparency in business dealings between the government , FIFA and the private sector made corrupt practices commonplace .
For instance it charges that proper procedures were not followed in awarding the tender to build the Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg where the opening match will be played .
Throughout the country there is widespread discontent with FIFA and how the sports extravaganza has been sold to a country that will struggle to pay for it .
At the Cape Town Press Club this week , author and investigative reporter Andrew Jennings talked about corruption in FIFA .
His book , “ Foul !
The Secret World of FIFA : Bribes Vote Rigging and Ticket Scandals ” exposes many of FIFA 's practices .
Jennings suggests that FIFA operates like an organized crime set - up and he quotes from past a FIFA court case pressed by VISA and MasterCard , who alleged in their Manhattan court statement that “ any company should have grave concerns about doing business with FIFA ... [ where ] lying and deception and bad faith are standard operating procedure . ”
But David Wilt — homeless and standing next to a sidewalk fire can to stay warm in the morning rain — wondered how he will benefit from the World Cup .
Wilt said he has been on the street for three months living in front of the place from which he was evicted , a scant hundred feet from Ellis Park Stadium .
" All the people of this area , they wo n't benefit , but the rich people will .
Sepp Blatter ( president of FIFA ) does not want to see us , so they will clean us up off the street , ” he said , and his friends mutter in agreement as they feed another piece of cardboard into the fire .
" We have no hope . "
In case anyone is questioning it , celebrities are terribly concerned about the Gulf of Mexico .
Actor Sean Penn has said he " cares about New Orleans . "
Actor Brad
Pitt has spent days in the region assisting with relief efforts .
And Jamie Foxx has raised more than half a million dollars to help those living in the area put their lives back together .
Oh , wait :
That was in 2005 , in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina — when George W. Bush was president .
Back then we saw A - listers come out in droves to shout about the man in charge , draw attention to the need for assistance and help marshal resources in the relief effort .
Angelina Jolie , who has often mentioned her love of New Orleans in interviews , sent letters to members of Congress and the White House .
Penn visited the wreckage on a tugboat , with a shotgun ( photographer in tow ) .
John Travolta personally flew supplies to the area on his private jet , while dozens of more famous faces donated to and participated in a nationally aired telethon .

Biodiversity is starting to be become another buzz word like green products and carbon footprints .
Biodiversity is the variation of life forms within a given ecosystem or on the entire Earth .
Biodiversity is often used as a measure of the health of biological systems .
The biodiversity found on Earth today consists of many millions of distinct biological species .
The year 2010 has been declared as the International Year of Biodiversity .
One of the market instruments to offset environmental damage is sort of biodiversity offsetting , or bio-compensation .
Quite simply , if a developer is going to build something that will damage or destroy a habitat of conservation value then they must buy a â€˜bio - creditâ€™ to compensate for that loss elsewhere .
Of all species that have ever existed on Earth , 99.9 percent are now extinct .
Since life began on Earth , five major mass extinctions have led to large and sudden drops in the biodiversity of species .
Over a period of 400 million years several periodic , massive losses of biodiversity occurred which are called as mass extinction events .
The most recent , the Cretaceousâ € “ Tertiary extinction event , occurred 65 million years ago , and has attracted more attention than all others because it killed the dinosaurs .
Today there is concern that the period since the emergence of humans is part of a mass reduction in biodiversity , the Holocene extinction , caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment , particularly the destruction of plant and animal habitats .
The relevance of biodiversity to human health is becoming a major international issue , as scientific evidence is gathered on the global health implications of biodiversity loss .
One of the key human health issues associated with biodiversity is that of new drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources .
A significant proportion of drugs are derived , directly or indirectly , from biological sources .
The reservoir of genetic traits present in wild varieties has been and will be important in improving crop performance .
Important crops , such as the potato and coffee , are often derived from only a few genetic strains .
When a crop needs improvement in yield or ti improve disease resistance , the wild versions have been found to be vital at times .
Examples include :
The Irish potato blight of 1846 , which was a major factor in the deaths of a million people and migration of another million , was the result of planting only a limited number of potato genetic varieties .
When the blight ( a fungus ) struck it found no genetic resistance to its spread .
When rice grassy stunt virus struck rice fields from Indonesia to India in the 1970s , 6273 other varieties were tested for resistance .
Only one was found to be resistant , an Indian variety , known to science only since 1966 .
This variety formed a hybrid with other varieties and is now widely grown .
Coffee rust attacked coffee plantations in Sri Lanka , Brazil , and Central America in 1970 .
A resistant variety was found in Ethiopia .
Monoculture , the lack of biodiversity , was a contributing factor to several other agricultural disasters in history such as the European wine industry collapse in the late 1800s , and the US Southern Corn Leaf Blight epidemic of 1970 .
One of the problems with biodiversity is measuring how much there is .
What is enough ?
Is it based on number of species ?
On available land or water ?
The idea is not new .
In the US there has been for decades some variation of a wetland banking scheme where public or private developers restore , establish or enhance an aquatic resource to compensate for any unavoidable damage they cause during property development .
Typically more wetlands must be created for any wetland acreage lost to development .
In Europe there is a growing movement to set up a biodiversity market credit system .
As noted the problem is to set a value and to measure the result .
The value of such a bio credit system is that it sets some economic value which is easier to measure and understand .
Targets to halt biodiversity loss are not working as well as desired .
This failure is blamed in part on the lack of value that decision makers place on nature and the benefits it provides humans .
The growing tendency is to place a value on biodiversity resources which will lead to new , market based ideas about how to stop and even reverse biodiversity loss in Europe and the United Kingdom .
One of those market instruments is biodiversity offsetting , or bio-compensation .
Quite simply , if a developer is going to build something that will damage or destroy a habitat of conservation value then they must buy a bio credit to compensate for that loss elsewhere .
( This is identical in concept to the US based wetlands compensation system . )
None of this establishes what biodiversity is .
What it does is attempt to give it a financial value so that it can be measured .

In order to monitor the effects of alcohol on the nation 's health , many emergency departments now have a little tick - box on the computer that politely asks " Alcohol - related ? " when you discharge a patient from the system .
Other than publishing them annually and tutting loudly , no - one really knows what to do with these figures , but at least we can now collect the data more efficiently .
I want the default setting of the tick - box changed , so you have to un - tick the box of patients whose problem was not related to alcohol .
I think it would save time .
It 's easy to imagine how you think alcohol would impact on an emergency department – binge drink - fuelled violence is the typical image .
But while the effects are indeed huge , they are often a lot more complex than that getting your face broken on a Saturday night .
Take the following real cases , from my own personal experience , over a recent two - day period .
There was the guy who had fallen off a chair and was so uncooperative that we could not get decent x-rays of his neck , which we suspected he had injured .
" Combative " drunks are difficult to deal with for all sorts of reasons , not least that sometimes their behaviour is not down to drink , but down to a head injury .
Miss that and you can end up on the sharp end of a coroner 's inquest .
We eventually managed to get a CT scan of this man 's neck , which he had indeed broken .
Thankfully it was a stable , self - healing type of break , as long as he takes care of himself for a few weeks .
Getting drunk and falling over would be the obvious sort of thing to avoid here .
So fingers crossed .
Then there was the 19 - year - old East European immigrant admitted overnight after being found insensibly drunk .
He was being " disruptive " on the ward .
By " disruptive " , I mean grabbing all the tubs of alcohol - based hand - gel found everywhere in hospitals these days and necking the contents .
We managed to find a place for him at a homeless persons ' hostel .
Last I heard he had absconded and checked himself into a neighbouring emergency department , no doubt with the intention of drinking it dry .
Next was the 40 - year - old almost crippled by peripheral neuropathy .
This condition can be brought on by excess alcohol , which slowly pickles your nervous system , starting with the longest , most vulnerable nerves .
So you end up with feet that feel like they 're done up in bubble wrap and look like they 're in the charge of a pissed puppeteer .
After coming round from an alcohol - induced seizure , he was well enough to go home .
The problem was that he lived in a first - floor flat and could n't negotiate the stairs unless we arranged a two - person ambulance .
We 'd already established that he was on a minimum of a litre of vodka a day at present , so I wondered just how that worked out for someone house - bound by a flight of steps .
Thank goodness for the internet .
His first job of every day was to log on and order his vodka , which arrived by lunch - time .
Delivered , free of extra charge , right to the door .
Alcohol does strange things to you .
As illustrated in a recent government TV campaign , it fuels confidence whilst simultaneously sapping ability and judgment .
It makes people do stupid things .
Like trying to light a barbecue with petrol ; petrol that you 've decided to keep handy in a slightly leaky plastic drinks bottle in your jacket .
In this case , the effects of alcohol extended into the emergency room , where the victim decided that he could manage the full - thickness burns on his chest himself , thanks all the same , and took his own discharge against medical advice ( and perhaps more tellingly , girlfriend 's advice ) .
With calamine lotion being such a poor substitute for skin grafting , he was back 48 hours later : sober , apologetic , and with burns so badly infected he nearly succumbed to full - blown septicaemia .
Booze does strange things to your body , as well as your psyche .
These effects become more apparent when you move on from the binge drinkers to the more serious , stay - at - home , dedicated consumers .
The liver has the job of breaking down alcohol .
It has plenty of other things to do as well , such as producing blood clotting agents and draining almost the entire blood supply from the digestive system to metabolise your food .
Once your consumption of alcohol goes above a certain level , the liver diverts nearly all its resources into dealing with the onslaught .
Push it even further and the liver cells themselves start to get damaged , eventually leading to that famous companion of chronic excess drinking , cirrhosis .
A cirrhotic liver is difficult to pump blood through .
Pressure in blood vessels within the liver rises , eventually leading to widening of veins inside the gullet .
These " oesophageal varices " are pretty much as they sound – varicose veins in your oesophagus .
When they burst , they bleed .
A lot .
And by the time varices have developed , the degree of liver damage established means the blood is not clotting as it should .
Bleeding oesophageal varices used to be something I only saw in middle - aged heavy drinkers .
Last week I saw it in a 25 - year - old .
We managed to replace some of the lost blood , but his clotting was so deranged that the bleeding was eventually unstoppable .
He died later that day , bleeding profusely from both ends of his digestive system .
Talking of blood , the ambulance service have just fetched in a very , very drunk man , who has a head wound , has already punched a paramedic and is thrashing around the trolley spraying blood in all directions .
It 's 10 am on a weekday morning .
Someone thinks the man may be " Hep C positive " , hepatitis C being one of the nastier and more easily transmitted blood - borne viral infections .
You do n't want a splash of fresh blood in your eyes or mouth if you can help it , especially as there is no vaccine and little effective treatment against Hep C. Somewhere there is a pair of goggles and a splash - proof face mask .
While someone finds them , the rest of us draw lots .
The lucky winner gets to stitch the patient 's head up .
Less dramatic – but just as much of a therapeutic challenge – was the woman in her mid-thirties desperate to stop drinking .
Emergency departments tend to be the last stop of many who are trying to get help .
So when this woman 's GP refused to prescribe medication to help her reduce her drinking , when she had been told there was a six - week wait to see an alcohol counsellor – and when she discovered how much it costs to book yourself in to a private clinic – she ended up with us .
What she needed and needed desperately was an in - patient detox bed .
The acute physical withdrawal ( not only unpleasant , but with alcohol , sometimes fatal ) can be managed at the same as starting psychological treatments and putting in place strategies to address long - term abstinence .
In - patient detox beds simply do n't exist in my area , nor in many parts of the NHS .
So we fudged things .
She pretended to have a fit and I got her admitted to an acute medical bed .
A tiny victory over the system and the beginning of the start of her recovery .
Hopefully .
It 's cases like these – young people with horrible but preventable disease , that I can't help bringing to mind when adverts for alcohol pop up on the telly .
Obviously it 's against the rules to suggest that drinking will make you sexy , but you can be pretty sure you 'll be surrounded by some fantastic - looking young people if you buy the right brands of booze .
None of these people appear to be jaundiced , or to have fallen over in the street and smashed some teeth out , or to have drowned in their own vomit , but that 's because they follow the advice in the corner of the screen , and enjoy their alcohol " sensibly " .
What you never see advertised are the increasing number of cheap products sold by the plastic - bottled litre or two , rather than in chic 75 cl glassware .
Supermarket own - brand vodka , that nobody ever drank with anything other than the determination of getting quickly and comprehensively smashed ; the garishly - labelled white cider , or the weird mixtures of fruit juices and ethanol and the tonic wines like the notorious " commotion lotion " Buckfast Wine , popular north of the border , where the world 's strongest beer ( 32 per cent abv ) has also been launched .
There 's an already well - rehearsed argument when it comes to alcohol pricing – minimum pricing being the latest policy being considered by the current government – and it's easy to predict who will say what .
" Health " campaigners say cheap alcohol encourages drinking by youngsters and that supermarkets even use cheap booze as a loss leader to promote other sales .
But it 's hard to dodge the apparent subliminal message here , which is that it 's only poor people who drink dangerously ; something which is patently untrue .
The " alcohol lobby " maintains that it is unfair to penalise the less well - off by introducing minimum prices , especially given that it is only small percentage of those who drink that have problems .
Trying to control the use of alcohol through its price does feel a little like " prohibition lite " and doomed to failure .
I have yet to meet a smoker who decides to quit because of the cost .
Having said that , put me in charge for a day and I would increase the tax on alcohol slightly .
Not to deter the drinker , but to raise money specifically for the treatment of alcohol dependency .
Detox clinics and liver transplants are prohibitively expensive .
I can see that the big names in the drinks industry would rather sponsor prestigious sporting events than have their name associated with treatment facilities , but when your liver starts to fail , or you reach that rock bottom that many addicts need before they seek recovery , you do n't need to go to a rugby match , or watch some horse racing .
You need quality help ; help which someone has to pay for .

Alcohol : how much is too much ?
* Government guidelines recommend that men limit their consumption of alcohol to 21 units a week and women to 14 units .
Estimates suggest that one in three men and one in seven women in the UK exceed these safe guidelines .
* Research indicates that 80 per cent of people are misinformed about these guidelines .
Further problems emerge with the measurement of a unit – a glass of wine can contain between one and three units , depending on the wine and the size of the glass .
* Prolonged drinking puts huge strain on the liver , often leading to cirrhosis , caused by build - up of scar tissue on the organ .
A number of cancers are more common among drinkers .
* In the shorter term , alcohol also prompts the production of excess acid in the stomach , causing irritation to the digestive system which results in pain , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In heavy drinkers the effects may be amplified , causing inflammation of the stomach 's lining and bleeding may result .
* Heavy drinking has been linked with anxiety , depression , memory loss and dementia .

Aquaman vs BP by Rob Kelly @ The Aquaman Shrine
This NASA graphic shows where to look in the constellation Aquarius for the Eta Aquarid meteor shower , which is made of the remains from Halley 's Comet .
Full May 2010 viewing info .
It 's been 24 years sinceHalley 's Comet last passed through the inner solar system , but remnants fromthe icy wanderer will light up the dawn sky this week in the Eta Aquarid meteorshower .
The meteorshower is predicted to peak early on Thursday morning , May 6 .
Underideal conditions ( a dark , moonless sky ) about 40 of these very swift meteorscan be seen per hour .
The shower appears at about one - quarter peak strength forabout three or four days before and after May 6 .
The famous Halley 's Comettakes roughly 76 years to circle the sun and last passed through our cosmicneighborhood in 1986 .
Halley 's orbit closely approaches the Earth 's orbit intwo spots , offering two chances each year to see meteor showers left over fromthe comet 's cosmic " litter . "
One point is in the middle tolatter part of October , producing a meteor display known as the Orionids .
The other point comes in the early part of May , producing the Eta Aquarids .
When and Where to Watch
There are , however , two drawbacksif you plan to watch for the Eta Aquarids meteors this year .
[ Meteor shower map . ]
First , there is the moon , whichwill be at Last Quarter on the peak morning and will likely " musclein " on the fainter meteor streaks by brightening the early morningsky with its bright light .
The other obstacle ?
at least forthose watching from north of the equator ?
is that the radiant ( theemanation point of these meteors ) is at the " Water Jar " of theconstellation Aquarius , which comes above the southeast horizon around 3 a.m.local daylight time , never gets very high as seen from north temperatelatitudes , so the actual observed rates are usually much lower thanthe oft - quoted 40 per hour .
In North America , typical ratesare 10 meteors per hour at 26 - degrees north latitude , half this at 35 - degreeslatitude and practically zero north of 40 - degrees .
Conversely , those who live in the Southern Hemisphere , where Aquarius rises much higher into the sky , considerthis to be one of the best meteor showers of the year .
Catch an Earthgrazer
For most , perhaps the besthope is catching a glimpseof a meteor emerging from the radiant that will skim the atmospherehorizontally ?
much like a bug skimming the side window of an automobile .
Meteor watchers call such shooting stars " Earthgrazers . "
They leavecolorful , long - lasting trails .
" These meteors are extremelylong , " said Robert Lunsford , of the International Meteor Organization .
"
They tend to hug the horizon rather than shooting overhead where mostcameras are aimed . "
" Earthgrazers are rarelynumerous , " cautions Bill Cooke , a member of the Space Environments team atthe Marshall Space Flight Center .
" But even if you only see a few , you 'relikely to remember them . "
Comet Crumbs
If you do catch sight of one earlythese next few mornings , keep in mind that you 'll likely be seeing theincandescent streak produced by material which originated from the nucleusof Halley 's Comet .
When these tiny bits of thecomet collide with Earth , friction with our atmosphere raises them to whiteheat and produces the effect popularly referred to as " shootingstars . "
So it is that the shooting starsthat we have come to call the Eta Aquarids are really an encounterwith the traces of a famous visitor from the depths of space and from the dawnof creation .

Three experts working to defuse a bomb from the second world war were killed when the device exploded , injuring six others , police said today .
Some 7,000 residents from the central German town of Göttingen , where the 500kg bomb was found , were still being evacuated when it blew up late on Tuesday .
Construction workers had found the device about six metres below the ground where the city is building a sports arena .
The three dead men , aged 38 to 55 , were experienced in defusing bombs and it was not clear why it exploded , Göttingen police president Robert Kruse said at a press conference today .
He said two other experts were severely injured and four others were treated for shock ..
City spokesman Detlef Johannson said the team was still preparing to remove the detonator when the bomb exploded .
Unexploded bombs from Allied bombardments and the first world war are found regularly in Germany .
Only a few days before , another bomb found in Göttingen was successfully defused .
Every German state has dozens of specialists trained to defuse old bombs , and accidents are rare .
Hundreds of police and firefighters are usually involved in helping evacuate people before experts attempt to make safe a bomb .
A Toronto software developer responsible for a browser plug - in to block Justin Bieber news has received death threats for his creation .
Fans of the 16 - year - old singer have flooded programmer Greg Leuch 's inbox with complaints about the program , which he has posted publicly on his website .
Alex , 15 , wrote : " I just wanted to give you the heads - up that you will have MANY people that are enraged with you .
I 'm talking 5,000,000 .
Me included .
" I realise that you 're just stating an opinion , but what you 're doing is going back to World War II all over again .
Hitler wanting to erase Jews from society - you want to erase Justin Bieber . "
Leuch said that he created the application in six hours after his friends complained about the frequency of Bieber 's presence in their online browsing .
" One said , ' Dude , you have to do something so I can quit seeing Justin Bieber online ' .
I was like , ' Damn , I can do this ' , " he told the Toronto Sun .

I do n't care what you say .
I know God exists because I have felt His presence in my life .
Atheists do n't need churches or anything like them .
I 'm happy to be done with church .
Atheism is n't an issue that you can build community around .
You do n't see me joining groups for people who do n't believe in unicorns !
Over the last few years , I have written quite a bit about the importance of atheist community .
I have argued that we need a secular community , applauded the growth of atheist groups across the world , and suggested that we could learn much from other successful movements .
This is important stuff because we have strength in numbers and because those who would do us harm count on our disorganization and apathy .
In this post , I 'd like to address what has been one of our primary obstacles and suggest a way through it .
How many times has a religious believer dismissed your well - reasoned arguments and solid evidence with a simple appeal to personal experience ?
Have n't we all heard this response more times than we can count ?
We know that this is not a valid refutation of anything and that personal experience ( i.e. , revelation ) is a lousy indicator of reality .
Some of us have even considered this a sign of a primitive mind at work .
Unfortunately , none of that stops us from making a similar mistake when it comes to discussions of how best to build community among atheists .
Not surprisingly , our version of the appeal to personal experience is quite a bit different .
It is so different that we may not even recognize the similarity .
See if you can spot the problems with the following :
So because you do n't personally miss anything about church , no atheist could possibly feel differently ?
I have had several atheists tell me about how they miss some of the social aspects associated with church and would love to have something like that for the secular community .
How about this one ?
So because you do not have any interest in getting together with others to discuss religion or how best to respond to it in a safe environment , others could n't possibly find that appealing ?
When people who do not believe in unicorns begin to face widespread discrimination and bigotry simply because they do not believe in unicorns , then this analogy might work .
Until then , not so much !
As someone who is " not a joiner " and who is in fact more of a misanthrope than he'd care to admit , I get the reluctance all too well .
But here 's the thing : I know I 'm atypical in many ways , and I 'm not going to make the mistake of failing to support a strong atheist community simply because I might not personally have much interest in some of the things that community does .
I think it is great that there is talk about holding atheist unity conventions .
It is unlikely that you 'll see me at one anytime soon , but I 'll do what I can to support them and similar efforts .
One of the ways each of us can help the atheist community is by asking ourselves a question whenever someone brings up an idea that we do n't immediately love :
Do I really think that is a bad idea , or is it just that I personally would n't have any interest in doing that ?
We atheists are a diverse group .
There are those among us who miss something about church and those who do n't .
There are those among us long to congregate with atheists to talk about the challenges of living as an atheist or simply mock the superstitious and those who would view such activities as counterproductive .
It is easy to sit on the sidelines and throw stones but so much more valuable to roll up one 's sleeves and jump in .
David Green normally only accessed his company ’s online bank account from his trusty Mac laptop .
Then one day this April while he was home sick , Green found himself needing to authorize a transfer of money out of his firm ’s account .
Trouble was , he ’d left his Mac at work .
So he decided to log in to the company ’s bank account using his wife ’s Windows PC .
Unfortunately for Green , that PC was the same computer his kids used to browse the Web , chat , and play games online .
It was also the same computer that organized thieves had already compromised with a password - stealing Trojan horse program .
A few days later , the crooks used those same credentials to steal nearly $ 100,000 from the company ’s online accounts , sending the money in sub- $ 10,000 and sub -$ 5,000 chunks to 14 individuals across the United States .
Now , Green ’s firm — DKG Enterprises , a party supplies firm based in Oklahoma City — is wrangling with its bank over who should pay for the loss , said Joe Dunn , the company ’s controller .
So far , DKG has managed to recover just $ 22,000 of the $ 98,000 stolen in the April 27 incident .
Unlike consumers , businesses that lose money as a result of stolen online banking credentials usually are left holding the bag .
As such , I ’ve frequently advised small business owners to avoid banking on Windows systems , since all of the malicious software currently being used by these criminals to steal e-banking credentials simply fails to run on anything other than Windows .
What ’s more , the tools these crooks are using — mainly the Zeus Trojan — almost always outpace anti-virus detection at least by a few days , and by then it ’s usually too late .
But the advice about banking on a dedicated , non-Windows machine only works if you follow it all the time .
As this incident shows , it does no good for small business owners to use a Live CD or a Mac or some other approach only some of the time .
“ He knew better than that , ” Dunn said of his boss ’s logging into the family Windows machine .
“ The thing about it is this would n’t have been able to happen if the security had been place that is currently in place , which means he can only access the bank ’s site from his Mac .
We no longer allow access from any other computer other than his . ”
Dunn said that not long after the fraudulent transfers were sent out , he heard from one of the money mules that were sent the firm ’s money and asked to wire it overseas to the fraudsters .
“ This guy , he went to go use his debit card to fill up his car at a gas station and his card was declined , ” Dunn said .
“ He was trying to figure out what had happened , so he researched where the money came from , went online and called the first number he could find and of course he got me .
All I could do is refer him to the FBI .
I think he ’d figured out by that point what had happened . ”
Dunn added the company ’s bank is disavowing any responsibility for the incident , but that there is a small silver lining .
“ Our take is we were n’t provided the utmost security to prevent this from happening , ” he said .
“ It ’s sad in this day and age , and we ’ll probably have to take it as a hard lesson learned .
On the bright side , though , the owner ’s wife now has a new Mac . ”

NILES , Mich . -
An out - of - work Michigan woman shot herself in the hope she 'd receive medical treatment for a shoulder injury .
Kathy Myers says she injured the shoulder a month ago while playing with her dogs .
The 41 - year - old Niles resident says she 's been unable to see a specialist because she can't afford health insurance .
So Myers shot herself on Thursday .
She was released from the hospital a few hours later .
Myers tells WSBT - TV in South Bend , Ind. , she has " no suicide wish . "
She says her life is n't great " right now , but I want to live . "
Myers says she would n't do it again and now is searching for a specialist who will accept a payment plan she can afford .
The prosecutor 's office is going to decide whether Myers will face charges for firing a weapon within city limits .
The great American poet Robert Frost died in 1963 , when he was 88 years old .
But he wrote his epitaph more than two decades before that , in a poem titled “ The Lesson for Today . ”
Frost first unveiled and recited the poem on June 20 , 1941 , at an event celebrating the anniversary of Harvard University ’s Phi Beta Kappa Society .
In 1942 , it was published in the book A Witness Tree , a collection of his recent poetry .
“ The Lesson for Today ” is not one of Frost ’s more accessible poems .
It ’s an imaginary discussion in verse with the Medieval scholar Alcuin of York and it includes a number of obscure literary and historical references .
( The kinds of references people like Harvard Phi Beta Kappa graduates might know . )
“ I hold your doctrine of Memento Mori
And were an epitaph to be my story ,
I ’d have a short one ready for my own .
I would have written of me on my stone :
I had a lover ’s quarrel with the world . ”
It ’s unclear whether Frost truly planned for that last line to be his real epitaph when he wrote it .
However , over the next two decades , it became increasingly associated with him .
Public awareness of the line was especially enhanced by its use in the title of a widely - seen documentary about Frost released shortly before his death — Robert Frost : A Lover ’s Quarrel with the World .
When Frost died , his family had it inscribed on the headstone of his grave in Bennington , Vermont .
You can see it there above the name of his wife , Elinor , who died a quarter of a century before him in 1938 .
For her epitaph , Frost had chosen the words “ TOGETHER WING TO WING AND OAR TO OAR , ” a romantic line from a poem he wrote in 1936 for his daughter ’s wedding , titled “ The Master Speed . ”
Below his name on the headstone are the words that became a famous summation of Robert Frost ’s own life : “ I HAD A LOVER ’S QUARREL WITH THE WORLD . ”

Rachel Shukert 's moving essay about defending Courtney Love after Kurt Cobain 's death — and the resulting treatment from her peers because of that choice — is a poignant reminder of how it feels when you do n't stand up for someone .
Shukert was in eighth grade when Cobain died , and on shaky social ground .
But when the kids she hung out with responded to his suicide not only by blaming Courtney Love , but by saying " I hope she gets raped , " Shukert took a stand .
She reflected ,
It took a special kind of guts to be a fuck - up as a woman , I thought .
To say to hell with being a nice girl , the responsible one , the one who makes sure the man takes care of himself and eats properly and does n't take too many drugs .
To be just as nihilistic and self - destructive as a man , knowing all along that you 'll get crucified for it , because somehow , the world will make everything your fault .
He 'll be a martyr , and you 'll be a succubus .
He 'll be a genius , and you 'll be a groupie .
He 'll be a hero , and you 'll be an ugly fat crack whore who deserves to die .

And so Shukert she acted , telling her friends , " That 's a disgusting thing to say .
She lost her husband .
She 's a widow , with a baby .
This is n't her fault . "
The other kids called her a " poseur , " but Shukert remembers the event as a moment of nascent feminism ( her essay also appears in an anthology of such moments ) .
I had a similar opportunity to defend another woman ( well , girl , really ) in middle school , but I remember it far less fondly .
Like Shukert , and like many people , I keenly felt my social awkwardness at that age , and I pretty much wanted to be liked at any cost .
But not all my friends felt this way .
When a girl I 'll call Beth found out about another , more popular girl stealing from a classmate , she committed the ultimate social suicide : tattling .
The other kids immediately shunned her .
I could have chosen friendship over social expediency , continuing to sit with her at lunch and talking to her in the halls and generally refusing to cave to the nastiest kind of unspoken peer pressure .
Instead , I started ignoring her too .

This choice may have saved me from total social ostracism , but it did n't make me cool — I never penetrated the popular crowd — and it certainly did n't make me right .
And while Beth 's situation was n't the same as Love 's — she was n't being blamed for the actions of a man — she was still the victim of a depressing truth about human social behavior : it 's far easier to stand with the ostracizers than with the ostracized .
Exclusion happens to boys and men , too , of course , but the small social misstep or shift in power that leaves you on the outs forever remains more of a female narrative .
Perhaps this is because , as Shukert says , we 're always expected to be " nice girls " — except when we 're supposed to be mean , but not too mean , to people we 're not supposed to like .
When we fail to speak out for people who refuse to meet those expectations , we implicitly enforce them , and we increase the likelihood that we and generations of women who come after us will continue to have to tamp down our personalities in order to measure up .
I 'll always regret not standing up for Beth , but sometimes shame can be as powerful as pride , and my eighth - grade failure has informed not just my feminism but my desire to be a decent person — and my understanding that social pressures will probably always fight against both .
Nice Girls [ Nerve ]
In a lab at Yale University , a rat inhales .
Every breath this rodent takes is a sign of important medical advances looming on the horizon , for only one of its lungs comes from the pair it was born with .
The other was built in a laboratory .
This transplanted lung is the work of Thomas Petersen and a large team of US scientists .
Their technique is n’t a way of growing a lung from scratch .
Instead it takes an existing lung , strips away all the cells and blood vessels to leave behind a scaffold of connective tissues , and re-grows the missing cells in a vat .
It ’s the medical equivalent of stripping a house down to a frame of beams and struts and rebuilding the rest from scratch .
The whole process only took a few days and when the reconstituted lung was transplanted into a rat , it worked .
This is important because the lungs are notoriously bad at regenerating and repairing themselves .
If a person ’s lungs are severely damaged , the only real solution is a lung transplant .
But that ’s easier said than done .
The procedure is expensive , only 20 % of patients at most are still alive ten years later , and the demand for donor lungs far exceeds their supply .
Peterson ’s ultimate vision is to solve these problems by fitting patients with a transplanted lung grown using their own stem cells .
The scaffold would come from a dead donor , or possibly even a primate or pig .
Its own cells would be stripped away and the patient ’s stem cells would give the scaffold a personalised makeover , seeding it with the various types of cells in the lungs .
The whole process should only take around 1 - 2 weeks .
Laura Niklason , who led the study , says , “ The value here is that the resultant lung would not reject , which is the key that limits survival of lung transplant patients right now . ”
The team ’s latest success in rats is a proof - of - concept – it shows that the technique should eventually be possible .
But as Petersen notes , there are many technical hurdles to overcome before it could ever used in humans .
That achievement is still years of hard work away .
“ I think that 20 to 25 years is not a bad time frame , ” says Niklason .
“ I previously developed an engineered artery that will be ready for patients next year .
It was first published in 1999 .
If an artery takes 12 years from first report to patients , then a lung will take 20 - 25 . ”
First , the team used detergents to strip away all the cells and blood vessels from freshly harvested lungs , leaving behind the ‘ extracellular matrix ’ .
This scaffold of connective tissues keeps the lung ’s physical properties , as well as its three - dimensional structure .
Right down to the microscopic level , every branch was preserved .
So were the structures of the alveoli , the little spheres through which our lungs exchange gas with our blood .
The complicated nature of the scaffold explains why the team ruled out the possibility of simply growing a lung from scratch .
“ We grow arteries from scratch all the time in my group , ” says Niklason , “ but lungs are harder because of the enormous surface area that is required for adequate gas exchange . ”
You ’d need to provide a template for that surface area and a man -made material is unlikely to do the trick .
“ That is , technologically , a very tall order .
” Other groups have tried this approach and failed to produce anything that can actually exchange gases as a real lung can .
For this reason , the team decided to use nature ’s template – the lung ’s own matrix .
Having exposed the matrix , they marinated it in a cocktail of lung cells taken from newborn rats .
The added cells stuck to the matrix in the right places and started reproducing quickly , in a way that they normally struggle to do on standard plastic surfaces .
The conditions certainly helped – the team incubated the lung matrix in a ‘ bioreactor ’ designed to mimic the conditions inside a growing foetus .
Different tubes imitated the flow of blood and air into the developing organ , with everything was maintained at just the right pressure .
All of these conditions proved to be essential for getting the lungs to re-grow in the right way .
Within just four days , the lungs were once again full of alveoli , blood vessels and small airways , all containing the right types of cells .
Then , the big test : Petersen transplanted four of these brand - new lungs ( just the left ones ) into living rats .
Within seconds , the lungs became suffused with blood , which rapidly turned from dark to bright red as it started taking up oxygen .
When the team took samples of blood from the major vessels , they confirmed that the new lungs were indeed exchanging gas as they were meant to .
Their biggest challenge now is to find a good source of cells to seed the empty frames they expose .
The re-fitted lungs will be immediately rejected by the immune system unless Petersen can grow them using lung stem cells derived from the patients themselves .
These are n’t available yet , although techniques that reprogram adult cells into stem - like ones may help to solve this problem in the future .
“ The stem cell biology will be the biggest hurdle , ” says Niklason .
“ Making the cells and growing them is not so bad , but controlling their fate within the lung matrix will be a substantial issue . ”
The team have already shown that the technique works on human lung samples taken from a tissue bank .
But even in rats , the results are far from perfect .
Chest X - rays revealed that the fresh left lungs were indeed inflating with air but to a lesser extent than the native right ones .
There were also signs of minor bleeding into the airways and some clots after a few hours .
The matrix had probably become slightly damaged during the process of removing its cells .
These leaks will have to be addressed before the procedure can be used in the clinic , but other scientists regard them as a sign that Petersen ’s group have rushed ahead too quickly .
Joaquin Cortiella , who works on lung tissue engineering at the University of Texas Medical Branch , says , “ I believe that they did not wait long enough with their cultured lung before they implanted it in the animal . ”
His colleague Joan Nichols agrees .
“ The big problem with tissue engineering is that because of the clinical need very often researchers have rushed to implant tissues before they had really produced materials worthy of transplantation , ” she says .
Nichols ’s own own group is working with engineered tissues that are two months old , and they only plan on implanting them into animals in 4 - 6 months , after careful evaluation .
In particular , they want to see if the lung ’s blood vessels form a proper junction with the alveoli and the matrix , something that Petersen ’s group have n’t established .
These junctions are the places where gas exchange takes place .
If they are n’t formed properly , gas will probably still diffuse through the blood vessels because the whole organ is sitting in an oxygen - rich environment , but you get blood leaks .
Nonetheless , both researchers say that the technique used to actually produce the lung was “ careful , well planned and beautifully presented ” .
Cortiella says that it “ shows the importance of using the organ ’s own extracellular matrix ” , while Nichols notes that it “ advances our view of what a bioreactor needs to look like in order to both grow and mature lung tissue ” .
And Nichols is particularly excited about the fact that other researchers are making significant headway in engineering a lung .
“ It is hard to make headway in a field when so few people have tried to engineer a lung , ” she says .
“ Good science does not take place in a vacuum .
You need a critical mass to move the field along . ”
Lung engineering may not be a competitive field , but it ’s clear that similar approaches are being tested for other organs .
Just last week , another team from Massachussetts General Hospital achieved the same trick for livers , stripping them down to a scaffold , re-growing them , and transplanting them back into rats .
Again , we ’re a long way off from the clinic but the fact that progress is being made at all makes this a very exciting time to be alive .

It ’s hard to think of a definition of “ activist judge ” that would not have Chancellor George Ellis of the 28th Judicial District in West Tennessee as Exhibit A .
In May 2008 , Angel Chandler and her ex-husband Joseph Barker went before the judge to modify their parenting plan .
But Ellis did n’t like that Angel was living with her female partner of nine years and decided that he was going to do a little legislating from the bench .
Now the 28th judicial district in Tennessee has Local Rule 23 , whereby agreements have a “ paramour clause , ” a decision that denies custody or even visitation rights to parents who allow an unmarried partner to stay overnight .
But this can be overridden by a court , something that Ellis decided he was n’t going to do .
Now this is not the case of a judge siding with the straight parent ; her ex-husband ( who has remarried ) did n’t ask for the clause or object to its removal .
And it was n’t over - reliance on a hostile child services worker ; reports showed no harm to the children .
This was simply the case of a judge going against the wishes of the parents and the children and the advice of the psychologist , and taking it upon himself to disrupt the life of this family out of his own personal biases and bigotries .
Angel ’s and her partner moved into two halves of a duplex so they could live near each other but apart while they appealed the decision , but soon found the double households to be prohibitively expensive .
But fortunately they won their appeal , with the court reminding Ellis that the state law requires the primary consideration for custody arrangements be what ’s in the best interest of the children .
Well , Ellis did n’t need no stinkin’ law to do what he wanted to do , so he insisted that the paramour clause remain in place until he could have a hearing .
Well in March of this year he had his hearing at which time he decided – without any evidence as support – that it was in the best interest of the children that Chandler and her partner be forced to live apart in order for her to have her kids visit .
( Citizen Times )
“ A paramour overnight , abuse of alcohol and abuse of drugs are clearly common sense understanding that children can be adversely affected by such exposure … . ”
( There is no mention of there actually having been abuse of alcohol or drugs , Ellis just sort of threw that in there for comparison .
Ya know : alcohol , drug , lesbians – all just obviously not in the kids ’ best interest to be around these things . )
So back to the court they went .
And this time the appeals court was not amused that Chancellor Ellis had decided to impose his agenda over that of the law .
“ The record is devoid of any evidence whatsoever to support the finding that a paramour provision is in the best interests of the children .
In fact , the record contains evidence demonstrating that a paramour provision is contrary to the best interests of the children , ” the court wrote .
So far I ’ve been unable to locate any mention of this story by the usual crowd of anti-gay ranters .
I guess their definition of “ activist judge ” is one who disagrees with them .
Last week during Steve Jobs ’ interviews at D8 an audience member asked him about AT&T ’s network .
i Phone users are deeply familiar with the issues — dead connections , dropped calls , bad coverage , and intermittent data .
Everyone was wondering how Steve would answer .
Using his masterful ability to demonstrate empathy , Steve disarmed the audience almost immediately ( see video ) , replying that AT&T ’s best experts tell him “ things should be getting a lot better soon – certainly by the end of the summer ” .
Contrary to Steve ’s answer , AT&T ’s issues are not primarily around spectrum or backhaul .
Instead , they center around ' signaling ' , which smartphones rely on for polling , status and control updates .
Ironically , as Jobs talked about a summer solution , we ’re on the precipice of an event which will likely make AT&T ’s network dramatically WORSE very soon : iOS 4 multitasking .
This is because multitasking will increase signaling usage by 3 - 5 x .
Imagine streaming Pandora , buying the song on iTunes while listening , receiving Twitter timeline updates and updated World Cup scores , and checking in on Foursquare – simultaneously !
Or exiting the subway with 5 open apps and waiting while each establishes a new network connection .
Without a doubt this will bring AT&T ’s signaling layer to its knees .
And no amount of additional spectrum or backhaul can solve signaling issues .
The longer term solution is re-architected LTE networks , but their deployment will take many years .
Adding femtocells is another solution , which is exactly why AT&T is the first carrier in the US to aggressively push their use .
But here ’s the fascinating point : the signaling issues are n’t just AT&T ’s fault .
In a quest to extend battery life on the iPhone , Apple did something ' non- standard ' which compounds the issues – the iPhone constantly drops connections , going in to an idle state .
Keepalives within the apps then reestablish a new connection after only a few seconds .
Network equipment makers never anticipated this .
Think of it as hanging up during a phone call when the line is silent , and then redialing to respond .
Though RIM was doing this earlier than Apple , the iPhone is the first device to really push use of idle disconnects , as Apple looked for every way to extend battery life .
If Apple stopped their use in iOS 4 , technical experts almost universally agree that signaling problems would subside .
But it would also result in reduced iPhone battery life , which is why Apple wo n’t agree to do so .
Steve Jobs almost certainly knows this .
Perhaps most fascinating is that this problem is another testament to Apple ’s marketing muscle and ability to control partners and suppliers .
How so ?
AT&T knows full well about the signaling issues , but has been okay taking public blame , even though the ' solution ' is in the handsets just as much as the network .
Psychologically speaking AT&T and Apple know that people prefer to have one primary scapegoat .
If instead AT&T subscribers knew that their horrible service was in part due to Apple ’s design choices , it ’s likely they ’d be less loyal .
In exchange for its constant bashing , AT&T enjoys the lowest subscriber churn in the industry .
So Steve Jobs is much smarter than his answer at D8 suggests .
He knows that there is a pretty simple solution to a complex problem — for Apple to roll back use of idle disconnects .
But this almost certainly wo n’t happen since for Apple it ’s not a zero sum game – the entire network would benefit , while Apple would lose its edge in battery life against Android .
Which is why your service is likely to continue getting worse for a long time to come , not better ...

I wrote this , and posted it to the Bartcop Forum in 2003 .
I also sent a copy to Terry Gross of Fresh Air , just before she interviewed him .
It was my first big Rock and Roll gig as a Theatre Stagehand .
I had gotten my parents to write school to excuse me for work .
I was thrilled .
I mean , there I was , a 16 year old kid and working on the KISS " Asylum " ( no makeup ) tour -- TOTALLY GEEKED .
Well , the load - in started at 5 am , and the wind blew straight off of Lake Huron into the McMorran Arena -- it was brutally cold .
All went well as far as the load - in goes , at 5 ' 5 " , and 105 pounds at the time , I managed to hold my own and do what was expected of me .
At 11 am we broke for an hour 's lunch .
During that time , two key things happened : Someone stole Gene Simmon 's fiber - optic cape ( about $ 5,000 ) from the cleaners .
Second , the Band moved into the facility -- the local crew was n't notified before hand that KISS would be using the locker room we had been using for our head .
So , my friends and I returned from lunch chatting , and walked right into their dressing room -- what we saw was every boy 's rock & roll fantasy :
There was the band , partying it up with women who NEVER lived in Port Huron , a FULLY STOCKED bar on the counter , a spread of decadence for TWENTY people , let alone four ... The band had ripped a mirror from the wall and put on top of one of those big wire spools .
Paul Stanley was sitting at the table , straw up his nose and snorting deeply from a HUGE pile of cocaine .
We walked in and stopped dead in our tracks -- Stanley was about four feet from me ( I was in the front ) .
He finishes his snort , catches his breath and just stops -- everything gets quite -- everyone is looking at me ... " OUT , " Paul says , with snow hanging from his nose tip , " Get the FUCK OUT --" I 'm blocked by my idiot friends who were trying to catch a peek .
Suddenly ,
Gene throws a whiskey bottle at us , and it explodes against the wall about a foot from my head .
Booze goes spraying all over me -- great !
" Get Out ! " he yells , " And you did n't see anything , you pansies !
" It was all I could do to get out of there , and I pushed past my buddies .
I 'm on deck , putting some vacuform trim in the shape of amplifier speakers on the drum risers , when I hear Gene screaming bloody murder behind me .
He just found out his costume was stolen .
He comes up onstage , raging with anger .
My back was turned to him .
" What the fuck is this ? " he says , " Who the fuck fucked up ? "
He was right behind me .
Suddenly , his hands were on me .
" YOU .
What the fuck are you doing ? "
He grabs me with one hand around my neck and with the other , he grabs my crotch from the back hoisting my over his head , shaking me in a " body slam " posture .
"
Is this a little joke of your 's , little guy ? " he screams , " I 'm pissed -- QUIT FUCKING WITH ME !! " he screams .
Meanwhile , I 'm terrified , saying , " I 'm just working , please put me down , I 'm just working . "
Somewhere across the arena , I hear someone shout , " Put the little guy down , Gene , you 're going to hurt him .
"
He put me down , alright -- just let go and stepped backwards .
Now Gene 's about six and a half feet tall and had me at full arm length over his head .
I SLAMMED against the deck , and I SWEAR I bounced .
I was stunned and could n't move , while I assessed my body for damage and caught my breath .
All of a sudden , he straddled me and sat on my chest .
He collared me with one hand while slapping me with his other .
he grilled me about where the fuck his costume was , and whether I was talking about what I saw in the dressing room .
I repeatedly told him that I was just trying to work ( slap ) and really had no idea about his costume ( slap ) and I was n't talking to anybody ...
I had a clove cigarette in the stem of my glasses and tried to offer it to him .
He slapped me again , got very close to my face and growled , " I do n't smoke .
" I was thinking to myself , Gosh , Gene , you snort coke , drink , and breathe fire on stage -- how should I know if you do n't smoke ... I just stared at him .
Finally , he starts to smile , licks my nose with his big tongue ( it REALLY is long ) .
By this time , a small crowd had gathered and some handlers were trying to pull him off of me .
" We were just having a chat , " he said over his shoulder .
He tapped me on my red cheek a couple of times , gave me one of those intimidation points , and got off of me like nothing happened .
A Stage Manager helped me up , never asked what happened , but got me some water and asked if I was alright .
I was , so I drank my water and went back to work .
I kept a LARGE Crescent Wrench in my back pocket the rest of the day .
The next morning , I broke all of my KISS albums and vowed to never support them again .
I have turned down five gigs with them since .
Two weeks after that day , I was watching MTV and who comes on for a " Rockers Against Drugs " ad ?
Gene and the boys .
" We Don't need drugs to have a good time ...
" We just LIKE them .
I really fucking hate Gene Simmons .
I 've been waiting a long time to finally hear that Karma caught up with him .
That cocksucker deserves two bullets in his head , and his own balls shoved down his throat .

We want to hear what you think about this article .

My wife and I have been married for 25 years – she is 45 and I am 48 .
It took a little red skirt to bring us the sexual adventure of our lives .
For our anniversary just over last autumn , I bought her a gold bracelet and booked a short country house break but as a fun present for me she ordered a short tight red mini skirt from a mail order company .
I was n’t to know how much of a “ fun ” present it would turn out to be although the first time she modelled it with a pair of lacey topped stockings I could see the real potential .
Babs is blonde with an almost perfect hour glass figure 39 c 29 40 , with shapely legs and a very ripe rear and this skirt showed legs , thighs and rear off to perfection .
It was the shortest skirt she had worn for over 20 years and in certain lights one could see the suspender belt and creamy thighs and buttocks through the taut material .
I enjoyed seeing her in it privately and was rather vicariously thrilled at the idea of seeing her wear this in public .
We enjoy walking holidays and we booked into a large country house hotel that we had stayed in some years ago in the lake district .
Babs promised that if it was as quiet as it had been previously she would wear the red skirt for me in public as well as in private .
When we arrived late afternoon we were very disappointed to see two tour buses in the car park as we had hoped for a quiet , intimate and exciting weekend .
When we went to recce in the bar we found that they belonged to a pensioners outing and my hopes of seeing Babs in public in the red skirt disappeared .
We agreed that it would n’t be appropriate to wear the skirt in a restaurant and bar full of pensioners but she did surprise me by saying she would wear a white rather transparent top without a bra albeit with a jacket over it for discretion .
I was delighted with her look when I saw her getting ready for dinner in skin tight black stretch trousers that emphasised her rear , thighs and pussy lips !
Her top was fantastic being skin tight and slightly fitted under the bust to push up and present her 39s and emphasise her nipples and large dark aureoles .
It was n’t quite as good as the red skirt but it came a close second .
Her smart black jacket meant that she looked reasonably discreet at first sight and she said if the restaurant was darkish she could take it off and let me lust after her .
The bar was fairly crowded , as we had booked to go in after the bus tour crowd , but when the waiter advised us our table would take about 20 minutes we went up and sat at the only vacant stools at the bar .
I noticed the young barman , a dark skinned guy in his early twenties , do a double take at Babs breasts as she climbed up on the stool and the jacket fell apart a bit , and when I told her this she gave him a bigger eyeful when he came back with the drinks , by pulling down her top and pushing out her breasts .
She seemed determined to enjoy herself and she had three large G&Ts before we went in to dinner .
The waiter , a young English guy again in his early twenties , led us to a good table in a darkened corner and when I jokingly offered to take her jacket she said why not and I noticed that he also stole a glance at the large unbraed orbs as I took her jacket off .
When he came back to take our order he could n’t take his eyes off them .
When I suggested that she would have been giving the waiter and bar man wet dreams that night Babs , refused to believe it saying she was old enough to be their mother .
So when most of the bus tourists had retired to the bar , and Babs got up to go to the loo and went to put on her jacket .
I suggested that she go as she was and see if the waiter displayed any interest .
As she went towards the loo with the big unfettered breasts bouncing he was coming towards her with some coffee for a neighbouring table and I saw him grab an eyeful and then turn round to watch her big jutting rear disappear through the door .
I noted that he engaged the couple that he was serving in conversation until she came out see he could see her again .
She did admit that he seemed interested but claimed it was probably because he did n’t see many women of her age braless .
To prove a point I said I would go out to the loo so she could order a Tia Maria from him and see how interested he was
When I came back she was flirting outrageously with him with her hand on his arm and the pair of them were laughing .
When I asked her did she now agree that he fancied her , my erection rose when she said – “ mmmm from the bulge in his trousers I think he does . ”
When I asked her did she fancy him I was slightly shocked when what I considered to be my rather reserved wife say “ mmmm he is cute with a nice little ass and an interesting bulge but I think I would prefer the bar man I ’ve always had a thing about darker skinned men ” .
When we went out to the bar most of the pensioners had gone to bed but Babs suggested sitting at the bar .
I thought she had been joking about the barman but I was n’t sure when I went out to get a bottle of water from the car and found that she had taken off her jacket and was giving the bar man a good display of her breasts .
She introduced me to Henri , the bar man who was Moroccan , and apparently the waiter was James .
Henri admitted that with the hotel being on the moors and usually having a pensioner clientele , James and he had found things in the hotel were rather dull but as the bar usually closed at 11 o clock they were able to seek their fun in the nearby town of Kendal ..
Just after 11.00 , whilst I was interested to see where Babs might go with her flirting , I was tired from our travel and suggested that we go up .
She suggested that I should go up while she finished her drink .
It was about 20 minutes later that she came up and when I asked her what the delay was , she smiled and said the waiter and Henri had insisted on buying her a drink and that I had been right about them fancying her because when she had got up to go the loo she had heard them commenting on her rear and boobs .
When she had come back she had told them she had heard them discussing her figure , both had flushed - even Henri with his dark skin .
She told them that it was highly good for her ego too such attractive young guys finding her attractive and they admitted that they found her very attractive .
They had tried to persuade her to have another few drinks but she thought it wiser not too .
When she had got up to go both had given her a peck on the lips in turn , and when they did so she had felt their hard erections against her .
When I asked her what would have happened if I had n’t been there , she smiled and said “ I do n’t honestly know but it might have been fun ” .
When I queried “ with both of them ” she grinned and said “ possibly ” .
This was the first time in 25 years of marriage that Babs had expressed interest in having sex with anyone other than me but to my surprise I was n’t jealous but extremely aroused at the thought of my blonde wife with these two young guys and especially with the dark skinned arab type guy .
She too was obviously turned on by the idea and when I rather crudely said so you would have let the two of them f*** you , she admitted that the thought of “ taking two young cocks ” did turn her on .
For the first time in our married life our sex was fuelled by “ dirty talk ” as we fantasised about her being ridden by two young guys .
The next morning she was rather contrite as we did a few miles walk before coming back to the hotel for a drink .
However after a few drinks she was quite relaxed and was soon chatting away to Henri .
That night she again wore a pair of tight black suede trousers and a black transparent top albeit with a lacey bra beneath .
By the time we came out of the restaurant after a good meal and a couple of bottles of wine , at just before 11 , the bus crowd had rather disappeared and Henri informed me that as he was doing night porter as well would we mind him closing the bar as he wanted to do some paperwork in the office .
If we wanted anything further to drink he could always get it for us .
I ordered a couple of doubles and we settled down to drink them at a table overlooking a superb moorland view .
Babs asked me to get another drink from Henri for us , as she wanted to pop up to the room for something .
When I went to get him from the office he was chatting to the waiter James , and said he would come down to the bar in a few minutes .
He had just gone in to the bar to get the drinks when I saw Babs coming across the lobby dressed to kill in her see through top without the bra and in her very , very short red skirt and black stockings and five inch heels .
When Henri came out of the bar with the drinks his eyes were on stalks and even more so when she said “ darling get me another large G&T I feel like a few drinks tonight . ”
While I carried the drinks across to the table and he went back to open up one section of the bar , I was shocked but extremely turned on to see her sit down , cross her legs and let the skirt ride up to show her lacey stockings tops and a bit of creamy thigh .
When Henri brought the drinks I saw his eyes flick over her and he lingered to say he had some work to finish off but he would come back to check if we wanted more drinks .
When he went , she smiled and said “ well how do you like your anniversary present ” I smiled and said probably about as much as he did !!
I asked her did she realise the two guys would be about when she came down and she said “ genuinely no , but do you not think it adds a little bit of frisson to me wearing this . ”
When I asked her did she not mind guys seeing “ what she had ” she said she had never thought that she would enjoy it , but she had enjoyed seeing the guys lust over her the previous night .
I had drunk enough to say “ and what about more ” she grinned and said “ that ’s up to you ” .
When I pushed and said “ would you really think about doing something about it . ”
She teasingly said “ your anniversary present , you decide what you want to do with it . ”
We had our drinks and she informed me she was going to the loo and to order her another drink .
When I watched the big hips swaying out to the lobby all I could think about was on taking advantage of an opportunity for a real sexual adventure .
My cock was at bursting point and I could hardly speak when I went up to the office to ask Henri to get another drink and I invited James and he to join us .
By the time , Babs came back through the lobby we were sitting with our drinks and six eyes were watching her progress .
I had never been so excited than to see the guys quite literally drool over my wife ’s big bouncing breasts and ripe thighs and when she sat down and very slowly and deliberately crossed her legs to flash acres of thighs , I felt my hands shaking as I took my drink .
The conversation flowed with the drink and it appeared no one was certain where things were going .
Then Babs got up to go to the loo again and as she did - she did a twirl and said “ Guys what do you think of his anniversary present ” – when they looked at her quizzically she said “ I bought this gear for his anniversary present but its only the wrapping , the real present is inside and what he wants to do with it !
As she strode off , all our eyes went to the bounce of her ripe jutting buttocks with the black g string , suspender belt and stocking tops faintly discernable through the taught material of her skirt .
In fact the skirt rode up as she walked and just skimmed the top of her stockings .
Henri whispered “ you are a very lucky man ” and when I said that he and James flirting with Babs had been the key to turning her on , he admitted that they had fancied her but did n’t think it was reciprocated .
I told him it was and asked him would they like to do something about it .
I said I did n’t know what she would want but she certainly had fantasised about being with the two of them and suggested that when she came back , I would go out to the car for a while to let them make their move and see how far she would go .
By this time Babs was slightly wobbly as she tottered in on her heels and when she flopped down with her legs apart we all had a flash of the gold trimmed g string straining to cover the big mound .
When Henri suggested more drinks , I got up “ to go to the car . ”
I went outside where I could catch a view of what was happening and when Henri came back with the drinks he leaned down and kissed Babs .
Initially she appeared to demur but then with rising cock , I saw her reciprocate and they were soon snogging .
I saw his hand cup a full breast without any objection and I almost climaxed when I saw James join the action by cupping her other breast .
Initially once again she seemed to object and broke off her snog with Henri but when James then kissed her she relaxed and allowed both guys to grope her .
I watched fascinated as the two young guys snogged and groped my wife ’s breasts and when I saw Henri ’s hand go up her skirt without any objection , I thought she is going to go the whole way .
I decided that I should perhaps join the action rather than hang back but when I went into the lobby I was surprised to see they were n’t at the table .
I was slightly worried but when I went into the bar I realised the action had moved to the restaurant entrance and the two guys had Babs sandwiched between them and were kissing and groping her .
When I got closer I could see that they had her top up and her boobs uncovered and her skirt up round her waist .
They were groping her tits and pussy and ass and she appeared to be loving it .
They were quite oblivious to me and when I said does anyone want another drink they broke away guiltily but I moved quickly forward and kissing her I said “ it appears you ’ve decided I ’m going to share my present but lets do it in comfort in our room ” .
As Babs pulled down her skirt and top , I asked Henri to get a bottle of Gin and some tonic and come up to our room .
I said to James “ do n’t be shy lets take her up ” and he did n’t need any encouragement to follow us up the large staircase .
As she walked up the stairs ahead of us I could see her skirt rising above her stocking tops and big thighs and ass cheeks were exposed .
We were both so excited that by the time we got to the top we pushed her against the wall and started to grope her boobs and pussy again .
By the time Henri joined us we were passed the point of no return and we all tumbled into the room and Babs was rather roughly tumbled on to the bed .
The rest is a bit of a blur as I remember very briefly seeing my wife lying on the bed with her breasts and pussy and thighs exposed before the three of us were on her like wild animals seeking to sate our lust .
I remember noticing that Henri had an oddly long thin curved scimitar like cock before I think I pushed the other guys aside because I was first to go between her legs , and push her g string aside , to mount her .
She was obviously very excited because the largest erection I had had for years slipped effortlessly home .
As I rode her hands were busy on the two guys and I climaxed immediately I saw Henri ’s long curved snake enter her mouth .
As I rolled off her James was on her in a flash and as I stood back I heard her sharp intake of breath as his hard young cock went home .
I was soon erect again as I watched my wife be used like a large rag doll as she was impaled on the two young cocks .
I had simply warmed her up for their use and she writhed and moaned in a way I had never heard before as she was serviced by them .
As Henri shot his load into her mouth she came off herself and James rode her through a screaming climax before he too shot his load .
Temporarily sated we paused for a drink while Babs went to the bathroom to tidy her dishevelled clothing but by the time , she came out wearing only garter belt and stockings , to get a very large G&T , she met three very erect cocks .
She smiled and said “ easy guys that was fun and I really enjoyed it but lets take it easy we ’ve all night ” .
She swigged the drink down almost in one and said now I want to ride one of you guys , and pulling me down on to the bed she spread her legs and lowered herself down on to my erection ..
I was very excited when I realised that the two guys were seeing her at her most voracious riding me hard with buttocks bouncing and tits dangling .
James jumped on the bed and pulled her head back forced his cock into her throat .
As James and I went about our work with her skewered between us she was energetically and very willingly taking it at both ends when I felt her tense and realise that Henri was trying to enter her rear .
I had tried her anally before but had n’t persisted when she said it hurt her and was stunned to find that after the initial wince she did n’t stop her riding of me and sucking James .
The thought of her being taken like this made me even more lustful as I moved my pelvis harder to meet her thrusts .
I was near my climax , when I simultaneously I heard a scream and felt him through the thin wall between vagina and rectum as he thrust his full length violently into her virgin ass .
James cut off her scream by pulling her head down and the three of us got to work on our respective orifices .
I climaxed first followed by James and as we rolled aside from our respective orifices we were both soon erect as we watched Babs sprawling on all fours , take a really violent and animalistic ride from Henri mounted on her big rear .
Time and time he plunged his long thin dark scimitar like length into the rosebud between her big creamy hips as he mouthed obscenities about how knew she had been wanting her big ass fucked and it was what she needed .
This was n’t anal sex this was pure buggery , but Babs on a sexual high appeared to having both pain and pleasure and when he obviously climaxed in her she moved her ass milking the last drop of cum from him .
As he withdrew she fell forward on the bed with her ass in the air and as James parted her cheeks to mount her it was a real turn to see Henri ’s semen oozing out of her rosebud .
She gasped as James thrust roughly into her rear and I watched as my wife ’s big rear was once again roughly sodomised .
It is difficult to explain the excitement that one can feel by seeing one ’s wife being really well used and being up for anything .
James also rode her hard stallioning her deeply with his smaller but obviously very hard cock until he too climaxed in her .
As she slumped forward again I was really ready to reclaim her ass for myself and I felt very little resistance as I eased my full length into her well lubricated rear and I was soon literally up to my balls in her rectum .
The feeling of her tight sphincter muscle round my cock , the excitement of seeing my cock disappear completely into what had been forbidden territory , the brilliant feeling of my balls slapping against the cool cheeks of her big rear plus the thought that my wife had allowed herself to be ass – f***** by two young guys gave me an unbelievable sexual high and I was soon climaxing for the first time in her rear .
As I rolled off Henri was on her again pushing it home and telling her we was going to give her the ass f****** that she had been wanting .
Over the rest of the night both James and I also sodomised her again and both her pussy and mouth were also well used by all three of us .
They both left about 5 am in the morning as James was on breakfast duty .
Babs and I flopped exhausted into bed and when I woke at about 9.30 am with the sounds of the bus tour leaving the night before appeared surreal like a dream .
But my almost raw cock and the fact that when I pulled back the covers and saw her laddered stockings and cum stained garter belt , plus the overwhelming smell of stale semen , I remembered only too well that my wife had taken copious quantities of cum in all her orifices .

With millions of Americans out of work and hurting , lawmakers who claim they worry about budget deficits spent last week forcing ‘ compromises ’ that will save hedge fund kingpins billions in taxes .
By Sam Pizzigati
You want to lead a charmed existence ?
Just start up your own private investment fund — a hedge fund perhaps or a private equity operation or maybe a venture capital shop .
As an investment fund manager , you ’ll live the sweet life .
You ’ll get to invest the mega millions you collect from deep - pocket investors almost any way you want , without hardly any pesky government regulation .
And you get to keep — for yourself — 20 percent of any profits those investments end up making .
Even better yet , you wo n’t have to pay regular federal income taxes on that 20 percent .
The charming reason : a neat little loophole in the federal tax code that lets billionaire investment fund managers pay taxes — on the bulk of their windfalls — at a 15 percent “ capital gains ” rate .
That ’s less than half the current 35 percent top federal tax rate on ordinary income .
In today ’s Great Recession America , most of us do not , of course , lead lives anywhere as charmed as the lives of private investment fund managers .
We live in a workaday world where 10 percent of us have no work .
And many more Americans in our world — hundreds of thousands of teachers and other public employees — will soon be joining the ranks of the jobless as revenue - starved state and local governments shift this summer into austerity mode .
The revenues these governments need could come , in large part , from shutting down the investment fund manager capital gains tax scam .
Last year , the top 25 hedge fund managers , just by themselves , took in a combined income of $ 25.3 billion .
The capital gains scam — known in the trade as the “ carried interest ” loophole — likely saved these 25 at least several billion in taxes .
So what would a Congress committed to the well - being of the entire American people do about all this ?
The no -brainer answer : That Congress would rush to close the “ carried interest ” loophole and put the billions this loophole is saving financial industry power suits to work for out - of - work Americans .
Last week Congress seemed to take a giant step in just that direction .
In the House , lawmakers narrowly passed , by a 215 - 204 margin , a $ 115 billion bill promisingly entitled the “ American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act of 2010 . ”
But House Democratic leaders , to round up enough votes to get the measure passed , had to agree to cut back on the legislation ’s original aid for the jobless and water down the bill ’s loophole closing .
The bill , as passed , does n’t fully close the carried interest loophole .
Hedge fund billionaires and their peers elsewhere in private investing will , under the House legislation , still get to claim as personal capital gains 25 percent of the profits they make investing other people ’s money .
Actually , last week ’s House bill gives investment fund managers an even better deal than that .
At the last minute , investment fund - friendly lawmakers forced still another concession from the House Democratic leadership .
They won a provision that will delay any carried interest changes until January 1 , 2011 .
For the next two years after that , investment fund managers will be able to claim a capital gains tax discount on 50 percent of their investment fund profit dollars .
This delay in implementing carried interest reform will cost the federal treasury billions .
Private investment funds , the Wall Street Journal predicts , will now move quickly to finalize deals before the new tax rates go into effect .
So how could lawmakers justify the delay ?
Lawmakers say they wanted to “ give the investment community time to adjust ” to the new tax rules .
Jobless Americans will get no such adjustment time .
The House leadership , to gain votes from “ fiscally conservative ” Democrats for last week ’s legislation , also had to agree to excise from the bill tens of billions in help for economically hard - pressed Americans , including a $ 6.8 billion subsidy that would have helped the unemployed pay their health care bills .
The U.S. Senate will take up its version of the House jobless aid and loophole - cutting legislation after the chamber ’s Memorial Day recess , in the second week of June .
The Senate appears ready — and eager — to help America ’s beleaguered investment fund managers through these difficult days .
Senate Republicans remain steadfastly opposed to any carried interest tax reform , and several Senate Democrats , most notably 2004 Presidential candidate John Kerry , are pushing proposals that would exempt even more of investment fund manager income from regular taxes than the House version .
Progressive advocacy groups are working to mobilize average Americans against this giveaway to the rich .
But the rich , even if they lose this latest skirmish on carried interest reform , will still have plenty of reason to gloat .
The central capital gains tax issue , after all , goes far deeper than the scam investment fund managers have been running .
Yes , the tax code certainly should not let these fund managers claim any capital gains tax breaks .
But the tax code also should not be giving a tax break to any capital gains income .
The basic issue remains simple :
Why should wealthy Americans who make money from money get preferential tax treatment over average Americans who make money from their own personal labor ?
This question ought to sit front and center in our national tax debate .
Instead , the question seldom ever gets asked .
America ’s plutocrats , over the next few weeks , may lose a battle or two on the carried interest front .
But these plutocrats , as a class , are still most definitely winning the war .

American , 19 , Among Gaza Flotilla Dead Furkan Dogan was shot five times , including four times in the head .
June 3 , 2010  -- A U.S. citizen who lived in Turkey is among the nine people killed when Israeli commandos stormed a Turkish aid ship heading for the Gaza Strip , officials said today .
The victim was identified as Furkan Dogan , 19 , a Turkish - American .
A forensic report said he was shot at close range , with four bullets in his head and one in his chest , according to the Anatolian news agency .
Dogan was a high school student studying social sciences in the town of Kayseri in central Turkey .
He was born in Troy , N.Y. , and moved to Turkey at the age of 2 .
He will be buried in his hometown tomorrow .
Dogan 's body was returned to Turkey today along with eight others , all Turkish nationals , who were on board the Mavi Marmara .
The ship was sponsored by a Turkish charity , the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief ( IHH ) and was carrying aid to Gaza in defiance of the Israeli blockade .
The charity released the names of all nine dead .
All are male and the ages range from 32 to 61 .
The Mavi Marmara formed part of a flotilla that was organized by the Free Gaza movement and intended to break the three - year Israeli blockade on the embattled Palestinian enclave .
Israeli commandos rappelled onto the decks of the six ships Monday , but on the Mavi Marmara the passengers battled the soldiers with metal rods , wrested weapons from soldiers and , according to the Israeli military , fired on them .
Nine people died and more than 30 were wounded , including several Israeli troops .
Click here to return to the " World News " page .
The activists on board the ship told a very different version of events from the one released by the Israeli military .
A Canadian on board , Farooq Burney , described watching an elderly man bleed to death .
The head of a Turkish charity that organized the aid flotilla said an Indonesian doctor was shot in the stomach and a photographer was shot in the forehead .
Flotilla Passengers Dispute Israeli Version of Flotilla Raid
" They [ Israeli commandos ] were trying to land on the boat .
So obviously there was this hand - to - hand combat and during that process the people on the boat were basically able to disarm some of the soldiers because they did have guns with them , " Burney told Reuters .
" So they basically took the guns away from them and took the cartridges out and threw them away . "
Asked if anyone had used the guns against the Israeli commandos , Burney said , " No , not at all . "
" Yes , we took their guns .
It would be self defence even if we fired their guns , " Bulent Yildirim , chairman of the IHH , said .
" We told our friends on board we will die , become martyrs , but never let us be shown ... as the ones who used guns , " he said , adding that people shouted that the weapons should not be used .
" By this decision , our friends accepted death , and we threw all the guns we took from them into the sea , " Yildirim said .
Thousands of mourners flocked to the funeral held for the Turkish activists today in Istanbul .
Coffins of most of those killed , draped in Turkish and Palestinian flags , were brought to Istanbul 's Fatih Mosque for the service before the bodies were taken to their home towns for burial .
" Turkey will never forget such an attack on its ships and its people in international waters .
Turkey 's ties with Israel will never be the same again , " Turkish President Abdullah Gul told a news conference .
" Israel made one of the greatest mistakes in its history .
It will see in time what a huge mistake it made , " he said .
Equally harsh words are being used by the Israelis .
The alliance is dead , a senior official in Jerusalem said Tuesday night , according to Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot .
" The Turks are right about one thing : Irreversible harm has been caused to the relations .
In the situation that has been created , Turkey will no longer be a strategic ally of Israel . "
Israel and Turkey face many challenges in which both have strong mutual interests , Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Andy David said .
" Hopefully , we 'll overcome the shadows that we see today , " he told ABC News .
Israel 's Next Test : the Rachel Corrie Due in the Area Friday
Meanwhile , Israel is preparing for a new ship to run the blockade , the Irish ship MV Rachel Corrie , due to arrive in the area Friday .
" The Rachel Corrie will not be allowed into Gaza , " David said .
" We are watching it and waiting to see what will happen .
Hopefully , the people on board will direct to the port in Ashdod .
" The naval blockade is still in effect and the ship will not be allowed to enter into the naval blockade area . "
Former U.N. assistant secretary general Denis Halliday , who is on board the Rachel Corrie , told ABC News that they do not intend to stop their mission or head to the Israeli port of Ashdod instead .
" It 's a totally unacceptable embargo .
There 's no justification for it , there 's no legality for it , it 's not endorsed by the U.N. , it 's not endorsed by anybody else .
It 's an Israeli military zone which is without legal status , " he said in a phone interview from the ship today .
The Rachel Corrie expects to be boarded by the Israelis Friday when they are approximately 80 miles off coast .
" When they tell they are about to board we will cooperate because it 's too dangerous not to do so , particularly as you say it may be at night which is the usual tactic .
We 're not fools , we 're not about to throw away our lives . "
" We 're very upbeat and having seen the appalling consequences of Monday we 're more determined than ever to try and make this work , " Halliday said .

Reserve Bank of New Zealand under the spotlight
Reserve Bank of New Zealand under the spotlight .
Last week , the Reserve Bank of New Zealand ’s ( RBNZ ) legal counsel abruptly closed communication on a matter in response to questions relating to an Irish High Court Report .
The report sent under the Order of a High Court Judge in 2004 has to have been ignored by the RBNZ or customers who had suffered losses would have been compensated .
The RBNZ response can only be concluded that there is agreement with EUFA ’s stand that there is a legal issue to be addressed by the Crown .
The reaction of the RBNZ is consistent with documented evidence that was placed before Hon Simon Power , at a meeting at Parliament last week , specifically in answer to the Minister public statements indicating the Regulatory Authorities ineptitude that caused the loss of billions of dollars of New Zealander ’s retirement savings .
Coordinator of EUFA Suzanne Edmonds said from Tauranga today “ After working for three years getting to the root of the problems facing investors , we have had to show the Government key factors that allowed the finance industry to collapse . ”
The response of EUFA has been to focus on clarifying Minister Hon Simon Power ’s public statement ; “ As investors money hit the floor the regulators involved in this space all looked at each other and said – well – who ’s responsible here ? ”
Evidence was handed to the Minister demonstrating a critical example of the RBNZs ( as the senior authority ) standard of supervision .
The evidence shows the RBNZ , openly ignored the judicious intent of an Irish High Court warning , relating to a Banking group operating in New Zealand , that had evaded Tax ( and overcharged its customers ) since being taken over by an Australian parent Bank , common to both States .
At the time of its findings , the Irish High Court obviously believed the practice was systemic throughout the Banking group , ( including NZ ) as has since been proven to be the correct judgment in the NZ High Court .
Five years after the Irish Report was sent , Justice Wild of the High Court ( NZ ) established that the tax dodge employed had cost NZ $ 416 Million in back taxes , escalating to $ 654 million when the correct interest was added .
To the EUFA organisations , this significant amount of money is recklessly written off , given the deteriorating level of health care and other important services needed to be paid for .
As stated to Minister Power the tax lost to New Zealand had the effect of depriving the economy of funding , simply because the New Zealand Regulator refused to value cross border regulatory supervision standards .
( Under this standard the new Financial Markets Authority ( FMA ) is destined to fail . )
EUFA has written to the Australian and the Irish Regulators raising its concerns .
Finance Spokesman for EUFA , Gray Eatwell responded to questions , saying , “ It is blatantly clear that if the Government truly intends to clean up the supervision of the Finance Industry , they must insist on regulatory standards commensurate with countries where global institutions operating in New Zealand also operate ” .

There seems to be a strong sentiment in Congress that the only constitutional right suspected terrorists have is the right to bear arms .
“ I think you ’re going too far here , ” said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday .
He was speaking in opposition to a bill that would keep people on the F.B.I. terrorist watch list from buying guns and explosives .
Say what ?
Yes , if you are on the terrorist watch list , the authorities can keep you from getting on a plane but not from purchasing an AK - 47 .
This makes sense to Congress because , as Graham accurately pointed out , “ when the founders sat down and wrote the Constitution , they did n’t consider flying . ”
The subject of guns turns Congress into a twilight zone .
People who are perfectly happy to let the government wiretap phones go nuts when the government wants to keep track of weapons permits .
A guy who stands up in the House and defends the torture of terror suspects will nearly faint with horror at the prospect of depriving someone on the watch list of the right to purchase a pistol .
More detail will emerge when further investigations take place , especially with regard to the last few hours leading up to the explosion .
However , I am confident the fundamentals are identified in this article and , most importantly , the crucial lessons learned so none of us repeat the same mistakes .
I have summarized the information to try and keep it to the salient facts .
The following information is from reliable sources .
Most is public record and the remainder is from confidential reviews carried out by other major oil companies .
I have interpreted the reports and made some conclusions with caveats where necessary .
As such , these are only opinions and no inference of blame can be inferred as a result of these statements .

Much is being made of the water depth as a factor in this disaster .
However , many of the mistakes made would have been equally serious in shallow - water drilling or even on land , and lessons learned apply to almost all drilling operations .
Well Status
Drilling of the Macondo well had reached total depth ( TD ) at 18,360 feet ( ft ) .
The previous casing shoe was at 17,168 ft .
Open hole diameter was 8 ½ inches ( in ) .
Rotary Kelly Bushing ( RKB ) to Mud line was 5,067 ft .
The open hole had been logged over a four - day period .
7 in by 9 7/8 in casing was run from TD all the way back to the wellhead - - a single string .
The casing had been cemented using +/-100 bbls of slurry .
There were no losses and the plug was bumped .
No back flow was observed after displacement ( although “ U ” tube effect was not significant . )
Top of cement is estimated at 16,200 ft .
9 7/8 in casing hanger was landed with no lock ring ( Reason not known ) .
No pack off or secondary seal was run ( Reason not known ) .
11 hrs after cementing , the casing was tested to 2,650 pounds per square inch ( psi ) with the blind shear rams closed .
Drilling string was run to 8,367 ft .
Sequence of events
16.5 hrs after bumping the cement plug , the draw down or negative test was carried out to establish well integrity prior to displacing 14.3 pound per gallon ( ppg ) oil - based mud out of the well from a depth of 8,367 ft .
This test was carried out part - way through the displacement of the well to seawater including a complex spacer pill , with the well shut in and the kill line open & full of seawater .
Kill line pressure was zero but there was 1400 psi on the drill pipe .
The inflow / draw down test was probably flawed .
It would not equate to what the well would see after the riser was displaced to seawater .
There is also witness statement information that the observation of return flow from the kill line to the cement unit was 15 bbls during the inflow test .
As can been seen in the BP report , there was quite a lot going on during this process , and the data seems rather confusing .
However , the test was deemed to be satisfactory .
The annular was opened up and the process of displacing the well to seawater continued at 25 to 31 barrels per minute .
During this time , oil - based mud was being transferred to the supply boat , so total fluid in and out volumes could not be monitored .
However , flow in and out was being monitored .
20:58 -21:08 hrs there was an indication of increased flow from the riser returns .
This coincided with a slowdown in pump rates and then stopping of pumps to carry out a sheen test in preparation to dump “ clean ” fluid returns to the sea ( fluid spacer ) .
During this period the drill pipe pressure increased ( +/- 200 psi increase over five minutes ) .
21:15 hrs pumping restarted and returns were dumped overboard .
The diverter was closed for this operation so there was no longer flow - out measurement .
21:31 pumps off .
The pump pressure just prior to this had been increasing but then showed , a drop off which could have been a sign of the gas coming up to surface .
Records show 4 telephone calls between the rig floor and the Toolpusher ( drilling manager responsible for all operations ) during this time .
21:31 – 21:47 erratic drill pipe pressure probably due to unloading of riser because of gas expansion .
21:49 Drill pipe pressure had risen rapidly to 5,800 psi .
It is thought that the annular preventer may have been closed at this time .
But since the drill pipe valve ( Kelly cock / stab in valve ) was not closed , the pressure would have reached the pumps where the relief valve pressure could have been exceeded and tripped gas would have flooded the pump room ( this is speculation but quite likely ) .
21:49 All data transmission from the rig were lost presumably due to the explosions & fire .
21:56 hrs The EDS ( emergency disconnect system which closes all valves & rams & blind shear rams on the BOP -- blowout preventer -- and disconnects the riser ) was pressed from a remote location but it did not appear to work .
After loss of hydraulics and communication from the well the AMF ( automatic mode failure system ) on the BOP should have functioned .
This would have closed all BOP rams but not the disconnect .
This did not appear to work .
Post - explosion ROV ( remotely operated vehicle ) interventions were conducted to attempt to activate the blind shear rams , variable rams and other BOP functions .
Leaks were found in the system that were previously noted in the rig log .
Hydraulic system errors such that test rams ( lower pipe rams ) were activated instead of the lower variable rams .
Subsequent NDT ( non-destructive testing ) examination of the BOP indicated that the blind shear rams & variable rams did move and may be in the locked position , but final status will not be possible until the BOP is recovered .
Conclusions
Well Planning
The hanger was run without a lock ring .
Pressures from gas leaking up from the producing formation could have provided sufficient pressure to move the hanger and affect seal integrity .
There was no lock ring or secondary seal ( pack off ) to prevent this .
Hanger was only a single barrier — the cement was and could not be tested .
Gas from the annulus getting past the hanger seal was the most likely source of the kick and subsequent blowout .
Policy & Procedure
The method of conducting the inflow or draw - down test in conjunction with displacement of the well from weighted mud to seawater is suspect at best , and possibly fundamentally flawed .
Basic Rig Practices
The inflow / draw down test did not appear to offer satisfactory results , and also took place over a relatively short period of time .
During the displacement of the well to seawater , volume , flow show and pressure anomalies were evident but did not result in the well being shut in in a timely manner .
Even after there were some indications that all was not well , pumping operations continued .
Returns were dumped and the return flow meter was bypassed , so the rig was effectively blind until things started to get quite serious .
When the well was shut in , the drill pipe safety valve or IBOP was not closed in time to stop rapid rise in pressure getting back to the pumps and probably blowing the pressure relief valves .
What lessons can we learn from this tragedy ?
Stop me if you 've heard this one before .
A record label uses DRM to sort of keep its customers from copying the music .
It turns out that the software poses a threat to the user 's PC .
So the label issues a patch ... which opens up another security hole .
If you guessed that the label in question is Sony , you 'd be correct .
If you guessed that I 'm recapping last month 's rootkit debacle , you 'd be wrong .
It 's déjà vu all over again , as Yogi Berra once said .
On Tuesday , Sony informed the world that its other DRM software contained a security vulnerability as well .
SunnComm's Media Max version 5 is the culprit , with its installation of a directory that could provide a means by which malware writers could hijack a PCs running Windows .
The problem was discovered in late November by Information Security Partners , which shared it with the EFF and Sony .
Common sense would tell most people that if your DRM software a ) is a security risk for your customers and b ) does n't really do anything to solve the problem you think you have , then your best course of action is to drop the whole subject .
Unfortunately , common sense and Sony are only passing acquaintances .
Sony and SunnComm released a patch to fix the vulnerability .
If by " fix , " Sony and SunnComm meant " make the problem worse , " then their solution is a rousing success .
According to Princeton computer science professor Ed Felton , the patch is insecure .
It turns out that there is a way an adversary can booby - trap the MediaMax files so that hostile software is run automatically when you install and run the MediaMax patch .
The previously released MediaMax uninstaller is also insecure in the same way , allowing an adversary to booby - trap files so that hostile software is run automatically when you try to use the uninstaller .
This time , Sony turned to security professionals for help and was able to release an updated patch earlier today that supposedly fixes the problems with the previous version .
If you own one of the 27 CDs that came with MediaMax 5.0 and want to get rid of the software all together , SunnComm offers a web - based uninstall tool .
At this point , I do n't know what I can say about the whole sorry mess that has n't already been said , so I 'll close with this : if Sony is trying to alienate its customers , expose itself to massive legal liability , and get the general public up in arms over DRM , it 's doing a fine job .
If the music label has some other goal in mind , it needs to change its tactics quickly .
