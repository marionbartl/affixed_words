£ 27,000 swine flu bonus for GPs ( who already earn £ 107,000 )
The vaccine : GPs could get £ 7.51 for every jab they administer
Family doctors could see their salaries soar by £ 27,000 once a swine flu vaccination programme is in place , the Daily Mail can reveal .
Yesterday they were trying to thrash out a deal which could see GPs paid £ 7.51 for every jab they give to patients .
They are also negotiating with ministers over their performance - related pay .
They want assurances they will not miss out on bonuses even if they have to cancel routine check - ups due to swine flu pressures - which has already started happening .
Every swine flu patient GPs inoculate will need two doses of the vaccine .
With the average GP having 1,800 patients , that means a salary boost of just over £ 27,000 .
This figure would give doctors a pay rise some 25 per cent above their usual salary of £ 106,000 .
There are 33,000 GPs in the country and the vaccination programme will cost the NHS £ 900 million in payments to them .
The Government is considering using school nurses to administer the vaccine in an attempt to keep down costs .
It will be up to each GP to decide how the money , which will go back into a practice , is spent .
Some doctors may decide to spend the money to cover extra staff costs but others could choose to pocket the cash .
And it has emerged the practice will get the money even though GPs themselves may not deliver the vaccine - the nurse may carry out the job on their behalf .
Critics said it was outrageous that GPs were asking for extra money to do something that should just be part of their job .
They added that it was extraordinary that GPs are demanding yet more money when their pay has gone up by 47 per cent in six years , and they are doing seven fewer hours a week thanks to the lucrative contract negotiated in 2003 .
GPs will find out in several weeks if their demands have been met .
A spokesman for the British Medical Association told the Health Service Journal : ' The seasonal flu jab costs £ 7.51 , but because the swine flu vaccination programme will be on a much larger scale there are also other issues to consider , not least the workload for general practice .
' We want to ensure GPs are still able to provide a good service to patients ill with conditions other than swine flu and that 's why we are continuing to negotiate with the Government on this issue . '
The BMA says GPs should carry out the vast majority of vaccinations because they have access to medical records .
But the Government may empower school nurses to ease the cost burden .
The BMA denies profiteering , saying the extra money is needed to pay for the increased hours of work , and to pay for extra staff .
An increase in calls and visits about swine flu means GPs up and down the country have already begun to cancel check ups in the first sign that the NHS is struggling to cope with the outbreak .
As well as asking for more money for vaccinating patients , the BMA also wants to see GPs ' performance - related pay scheme - the Quality and Outcomes Framework - suspended for the duration of any epidemic to ensure they do not suffer a wage cut .
Around a third of GP pay comes from the QOF , and depends on them carrying out tasks such as giving check - ups to patients with high blood pressure and dementia .
But these may have to be cancelled if doctors are overwhelmed with calls and visits from people with flu , leading GPs to become concerned they may lose money .
Matthew Elliott , of the TaxPayers '
Alliance , said : ' This is an outrageous bit of opportunistic greed by GPs .
They have already had massive pay rises for no extra work , so there is no way they should get away with claiming more money for this , too . '
Flashy threads .
A kickin’ ride .
Ladies who know their place .
It takes a lot to punch the pimp card .
Like most professions , pimps come in all shapes and sizes .
Some are cruel , ruthless monsters who enjoy smackin’ a bitch across the face .
Others prefer a smoother approach in handling the ladies .
Then there are those who dream of a better life , away from the corner .
Whether flamboyant , scary , or both , the big screen has featured a wide variety of hustlers throughout the years .
Here are ten of the best .

7. Doctor Detroit – Doctor Detroit
From nebbish professor to Motown ’s number one pimp .
The Doctor dresses the part , looks the part and talks the part .
Truth be told , Doc Detroit is a complete and utter whack job .
You wo n’t find a more over - the - top or ridiculous performance from Dan Aykroyd .
And what ’s the deal with the glove ?
6. Flyguy – I ’m Gonna Git You Sucka

None more so than Flyguy , an outlandish pimp who sports a zebra-striped sombrero , platform shoes with gold fish in the heels , and a walking cane .
Flyguy is very fly , indeed .
5. Ramrod – Vice Squad
Ramrod is n’t one of those “ good ” pimps .
He ’s a brutal madman who sees no problem murdering one of his girls if she misbehaves .
He is n’t big on style either , unless you call tacky western shirts stylish .
No , Ramrod is a vindictive son - of - a- bitch who hates pretty much everyone , except himself .

New election head to take office
The opposition has accused Mr Chawla of favouring the ruling Congress A controversial new chief election commissioner is to take office in India four days after the start of the marathon five - phase general election .
Navin Chawla will take over from N Gopalaswami , who had urged his rival 's removal from the commission for favouring the ruling Congress party .
The government said Mr Gopalaswami 's demand had no merit .
The Election Commission is an autonomous , three - member body aimed at delivering free and fair elections .
' Short - sighted assault '
Mr Gopalaswami 's term as commission head was always scheduled to end on 20 April .
Mr Chawla will take over as chief commissioner and V S Sampath will be promoted to the three - member body to join current commissioner SY Quraishi .
Mr Chawla will serve as commission head until 29 July 2010 .
Mr Gopalaswami maintained his rivalry with Mr Chawla to the end In January , Mr Gopalaswami petitioned India 's president to remove Mr Chawla , accusing him of " bias " .
At the time India 's Law Minister Hans Raj Bharadwaj said Mr Gopalaswami " should do his work in the EC [ Election Commission ] and not become a political boss " .
The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has also accused Mr Chawla of favouring Congress and last year lodged a complaint with Mr Gopalaswami .
Congress criticised the BJP for an " irresponsible and short - sighted assault " on the commission .
Mr Chawla and Mr Gopalaswami maintained their rivalry to the end .
On Sunday Mr Gopalaswami was the dissenting voice in a split 2 - 1 decision which ruled that Congress president Sonia Gandhi should not be stripped of her membership of the lower house of parliament for accepting a foreign award .
A petition had been brought by a lawyer claiming Sonia Gandhi should be disqualified as the constitution demands that an MP cannot be " under any acknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a foreign state " .
Mr Chawla also faces controversy over the arrest of BJP politician Ashok Sahu .
The Election Commission last week ordered his arrest in connection with an alleged hate speech against Christians in the eastern state of Orissa .
Mr Sahu accused Mr Chawla of behaving in a " partisan manner " .
" The EC is not above the law .
He derives his powers from the law and should function within its ambit , " Mr Sahu said .
Mr Chawla will oversee the final four phases of the election , with final voting on 13 May and counting on 16 May .

YES , WE ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS !
A rundown of military Spending as a percentage of GDP and in total dollar amounts .
Info courtesy of the CIA World Factbook and the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation .
The US spends the most on its military than any other country .
The 2018 US defence budget was $ 700 billion – well exceeding the budget cap of $ 549 billion enacted in 2011 .
The 2019 defence budget is expected to be $ 716 billion .
Why does the US spend so much on defense ?
The US foreign policy dictates military spending .
Its priorities are border defense and upholding international order , as well as promoting and protecting global American interests .
According Todd Harrison , director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , US military size is based on the ability to fight more than one conflict at a time in Europe , the Middle East and Asia - Pacific .
It seems most countries are spending more on defense .
Increase US military spending triggers increased defense spending around the world .
Global defense spending has continued to grow for the past five years and will reach 1.67 trillion in 2018 – a 3.3 % increase from 2017 .
Experts believe this to be an effect of a growing global economy since global military spending is down to 2.2 % of the GDP compared with 2.7 % from the previous year .
Top 8 Countries Who Spent the Most of Defense In 2016
While the US spends the most dollars on the military , almost 14 % of Saudi Arabia 's GDP goes to military spending .
In 2018 , Europe 's defence spending is also expected to rise by 1.6 % .
Eastern Europe will have the fastest growth of defense spending in the world , nearly doubling spending from 2014 .
Russia 's defense spending will fall for the second year in 2018 , reducing its GDP percentage on the military by 5 % .
Commanding NATO
US defense spending is almost three times more than all other NATO members spending put together .
The US spends the biggest percentage of its GDP on the military .
After that , only Greece , Poland , Estonia and the UK spend the mandated 2 % or more of their GDP on defense .
However , that number will rise in 2018 , when Greece , Estonia , Turkey , Latvia , England , Lithuania , Poland and Romania are all expected to hit the 2 % GDP spending on defense .
How Military Budgets are Spent
The US commands the skies with 13,362 aircraft and 10 aircraft carriers .
The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier cost $ 13 billion and uses an electromagnetic launch system to scramble planes faster than ever .
The US has four times more aircraft than China ( 3,035 ) and three times more than Russia ( 3,914 ) .
However , Russia 's military power is on the land with over 20,000 tanks .
China has nearly 8,000 and the US has just above 5,000 .
With the huge geographical size of both Russia and China , it would make sense they spend money on tanks .
When it comes to naval superiority , North Korea has the largest number of ships ( 967 ) , with China as a close second ( 714 ) .
The US is third with 415 .
America 's Military Equipment
3,476 Tactical aircraft
637 Unmanned aerial vehicles ( drones )
760 Attack helicopters
10 Aircraft carriers
157 Bombers
2,831 Tanks
31 Amphibious ships
93 Cruisers , destroyers and frigates
68 Submarines
450 Intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) launchers
Largest Armed Forces by Country
Countries with the largest number of troops also have booming populations compared to the US .
Country # of Troops Population China 2.2 million 1.379 billion India 1.4 million 1.324 billion US 1.3 million 325.7 million North Korea 1.2 million 25.37 million Russia .8 million 144.3 million
Military Spending : Past , Present and Future Although the US defense spending is huge compared to other countries , it has actually decreased since 2007 , while China 's has more than doubled .
The US Defence Budget VS Other Federal Spending
The US does not spend as much on defense as it does on social security and Medicaid and Medicare .
Total Federal Spending 2018 Defense 15 %
Social Security 25 %
Interest 7 %
Other 30 %
Medicare / Medicaid 24 %
Public Opinion on Military Spending
The people of different countries have varying opinions on their country 's military spending .
For example , more than half of those in Poland think their country should spend more on defense , while only 14 % of the residents of Spain agree .
Why do the people in Poland , the Netherlands , Sweden and the UK think their governments should spend more on defense ?
In 2017 , the deputy minister of Poland announced that the country would increase its military spending by $ 55 billion by 2032 .
The increase is said to be due partially to growing Russian aggression .
In 2014 , the Netherlands reversed declining defense spending by increasing it by
$ 385 million until 2017 .
The government made this decision based on the political unrest in the Ukraine , as well as Russia 's shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 , killing 196 Dutch citizens .
Sweden is also increasing its military spending due to recent Russian aggression in the Baltic countries , and reintroducing the draft .
Its 2018 defense budget was raised by $ 250 million and by $ 750 million by 2020 .
Although the UK 's defense spending is up - in - the - air until it leaves the European Union , or Brexit , its military has been calling for increased military spending .
In March 2018 , Rear Adm. Alexander Burton stated to the BBC
If you do not spend more on defense than we currently are as a percentage of GDP , then we put at risk the fact that we are currently a credible military power , and from that we put at risk our position on the global stage .
The Pew Institutes " Spring 2016 Global Attitudes Survey " showed the different levels of support on defense spending by citizens of different countries .
The latest Gallup poll showed that the American people are pretty evenly split on whether the US should spend more , less or the same on defense .
When asked if the US spend too much on the military , 34 % of Americans said yes , while 31 % said spending was about right , and 33 % think the US should spend more .
Much of the increased military around the world , including the US , has to do with modernizing equipment .
Advancing technology can outfit planes , tanks and ships with faster and more effective capabilities , but it certainly is n't cheap .
DAUPHIN ISLAND --
It was odd - fellows day at the scales at the 77th Alabama Deep Sea fishing Rodeo on Saturday and people still can't stop talking about the catches .
Sure , there are plenty of mutant - type fish weighed in the " regular " categories .
I mean , you just do n't see every day a 64 - pound king mackerel or 120 - pound amberjack like those brought Friday .
Fish like these rightfully create an electric buzz around the scale .
You also do n't often see Dr. Bob Shipp , dean of marine sciences at the University of South Alabama , who 's been a rodeo judge since 1980 , leave the weigh station to photograph a fish .
He did that twice to snap shots of Joey Lapeyrouse 's huge king mackerel .
But if you really want to see Shipp 's eyes light up , lay something in front of him like a long - tail bass or lesser electric eel or something with a name like cubbuyu or guaguanche .
Just the names cubbuyu and guaguanche are so out of the norm , the things bearing them just beg to be poked and prodded , " oohed " and " awed " over , and photographed and photographed .
The names make the spell - check on my computer do a double - take , too .
While the cubbuyu , a relative of the barracuda , is pretty cool to look at , it can't hold a candle to the king snake eel , at least in terms of enticing an audible gasp from any spectator lucky enough to see it .
That happened late Saturday when Jim Waller 's 6 - foot king snake eel was hoisted from the dock cart so it could be photographed repeatedly .
Throw in the moment later when Bryan Dean 's conger eel was pulled from the same cart , and you have the makings of some pretty awesome looks on the faces in the crowd .
I even saw one small boy ease closer to his mom when those two evil - looking creatures were pulled out .
It almost made you want to hug the kid .
WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE IN THE GULF ?
VIEW 4 PHOTO GALLERIES FROM THE RODEO
The RSPCA is bracing itself for a surge in numbers of air gun attacks on animals .
This year , the charity has received more than 300 calls about attacks on dogs , birds , cats , fish and horses .
The majority come from members of the public during school holidays , with attacks rising during lighter summer evenings .
Steve Cheetham , the RSPCA 's chief veterinary officer , said : " It is very distressing to think that people take pleasure in causing such horrific injuries to defenceless animals .
These are deliberate acts of cruelty and I would appeal to people 's consciences not to commit such an atrocious offence . "
In February , a male swan was killed with a single shot and his mate shot in the head on a Wolverhampton canal .
Last year , the RSPCA dealt with 759 animals affected by the improper use of airguns .
A Survival Guide to Maven , OR , Why Maven 's Still Cool
27 August 2009
The Problem : Confusion
I 've had a lot of small discussions recently with people where they were just absolutely not interested in using Maven .
Has it somehow gotten a bad reputation when I was n't looking ?
Am I missing something ?
When did I suddenly become the guy using a tool that was too slow , or not agile enough for everybody ?
I can still sing and dance and jump like you guys , too !
Even if I do use Maven ...
So , let old Josh tell you a little bit about Maven .
Maybe we 're not all talking about the same thing .
Consider this a survival guide to Maven .
Maven , like this guide , assumes you 're trying to solve the 80 % cases effectively .
Already , we have a point of confusion !
I 'm pretty confident that your first thoughts on that last sentence were to what Maven considers " 80 % , " and you 're probably wondering what you might reasonably call Ant 's " 80 % " cases .
I would argue that Maven 's " 80 % " is 80 % of a much , much bigger pie .
I have n't met an Ant build yet that could n't be cut down in complexity by using Maven .
Sure , sometimes the resulting Maven pom.xml was more verbose ( though , that does n't happen all that often in practice , either ) , but that 's not the same as complexity .
Intrinsic complexity is one thing .
Surface complexity is another .
I define intrinsic complexity as the concepts required to effectively deal with a problem in a problem space .
I define apparent complexity as the busy work a process presents you with to obtain a goal .
I 'm pretty convinced Ant suffers from both of those kinds of complexities .
I was n't going to start any bar fights about it , but I was pretty sure .
Then , Ruby On Rails debuted and made code generation popular again .
It brought " convention over configuration " to the mainstream .
Then , I knew I was on to something with Maven .
I might argue that when you download
Ant and decide to keep it in your tool chain , you think of it as providing a solution , assuming you 've configured it , to :
compiling Java source files into classes copying resources to the right place , such as .XML files , . properties files , etc. generating . jar or .war artifacts from the aforementioned classes .
generating JavaDocs .
I 'm adding this one as a " maybe . "
Does anybody still do this and actually keep JavaDocs floating around ?
Is the Eclipse or IntelliJ support for rendering in - popup the contents of the JavaDoc not enough ?
The enlightened Ant user will also , maybe , add dependency management with Ivy to Ant 's 80 % cases .
I mention this to be fair , though I highly doubt it 's that common .
I suspect that a lot of Ant users would still relegate that to the fringe 20 % cases .
Alright , so we have our 80 % .
Most people have a sample ant build.xml that they 've lugged around and , when it 's time to seed a new project , they plop it into place and it's got some variables that need to be replaced and then it does most of the things above .
Except JavaDocs and Ivy .
I 'd be surprised , anyway .
Maven 's got all of those features - right out of the box - in 5 lines of XML and a standard directory structure .
This is where it stops being a fair fight .
No matter how much you tug or pull against that list above , chances are you 're at least going to use Ant to compile .
No way around it .
Even the simplest
Ant configuration requires more exertion to acheive that than Maven does .
This point , and this point alone , is why I 'm just not convinced people are taking a look at this and understanding it .
If the goal is simplicity , then there 's nothing simpler than nothing .
If you 've had to put even a moment 's care into that list above , than you 've already wasted time and could have been using Maven .
Now that I 've gotten the soap - box speech out of the way , read on to understand a little bit about it , including how to set it up to do all the things in that list ( and hundreds of other things ) with a few directories and a 5 - 6 line XML file ( the 5 - 6 lines comes from my formatting .
It could easily be 3 lines of XML , if we 're honest .
Things To Know
Where Can I get Maven ?
Maven is freely available , just like Ant , from Apache .
Alternatively , many distributions have it in their repositories .
For Ubuntu , it's
sudo apt - get install maven2
This version , as with all repository packages , is slightly out of date .
But , at least you 're off and running .
How Do I Install Maven ?
The simplest way is , like Ant , to unzip it , and add the bin folder of the directory to your system 's PATH variable .
Alternatively , skip to the next question and simply use your operating system 's repository to install it , if possible .
How Do I Build a Maven Project Building a Maven project is easy , as the command never changes .
mvn install
pom.xml
mvn install
target
target
.jar
.war
target
pom.xml
mvn install
This is true whether it 's your project or somebody elses .
It 's predictable , and consistant .
To use it , ascend to the highest directory in the directory tree that contains afile .
That 's usually the parent project .
Usually , Maven projects cascade downwards , so you might try issuing :
This will generate adirectory in each project ( if there are any ) .
Inspect thedirectory for youror , or whatever you 're expecting .
If for some reason there 's nodirectory in the directory that contains the source code you 're trying to build , descend into it to the point where you 're adjacent to the .
Then , issue again :
How Do I Bootstrap a New Maven Project
The simplest setup requires the creation of directories as well as one XML file .
But , you 'd likely create these directories and at least one XML file with Ant , too .
Run the following on the command line .
NB : I have n't translated for Windows .
I 'm sure it 's easy enough , there , too .
mkdir -p myproject/src/{main,test}/{java,resources}
jlong@studio:~/Desktop/myproject$ find . .
./src ./src/main ./src/main/resources
./src/main/java ./src/test ./src/test/resources
./src/test/java
src/test /*
src/main / {resources , java}
src/main / java
src /main / resources .
You can changeto whatever you want .
This will create a directory structure like the following :
If you 're just getting started and are n't test - driven , then you can ignore .
That leaves you with .
Java code goes in .
Things you 'd like on the classpath of the same artifact , such as Spring application contexts , go in
Finally , you 're going to need an XML POM file .
POM standards for " Project Object Model , " I think .
It 's the sole center for configuration related to your project .
No need to do includes , or externalized configuration or anything .
The simplest pom.xml looks like :
< project xmlns= " http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 " xmlns:xsi= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance " xsi:schemaLocation= " http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd " > < modelVersion >4.0.0</modelVersion > < groupId>com.yourproject.crm</groupId > < artifactId>utilities</artifactId > < version > 1.0- SNAPSHOT</version > </ project >
pom.xml
myproject
You can copy and paste that into a file called , at the root of thefolder created above .
You 're done .
From here , so long as you 're just planning on using the JDK , etc , then this will work fine .
What do those directories and 5 lines of XML buy me ?
Think of that as being equivalent to hundreds of Ant targets .
The project already has enough information to , among other things :
Generate javadocs : mvn javadoc : javadoc Compile classes : mvn compile Compile and generate an artifact ( a . jar , in this case ) : mvn install Generate a Checkstyle report : mvn checkstyle : checkstyle Or , in the alternative ( and perhaps a complement ) : generate a PMD report : mvn pmd:pmd Build a web site with documentation on the structure of the project ( anemic thing that it is ) : mvn site Build a cross reference of the project 's sources : mvn jxr : jxr Setup project files for your favorite IDEs : mvn eclipse : eclipse , or mvn idea : idea ( NB : if you 're using IntelliJ IDEA 7 or later , or Eclipse with the fabulous m2 Eclipse plugin , then you do n't need these plugins .
You can simply ' open ' the project as you would any project by importing or opening the pom.xml .
Netbeans also has incredible support for opening Maven projects directly .
How Do I Add JARs to the ClassPath ?
Short answer : you do n't .
You let Maven handle it for you .
If you need a . jar , more than likely , it 's already available in some repository , in the same way that a package might be provisioned by an operating system ( such as Windows Update on Windows , apt on Debian distributions , rpm on RedHat distributions , port on OSX , etc .. ) .
For Maven , using a depdendency is as simple as identifying it and adding the metadata to the pom.xml .
There are many ways to " find " a . jar .
The simplest is to start browsing a central repository and opening the pom.xml files .
To add a dependency , you need it 's < artifact Id > , its < version > , and its < group Id > .
These elements are usually at the top of all pom.xml s.
To add a dependency on the Apache Commons Lang library to our project above , add the following lines to your pom.xml , right before the closing < project > element :
< dependencies > <!-- plenty of room to add dependencies --></dependencies >
dependencies
.jar
.jar
.jar
< dependency >< groupId>commons-lang</groupId><artifactId>commons-lang</artifactId><version>2.4</version></dependency >
Inside thesection , you will add all your dependency information .
The information you enter could be that for a third party , or ain your own project .
Perhaps one team 's project depends on another's .
If Maven can't find the cached version of the , it 'll download it for you .
To test , simply rebuild it as before : mvn install .
Most of the IDE integrations will have suport for updating the project configuration in the IDE ( i.e. , the classpath ) according to what 's in Maven 's configuration .
If you 'd rather not spelunk through the ibiblio repository site , you can always use one of the many Maven repository indexes .
A good one is Maven Search .
Type in a fragment of what you 're looking for and it'll provide you with matches .
Thus : I entered " commons - lang " and it found results .
Additionally , most of the IDE 's will have support for some form of repository browsing .
I 'm Test Driven !
This one 's easy .
If you do want to use JUnit ( or TestNG ) , then fret not - that 's Maven 's default M.O. !
By default , any JUnit classes put into the src /test / java folder will be compiled and run before proceeding with the build .
The Tour 's Over , What Did You Think ?
In this guide , I 've given a walk through to the questions I can imagine thinking about when setting up a project with Ant .
The result is that you can get a LONG ways with nothing ( the minimal pom.xml ) .
The balance of a given effort is the 20 % stuff .
As they say , the 20 % cases can take 80 % of the time .
I can't speak to whether this is true or not as Maven 's never delayed me , for any particular length , except when I was pushing it to do stuff that nothing else , including Ant , could have done .
Even so , if you hit the 20 % cases , you can rest easy in the knowledge that Maven is built to be flexible and extendable .
It 's whole model is exposed as a lifecycle .
If you want to inject custom logic at a custom point , doing so is easy .
It 's also insanely interoperable .
In fact , even if you do n't want to use Maven but wan't to get a very high quality build script , setup the project using Maven and then use mvn ant : ant .
It 'll generate an ant script that 'll handle most things you 'd want to do .
Finally , if you decide you absolutely can't live without , or translate effectively , an Ant script , there 's good support for running Ant scriptlets inside of Maven .
Go ahead and give it a try if you have n't tried it before or if you were put off .
It 's truly powerful .
The most visible testament to this are the ideas ( like Ivy ) that are inspired by it in Ant .

If Obama had stated that preventive detention would not apply to anyone apprehended going forward , he would have offered a decisive – not to mention , for people like me , more acceptable – policy directive .
The fact that he did not make this distinction cannot help but make one wonder whether the remedies created to address the unfortunate and unacceptable baggage of the Bush years may carry over into his own era .
If that is the case , we might well ask ourselves , what other good intentions might choose to hide behind a legacy that begs for closure ?
~ via The major missing piece in Obamas new Gitmo policy .
I had an interesting discussion with a close friend of mine yesterday , a former journalist who quit the business years ago to get a real job .
We were talking about our early impressions of Obama , and while I kept harping on the bailouts and Obamas bizarre decision to hand the Treasury over to Goldman , Sachs , my friend kept coming back to Gitmo .
He said he could understand how Obama , a young president with no background in economics continually blasted for his lack of experience , could be bullied into handing over his economic policy to worn - out Wall Street gorgons like Larry Summers and Bob Rubin .
Politically , you can see how that could happen .
It s not as if , my friend pointed out , Obama could just hand over the Treasury to Paul Krugman and Simon Johnson and expect the Democratic Party honchos to go for it without complaint .
The Rubin / Summers axis was always going to be the default policy setting for a Democratic president , and it would require spending a lot of political capital to switch to a new paradigm .
Of course theres the other notion , which is that these pro-Evremonde economic policies are actually an accurate reflection of who Obama is .
Everywhere I go I keep hearing people say ,  How come Obama is letting X happen or Y happen , how come hes letting his underlings do Z ?
It seems so unlike him !
It reminds me of the way people view leaders in Russia .
Going back centuries , Russian peasants wrote impassioned letters to the Tsar , sure he was completely unaware that his Grand Dukes were all thieves and his okhranka agents were rapists and torturers .
Now that Obamas on the scene a lot of Americans are demonstrating a similar public desire to believe in the good king .
Obama seems so decent and intelligent , its hard to imagine that his act is just a big sales job , that hes really just a smooth - talking shill for a bunch of Wall Street bankers and Pentagon generals .
So people tend to scramble for the exculpatory explanation : hes being tricked , hes unaware , his hands are tied , and so on .
The Great Derangement :... Matt Taibbi Best Price : $ 1.44 Buy New $ 8.90 ( as of 01:40 EST - Details )
You can sort of see that , maybe , with the economic policies .
If you were bent on clinging to the good - king fantasy , you could hold your nose and imagine that Summers / Rubin cast a spell on poor Barack .
But this Gitmo thing is different .
It s not like Barack Obama doesnt know what habeas corpus is .
The guy was a freaking constitutional law professor ( or senior lecturer ,  if that controversy over his academic title still rankles you ) .
And yet Obama seems to be determined to preserve the whole concept of preventive detention , which is every bit as jarring and upsetting as the preemptive invasion concept Bush introduced .
In fact this whole Gitmo episode should serve as a reminder that the upper crust of the current Democratic leadership has not , for the most part , even publicly renounced preemption .
While John Edwards a couple of years ago said that preemption was wrong on the merits , wrong on the morals , wrong for America ,  both Hillary and Obama have carefully avoided taking any public stance against it .
True , back during the original war vote , Hillary did say that her yea vote should not be taken as a vote for any new doctrine of preemption  except that that s exactly what that vote was , an endorsement of the preemption policy outlined in Bushs notorious  National Security Strategy of the United States paper .
Moreover Hillarys top foreign policy staffer at the time , Lee Feinstein , wrote soon after that  the biggest problem with the Bush preemption strategy may be that it does not go far enough . 
When Kerry ran for president he specifically endorsed pre-emption , only parsing it with one of his classic waffle jobs , saying that any decision for a pre-emptive strike would have to pass some kind of unspecified global test .
And Obama has never really gone near the topic : he did talk about the U.S. having the right to respond to imminent threats , but hed always seemed to mean a genuinely imminent threat , not the  They might have some kind of unnamed weapon with or without a delivery system in thirteen or fourteen years , we better invade now standard that Bush went by .

For a more recent update on Hurricane Bill , CLICK HERE
Hurricane Bill is providing a pretty good lesson on how hurricanes work and forecasting .
If you look at the National Hurricane Center Hurricane Bill Discussion , they note that the winds have decreased and that the pressure was up a bit to 954 mb .
Also , the satellite imagery makes it hard to find the eye .
The Hurricane Hunter Aircraft reports an eye of 14 miles .
If you recall , earlier it had been running about 35 miles and was clearly visible on the satellite images .
One thing that the discussion does not say is that the vortex message indicates that the eye is open in the Southwest quadrant .
On the surface , this all appears to mean that Bill is dying .
In a sense , it is because it is headed toward colder water and a more hostile environment …. but not just yet .
Again , in the discussion it talks about a second wind maxima .
What appears to be going on is that Bill is going through another eyewall replacement cycle .
Most likely , the open part of the eye
is indicative of a deteriorating inner eye all and the second maxima is indicating that a new eye is forming .
The smaller eye is probably a result of the old eye collapsing in .
The pressure rise was not all that dramatic and fairly typical of a storm going through a replacement cycle .
The idea here is that as the storm bends on Saturday from its Friday evening 340 degree vector to a 360 degree heading , it will still be in a relatively weak shearing environment and be over warm water .
It will have completed the eyewall replacement cycle and so it should ramp up a bit in intensity .
This eyewall replacement process is why it is really tough for a mature hurricane to maintain a maximum intensity for a long period .
For that reason , it is rare for a category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the United States .
I think its only happened 3 times .. Camille in 1969 , Andrew in 1992 and a Florida hurricane in the 1920s or 1930s … maybe the Keys Hurricane .
The timing just has to be right .. or wrong as the case may be .
Anyway , Bill ’s uptick will probably not be back up to category 4 status and whatever increase in intensity will not last long .
The big long wave trof has made its way across the Ohio Valley and weekend temperatures will be in the 70’s over much of the region .
It ’s a fall like pattern and Bill is behaving like a fall - like storm .
As Bill moves north …. probably about the time its even with Washington DC , it will start to encounter strong southwesterly winds ahead of the trof and that will start to rip it up .
It will also be running into cold water and as it approaches Nova Scotia , Bill will start to take on a northeastward component and its forward speed will increase rapidly and markedly .
It will lose its tropical characteristics and probably be in Scotland by the middle of next week .
But , even though it may parallel the coast of Nova Scotia and be losing its tropical characteristics , the pressure gradient between it and the big ridge in the Atlantic will still be large and therefore strong winds , perhaps still running about 100 mph will be pushing water on the right hand side of the storm up in the form of a storm surge .
Harbors , bays and inlets in Nova Scotia and other land masses will have a pretty rapid and significant sea rise .
What ’s interesting is that with the storm moving so fast , if it does parallel the coast , then they may see a rapid retreat of extreme tidal surges as the wind shifts around from the north on the back side .
If I ’m in Halifax or anywhere in Nova Scotia , I ’m still heeding the local warnings and advisories .

HURRICANE BILL DISCUSSION NUMBER 26
NWS TPC / NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL032009
500 PM AST FRI AUG 21 2009
AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT REACHED BILL THIS
AFTERNOON AND FOUND THAT THE CENTRAL PRESSURE HAS REMAINED AROUND
954 MB…BUT THE WINDS HAVE DECREASED AND INITIAL INTENSITY IS NOW
90 KT .
THE PLANE REPORTED A SMALL EYE OF 14 N MI DIAMETER .
GIVEN THE CONCENTRIC RING STRUCTURE OBSERVED ON MICROWAVE AND THE
DOUBLE WIND MAXIMA PROVIDED BY THE PLANE …IT IS LIKELY THAT THE
HURRICANE IS GOING THROUGH AN EYEWALL REPLACEMENT AND THE REASON
FOR THE CURRENT WEAKENING .
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BILL TO
REGAIN SOME STRENGTH DURING THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS WHILE THE SHEAR
IS LOW AND BEFORE THE HURRICANE REACHES COOLER WATERS .
THEREAFTER…A STEADY WEAKENING IS INDICATED AND BY 72 HOURS …BILL
SHOULD ALREADY BE AN EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE INTERACTING WITH THE
HIGH LATITUDE WESTERLIES .
BILL IS NOW MOVING TOWARD THE NORTH - NORTHWEST OR 340 DEGREES AT 17
KNOTS .
THE HURRICANE SHOULD GRADUALLY TURN MORE TO THE NORTH AROUND
THE BERMUDA -AZORES HIGH TONIGHT AND SATURDAY AND SHOULD BE FORCED TO
RECURVE AS A LARGE MID - LATITUDE TROUGH MOVES EASTWARD ACROSS THE
EASTERN UNITED STATES .
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY CHANGE IN TRACK
GUIDANCE WHICH IN FACT CONTINUES TO BE TIGHTLY PACKED …MAINTAINING
HIGH CONFIDENCE IN THE TRACK FORECAST .
LARGE SWELLS GENERATED BY THIS HURRICANE WILL AFFECT A LARGE PORTION
OF THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC COASTAL AREA DURING THE NEXT FEW
DAYS .
THESE SWELLS WILL LIKELY CAUSE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SURF AND
LIFE -THREATENING RIP CURRENTS .
PLEASE CONSULT STATEMENTS ISSUED BY
YOUR LOCAL WEATHER OFFICE AND METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES FOR MORE
DETAILS .
AT THIS TIME … TROPICAL - STORM -FORCE WINDS ARE NOT FORECAST TO REACH
NEW ENGLAND .
HOWEVER …A SLIGHT SHIFT OF THE FORECAST TRACK TO THE
LEFT WOULD REQUIRE A TROPICAL STORM WATCH OR WARNING TONIGHT .
THE
WIND SPEED PROBABILITY PRODUCT INDICATES THAT THERE IS ROUGHLY A 25
PERCENT CHANCE OF THESE WINDS REACHING EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN NEW

CPR 's Rick Scott twists in the wind as he tries to explain how he as the CEO of HCA had no idea his former company was participating in the practice of upcoding , where they defrauded the Medicare system for more than a decade and were forced to pay a $ 1.7 billion fine , the highest in U.S. history .
I mean , some would argue , and it would be hard to say they 're wrong , that you would be the poster child for everything that 's wrong with the greed that has hurt our current health - care system .
People would ask , why should they listen to you ?
SANCHEZ : ... which later became HCA , which made you , from my understanding , incredibly wealthy , was charged with defrauding the government for more than a decade and had to pay a record fine of $ 1.7 billion .
SANCHEZ : But you know , let 's talk about this , though .
I mean , the accusation that the White House was essentially making , one that you have n't challenged yet to my knowledge .
Maybe you will here now .
Now , would I rather people show up that care about the debate on -- the way I believe ?
Absolutely .
But when I 'm on radio -- I 'm on a lot of talk radio .
I say show up , read the bill .
SCOTT : Well , I believe -- I clearly believe that government - run health care will be bad for you as a patient .
It will be bad for you as a taxpayer .
It will be bad for our country .
But most importantly , bad for you as a patient .
SANCHEZ : But -- but you 're -- but -- but let 's be fair about this .
You 're not trying to get everybody to go .
You 're trying to gin up the people who are going to be on your side .
I mean , you 've got a lot to gain from this , do n't you ?
I think they ought to show up whatever side you 're on .
You ought to let people know .
I mean , we 're going through a significant debate about what ought to happen in health care .
Show up and tell them what you think .
Some people have used the word " orchestrated . "
I 'm not sure what word you would use .
But do you take credit for making sure this is going on ?
SCOTT : It would be nice to , right ?
But -- because I believe that people ought to show up to these meetings .
They ought to be nicer about it .
But they ought to show up to these meetings and tell them what they think .
And there , you tell people where they can go , to these town - hall meetings .
You tell them what they can do .
You show them videos of what 's been done so far .
SANCHEZ : Yes , yes .
Do you -- do you take credit -- I was just having a conversation with Eric Boehlert and they said , look , this guy has got this Web site .
In fact , I 'll show it to the viewers again .
There 's your Web site right there .
We 'll take it all the way to the very top .
People can see it .
It 's CPR , Conservatives for Patients ' Rights .
SANCHEZ : It sure looks to me like he 's pointing his finger right at you .
Do you think he is ?
SCOTT : Well , you do n't have to listen to me .
You should look at the facts .
You should read the bills .
If you want to go back and look at Columbia HCA , you should look at what we accomplished .
Health - care costs when I got into the industry in ' 88 were 16 percent a year inflation .
When I got out in 1997 , they were less than 1 percent .
We had the highest patient satisfaction ; we had the best outcomes .
Now , if you were in the hospital business in the late ' 80s , you went through Medicare investigations .
President Clinton expanded the investigations .
They said , " If you made a mistake in your filing , that was called fraud . "
Not only did Columbia HCA ...
SANCHEZ : But one point -- but $ 1.7 billion ?
That 's the highest ever paid in the history of the United States that your company ended up having to pay as a result of what you did by defrauding the government ?
SCOTT : The -- no one went to jail .
I was never accused of anything .
Now let 's think about it : $ 1.7 billion sounds like a lot .
We had 343 -- 343 hospitals , 150 surgery centers , over 100,000 patients a day .
Now , let 's look at the industry .
Cleveland Clinic paid big fines .
Mayo paid big fines .
Yale paid big fines .
Now , were they as big ?
No .
How many hospitals did they have ?
SANCHEZ : But you 're the guy who 's sitting here telling us that we can't allow the government to do this because it wo n't work , and they might take over or do some things that are -- that are wrong .
How much more wrong can you be than what you just said ?
Not only has your company screwed up , and you just admitted to it .
But you 're saying , " And look at all the other companies , they did the same thing . "
SCOTT : No , I do n't believe that at all .
SANCHEZ : It does n't sound to me like a sterling system that we have , does it ?
SCOTT : I think -- that 's right .
You ought to fix the system .
You ought to say , why do we have 135,000 pages of Medicare regulations that people work their tail off ?
The hospital industry to this day works its tail off to do the right thing .
But do n't believe me .
Read the bill .
Beside , do you want your taxes to go up ?
Do you want a UK system ?
Do you want a Canadian system ?
SANCHEZ : Some people would answer , yes , they do .
As a matter of fact , in Canada , I think they pay one half of what Americans pay for health care .
And most of them are proud as pudding of their health - care system .
They write me here every day , saying , " I can't believe Americans do n't like our system .
We think it 's absolutely fantastic . "
By the way , let me ask you a question .
Your company was accused of something called upcoding .
That means they treated patients for something minor but charged the government , the taxpayers , for something expensive .
That was the accusation .
Is that true ?
SCOTT : I have -- Rick , I have no idea .
Rick , I have no idea .
I was -- I never did anything with Medicare .
I started a company .
I bought hospitals .
I bought HCA .
I bought all the Humana hospitals .
Let 's go back to ...
SANCHEZ : All right .
Let me ask you this one then .
Here 's the other accusation , as I was reading about what some people say your company may have been involved in .
Your company would go into a region .
They would buy up all the hospitals , and then they would shut them all down except for one to make that one hospital very powerful .
I mean , I guess that 's a good business plan .
But is that good for patients ?
SCOTT : Absolutely .
Now , first off , that did n't happen .
We did buy 20 hospitals that we consolidated .
It goes on every day , and -- not every day .
It goes on throughout the country , all the time .
It 's happened since before I got into the business and afterwards .
But here 's the reason why you want that to happen as a patient .
SANCHEZ : OK .
SCOTT : You want to make sure -- you want to make sure that your hospital has the best equipment .
So if you have a hospital that has more patients and can afford the best equipment , you want your hospital to be successful .
They have the right equipment .
They can hire the right employees .
SANCHEZ : Well , I 'm reading a report here , though , from " The Post and Courier " that says -- they say your hospitals had consistent dirty facilities .
The doctors say the gloves they were asked to used to operate were so cheap they would break .
And nurses say they had to treat so many patients they were n't able to handle the demand .
SCOTT : Well , let 's look at the numbers .
How could I have the lowest cost to a patient ?
I did .
You look at the studies .
I had better patient satisfaction in the industry by a long shot , and I had better outcomes .
Because we measured everything .
So -- so who probably put that out ?
No different than what 's happening today .
The unions put these things out , because they want to unionize your hospitals .
But if you look at the facts ...
SANCHEZ : Yes .
SCOTT : ... lower prices , better outcomes and better patient satisfaction .
SANCHEZ : But you 're not saying all of these things are true ?
I mean , you 're copping to the fact that your company had to pay $ 1.7 billion , which is still the most ever paid in the history of the United States , right ?
SCOTT : After I left , the company paid those fines .
The company did not pay those fines when I was there .
When I bought -- when I bought ...
SANCHEZ : But hold on .
No , no , no , no .
You 're playing -- you 're playing with the facts , sir .
Let me tell you what happened .
SCOTT : No .
SANCHEZ : These charges were charged against your company while you were there , while you were the boss , and it happened over a period of ten years .
Yes , they were paid after you left , but the accused -- but they accused them of happening while you were leading the company ?
You know that .
SCOTT : And , Rick -- and , Rick , it was covering time frames before I bought those companies , and it covered time frames afterwards .
SANCHEZ : I guess the point I 'm making is , though , look , people are going to look at you as the guy who 's telling all these people out there , which is your right as an American and good for them for wanting to get out there and have a point of view and be passionate about their money and their tax money .
SCOTT : Right .
SANCHEZ : But some people are going to look at your record and some of the things that you and I just talked about and say , " This is the guy who 's leading this charge .
Is he the one that we should be listening to ? "
Not exactly a perfect past when it comes to what 's right for taxpayers and patients ?
SCOTT : Absolutely .
If you care about patient satisfaction , if you care about cost , if you care about quality , you absolutely do .
SANCHEZ : All right .
Rick Scott , you know what ?
Thank you , sir , for taking the heat and taking the questions .
We appreciate having you on .
SCOTT : All right .
Thank you .
I wrote about this in 2007 , but there ’s new research :
Scientists from Oregon State University , the University of Washington and McGill University partnered with city workers in 96 communities , including Pendleton , Hermiston and Umatilla , to gather samples on one day , March 4 , 2008 .
The scientists then tested the samples for evidence of methamphetamine , cocaine and ecstasy , or MDMA .
Addiction specialists were not surprised by the researchers ’ central discovery , that every one of the 96 cities — representing 65 percent of Oregon ’s population — had a quantifiable level of methamphetamine in its wastewater .
“ This validates what we suspected about methamphetamine use in Oregon , ” said Geralyn Brennan , addiction prevention epidemiologist for the Department of Human Services .
Drug researchers previously determined the extent of illicit drug use through mortality records and random surveys , which are not considered entirely reliable .
Survey respondents may not accurately recall how much or how often they use illicit drugs and they may not be willing to tell the truth .
Surveys also gathered information about large regions of the state , not individual cities .
The data gathered from municipal wastewater , however , are concrete and reveal a detailed snapshot of drug use for that day .
Researchers placed cities into ranks based on a drug ’s “ index load ” – average milligrams per person per day .
The Supreme Court has an opportunity , said The New York Times in an editorial , to help balance students ' privacy rights against the need to keep schools safe .
The court hears arguments Tuesday on behalf of a Savana Redding who , at 13 , was strip - searched to see if she was carrying pain - relief pills .
" The invasion of privacy was extreme and the security rationale was weak , " so the justices should rule the search unconstitutional .
That would be a mistake , said The Washington Post in an editorial .
Maybe officials should have notified Savana Redding 's mother before the search , or waited until they had evidence that she actually had prescription - strength ibuprofen hidden in her bra .
But school officials need flexibility so they can act decisively to avert danger ; punishing them for bad calls will chill efforts to keep kids safe .
" Schools already have wide latitude , granted by the courts , to inspect lockers and other student possessions with only ' reasonable suspicion , ' " said USA Today in an editorial .
" But strip searches are grossly excessive .
Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules , schools should be smart enough to figure that out . "
Dinosaur bones around 97 million years old have been found in south - west Queensland .
Palaeontologists uncovered the bones and plant fossils at a sheep and cattle station near Eromanga .
The dinosaur awaits official identification but is believed to be a species of the long - necked sauropod .
In the meantime , it has been nicknamed Zac .
The sheep and cattle station already boasts Australia 's largest dinosaur , Cooper , a new titanosaur species , measuring about 26 to 28 metres long .
He was discovered in a previous expedition .
Queensland Museum palaeontologist Scott Hocknull said although smaller than Cooper , Zac 's skeleton was more complete .
He said he believed the discovery to be one of the most exciting in the region .
" The discoveries made this year confirm the site is likely to be of great significance , not only for Australia , but for a wider scientific understanding of the age of dinosaurs , " Mr Hocknull said .
Other discoveries in the region include a long - necked plant - eating sauropod , Rhoetosaurus , found in the 1930s at Roma and believed to be 170 million years old .
Winton is also known for harbouring many dinosaur fossils with some dating from 98 - 95 million years ago .
Banjo ( a carnivorous theropod ) , Matilda and Clancy ( giant plant - eating sauropods ) were found in a vast geological deposit near Winton that dates from 98 million years ago .

EDIT : You may prefer to install the entire haskell platform in one go , which includes cabal .
Detailed instructions can be found here .
Recently I ’ve begun to learn Haskell , the lazy functional language .
Haskell is backed by a large library of packages , called Hackage .
On Hackage , libraries and programs in a wide variety of genres are available for download .
In order to simplify the download and install process for these packages a tool was born to allow command line grab / install maneuver .
Think apt - get for Haskell .
The tool in question is called cabal , and it ’s quite useful during Haskell development .
Unfortunately , I ’ve run into some issues while using it , mainly to do with resolving dependencies .
I ’ll get to that later .
Installing Cabal
Installing cabal was not as straight - forward as I had hoped .
I first went to the offical cabal download page , to see what my options were .
The only option on that page was to download a tarball and install it by hand .
Of course , having been pampered by the power of apt - get , I figured there had to be a better way .
Unfortunately , it seems as there is not .
No cabal package exists in the Ubuntu repositories .
I downloaded the tarball and prepared to install .
The install from the tarball was painless as manual installs go , but unfortunately I had to resolve multiple dependencies to get the build to succeed .
Here were the steps I took :
# get our dependant libraries ( this assumes we already have ghc6 installed ) sudo apt - get install libghc6 - network - dev libghc6 - parsec - dev libgh c6 - mtl - dev libghc6 - zlib - dev #grab the source wget http://haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-0.6.2/cabal-install-0.6.2.tar.gz
#untar it tar - xvvf cabal - install -0.6.2.tar.gz #install it sh cabal - install - 0.6.2/bootstrap.sh # link the executable into our path sudo ln -s $ HOME/.cabal/bin/cabal /usr/local/bin/cabal
Using Cabal
Cabal is not limited to simply downloading libraries .
It can also allow you to easily create libraries of your own and upload them to Hackage , and also build projects ( similar to make ) .
cabal -- help will bring up your main options , which is always a good starting place .
Let ’s look at installing a package using cabal .
cabal install [ package - name ] installs the given package name .
This should be very familiar to anyone who has used a package manager such as apt - get .
cabal list [ string ] is like apt - cache ; it searches Hackage for packages pertaining to the string you entered .
Explore !
Have fun !
there ’s plenty more features of cabal that I wo n’t be covering now , yet are plenty awesome .
Problems
I ’ve had some strange dependency issues ; for example , installing bloxorz –
cabal install bloxorz
gives me an error while trying to build a dependency that in turn depends on a C library which is not auto - resolved .
Fun .
Fortunately , such errors seem to be few and far between .
It 's the planet that really should n't exist – or at least not for long .
It is 10 times the size of Jupiter , orbits its own star in under 24 hours and should soon be spiralling into the surface of its searingly - hot sun .
Under the laws of physics , planet WASP - 18b orbiting a star 1,000 light years from Earth is too big and too close to its sun for comfort .
The tidal interactions between the two massive objects should be pulling them together in a deadly gravitational embrace .
British astronomers say they have made a highly unusual planetary discovery in finding WASP - 18 b .
Either they just happened to have witnessed an exceptionally rare event that they have likened to winning the lottery , or they do not understand the tidal forces affecting distant planets beyond our own solar system .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The problem with this planet is that it 's very massive and very close to its star .
It should be creating tidal bulging that makes it spiral into its star , " said Professor Andrew Collier Cameron of St Andrew 's University .
The planet is at least one billion years old , yet at this rate it should have no more than half a million years left before it crashes into its own star .
The chances of finding it at this point in its life cycle is about 1 in 2,000 .
Professor Cameron said : " This is another bizarre planet discovery .
The situation is analogous to the way tidal friction is gradually causing the Earth 's spin to slow down , and the Moon to spiral away from the Earth , " he said .
" In this case , however , the spin of the star is slower than the orbit of the planet , so the star should be spinning up , and the planet spiralling in , " he said .
WASP - 18 b , one of more than 300 known " exoplanets " orbiting distant stars , was discovered by a team led by Coel Hellier of Keele University , whose study is published in the journal Nature .
It is a hot , Jupiter - like planet where temperatures exceed 2,100C – high enough to create clouds of silica - based gems , according to Professor Cameron .
If anyone could visit this planet , and survive , they might see a sky full of diamonds and sapphires , he said .

Rural residents who drink water from private wells are much more likely to have Parkinson ’s disease , a finding that bolsters theories that farm pesticides may be partially to blame , according to a new California study .
Nearly one million people in the United States - - one of every 300 - - have the incurable neurological disease .
Beginning with a slight tremor , Parkinson ’s often progresses to severe muscle control problems that leave patients struggling to walk and talk .
Over the past few years , a growing body of evidence has led many experts to suspect that pesticides can attack developing brains , perhaps in the womb or infancy , leading to neurological diseases later in life .
Many insecticides widely used on farms are potent neurotoxins , and lab animals exposed to mixes of them develop Parkinson ’s symptoms .
In addition , several previous studies of farmers and rural residents have reported a link .
The new study of more than 700 people in California ’s Central Valley found that those who likely consumed contaminated private well water had a higher rate of Parkinson’s .
The risk was as much as 90 percent higher for those who had private wells near fields sprayed with the widely used insecticides propargite or chlorpyrifos .
People with Parkinson ’s “ were more likely to have consumed private well water , and had consumed it on average 4.3 years longer ” than those who did not have the disease , said the scientists , led by UCLA epidemiology professor Beate Ritz , in their study published online in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives .
Unlike municipal water supplies , private wells are largely unregulated and are not monitored for contaminants .
Many are dug at shallow depths of less than 20 yards , and some of the crop chemicals used to kill pests and weeds can seep into ground water .
The study participants lived in Fresno , Kern and Tulare counties — the heart of California ’s farm belt .
About 17 percent reported drinking private well water during the study period from 1974 through 1999 .
Previous studies have reported connections between Parkinson ’s and consumption of rural well water and pesticide use .
The UCLA research , however , is the first to examine people ’s proximity to specific chemicals and estimate their exposure .
Incorporating a geographic information system and land use maps , the researchers based their analysis on California ’s pesticide use records .
A weakness of the research is that the scientists do not know exactly what each person in the study was exposed to because private wells are not tested .
Close proximity to sprayed fields does not necessarily mean their wells were contaminated .
The UCLA team examined state records identifying where pesticides were used between 1974 and 1999 .
They then compared the address of each participant in the study to those records .
From that , they estimated each person ’s exposure via the air and the water based on how much pesticide was used within 500 meters of their homes .
Jonathan Chevrier , a University of California at Berkeley postdoctoral researcher in epidemiology who did not participate in the research , said the new effort “ is an interesting study ” that “ goes further than prior research ” in connecting pesticides to Parkinson’s .
Most other studies had no exposure information at all , while the UCLA scientists tapped into the historical data , which Chevrier called “ a major strength . ”
Nevertheless , he added , “ it is important to note that the authors did not measure the water concentration of pesticides or determine the amount of well water participants consumed . ”
Twenty - six farm pesticides were included in the study , although six with widespread use were studied individually to look for connections to Parkinson’s .
The goal was to identify specific pesticides that may warrant further investigation .
People drinking well water within 500 meters of a dozen or more of the pesticides had a 66 percent greater rate of Parkinson ’s , the study says .
Airborne exposure only slightly increased the risk .
The strongest link to the disease was for propargite .
Those who had wells near fields sprayed with the chemical had a 90 percent higher risk of having Parkinson ’s , according to the study .
About half a million pounds of propargite were sprayed on California crops in 2007 , mostly on nuts , corn and grapes , according to the state Department of Pesticide Regulation ’s database .
Propargite , sold under the names Omite and Comite , has been used on crops since 1969 , but many uses , including the spraying of many fruits and beans , were rescinded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1996 due to the cancer risk .
The EPA , however , in 2001 approved its continued use on restricted crops and reported that levels in drinking water are below levels of concern , based on the cancer risk .
Other strong links were found for the insecticides methomyl and chlorpyrifos , which increased the risk of Parkinson ’s by 67 percent and 87 percent .
Chlorpyrifos , sold under the names Dursban and Lorsban , was banned in the United States for residential use in 2001 but is still widely used on cotton , corn , fruit trees and other crops .
Methomyl is highly restricted because of its toxicity and is mostly used on alfalfa .
In recent years , scientists have gathered a large amount of human and animal evidence suggesting that exposure to agricultural pesticides , particularly early in life , may play a major role in who gets Parkinson’s .
University of Rochester scientists found that newborn mice exposed to a mix of two commonly used pesticides — maneb and paraquat — developed Parkinson ’s symptoms as they aged .
Earlier this year , Ritz and colleagues reported similar human results after investigating Central Valley residents exposed to those same two pesticides .
Parkinson ’s is caused when nerve cells die in an area of the brain , called the substantia nigra , that produces dopamine .
As dopamine decreases , messages from the brain that control how and when the body moves are blocked .
Only a small percentage of those with the disease share a gene or family history of the disease .
Experts say the cause of the vast majority is probably due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors .
This article originally ran at Environmental Health News , a news source published by Environmental Health Sciences , a nonprofit media company .
The original series had very tactile interfaces for the controls - utilizing levers , knobs , and buttons at each station on the ship .
Later series and movies evolved into a more modern " touchscreen " sort of interface .
Can you maintain that feel of the original series controls and still present those devices as " futuristic " now that our culture has taken great strides towards more modern touchscreen devices ?
Colombia 's government says it is close to sealing an agreement with Washington to make Colombia a hub for US anti-drug operations in South America .
The deal would give the US access to air bases in Colombia to gather intelligence and support operations against drugs production and terrorism .
Colombian officials have rejected accusations that the deal would infringe the country 's sovereignty .
Colombia is the biggest recipient of US military aid in the Americas .
The US was forced to look for a new centre for regional operations after Ecuador refused to renew the lease on its military base of Manta .
Ecuador 's left - wing president Rafael Correa , a political ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , has said he would rather " cut off his arm " than allow the Americans to stay on at Manta .
" The aim is to defeat drug - trafficking and terrorism "
Jaime Bermudez
Colombian Foreign Minister Final details of the Colombian plan are still being worked out but the US may use at least three air bases , including Malambo in the north , and Palanquero and Apiay in the central region .
A maximum of 800 US military personnel and 600 civilian defence contractors would be based in Colombia .
They would operate the US aircraft that maintain 24 - hour monitoring of the region , intercepting communications and coordinating with spy satellites to protect US interests .
Controversy
The US mission is supposed to be primarily against drug - trafficking , but also has a counter - terrorism element as Colombia 's rebels groups are on the US list of terrorist organisations .
Colombia may well be a close ally of the US , but this latest deal is causing controversy , says the BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Medellin .
Rafael Pardo , the presidential candidate for the Liberal Party , said he was concerned about how relations with neighbouring countries would be affected because the US aircraft operating from these bases would probably be collecting intelligence on these nations .
But the Colombia Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez said : " The aim is to defeat drug - trafficking and terrorism . "
He said the agreement would respect Colombia 's neutrality and sovereignty , and would not affect ties with neighbouring countries .

BELGRADE , Mont .  President Obama on Friday accused some insurance companies of trying to undermine his plans for overhauling health care by “ funding in opposition , ” a comment that could inflame tensions at a time when Mr. Obama is hoping to keep insurers at the negotiating table .
The president , who did not mention any company by name , made the comment in a question and answer session at a town - hall - style meeting here .
He was responding to an insurance salesman who challenged him on why the White House had decided to “ vilify the insurance companies ” by shifting its strategy from talking about reshaping health care to emphasizing changes in health insurance .
“ O.K. , that ’s a fair question , ” Mr. Obama told the salesman , Marc Montgomery of Helena .
He went on to say that some companies have “ been constructive , ” citing Aetna , whose chief executive , Ronald A. Williams , is a major Obama supporter .
Mr. Obama then criticized other companies , though not by name .
“ Now , I want to just be honest with you , and I think Max will testify , ” Mr. Obama said , referring to Senator Max Baucus , the Montana Democrat and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , who is spearheading the Senate legislation .
“ In some cases what we ’ve seen is also funding in opposition by some other insurance companies to any kind of reform proposals . ”

In 2008 , a cargo ship was grounded off Blackpool after being hit by a freak wave
Scientists in the US have made a major advance in their understanding of so - called freak waves .
These monster waves present a major risk to ships and offshore platforms .
A computer simulation developed by oceanographers in the US could help locate where and when these " rogue " phenomena are most likely to occur .
The theoretical study shows that coastal areas with variations in water depth and strong currents are hot spots for freak waves .
The history of seafaring is littered with tales of rogue waves capable of rending ships asunder .
A freak wave is one that measures roughly three times higher than other swells on the sea at any one time .
These phenomena can measure up to 18 m ( 60 ft ) - the height of a six - storey building .
The new computer simulation was developed by Tim Janssen of San Francisco State University ( SFSU ) and Thomas HC Herbers of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California .
Their findings are published in the Journal of Physical Oceanography .
Focal zone Sandbanks and strong currents may cause waves to change direction and speed .
This concentrates wave energy into a single point , which oceanographers call a " wave focal zone " .
This zone is like a burning glass , Dr Janssen explained , where the light comes in and focuses all the energy on a single point , forming a hot spot .
The same happens when a wave travels over , for example , a sandbank , or over a current .
The energy is being focused on to a single point .
The research could help inform the design of offshore platforms
The researchers found these hot spots were much more likely to drive the formation of extreme waves .
" In a normal wave field , on average , roughly three waves in every 10,000 are extreme waves , " Dr Janssen explained .
" In a focal zone , this number could increase to about three in every 1,000 waves . "
The scientists fed data on real waves into their computer model .
Then , they repeated a single experiment over and over , each time using different data .
The SFSU oceanographer said he next hoped to go to known freak wave hotspots such as the Cortez Banks on the coast of California to test whether his simulations held true .
" What 's really important about this research , is that it is easy to validate .
We have a theory now , a prediction , and we can go to areas and actually measure whether this happens or not , " he told BBC News .
Vital knowledge Understanding where and when freak waves are most likely to occur could assist shipping and navigation in coastal areas .
The knowledge could be used for marine weather forecasts and could also inform the design of offshore platforms .
" If you know that a certain area is very prone to freak waves , then you might wish to stay away from it , " Dr Janssen said .
" Anybody out in the ocean would like to [ have this information ] . "
However , Dr Janssen was keen to stress that the study is theoretical .
" We have tried to be as realistic as we could , but we are a long way away from making a prediction solid enough for people to actually use .
However , it might be something to work towards , " he said .
Dr Janssen added that the word " freak wave " was unfortunate , as it suggests these types of wave are unexpected .
But , he explained , the random nature of ocean waves means that any size of wave can happen at any time .

In a classic case of one step forward , two steps back the City of Portland is now proposing a design contest to redesign PortlandOnline .
And it ’s spec work .
[ HTML3 ] Sigh .
And just when we thought things seemed to be going so well with the City of Portland .
I mean , the City had committed to being more open , gone out for bid on fixing the PortlandOnline site , and just ratified the Portland Economic Development Strategy .
Yet , now that string of victories risks being thoroughly undermined by a slap in the face to the Portland Web and graphic design community .
In a classic case of “ one step forward , two steps back , ” the City of Portland is now proposing a design contest to redesign PortlandOnline .
And it ’s spec work .
I ca n’t decide who said it better , Reid Beels or Robin Catesby .
Now , you can try as hard as you might , but few things can be as insulting to people as telling them their work is worthless .
Which is basically what the City is doing by asking for designers to work on spec .
Web developers , graphic artists and visionaries to transform the navigation and design of PortlandOnline , the city ’s primary web presence .
Winners will be fully credited on the website for their work – a website that receives over two million visits a month and includes over 140,000 pages .
That ’s right .
Or to paraphrase , that work that you do ?
It is n’t worth anything more than a link .
Now , I ’ve had the opportunity to work with graphic designers in Portland for years and years .
And I ’ve often been in awe of their ability .
With good reason .
Portland has one of the most brilliant graphic design communities in the United States , if not the world .
So great .
Yes , definitely go to that community for help .
But ask them to work for free ?
Are you kidding me ?
At best , that ’s insulting .
And whatever the case to not support the community that has played a huge role in making Portland what it is today ?
That ’s downright shameful .
But do n’t just take my word for it .
Thanks to Reid , let ’s check out the AIGA — the professional organization for design — position on spec :
AIGA , the professional association for design , believes that professional designers should be compensated fairly for the value of their work and should negotiate the ownership or use rights of their intellectual and creative property through an engagement with clients .
[ HTML2 ] AIGA acknowledges that speculative work — that is , work done prior to engagement with a client in anticipation of being paid — occurs among clients and designers .
Instead of working speculatively , AIGA strongly encourages designers to enter into projects with full engagement to continue to show the value of their creative endeavor .
Designers and clients should be aware of all potential risks before entering into speculative work .
[ HTML2 ] AIGA is committed to informing designers , students , educators , clients and the general public on the risks of compromising the design process though information , materials and services that can help in forging a healthy working relationship between designers and their clients .
Long story short , there is — in my opinion — absolutely no benefit to spec work .
It devalues the work of designers and it delivers sub-par to design to the recipient .
The City of Portland should know better .
Given that the contest has yet to open , I ’d strongly encourage the City of Portland to reconsider their position on this project .
And I ’d urge you to do the same .
UPDATE 1
Lizzy Caston ‘s letter to the City of Portland in response to this contest .
[ HTML4 ]
UPDATE 2 ( hat tip to Jeff )
Pop
Art ’s response to the City of Portland spec work request .
It was with enormous disappointment , and more than a little indignation , that I read that the city has elected to “ crowdsource ” the project to any Portland resident , offering as compensation “ credit on the finished web site . ”
UPDATE 3
Stacy Westbrook provides her thoughts on the PortlandOnline design contest :
Now , I know I sound angry and I kind of am , but mostly I ’m disappointed .
Even if these were good economic times , a “ design contest ” for such a complex project is never a good or ethical proposition .
Mostly , this is a slap in the face for professionals who already have to struggle against the notion that being creative should be free ( or close to free ) .
Now we ’re getting it from our own city ?
UPDATE 4
Jerry Ketel of Leopold Ketel & Partners takes some time to weigh in on the PortlandOnline design contest — and appears to have started a new blog , to boot .
This is simply the wrong way to go about designing an important communication tool in our fair city .
The idea of this kind of contest is a perfect example of how much the city fathers value the contribution of the design community in Portland .
I am certain that there is a very good Web design firm here in town who would work for pennies on the dollar to help the City of Portland to polish its presence on the internet … .
Our community wants to be a seen as a creative magnet in the world , it is a source of pride .
So why do n’t our elected leaders get that ?
And leave it to Metroknow at OurPDX to unleash the full complement of snark by announcing a new design contest for Portland creatives :
But here ’s the thing : times are tough for the likes of a creative - friendly person such as myself .
I would love to have a completely redefined , resculpted , warm - to - the - touch , shapely , hopefully ” spoonable ” , and definitely unimpregnable brand spankin ’ new intercontinental junk trunk installed smack dab between my Alaskan Tundra and my South American tip , ASAP .
But times being what they are , and especially in light of current crowd sourcing trends , I have a brilliant idea : I would like this skilled service , this ass craft , this peASS de Resistance , designed for – you guessed it : Damn free .
UPDATE 5 ( 7/14/2009 )
The City has posted the rules and criteria for the PortlandOnline Refresh redesign contest ( PDF ) and FAQs about the contest , including :
HOW DOES THIS CONTEST FIT INTO THE PORTLANDONLINE REFRESH PROJECT ? [ HTML2 ]
This community contest is the beginning step of developing a concept for the new look and feel of PortlandOnline .
The City is inviting the entire community to participate in both generating graphic ideas and in voting on the winner (s ) as a seventh member of the judge ’s panel .
Following the decision on one or more design concepts , the City will likely need the help of a design firm – through a separate contract – to implement the new design on the City ’s main pages and for its sub‐pages for different City bureaus and projects .
[ HTML2 ] WHY AREN ’T YOU OFFERING A MONETARY PRIZE FOR THIS ? [ HTML2 ]
Offering prize money would have turned the contest into a formal purchasing process .
We would have had to issue an RFP and then make a decision to go with one firm .
This would have precluded many from participating , including youth , those freelance designers and artists without a business license , City employees , design students , or individuals or firms without sufficient insurance to bid on a City RFP . [ HTML2 ]
It also would have made it impossible for the people of Portland to vote on the final design .
Holding the contest does not preclude future contract opportunities .
If the contest is successful , it will likely lead to a contract for refining the design .
More updates as the story develops .

Sony 's 80 GB PS3 is $ 300 starting tomorrow and its similarly priced 120 GB PS3 Slim is just a few weeks away , so how does a 25 % price cut stack against the competition ?
Have a look at my chart below and see for yourself , and just remember , everyone has different wants and needs .
Some people do n't care about Wi -Fi and work around it with an Ethernet cable .
Others think $ 50 a year for the " privilege " of playing online multiplayer is exorbitant .
Do n't assume those bottom line prices are necessarily your bottom line .
Use the chart as a build - it - yourself tool .
Points of clarification :
1. I 've baselined with the 120GB hard drive this time around ( see last time ) since in my view it 's become the minimum standard for juggling downloadable movies , games , music files , etc .
( In fact for me , 120 GB is almost too small . )
That said , you can certainly build out an Xbox 360 Arcade with the $ 50 cheaper 60 GB hard drive if you like , or stick with the Xbox 360 Pro's default 60GB .
2. The Xbox 360 Arcade comes with 5 arcade games and a 256MB memory unit , if that 's of interest .
The Xbox 360 Pro and Elite models have at various points sold with promotional games , but are n't currently .
( Rumor is , Microsoft plans to phase out the Pro entirely and drop the price of the Elite to $ 300 . )
3 . All accessory prices taken from Gamestop , accessed 8/18/09 .
You can certainly find better deals if you shop around .
As always , I picked a popular retailer to level set .
4 . Remember that the above chart does n't gauge the " soft " value of features like Xbox LIVE or PlayStation Home or any of the many intrinsic ( by design ) or gratis services included with either system .
5. Update : Engadget reports the PS3 Slim 's hard drive bay is swappable .
I 've adjusted the chart accordingly .

Flood that email flag@whitehouse.gov with a variety of different messages , otherwise they ’ll use filters to sort out those opposition emails that use the same phrasing .
I ’ll ( Thank you Kathy Morrison ) be starting with these messages :
Is it true that through your health care plan a government representative will be trying to convince my grandmother not to seek health care ?
Why is tort reform off the table ?
How about using some of that trillion dollar stimulus to pay for health care instead of increasing taxes as Geitner and Summers accidentally acknowledged would be necessary ?
Why belittle those who have gone to town calls upset that the current health care plan is too costly and too intrusive , when this is clearly not a ‘ fringe view ’ ?
Why not put the 535 on the same plan ?
We the people are paying for the plan the house and senate get we should have a say on what they get ?
Why did the House and Senate vote themselves exempt from this plan before they ever even saw it and yet expect us to settle for it ?

we are not robots – we want answers and we want what the 535 get – or they settle for what we get – CASE CLOSED - if it ’s good for us – let them settle for it too .
As for Obama bragging about his health care – we are paying for it – remember that – while he laughs and says he ’s got health care and it ’s not for him .
He ’s right – we are paying through the nose for him , the Czars and the 535 to have nothing but the very best – for life !
And also remember – when we fire or jail the crooks they and their families get health care and benefits and pensions for life - only the very best – at our expense while they are forcing this unread bill that the 535 exempted themselves from down our throats .
Remember they rushed in from all over the country to sign a bill exempting themselves from ours .
That was the first clue – a red flag !
WAKE UP AMERICA .

Just out from Bloomberg :
Aug. 24 ( Bloomberg ) --
The Federal Reserve must make public reports about recipients of emergency loans from U.S. taxpayers under programs created to address the financial crisis , a federal judge ruled .
This is in relation to a lawsuit filed by Bloomberg LP against the Federal Reserve on November 7 , 2008 , in Southern District of New York ( 08-09595 ) , in which Bloomberg sought material loan and collateral data in relation to emergency loans released by the Fed , and which were previously claimed to be non-FOIAble .
This is a large blow against the Fed and specifically against organizations using FOIA loopholes from providing critical information , particularly in cases involving trillions of taxpayer dollars bailing out huge , systematically and politically embedded financial organizations ( which lately is pretty much all of them ) .
The conclusion from the order just issued by District Judge Loretta Preska is as follows :
The Board 's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED , and Bloomberg 's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED .
Specifically :
1 . The Board shall produce forwith the Remaining Term Reports within five business days of the date hereof ;
2 . The Board shall search forthwith records at the FRBNY that constitute " Records of the Board " within the meaning of 12 C.F.R. # 231.2( i ) ( 1 ) ; and
3 . The parties shall confer following their review of the results of the search and inform the Court by letter no later than September 14 , 2009 how they propose to proceed .
The beneficial outcome means that many more FOIA - based lawsuits against the Federal Reserve will now spring up , and with case law on their side , the outcomes of most will likely be on behalf of the plaintiffs .
This could detour any short - circuit attempts by either Congress or Senate to prevent a Fed audit , as it may suddenly not be necessary , now that there is this alternative venue to get various pieces of information , previously not available to the general public .
Divided country in North Africa has two system and is fighting a cold war of attracting unity and secesion .
The North unity because of benefit and South want separation because of opppresion .
We do n’t know which one will succeed , benefit or Oppression .
If the South want to vote for unity it must ask itself what is the force of atraction ?
If it choose separation what causes it ?
For me and those who have long vision the South shoud choose secesion : for these reasons : Saharia Law is dangerous for unity , Islamic Relgion is dangerous for unity , Arab cutlure is dangerous for unity , Arabic langauge is dangerous for unity , Arab League is dangerous for unity , Arab civilization is dangerous for unity , Southern minerals is dangerous for unity , Agricultural and forestry alnd id dangerous for unity , Animal hubandry is dangerous for unity , Arabs are civivlised 99 % ahead of us in education , foreign policy , military warfare , economic welfare , socially development and the list continue .
While the South was going on in with war in the last 53 years and before the South was going on with education , social development , military and economic development during and after colonial time .
The Nortrh was already far ahead by 99 % during independence 1956 .
The British left the government in their hand and they are the one who fought the British out .
During this time we had primitive chiefs and less educated person Chief Executive Officer Ciricio Iro who signed unity on behave of the South after receiving bribes from the Arab where he he was offered leadership of Sudan for 24 hours and this will be done to any Southerners who think he will rule in Khartoum after Referrandum .
Arabs started to torture us before colonial time and after until CPA and even now the torture continues , no money in the South while the North has pleanty and no development in the Souht while the North is now manufacturing AIRPLANES .
During Addis - Ababa Agreement similar thing happened , no salary in the South and no development .
aLL DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS WERE TRANSFERED TO THE nORTH TO LEAVE US A MARKET PLACE .
This cause Addis - Ababa Agreement to collapsed in 1983 because of frustration .
Abel Alier the so called Lawyer was used to destroy Addis - Ababa Agreement and now he is being again being used to detroy CPA .
HE IS NOT FIT TO HEAD THE ELECTION .
THERE IS AGENDA IN HIS APPOINTMENT .
One of the worse weaknesss of the South is ambtion of power and money .
Everyone wants to be a minister regardless of ability .
People fight for power and cause division , hatrate attract money for themselves by betraying other Southerners like Lam Akol .
He was peaceful when he was messing up as Minster of Foreign Affairs and when removed because of failure to respect the regulation of his party decided to form a party so as th weaken the SPLA / M from succeeding in separation after being bribed by the NCP / NIF .
Now he is mobilizing his tribes and NCP TO DESTROY THE REFERRndum .
Tribalism in the South is to remain in power whether efficient or dorman .
These leders appoint relatives based tribalism to gain favour from the tribeS and this is the cause of assignement of responsibiltiy to people who cannot manage and as such the country cannot progress .
These people have no plan for development even for themself .
All Southerners must accept the truth if they choose unity it will be the third time Southern are going are going to be cheated .
Let us follow the vison of President Ghaddafin .
He told the truth and all notion will support our independence .
SPLA / M should change their vision from NEW SUDAN because the concept and its vison is dangerous to the South ?
How can you mix new things with the old one to form good combination .
Where is the quality .
Something must either be new or old .
Where is the leader of the so called NEW sUDAN ?
He wad made to disappered before enjoying his vision that he miscalcualte .
He was cheated and executed because the old vision knew he was going to take power .
The rest of the people are not a theat because they are pictures .
The First Vice President , is nothing , He fear his position in the North and is only President in the South .
Who sits in he Chair in the North , now one knows .
It is either empty or the second Vice Presidentt .
Why do you claim for a chair you cannot manange ?
The Foreign Minister is voiceless in the media as if there is not Foreign Minister in the Sudan .
Voices of other junior Arabs in the Ministry are the one active .
Why do you claim the chair you do n’t know how to manage because of lack of ability or inferiority complex , fear , experience and qualfication ?
Lastly , Can a Southern lead United Sudan ?
Big
No , because it cannot lead South Sudan that is minute region ?
Let us snot forget the truth unity is dangerous .
Leave the North to Arabs who are advanced in everything and let us start from scracth in the South fighting tribalism , nepotism , weakness in education , economic , militray and scoial service .
We are rich in mineral and Agricultural and it will take us less time to catch up with the North instead of accetping second class citizen in the Sudan where we are in .
We do n’t want another militray war , we must end this war by voting Arabs out in the South and if the Nubas and Blue Nile wants to join us they are welcome , if they want to be alone let them choose , if they want to be with the Arabs let them choose after all they share similar culturE .
These two region or more should not confused freedom the South has fought for before and after Independence of the Sudan and is now up to us to leave it take it .
The South will always be with marginalized areas to fight against freedom
What is a mancession , you ask ?
It 's not this .
It 's a recession that hurts men much more than women , and we are allegedly in the worst mancession in recent history .
Eighty percent of job losses in the last two years were among men , said AEI scholar Christina Hoff Summers , and it could get worse .
Here some graphs provided by Mark Perry , an economist from the University of Michigan who coined the term mancession that , with any luck , is not long for our world .
Unfortunately this trend does n't look to be reversing itself any time soon .
This following graph is particularly incredible , as it demonstrates that the difference between male and female unemployment is at a half - century high , with men taking a 2.5 percent lead .
In the late 1970s and mid-1960s , it was women who were behind by that same margin .
As Michael Mandel shows here , male unemployment in every age category is nearing a post - war record .
Perry is n't alone pointing out the terrible toll this recession is taking on men .
Mark Penn , Hillary Clinton 's former pollster , notices a macrotrend that guys are falling behind in all sorts of factors these days , from alcoholism , to prison rates , earnings and life expectancy .
How do we explain this ?
The decline in manufacturing jobs is certainly one thing .
Greg Mankiw adds another likely explanation : Residential construction , which boomed during the early part of this decade , has been eviscerated in the housing slump .
Nine out of ten construction workers are male , and seven out of ten manufacturing workers are men .
Those sectors alone have lost more than 2.5 million jobs .
And who works in the health and education sectors ?
According to the
Secretaries and administrative assistants , 3,168,000 Registered nurses , 2,548,000 Elementary and middle school teachers , 2,403,000 Cashiers , 2,287,000 Retail salespersons , 1,783,000 Nursing , psychiatric , and home health aides , 1,675,000
Three of the top six occupations for women are in the rare sectors that have been growing over the last decade .
The Great Mancession , as silly as it sounds , could be deeper , and more long lasting , than the Great Recession .
On the other hand , many women are in industries that are n't facing such devastating , and possibly permanent , upheaval .
I keep coming back to this graph about net jobs created in the last ten years in the health and education sectors :
And who works in the health and education sectors ?
According to the Women 's Bureau of the Department of Labor , the most prevalent occupations for women are : Three of the top six occupations for women are in the rare sectors that have been growing over the last decade .
The Great Mancession , as silly as it sounds , could be deeper , and more long lasting , than the Great Recession .
Update :
We go an email and phone call from Brent Huston with Microsolved .
This mailing was part of an authorized pen test .
Nothing to worry about ( right now ) , but the best practices to deal with such issues still apply .

The National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) published an interesting advisory here :
http://www.ncua.gov/news/press_releases/2009/MR09-0825a.htm
Member credit unions evidently are reporting receiving letters which include two CDs .
The letters claim to originate form the NCUA and advertises the CDs as training materials .
However , it appears that the letter is a fake and the CDs include malware .
We have not heard about this scheme affecting any other targets , but please let us know if you see something like this .
Malware delivery via USPS has certainly been suggested before .

If you 're scared of heights , it may be time to look away now .
Not content with having the tallest building in America , the owners of Sears Tower in Chicago have installed four glass box viewing platforms which stick out of the building 103 floors up .
The balconies are suspended 1,353 feet in the air and jut out four feet from the building 's Skydeck .
Floating on air : Visitors get their first view from The Ledge , four glass balconies suspended from the 103rd floor of Chicago 's Sears Tower
Designers say the platforms - collectively dubbed The Ledge - have been purposely designed to make visitors feel as they are floating above the city .
The reward is unobstructed views of Chicago from the building 's west side and a heart - stopping vista of the street and Chicago River below - for those brave enough to look straight down .
' It 's like walking on ice , ' visitor Margaret Kemp , from Bishop , California said .
' The first step you take you think " Am I going down ? " '
Fearless : Anna Kane , five , spreads out on the floor of the 10ft square box which is 1,353 ft up
Spectacular :
She also enjoyed amazing views out across the city
' At first I was kind of afraid but I got used to it , ' 10 - year - old Adam Kane from Alton , Illinois , said as clouds drifted by below .
' Look at all those tiny things that are usually huge . '
John Huston , one of the owners of the Sears Tower , even admitted to getting ' a little queasy ' the first time he ventured out on to the balcony .
However , after 30 or 40 trips , he seems to have got used to it .
Thrillseekers :
The boxes jut out four feet from the building and were specifically designed to make visitors feel as if they are floating
' The Sears Tower has always been about superlatives - tallest , largest , most iconic , ' he said .
' The Ledge is the world 's most awesome view , the world 's most precipitous view , the view with the most wow in the world . '
The balconies are 10ft high and 10ft wide , can hold five tons , and have glass which is 1.5 inch thick .
Unfazed :
Although some adults felt dizzy after experiencing the Ledge , children seemed to take it in their stride
Long way up :
Even the floor of the platforms are glass - few were brave enough to look straight down
Inspiration came from the hundreds of forehead prints visitors left behind on Skydeck windows every week .
Now , staff will have a new glass surface to clean : floors .
Architect Ross Wimer said : ' We did studies that showed a four - foot - deep ( 1.2 metres ) enclosure makes you feel like you 're floating since there 's only room for one row of people , not two . '
The Skydeck attracts 25,000 visitors on clear days .
They each pay $ 15 to take an elevator ride up to the 103rd floor of the 110 - story office building that opened in 1973 .
The viewing platform is on the 103rd floor ... towering above the height of buildings such as London 's Canary Wharf Tower
Rage Screens Show Off ' Virtual Texturing '

Becoming a freelance web designer is a common dream among many designers , although it takes quite a bit of talent , business savvy , committment , and time .
With all there is to consider when becoming self - employed , one can become overwhelmed — enough to deter themselves from trying at all .
Realizing many Smashing readers probably already have a head - start into the world of professional and freelance web design , this post is meant to act as not only a step - by - step guide , but also as a checklist for those who have already started their career .
Hopefully this guide can cover all aspects of becoming a professional and freelance web designer , from business aspect and working with clients , to creating an effective portfolio and advertising one ’s work .
Also consider our previous articles :
1. Do the Necessary Research
The absolute first step into any freelancing career is to do the needed research ahead of time .
Freelancing is a huge life and career change , and one needs to look into exactly how it will change life before diving in .
Research the Costs
Making money on one ’s own terms sounds incredibily appealing , until the realization comes that it ’s a lot less money than working at a company ( at first , at least ) .
Below is just a short list of expenses to consider .
Make sure they are covered when venturing into a freelancing lifestyle .
Domain name and hosting services
Stationery , Business Cards , and other marketing material
Needed software
A desk space and supplies
Subscriptions to stock photo sites and other forms of resources
On top of that , consider basic living expenses and additional emergency or living money .
At this point , a formal budget is not needed , but it ’s a very smart idea to go over the basic numbers of starting a freelancing business , and maintaining it .
Most of the time , designers must save up before starting a freelancing career .
Taxes & Insurance
While most aspiring freelancers will slowly transition into the lifestyle , opposed to quitting their day job cold turkey , it is important to look into taxing information , insurance , and other assets that will be changed with self - employment .
Because local laws and personal circumstances can vary so significantly , new designers should research this area on their own .
Research the Time
A more specific schedule can be setup later , but it ’s a good idea to look into the time requirement for work each day , per week , and even per month to handle X amount of clients .
For some , the time needed to be invested in this type of career path is not currently available .
Consider current social or family happenings , career responsibilities , and for some — even school .
If it is not a good time in life to change focus , it may not be a good time to start freelancing full - time .
Sometimes it is appropriate to put dreams on hold .
With that being said , set a realistic date to begin a true freelancing lifestyle , whether that means just easing into it now , or setting a time in the future to go full - time .
If all consideration is put into place , the idea is well researched , then it can be time to start a freelance web design career !
Below are the remaining steps to take .
2. Become a Brand
There are many differences between a young freelance web designer just trying to get by , and a successful freelance web designer with their business and future in mind .
One of those differences is that successful freelance designers understand , and pay close attention , to branding .
Branding a business , even if only a one person operation , can do a lot of things in terms of the business ’s sucess .
A good brand builds credibility , client loyalty , delivers a target message to clients and other businesses , and even aids in marketing strategy .
What ’s in a Name ?
The name of a freelancing business can signify a lot , and most designers just choose to use their full name as the brand name .
This is fine , but another option is to use a specialized brand name .
Depending on the future plans of the business , it is smart to think closer about an official name .
If one plans on turning an individual freelancing business into a firm one day , a name other than the designer ’s given name may be more appropriate .
Also , a specialized brand name may be more memorable than the designer ’s given name , and the posibilities are then endless as far as finding an SEO friendly name , or a name that gives off a portrayal of the business it represents .
On the other end of the spectrum , it ’s easy to see the benefits of using a given name as a business name .
Using a designer ’s given name is always original , and something uniquely personal to the designer .
Really , both can be successful decisions , but it is a decision that is often times taken too lightly .
The way the brand is futher marketed depends largely on this decision .
Below are successful examples of both instances .
Here are four great examples of using a specialized name for the brand :
In contrast , here are four great examples of using the designer ’s actual name as the brand .
All of the examples above are the portfolios of individual designers .
However , one will notice that designers who chose a specialized name for their brand often call themselves a studio .
This gives the impression that they are a bigger business ; a more formal organization .
The portfolios with given names , though , provide a more personal appeal — something many clients look for .
This often gives them more of the true freelancer feel .
Depending on how a designer wants to operate their business , the clients they want to attract , and based on the future goals of the business , the final decision of the freelancing business name can have many possibilities .
Logo
After the official brand name is decided , it ’s time to start creating a logo around it .
Many beginner designers do n’t understand the importance a logo has in a brand , or even how important a brand is in itself .
Opposed to creating a quick logo in the process of designing a portfolio template , a logo should be made separately and with the utmost consideration .
Below is a small showcase of excellent logo design in a few web design portfolios .
Because these designers , and so many more , took the extra time to create a well - branded and effective logo , they have the opportunity to expand the logo design to stationery , business cards , advertisements , and more .
Not to mention , these logos serve the origial purpose of logo design — to create a brand , build business loyalty , and create an image that aids in recognition .
A designer will want to create a logo that represents their design style , and that will attract a client that is looking for that type of web design .
To create a great logo , read up on logo design principles , tutorials , and logo design processes .
Below are just a few of these tutorials and walkthroughs .
An Elevator Pitch
There is a lot more to being a successful freelance web designer than just being good at web design .
Any sort of freelancer has to be an entrepreneur as well .
Rule # 1 for entrepreneurship : create an elevator pitch .
For those that do n’t know what an elevator pitch it , it is a premeditated , well thought - out introduction to one ’s services or a person ’s business as a whole .
Let ’s take a look at a better definition .
Excuse the use of Wikipedia for a professional reference , but Wikipedia ’s definition of an elevator pitch is just about perfect for the freelance web designer :
An elevator pitch ( or elevator speech ) is an overview of an idea for a product , service , or project .
The name reflects the fact that an elevator pitch can be delivered in the time span of an elevator ride ( for example , thirty seconds and 100 - 150 words ) . …
A variety of other people , including entrepreneurs , project managers , salespeople , evangelists , policy - makers , job seekers ( web designers and freelancers ) , and speed daters commonly use elevator pitches to get their point across quickly .
—
Elevator pitch , Wikipedia
Take the time to create an elevator pitch for a freelancing business .
For a freelance web designer , it can venture beyond the traditional use of a speech in an elevator , to the introduction to a portfolio , the about page , or as an introduction to an application for a freelancing position .
Many marketing gurus leave the assumption that the creation of an elevator speech for a business will increase the client list dramatically .
Usually , this is n’t the case — at least not directly .
What it will do though is still quite useful :
Save the designer countless hours in coming up with a smart introduction over and over again .
Create a professional atmosphere for a portfolio , or whereever it is used .
An elevator speech will make sure that any new introductions do n’t leave out vital information about the services or freelancing business .
The following is an example of an excellent elevator pitch for a 45 royale web design studio .
45 royale is an enthusiastic web design studio located in the bustling metropolis of Canton , Georgia .
We promote web standards and bring energy and commitment to our work every single day .
— 45 royale Inc .
The above is a strong example for a small , yet established business .
Freelancing can use the same principle , but with a more personal approach :
Hi there , my name ’s Brian Wilkins and I am a web designer / front - end developer living outside Boston , Massachusetts .
I currently work at Reelpoint , an online design and marketing firm .
I build clean and functional interfaces .
With a hunger to constantly grow and evolve as a designer , I have a genuine passion for art , typography , design , technology and creative thinking .
— BrianWilkins.net
That detailed elevator pitch can be seen on his about page , telling potential clients exactly what he does .
On the front page , as part of his portfolio design , he includes a much shorter , but equally effective pitch :
I ’m a web designer that creates clean and modern content for the world wide web .
Taking the time to create an elevator pitch can help launch a freelance career through the use of business tactics .
Below are some further resources for creating a great elevator pitch .
An Overall Style
The last thing to do is create an overall style for the freelancing business .
Fortunately , most of this is accomplished by the above several factors .
The overall style , colors , textures , and even how a designer presents one ’s self should reflect the style of work a designer completes .
To promote consistency throughout the life of the freelancing business , though , designers need to look at branding in a more broad sense when first starting out .
Creating a color scheme , design style , and other overall design guidelines based off of the logo design , and information presented in the elevator pitch .
Then , stick to the brand as the freelancing business progresses .
3. Create a Portfolio Website
Step number three is an obvious one — create a portfolio website .
However , it deserves a decent overview and closer look because we as designers are our own worst clients .
Many new freelancers , or anyone just entering the web design world of business , will open Photoshop and start grinding away .
Instead , think about what a portfolio can actually do .
A mediocre portfolio will have a great design , and show off a designer ’s past works .
However , an excellent portfolio will do the following things :
Reflect and grow a designer ’s brand .
Show a client not only what a designer can do , but what the designer can do for them .
Show great talent , but also business savvy and professionalism .
Intrigue potential clients strongly enough so that they stay on the website long enough to make contact with the designer .
Provide a user - friendly interface for the client ( who very well may not be so Internet or design savvy ) .
Keep all of this in mind during the design process of a web design portfolio .
Make note that a designer ’s portfolio has to be their best work .
Furthermore , consider the following items when creating , or even modifying a design portfolio .
Consider a 1 - Page Portfolio
It ’s called direct response marketing , and it ’s proven to be one of the most effective forms of marketing to get the most sales .
It ’s bascially a method that involves making a huge impact in the most direct way possible .
In the world of web design , this means an incredibily effective and amazing portfolio — but in only one page .
Of course , this is n’t a great method for everyone , especially those who offer more than just basic web design services .
However , without a one - page design , a designer can still take use of this knowledge by applying more direct - response marketing to their portfolio .
This may mean simplifying it , puting the contact form on the front page , and merging similar pages together .
Provide a traditional email address and other information , but most importantly , include an email form .
It makes things easier for the potential client to get ahold of the designer , even if only to ask for more information .
This then provides further opportunity for the designer to sell their work .
The form above ( Komodomedia ) is a perfect example because it gives the visitor various options for the form , rather than just requesting a quote .
This designer has made themselves approachable , which is an excellent way to gain more clients .
Also , above the form , there are other ways to contact the designer , which may be suitable for different visitors .
Make the Most Important Things Noticeable
Make sure the most important components of a portfolio design are out in the open and easy to use and find .
For most , this means the contact form and information , the portfolio pieces , and the logo .
A perfect example is Alexandru Cohaniuc ’s portfolio .
The biggest text on the page is “ Portfolio ” , “ Hi , I ’m Alex ” , and “ Contact . ”
Right above the word “ Portfolio ” is the logo , strategically placed in the top left .
4. Build Legal Documents
To make things really official , a designer has to create some legal documents .
These can be reused for each client , but must be made initially to deal with potential problems later .
Contract
A contract is a necessity for a freelancer of any sort .
It will help protect the designer and the client , as well as outline some rules and guidelines .
For more information on how to create a freelance contract , check out the resources below .
In addition , one can hire a technical writer or other writing professional to do the job .
Terms & Conditions
Terms and conditions are a more in - depth view of the rules between the web deigner and the client .
Again , one can hire someone to write a terms and agreement paper for them , otherwise here is a great template : Terms and Conditions Template .
Copyright Agreement
A third needed agreement is a separate copyright agreement .
Designers are always at risk for work being stolen and miscredited .
A copyright agreement is a way to protect that work , and a way to set further rules for who can use the work .
Because copyright law can vary among different countries , we wo n’t get much into it here .
It is important , though , to research copyright law , know one ’s own rights , and apply it to one ’s own circumstances .
5. Find a Starting Wage & Budget
Deciding on a personal starting wage is difficult , because we never truly know how much to pay ourselves .
As anyone can guess , someone just starting out in freelancing wo n’t be making much .
A new designer just has to make sure they have basic living expenses paid , and a bit of cusion room for emergency costs or budget mishaps .
Pros and Cons of Fixed - Priced Projects
A fixed - priced project is one where the designer and client agree on an overall cost for a design project ahead of time , and the payment is completely independent of how long it takes the designer to complete .
Below are some pros and cons of using this method .
Pros :
These types of project can be easier to apply to a monthly budget .
Designer ’s with efficient methods to save time during a project wo n’t be unfairly punished with a low cost .
It is easy to see how many projects per month need to be completed to determine profits and budget handling .
Cons :
It is much more difficult to determine a fixed - price for a project before actually completing it .
Sometimes designers are underpaid using this method .
Payment does n’t come at regular intervals , which may not be suitable for all lifestyles .
Pros and Cons of Hourly Wage Work
While hourly work may be what we ’re all used to , there can be some equal pros and cons to consider when thinking about this payment system as a freelancer .
Pros :
Budgeting is easier for those that require a daily or weekly budget .
It is harder to become under or over paid for a project .
It is much easier to explain to the client the final cost of a project .
Cons :
It is hard to determine our own hourly rate based on the judgement of our own skills .
It is more difficult to work with a monthly budget .
Timesheets need to be filled out and there needs to be an effective way to transfer timesheets back and forth between the designer and client .
A closer look into these two types of payment plans can help a beginner decide .

FreeAgentCentral.com

6. Create a Résume
Without a strong portfolio just yet , new freelance web designers need to rely on a strong résume .
This is a designer ’s true chance to flaunt their skills in full detail .
Most of us learned how to create a résume back in high school , and another good portion of us probably still hold on to our most recent one today .
When venturing into a new freelance web design career , though , it ’s time to tweak it to meet the needs of this new career path .
Below are some resources for creating the perfect résume for web designers and freelancers .
For a newly created web design freelance portfolio , providing a download link to a designer ’s full résume may be just what the client is looking for .
7. Find “ Portfolio Building ” Clients
Now that just about everything is set up , it ’s time to take action .
Finding the first few clients is always tough , because nobody wants to hire a nobody .
It may be near impossible to find good , well - paying clients yet , so sit tight and take on the first few “ portfolio building ” clients .
Consider Offering Free Services
Image source : On the Block
Working for free is never fun , but it may be necessary .
Do some volunteer work for a church or another non -profit / low budget organization .
These services obviously are n’t hard to sell ; just put an ad up for yourself up on Craigslist or in freelance and web design forums .
When creating an ad to offer free services , be sure to avoid failure .
This means setting limits — no designer wants to spend a month on a complicated job making no money .
Offer only PSD templates , 1 - page websites , or something of the like .
Of course , this is n’t an option for everybody because we all do n’t have the time , nor the patience to do a free job .
If that is the case , explore some options below to get paying clients that will gladly deal with a new designer .
Advertise Locally
Put up fliers or an ad in the local newspaper to gain some local recognition .
Not every potential client knows where to look online for web design services , and it may very well be that many are looking locally .
Otherwise , they ’re only finding top Google - ranked web design businesses that they ca n’t afford .
If a new designer comes to them offering cheaper services , whether in the form of a newspaper ad , a flier at a grocery store , or through word - of - mouth via friends and family , they ’ll be very happy to hire .
Offer Freebies or Sell Templates
One more option requires no actual clients at all .
Many designers choose to make free templates in their spare time , and use them to advertise their services , show off what they can do , and in some instances , sell them for some residual income .
Over at ThemeForest , Collis has sold a PSD template at $ 10 — 168 times .
This means over a thousand dollars in his pocket , and a great portfolio piece to show off .
Unless one makes spewing out free or cheap templates , Wordpress Themes , or scripts their full - time business , this is n’t going to be a great option for making monthly living expenses .
It is however , a great alternative to 1 ) get a designer to create some portfolio pieces , 2 ) get the designer ’s name out in the community , and 3 ) let the designer make a bit of extra cash .
However , it is important to try a few real clients as well , for the business experience .
Then what ?
After finding a few clients , keep these few things in mind .
Create a personal ( yet professional ) connection between the first few clients .
This may welcome great testimonials and word - of - mouth clients .
Offer variety in your services when starting out .
For example , one may want to try logo design , web design , and basic coding .
Later on , when trying to add a new service to the freelancing business , this will make for a much easier transition .
Just because new designers have to deal with low ( or no ) wages , does n’t mean they should offer low - quality work .
Put in the hours and create something great .
Keep in mind that there is more to the first few projects than just the money .
BaseCamp BaseCamp is a very popular project managment tool for freelancers .
With BaseCamp , a freelancer can share files , set deadlines , assign tasks , organize feedback , and more .
Zoho Writer Essentially , Zoho Writer is an online word processer .
In addition to being that though , it is aimed at freelancers , with the ability to share documents and collaborate with clients in various ways .
Big Contacts
Big contacts is an online contacts solution to help share files , email , have meetings , send notes , and more between the freelancer and client .
8. Create ( and Stick to ) a Schedule
A huge part of freelancing is finding a schedule that fits the designer ’s needs , and allows the designer to get the necssary work done on time .
It is a step in itself to becoming a professional freelance web designer .
Find the Hours Necessary
To find a schedule , a designer needs to find how much time it actually takes them to do the tasks at hand .
A freelancer has to ask themselves , “ How much time does it take to create a simple PSD template , and then how long does it take to code it ? ”
Depending on the skill sets of individual designers , this length of time can greatly change .
However , work from previous clients or the creation of sample templates can give a rough estimate .
After determing how long the workflow takes , decide on a daily hourly input for work — and work only .
A Daily Schedule
A general daily schedule depends greatly on each designer ’s personal lifestyle , and is something that needs to be predetermined in order to be successful .
After a designer realizes how much time it takes daily to get the required amount of work done , he or she should create a daily schedule for themsleves .
A daily schedule will help aid the designer to stay on track , instead of constantly checking email , jumping back and forth between projects , or ignoring client work altogether .
A Weekly & Monthly Schedule
On top of a daily schedule , freelance professionals should also make a weekly and monthly calendar .
A broader calendar can be used to keep track of deadlines and plan out longer projects .
Whether it be a calendar hanging on the wall or a web - based calendar like below , make sure to keep track of deadlines , payment schedules , and other checkmarks along the way of a project .
Find the Motivation
Anyone can see the benefits of a steady schedule , but the hardest part for most may be staying motivated to keep to it .
Below are some things to keep in mind if the urge to break a preset schedule creeps up .
Do the same specific thing during work at the same time every day .
For example , check email first thing in the morning , then start directly on client work .
For those who have already quit their day jobs to pursue this career :
Wake up at the same time everyday .
If it means sleeping in a few extra hours than the traditional worker , that ’s fine .
However , having a constantly altering start to the day can mess up a schedule , even if things are done in the same order during wake time .
Write a to - do list in the morning of items that need to be addressed that day .
Use a calendar and daily planner to keep track of daily , weekly , and monthly tasks .
Dejal Timeout Quite the opposite of most time managment software , this application actually tells you when to stop working .
With timed breaks , this tool can help a freelancer have an overall more relaxing career .
Google Calendar Google Calendar is a great option for those that use Google ’s other tools a lot , in that it will be all in the same place .
Like many of Google ’s other tools , it is free , versatile , and very useful .
Ta -da List Ta-da
List is an easy to - do list tool hosted online for convenience .
It is easy to create lists for one ’s own use , or for others .
9. Create a Business Plan
One of the most boring and tedious tasks one can do is create a business plan .
Most might feel free to skip this step , but wait a moment and consider the benefits ( and assurances ) of taking the time to create one .
Benefits of a Professional Business Plan :
Creates a real business in the designer ’s eyes , and in the client ’s eye .
A business plan can be used in tricky legal situations , to differ the business from just a hobby .
Identifies future plans , direction , and goals for the business .
Keeps the designer , as a business owner , on track with the development of the business .
Upgrades the simple monthly budget to a long - term financial structure .
Anyone can see the benefits range from business growth , to financial growth , and credibility .

10 . Know How to Gain Recognition
Not all designers are marketing experts , but a bit of knowledge about how to gain recognition in the freelance web design world is necessary to be successful .
Designers should do research on marketing , and create a long - term plan for the growth of their portfolio and their reputation as a freelance designer .

Use social networking sites to not only promote a portfolio , but also to promote new designs and projects .
In addition , one can use Twitter , or something similar to get valuable feedback on current projects .
For more ideas on how to get the most out of Twitter as a web designer , take a look at Ramsay ’s post : 5 Simple Ways Twitter Can Make You a Better Web Designer .
Also , those who are active within social media communities benefit far more than those who use them for only self - promotion .
Create a community , find other designers , and even discover some interesting finds along the way .
Take the time to enjoy social media websites , while gaining recognition as a web designer .
Get Recognized in a Crowd of Applicants
Knowing where to look for more work is necessary when depending on that work for a decent income .
However , with thousands of freelancers floating around in forums , job boards , and other sources of possible clients , getting noticed can be some hard work — especially when others ( who may be doing it for just a hobby ) are willing to offer their services extremely cheap .
To get noticed by clients and win a job , follow a few of these simple rules .
Do n’t apply to jobs that are more than a few days old — chances are they ’ve been filled , and it ’s really a waste of time .
Use multiple job board websites and forums to have a wider range of possibilites .
Be a good designer .
This sounds like a dumb tip , but often times clients get application for web designers that either 1 ) are n’t good at design or 2 ) have designs that show no unique abililty and are very ordinary .
Do n’t apply for jobs that you do n’t qualify .
Client ’s can’t stand hearing , “ I have n’t done a design for the style you ’re looking for , but I ’ve been creating websites for X years and could probably do it . ”
The next designer that comes to them with a decent portfolio proving they can meet the client ’s needs is going to get the job instead .
This should n’t even have to be said , but sadly , it does : Capitalize your sentences , use correct grammar , and do n’t make spelling mistakes when applying for a freelance job .
As for the best tip of all — do n’t sell work cheaper than it needs to be just to gain a client .
If a client ca n’t see why a logo design costs $ 200 when the kid that applied the day before is offering the same service for $ 20 , then it ’s really their own loss .
Somtimes it ’s worth losing jobs , and that ’s a part of the difficulty when just starting out .
11 . Blog often , but pay attention to the quality of your posts
Blogs are great for improving search engine rank and gaining popularity in the web design community .
Whether designers have a lot of time or barely enough , a blog showcasing interesting finds or discussing anything related to the web design or the freelancing profession can gain an audience fast .
Below are just a few websites that use blogs to promote their general careers as freelance web designers .
WellMedicated.com really does n’t update that often — only about once every two months — but it ’s still a well respected design blog in the community .
Andrew Lindstrom is a freelance web designer , and spends most of his focus on that .
However , with a great following on his blog , he can easily gain traffic to his web design portfolio through his sidebar and about page .
In a recent interview of Steven Snell of Vandelay Design , Steven discussed how the popular Vandelay Design Blog was indeed intended to bring more traffic and clients to the Vandelay Design portfolio .
Well , that mission was very successful , and the blog changed direction to fulfill the wants of a different audience , as a full - time design blog .
Now , it is updated every few days and it ’s goal is no longer to bring portfolio traffic .
However , with a link to the portfolio and further information about the web design business , there is no doubt it still does .
Chris Spooner ’s blogging experience started with just some simple experimentation , and as a place for him to simply explore and share .
However , the blog soon gained a lot of popularity , and now does great work in promoting his portfolio as well .
So the lesson to be learned is , no matter what reason a designer has to start a blog , it can be a great source for traffic and a way to gain recognition in the community .
Not to mention , the additional income from selling advertising spaces .
12 . Get into the Community of Freelance Web Designers
Do n’t be a freelancing loner .
Getting involved in the community and meet other web designers and freelancing professionals to grow as a designer .
Make contacts within the community by blogging , joining a design network like Envato , and using forums .
One could also donate freebies to larger communities , or try to do guest posts .
Below are just a few ways gaining a strong social network in the community can help a freelance web designer .
It creates a support group .
Guessing that many freelance web designers do n’t have many offline friends or family that do the same thing for a living , having an online support group for your field of interest can be very beneficial .
Get into the web design community to share , rant , rave , and get feedback as a designer .
Learn new things .
Following a blog regularly , being active in social networking sites , and participating in forums is a great way to improve your current abilities , and expand horizons .
Instead of grinding away at what needs to get done or what needs to be learned for a current project , being a part of a community will help you to explore new things and find inspiration .
Become an authority and let the clients come .
Being the best designer in the world does n’t make that designer an authority figure .
As skills and wisdom improve , others in the web design community will reference a designer ’s work , portfoio , and services for them .
Attend Conferences and Other Face - to - Face Events
Attending various web design and other conferences for webmasters is not only a great way to network with other designers , but also a great way to learn new things and keep up with the latest trends .
Get to some conferences , and become a real person , rather than just an online presence .
Below are just a few popular conferences within the community .
AnEventApart.com
An Event Apart is an intensely educational two - day conference for passionate practitioners of standards - based web design .
If you care about code as well as content , usability as well as design , An Event Apart is the conference you ’ve been waiting for .
Carsonified For Web Designers , Creatives and anyone who cares about web design .
Web Design World
Since 1997 , we ’ve helped thousands of Web designers learn what they need to know to make better web sites , manage web projects , and get home at a decent hour .
As a freelancer , we have the ultimate schedule for attending these events , and it can be easier than for others to gather the funds .
In order to truly succeed , freelance web designers should attend these events to socialize , learn , and grow their freelancing web design career .
13 . Reinvest the Income
It takes money to make money , so when starting out , reinvest some of the income made back into the freelancing business .
It ’s tempting to pay off bills or buy something nice once it can be afforded , but dedicate a certain percentage to the business ’s growth .
Among the many things that need to be maintained for a freelancing business are software upgrades , hosting and domain renewals , desk space upgrades , stationery , and more .
In addition to maintinence items , though , some of the income may be turned into a luxury web design item — for fun and for work .
Figure how much of the income is actually needed for living expenses , and use either all of the remaining profit , or a strong percentage of the profit to go back into the business .
14 . Get a Professional Space
Finding a place to do work may help new freelancers differ play time from work time .
On another note , a good workspace is needed to keep organized and create an effective workflow .
Below are two great workspaces that are effective and fun , both held as a home office .
The workspace of Ben Mautner provides a lot of worspace to get things done , with plenty of inspiration handing on the walls as well .
Jay Hilgert ’s office space is is clean , neat , and trendy — but also has all the necessary equipment .
Beyond a home office ’s benefit of staying organized and aiding in getting some work done , it can make anyone finally feel like a true professional freelance web designer .
You may want to take a look at the workstations of other designers as well .
15 . Keep Learning New Tricks
As the final stage of the transformation comes into completion , there is only one more thing that needs to be done to create and maintain the status of a professional , freelance web design career .
That final step is to keep learning .
Designers should always be discovering new practices , techniques , standards for client work — and also tweaking their own business along the way .
Conclusion
Hopefully , this walkthrough can help most web designers just starting out in freelancing go down the correct path .
Freelancing in the web design niche is an exciting and freedom - filled career path , although it requires a mix between design , development , and entrepreneurship .
Finding a good grasp of all three can only mean success as a freelance web designer .
Because everyone ’s experiences are different , for anyone who has already accomplished a freelancing career , feel free to share further tips and advice for doing so .
It ’s always great to hear and discuss more tips .

Little Wars is a set of rules for playing with toy soldiers , written by H. G. Wells in 1913 .
Its full title is Little Wars : a game for boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys ’ games and books .
Little Wars is considered by some to be the first modern table top war game .
It included fairly simple rules for infantry , cavalry , and artillery in the form of a toy 4.7 inch naval gun that launched projectiles , usually small wooden dowels to knock down enemy soldiers .
In addition to it being a war game , the book hints at several philosophical aspects of war .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
A useful principle of political analysis is to be suspicious when everyone agrees .
Which is why the bipartisan paeans to " prevention " in this summer 's health care debate have me scratching my head .
It 's the one reform on which Henry Waxman and John Boehner can join hands .
Do n't get me wrong : officials are right to say our system is crazily tilted toward paying docs and hospitals for curing people only after they 've gotten terribly sick .
But when they jump from this to the idea that America 's overdue prevention agenda will be the fix for soaring national health costs ( and even help pay for expanded coverage ) , they 're blowing smoke .
The main reason is something Victor Fuchs , a health economist at Stanford , pointed out long ago .
The bulk of most people 's lifetime health spending comes in the last five years of life , when one body part after another begins to crumble , often in tandem .
That 's when we roll out the heroic medicine , as endlessly inventive technology is applied to stave off the day of death .
Nothing on the prevention agenda alters this end - of - life dynamic .
" Prevention gives you a better quality of life , " says Uwe Reinhardt , a health economist at Princeton , " but I have never seen any analysis that shows that in the long - run a society that uses a lot of prevention will have lower health care costs . "
A prevention nirvana that delays some costs but can't eliminate them means any savings will be akin to the one - time shakeout we saw from HMOs in the 1990s .
Pushing costs back is good , no question .
But to put it crassly , success here means trading cheaper , earlier cardiac deaths for more expensive deaths from cancer and chronic diseases down the road .
This is a great thing for our loved ones , but it wo n't stop health costs from passing 20 % of GDP .
Some forms of preventive care , like childhood immunizations , do n't cost much and boast big payoffs .
But many are costly .
The problem , experts say , is that any intervention you use too much of ( because it 's hard to target who'd really benefit ) ends up delivering low bang for the buck .
Annual check - ups and health maintenance programs are good things , for example -- but they also require upfront investments in health care professionals and imaging , often for patients who have n't had such resources devoted to them before .
" The few studies that have compared preventive care to treatment have shown that either form of care can be cost effective -- or not -- depending on how it 's used , " says Alan Garber , director of the Center for Health Policy at Stanford .
" There 's no magic to the idea of prevention , except that it sounds good . "
Prevention in the chronic disease context likewise tends merely to defer costs .
Diabetics get eye exams and have their feet checked by podiatrists to stave off awful complications like blindness , or the need for amputation .
Folks with heart disease may take statins and aspirin and blood pressure meds .
All these measures improve quality of life , but they do n't reverse disease , they delay its progression .
Fuchs 's iron law still holds :
We all get expensively sick eventually .
The potential game - changer over the long - term is n't prevention per se but behavior change .
Prevention -- taking meds and getting special checkups and the like -- may be good for us , but it also imposes societal costs that may outweigh any savings , and often involves folks who 've already got serious ailments to manage .
Healthy behavior is the Holy Grail :
If it starts early enough in life , it has the potential to fundamentally lower the odds that we 'll get multiple costly chronic illnesses to the same degree .
And behavior change is possible .
That 's what Mike Huckabee , whose hundred - plus pound weight loss made him an authority on the subject in the 2008 presidential campaign , always stressed .
Huckabee told audiences that " if we were having this meeting 40 years ago , half of you would be smoking and the other half would n't care . "
The fact that no one 's smoking today , he 'd say , proves we can change the way we think and act .
Changing the way kids view fruits and vegetables versus potato chips and candy bars could eventually bend the cost line , says Len Nichols of the New America Foundation .
If we reduce obesity and the incidence of new chronic ailments over time -- and thus cut the presence of super - costly multiple chronic conditions when people reach the end of their lives -- Nichols says , " the impact could be profound . "
But that 's a long way off , if we 're lucky .
For now , the only way to get serious about health costs is to re-engineer the delivery of care in a system researchers agree is radically inefficient .
Yet as politicians know , getting doctors , nurses , hospitals , health plans , and drug and device makers to change the way they do things is a thankless task -- especially when every dollar of health care " waste " is somebody 's dollar of income .
That 's why prevention is the faux panacea in the debate .
" It 's irresistible for politicians to say we can cut costs while making people healthier , " says Stanford 's Garber .
" But if that were so easy to do someone would have done it already . "
Matt Miller is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author of The Tyranny of Dead Ideas .
When I lived in San Francisco one of my smartest , most urbain and savviest friends was Susan Klein .
She kind of idolized her kid brother Jonathan , who had graduated magna cum laude from Brown and gone on to work at CBS News .
I always had the idea he was just as smart , urbain and savvy as Susan .
Apparently the folks at CNN thought so too .
In 2004 they made him president of CNN US , " responsible for management oversight of all programming , editorial tone and strategic direction of the network . "
Aside from a couple of Emmy awards , this guy actually did win a Peabody .
And now he 's responsible for CNN 's editorial tone in the U.S.I do n't think I ever met Jonathan though I feel like I know him , at least enough to be certain that -- other than the way I liked Cher when I ran her record label -- he does n't like Lou Dobbs one bit .
Lately he 's been damaging his reputation -- like damaging it -- by publicly defending Dobbs .
He has bosses too and Dobbs ' extreme Know Nothing editorial tone attracts a certain crowd that would otherwise be busy watching Fox - News or reading Ku Klux Klan one sheets .
Advertisers get measurements of their presense , not measurements of the absense of millions of former or might have been CNN viewers who now watch MSNBC or get their news even less corporately .
The editorial tone Jonathan is responsible for , at least on paper , is now so poisonous and hateful that it 's impossible to mention malevolent , treasonous figures like O'Reilly , Beck , Hannity , Limbaugh , Coulter , Savage and Ingraham without , in the same breath also mentioning CNN's Lou Dobbs .
His show is repulsive , the way Joseph McCarthy was repulsive and the B.A. Jonathan Klein earned -- summa cum laude -- at Brown was in history .
So he knows .
If Jonathan Klein is unable to self - police , no one can .
It 's impossible .
Society will either disintegrate into a brutish reactionary mob ruled by the Law of the Jungle or it will figure out a way to protect itself from this : Racism is not acceptable , not in America in 2009 -- and not as a tactic in a Big Money war against health care reform .
We -- our nation -- has to do something about the way the public airwaves are being used to brutalize the population .

The steady drumbeat of good news is getting infectious .
The Dow Jones has rallied almost 40 percent from its bottom on March 9 .
The Federal Reserve expects the economy to pick up in the second half of this year .
Home sales rose 11 % in June and corporate profits strengthened in the second quarter .
Pres. Barack Obama has signaled signs of green shoots on the economic landscape .
Alan Blinder , the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , recently pronounced in an op -ed in the Wall Street Journal ,  The Economy Has Hit Bottom . 
The Aug. 3 cover story in Newsweek went even further , declaring boldly ,  The Recession is Over . 
But before you get giddy , several economists caution that we may be witnessing a false lull before the storm , that the temporary economic boost is propelled by the nearly $ 1 trillion infusion of government bailout money to financial institutions and the economic stimulus package .
They fear that we are on the verge of a double dip recession and that the second recession could be longer and deeper .
A handful of prominent investment and trend analysts and scholars are decidedly alarmist , even projecting a depression that will rival the Great Depression of 1929 .
Gerald Celente , founder of The Trends Research Institute , which the Los Angeles Times once described as the  Standard and Poors of Popular Culture ,  forecasts  Food riots , tax protests , farmer rebellions , student revolts , squatter digins , homeless uprisings , tent cities , ghost malls , general strikes , bossnappings , kidnappings , industrial saboteurs , gang warfare , mob rule , terror by 2012 in the latest edition of The Trends Journal .
Truth is , economic forecasting is a hazardous business even in less rockier times .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently quipped at a public town hall ,  Economic forecasting makes weather forecasting look like physics . 
These days many economic indicators are defying both logic and historical patterns .
It is the reason why , despite many reassuring economic signals in recent weeks , national anxiety remains palpable .
To gauge the view from the other side , Little India turned to Celente and three other prominent advocates of the counter intuitive perspective : investor advocate Martin Weiss , author of New York Times bestseller , The Ultimate Depression Survival Guide ; economic forecaster Harry S. Dent , author of another New York Times bestseller The Great Depression Ahead ; and Southern Methodist University economist Ravi Batra , author of The New Golden Age : The Coming Revolution Against Political Corruption and Economic Chaos .

Trends analyst Gerald Celente , founder of The Trends Research Institute and publisher of The Trends Journal , built his reputation by accurately predicting the 1987 stock market crash , the 1997 Asian economic crisis and the  Panic of ’08 . 
He has attracted both attention and ire in recent months with his increasingly dire projections , which he titled as  Obamageddon . 
In the latest The Trends Journal you make very dire predictions of tent cities , food riots and tax rebellion by 2012 .
Do you still envisage conditions will be as bad as you were projecting ?
Economists now predicting recovery are the same people that were saying recession was n’t here even when we were in recession .
Go back to the campaign in 2008 , they did n’t start talking about the recession until the Fall of 2008 even though the recession began in December 2007 .
These are the same people talking about green shoots a couple of months ago and as you go back to the beginning of the year , they said we would be in recovery by second quarter of 2009 .
The Obama administration , which began with a stimulus package , had estimated that without the stimulus package , unemployment in 2009 would be at 8 % .
We had a stimulus package and unemployment is at 9.5 % .
They had also said that they would create by mid-year 600,000 jobs and we lost 2.5 million .
At best , at best , they saved 150,000 .
All their forecasts are wrong .
There is nothing they have forecast economically that has come to pass .
But the improving signs of bank profits and new financial earnings reports , do n’t give you hope ?
Let ’s look at the bank reports .
We know that hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money has been given to the banks and they refuse ( this is like fiction ) , to tell the people ( the taxpayer ) who gave them money , where the money went , how they are spending it .
The Ultimate Depressio ... Martin D. Weiss Best Price : $ 0.10 Buy New $ 3.95 ( as of 04:55 EST - Details )
If you gave me , as they gave Goldman Sachs , $ 13 billion to cover losses with AIG — 100 % coverage of losses — converting Goldman Sachs from a brokerage firm to a bank holding company , giving them access to $ 10 billion , plus all the loans and benefits they are giving them at discount prices , could you show a profit ?
These are profits that are pumped up by bailouts , rescue packages and stimulus plans .
Yesterday the market went up because Caterpillar showed better earnings than they had thought , or rather losses less severe .
They are not better off ; their profits are off 66 % .
Who in the real world would n’t call that depression level results ?
I would consider that atrocious .
What you did n’t have a 77 % decline ?
Oh , you only lost one arm and a leg , but you still got your two eyes and the use of one leg !
You have said this bailout bubble can be more lethal than the earlier bubbles .
Can you explain ?
In The Trends Journal in 2004 we predicted the great recession .
We noticed it would happen .
It was very easy to see that after the dot com crash in March 2000 , rather than letting Wall Street take its $ 5 trillion worth of speculative losses that were built up by the dot com boom , the Federal Reserve began to lower the interest rates to 46 - year lows .
They created this borrow - and - spend mentality that was unprecedented in American history .
You want to buy a new house , borrow on your old one ; with your new equity loan , you can build that new addition , go on a vacation , buy a new car , send your kids to school , go on a shopping spree .
Your house is a piggy bank .
So housing as an asset became artificially inflated by the availability of historically cheap money rather than letting the bubble burst .
With the bailout bubble , they have added $ 13 trillion worth of phantom money .
This is n’t real money , it is phantom money printed out of thin air , based on nothing , backed by nothing .
So they are creating a bubble , but when this financial / real estate bubble bursts , it is worse than the dot com bubble , because now government has an equity position in these companies , and they have government executive powers and management controls .
This is unheard of in American history .
This used to be the entrepreneurial empire of the world , that so much of the world respected and revered as the capital of entrepreneurism .
No more .
You developed a fair amount of credibility in the media with your previously accurate predictions .
But some of the things you are saying sound shrill .
Do you really believe it will be as extreme as you are saying or are you trying to pierce through the clutter of the positive blather ?
Not at all .
We take what they are saying to be extreme .
How could people believe these people when everything they said is wrong .
If you can show me they are right here , I ’ll say fine , we ’re only humans , we all make mistakes .
But we can say with all certainty , and we say it over and over again , you cannot print phantom money out of thin air based on nothing , backed by nothing without destroying the economy .
Look at Brazil , India , China , Russia , the BRIC countries , they all talk now about another reserve currency .
But when you say food riots , tent cities and tax rebellions ?
Tax rebellions , let ’s take that .
Go back to 2007 , we wrote about tax revolts when George Bush was president .
We saw this coming .
Current events inform future trends .
They are squeezing the people at every level .
Look at what is happening in California .
Tax rebellion is already happening .
They are trying to downplay them when tea parties and tax protests happen .
This has n’t happened in America before in my lifetime .
And now they are commonplace .
They happened in April and again on the 4th of July .
This is just the beginning .
Food riots , oh yes .
When people get hungry , when they have nothing to eat , you are going to see a lot of ugly scenes happen in America .
What would you project the unemployment rate to be at end of 2009 and end of 2010 ?
It will probably be heading towards 11 % by end 2009 and by 2010 it could well be into 12 — 13 % .
Where would you project the Dow Jones ?
We do n’t know .
The Dow Jones is a different game .
It can go in any kind of direction .
When you go to the Great Depression , you saw the Dow Jones improving .
It is not an economic indicator , it is a casino .
When do you expect housing prices to bottom out ?
It could be many years .
It could be a decade .
There are two buying seasons in America , Spring and Fall , period , paragraph .
Spring buying season was a bust and Fall does not look any better .
It is very dismal for the future .

Do you think our money is safe in U.S. banks ?
We do n’t give investment advice .
I tell you what I do .
I am a big believer in gold and I think Indians like gold .
I hedge my money .
In my business I need cash , so I spread it between euros and dollars , knowing that if euros go up , dollars go down , so I have parity .
That is the investment strategy for right now , it is not to take risk , it ’s wealth preservation .
We are looking at mid-August for some dire economic news .
In the event there is dire economic news , there are more financial collapses , there is a probability that they may call a bank holiday .
It is not unprecedented , it has been done in America before , Pres. Franklin Roosevelt did it .
So are banks safe ?
It is not a question , are banks safe ; it is a question , will they call a bank holiday , which they have done before ?
If they do , you will be restricted on how much money you can get out .
They have done it in Argentina and other countries .
Yes , you can get your money out , it ’s FDIC insured .
You just ca n’t get it out all at once and it may be devalued .
What do you do with your investments and retirement accounts ?
I do n’t have any .
My investments are in the property and real estate I own .
My retirement is all in gold .
What can people do to minimize their employment and other financial risks ?
This whole mentality , this American mantra to shop until you drop , what kind of sick thinking is that ?
The businesses that we believe are going to make it in this new climate are going to be ones that accentuate quality — less is more .
In our study , the very best company that we see are the ones whose profits are down between 25 — 30 % , that ’s the best .
The worst are down 70 % .
The other thing to consider is , why are you sending your child to college for an MBA , or a degree in communications , journalism , art , history ?
As an economist what is going to be the return on the investment ?
The college industrial complex is going to be one of the major economic collapses in the United States .
They are producing students , retraining people for jobs that do n’t exist .
So unless you are in specialty fields in high - tech , health , engineering , alternative fuels , or smart areas that have more productive usage of resources , outside of those fields , the soft arts are going to be losers .
This country was built not on a mantra of shop until you drop .
It was called Yankee frugality : use it up , wear it out , make it do , do without .
Those are the kinds of things that need to be considered again .
At this stage what do you think are the greatest risks to the U.S. and the global economy ?
The greatest risk on the economic end is the collapse of the U.S. dollar .
That is the greatest risk that we see , because America has the ability to destroy the global financial system with these unprecedented bailouts , stimulus and rescue packages .
Whoever heard of this before ?
They are jeopardizing the global economy .
It is not saving it , it is jeopardizing it .

Are there other disruptive forces as well ?
We are only looking at economic issues .
Back in 2001 , President Bush ’s popularity rating was as low as President Obama ’s is now .
It was declining rapidly .
I even remember word for word , because I was writing about it , what the American media were talking about .
There was this Congressman Gary Condit and his aide , a young girl Chandra Levy , who was missing , and shark attacks .
That was the news , that is all they were talking about in the summer of 2001 and Bush was off on vacation in Crawford , Tex. , for months as America was still suffering from the fallout of the dotcom bubble burst .
Then all of a sudden on Sept. 11 the whole game changed .
The war on terror began and Bush ’s popularity skyrocketed .
The same thing can happen here .
Any wild card could happen and change the game at a minute ’s notice and deflect people ’s attention away from an economic policy failure , an economic policy that is doomed to fail .
Do you envisage that as conditions worsen , immigrants could face a backlash ?
I do n’t care what country it is , immigration is going to be a major issue because there is not going to be enough wealth to go around under the current system .
Do you know that the anti-marijuana laws in America grew mostly out of the Great Depression and they blamed the Mexican immigrants for all the heinous crime .
They trumped up the problem and blamed it on the immigrants .
They made it an immigrant issue , which had absolutely no foundation at all , either the danger of smoking marijuana or the problem being caused by the Mexicans .
But they blamed it on the Mexican immigrants and it was used as a pretext to have very severe anti-immigrant laws in place and they were of course also blaming them for undercutting the economy .
So these trends are old .
It ’s just a new time and a new phase .
Do you think either political party could have made a difference ?
No , it is like watching the World Wrestling Federation .
They pretend to be arch - enemies on the stage .
After the cameras go off , they do their deals together .
There is very little difference between the two parties .

The Debt Monkey On Our Backs
We ’re scanning markets of the world today and scratching our heads … have n’t we heard this before ?
There was a scare at the start of the year — banks were in trouble , the housing market was crashing and unemployment was rising .
The S&P fell at a rate unseen in a long , long time .
But then , a sucker ’s rally !
The worst was likely over , they said … stocks were oversold .
The U.S. consumer , China and oil companies promised to lead us out of this mess .
And of course , the current administration ’s new multibillion stimulus plan will kick in any second .
After bottoming in early March , stocks soared well off their lows .
With the S&P 500 at break - even for the year , stocks now face an inflection point .
Wait a second … what year is it ?
We need not remind you of what happened in the second half of 2008 .
But it ’s not worth worrying about … it ’ll be different this time !
Stocks took quite a tumble Thursday .
The worse - than - expected jobs report gave traders more than enough reason to be short into the three - day weekend .
The S&P 500 fell nearly 3 % .
Since reaching its 2009 high in early June , the S&P is down 5 % .
Major indexes are in trouble again today .
The Dow and S&P opened down 0.75 % , mostly thanks to sour moods left over from Thursday .
And just as in 2008 , the smart money says there is more pain ahead :
“ You may have green shoots , whatever you want to call them , ” said market sage and author of The Black Swan Nassim Taleb .
“ You may have temporary relief , but you are still in a world that ’s breaking .
We ’re in the middle of a crash .
So if I ’m going to forecast something , it is that it ’s going to get worse , not better . ”
And the root of all our woes , Mr. Taleb ?
“ The monkey on our back is debt . ”
Amen .

THE odds of encountering a tsunami kicked up by an asteroid strike have just plummeted .
Best to hope , though , that you ’re not underneath the almighty splash such an impact could create .
Small impactors hit us far more frequently than larger ones : a 200 - metre asteroid hits Earth about every 10,000 years on average , while 10 - kilometre objects like the one that probably killed off the dinosaurs strike every 100 million …

If you ’ve ever shopped at Best Buy , Office Depot , or any other retailer where the sales associates all wear polo shirts in the same color , then you know what an Extended Service Contract is — it ’s that piece of paper covered with tiny print that you agree to buy for $ 69.99 because you ’re so happy you ’re saving $ 40 the price of your new digital camera .
According to WarrantyWeek.com , American consumers spend approximately $ 15 billion on Extended Service Contracts , or ESCs , each year .
In theory , you ’re not just buying an expensive piece of paper , of course .
You ’re protecting your investment .
Buying peace of mind , as you ’re doing the prudent thing now to avoid headaches and unexpected expenses in the future .
In practice , well …. let ’s say you do n’t buy an ESC .
Two weeks after your manufacturer ’s warranty expires , your camera contracts a Stage IV case of LCD touch display fuzziness .
Without an ESC , you ’re totally responsible for paying the repair costs .
And because the repair costs are so high , and digital camera technology has advanced so much in the last 12 months , and Best Buy is having an awesome summer sale , well , guess what — you ’ve got a great excuse to buy yourself a new camera !
Now let ’s say you did buy an ESC .
Your camera breaks , and you spend three hours ransacking your house for that $ 69.99 piece of paper , which you lost track of within seconds of bringing it home 12 months ago , but you know has to be in your files somewhere .
Then you lose an hour looking at phone bills from 1994 — who the hell did you know in Chicago , and why were you spending hundreds of dollars a month calling them ?
Then you spend another hour on the phone , trying to find out if Best Buy has a record of the ESC you bought , which it does n’t , because you actually bought the camera at Circuit City .
( RIP ! )
Are n’t you glad you went the peace of mind route ?
Of course this is n’t the only scenario .
You may be one of those extremely organized types who fills a spreadsheet with the GPS coordinates of where all your important documents are stored .
If your camera ’s malfunctioning LCD touch screen is n’t working due to defects in materials or workmanship , rather than , say , abuse , fire , flood , wind , freezing , power failure , inadequate power supply , unusual atmospheric conditions , acts of war , acts of God , improper storage , improper ventilation , or utilization of the equipment in an industrial or commercial setting — which are just some of the situations a typical ESC does n’t cover — then you made a smart choice !
Especially if the necessary repair ends up costing more than $ 69.99 .
Not surprisingly , however , the odds favor those who sell ESCs over those who buy them .
Warranty
Week estimates that while consumers spend $ 15 billion a year on ESCs , ESC administrators pay out only $ 3 billion a year in claims .
In part , this is because ESCs are pre-paid repair contracts rather than insurance products .
While the latter are monitored by government regulators to ensure that the rates they charge are fairly tied to the benefits they may return , ESC administrators are free to charge whatever they like .
According to research compiled by Warranty Week , this ranges from 1.2 to 43 percent of a product ’s retail price !
But it ’s not just high prices that make ESCs attractive to retailers , manufacturers , and third - party administrators .
Another factor is the reliability of most products these days .
As this graphic from the Cleveland Plain Dealer illustrates , a 36 - inch plasma TV has only a 7 percent chance of needing repairs during its first three years of operation .
A camcorder has an 8 percent chance of breaking down ; a refrigerator has a 17 percent chance .
Or to put it another way :
As long as you avoid improperly ventilated war zones in freezing countries God hates , your digital camera is unlikely to need service .
Even though ESCs may only be protecting you from break - downs that are unlikely to happen , even though they ’re often overpriced ( given the value they are likely to return ) , millions of people are willing to pay for them .
These people may complain that ESCs cost too much , or that ESC administrators do everything they can to avoid paying repair costs they should be covering .
But where is the Michael Moore documentary passionately advocating for our right to free extended repair service ?
How come Barack Obama never highlighted his desire to overhaul the costly and inefficient laptop insurance industry on the 2008 campaign trail ?
And why do millions of people keep paying for a service most consumer advocates characterize as unnecessary ?
Two professors and one Ph.D. candidate at Carnegie Mellon ’s Tepper School of Business recently published a paper ( PDF ) in the Journal of Consumer Research that may shed some light on this mystery .
Using field data collected from the electronics department of a major retailer , they identified several factors that are in play when people purchase ESCs .
For example , one determining factor is whether or not a product is “ hedonic ” or “ utilitarian . ”
A hedonic product , the study ’s authors explain , is one associated with “ fantasy , fun , and pleasure . ”
A utilitarian product is one that is “ useful , practical , and necessary . ”
In previous studies , researchers found that people tend to form greater emotional attachments to hedonic products .
In this study , the authors hypothesized that people would be more likely to purchase ESCs when buying products generally considered to have high hedonic value , and indeed , the field data supported this theory .
The study ’s authors also hypothesized that people would be more likely to purchase ESCs after taking advantage of unadvertised promotions .
Their rationale : Unadvertised promotions create a positive mood in consumers , and a positive mood typically increases risk aversion .
You do n’t want your good mood to end , so you take whatever steps you can to ensure that it does n’t .
Once again , the field data supported this hypothesis — people who saved money on an unexpected sale were more likely to purchase an ESC .
On the one hand , this seems perfectly rationale :
If you were planning to spend $ 199.99 on a camera , but only end up paying $ 159.99 for it thanks to an unadvertised promotion , why not spend $ 69.99 for an ESC ?
It may not be a very good bet , but at least it ’s being largely subsidized by “ free ” money .
On the other hand , would n’t it be far more prudent to invest that $ 40 savings into something truly hedonic , like a bottle of scotch ?
If your camera breaks down within three years , you ’ll have something with which to drown your sorrows .
If it survives , you can toast your good fortune .
Either way , you win .

The report last night that Obama is getting so frustrated with the blatant obstructionism from the Republican Party regarding health care reform -- like the " need " for 80 votes instead of 51 -- and that he 's prepared to just give up on them and let the Democrats pass the legislation without them , may be true .
I doubt it but itbe true .
But none of that matters to the House 's worst Democrat , Blue Dog Dan Boren ( OK ) .
Boren , who represents the " Little Dixie " section of the state that voted heaviest for McCain in the country , is the only Democrat in Oklahoma 's congressional delegation .
He usually votes with the Republicans when it comes to substantive , contentious issues .
Like Republicans and other Blue Dogs , he voraciously scoops up massive ( legalistic ) bribes from corporate America and then does their bidding regardless of the impact on his own constituents , by far , the poorest , least educated and most poorly served in the state .
Boren has taken $ 121,985 from the Insurance Industry to whom he is so loyal , and another $ 267,710 from the Medical - Industrial Complex ( all in just 4 years ! ) .
He 's already announced that he 's a definite " no " vote on health care reform ( just like his bribe - besotted fellow reactionary Blue Dog Allen Boyd in Florida did at a town hall meeting this week . )
In fact , according to the Tulsa World he said he was so certain he would join his pals and fellow - bribees the Republicans to kill health care reform that if he votes yes , " I 'll shave my head .
" Boren is enough of a clown already that he surely need n't shave his head to play the fool .
He brags how he did n't vote for Obama for president and how he opposes Employee Free Choice .
This year he voted against equality for women in the workplace and against hate crime legislation that would help protect gay men and women from violence and he seems to revel in distancing himself from President Obama and calling him a political liability Last year Boren beat his GOP for with 70 % of the votes slightly down from the 73 % he received in 2006 .
Supposedly the NRCC is targeting him next year .
I hope they beat him but judging by the imbecile they 're putting up against him ( see video below ) , Howard Houchen , a clueless dittohead , Boren will be safe to wear out the carpet across the aisle for two more years .
The Chairman of the state GOP referred to Houchen as " well educated " after he ascertained that he could read .

Chinese police had dealt with about 15,000 people caught for drunk driving in a two - month nationwide crackdown on driving under the influence of alcohol launched on Aug. 15 , according to the Ministry of Public Security .
Among these drivers , 2,052 or 13.7 percent recorded a blood alcohol concentrations at or above 80 mg per 100 ml when seized by the police , the ministry said in a statement on its website Saturday .
The highest number of drunk - driving cases were reported in eastern Zhejiang Province with 3,075 cases , Shandong Province with 1,677 , Shanghai Municipality with 1,542 , Jiangsu Province with 1,268 and national capital Beijing with 1,119 , the statement said .
Males make up about 98.6 percent of such drivers , 72 percent of them aged between 30 to 49 , and 97.4 percent are private car owners , it said .
According to the ministry , if drunk drivers are caught , their licenses will be suspended for three or six months and , in serious cases , the driver would be detained for 15 days .
If a drunk driver is caught twice within one year , his or her license will be revoked for two to five years .
The campaign was launched to prevent serious traffic accidents ahead of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic of China in October .
It is also the latest ministry move against drunk - driving following increased media coverage of traffic fatalities and accidents in recent months .
On Aug. 4 , a drunk driver in Hangzhou , Zhejiang Province , killed a 16 - year - old girl .
Two days later , another drunk driver in Shanghai killed a four - year - old boy and injured three others .
The ministry said " no obvious drop " in the number of drunk driving cases were reported since the campaign was launched a week ago .
While vowing tighter monitoring on the road , the ministry called on working units , colleagues and relatives to take part in the anti-drunk driving campaign to achieve more favorable results .

" The D3000 combines the best of both worlds , providing picture takers with the ease - of - use currently offered in point - and - shoot cameras alongside the speed , precision and exceptional results that have made Nikon D - SLRs so popular , " said Edward Fasano , general manager for Marketing , SLR Systems Products at Nikon Inc .
" The D3000 offers everyone the ability to discover the superiority of D - SLR photography at an affordable price point .
We look forward to enabling more consumers to explore the possibilities of D - SLR picture taking and , more importantly , capture life 's memories faithfully . "
Intuitive Assistance On - the - Fly
The D3000 includes the all - new Guide Mode with an easy - to - use interface to help new photographers build confidence in using a D - SLR with step - by - step instruction and inspiration .
The Guide Mode , easily accessed by the Mode dial on the top of the camera , displays a variety of shooting situations via the LCD screen , indicating the most appropriate settings for a particular scenario .
Users can also see sample photos on the LCD screen , which illustrate the effects of different photo - taking techniques .
The Guide Mode also helps users easily review , organize and delete images .
Whether new to D - SLR photography or simply mastering new shooting techniques , the D3000's Guide Mode assists users in exploring effective picture taking solutions at their own pace to make capturing great pictures even easier .
Small in Size , Big on Features
With elegant ergonomics , softly rounded corners , and a comfortable grip , the D3000 packs powerful technology into a compact form factor .
Though the D3000 is tiny when compared to professional D - SLR cameras , it boasts a large , bright three - inch 230,000 - dot LCD screen , and now features an easier - to - read font size , 20 percent larger than in previous Nikon D - SLRs .
Quick performance and response are at the core of the D3000's design and its 11 - point Multi-CAM 1000 autofocus system makes it easy to find and focus on a subject .
Also , the D3000 offers split - second shutter response , eliminating the frustration of shutter lag , as well as the ability to capture images up to three frames per second , allowing users capture every moment .
Users can enjoy the benefits of Nikon 's advanced 3D Subject Tracking , which continuously focuses on a fast moving subject throughout the frame .
The D3000 provides multiple ways for users to engage with their pictures , post capture .
It uses Nikon 's extensive in - camera Retouch Menu , which allows users to easily apply a variety of fun and dramatic effects to their images even when away from a computer .
The D3000 introduces a new Miniature effect , which changes the appearance of distant subjects to look like close - ups of miniature models .
The D3000 also inherits the Soft Filter and Color Outline Retouch options from the D5000 , allowing users to express their photography in a new and artistic way .
As with all Nikon D - SLRs , the camera creates the new retouched image , while preserving the original .
For users who want to take their creativity to the next level , the D3000 also includes the ability to capture images in the NEF ( RAW ) format , in addition to traditional JPEG .
Images captured with D3000 in the NEF ( RAW ) format include a greater amount of image data , which in turn , affords finer image control and higher uncompressed lossless image quality .
With NEF ( RAW ) images , users can fine - tune the appearance of an image with simple adjustments to things like exposure , color saturation , brightness , and overall tone – especially in the post - production process .
Users can use Capture NX 2 , Nikon 's powerful image editing software , to achieve these desired effects .
Nikon extends the creativity with Stop - Motion Movie Mode .
With this mode , users can choose a collection of images within the D3000's Retouch Menu , and the camera then compiles and stitches them into a fun and creative video file .
Renowned Nikon Technology
The D3000 leverages proven Nikon technologies to create the most positive picture taking experience for consumers .
The D3000 delivers highly detailed images with vibrant color reproduction and low noise across a broad ISO range , due to its 10.2 - megapixel CCD image sensor coupled with Nikon 's exclusive EXPEED image processing system .
The D3000's normal ISO range extends from ISO 100 to 1600 , allowing for low light versatility .
Additionally , the D3000's ISO range can expand to a Hi-1 setting of ISO 3200 , furthering the opportunities for shots that other cameras miss .
The D3000 also makes use of Nikon 's Active D-Lighting system , which automatically compensates to reveal veiled details in shadows and highlights in high - contrast situations .
For instance , when selected , Nikon 's Active D- Lighting can improve the appearance of fine detail in a person 's face that was previously hidden in dark shadows or bring out the highlights in a beautifully backlit landscape .
Nikon 's exclusive 3D Color Matrix Metering II , in conjunction with the EXPEED image processing system , contributes to the D3000's ability to capture breathtaking images by instantly evaluating the exposure elements of each scene and comparing it to an onboard database of information from more than 30,000 images .
These split - second calculations allow the D3000 to ensure beautiful exposures - even when conditions are extreme .
The D3000 also incorporates Nikon 's Integrated Dust Reduction System , which offers a comprehensive solution that combats the accumulation of image - degrading dust from the camera 's image sensor .
The system not only utilizes an active sensor cleaning function that activates whenever the camera is turned on or off , but also the Airflow Control System to redirect dust particles , limiting their ability to reach the sensor .
System Expandability
Photographers and enthusiasts alike can also appreciate the D3000's system expandability , as the camera can work in conjunction with a variety of Nikon accessories , including a broad assortment of legendary NIKKOR AF -S interchangeable lenses .

BGH - Entscheidung Nazi-Parolen nur in deutscher Sprache strafbar
Der Bundesgerichtshof hat ein Grundsatzurteil zur Verwendung von Nazi-Parolen gefällt : Deutsche Begriffe wie " Blut und Ehre " bleiben strafbar , ihre englische Übersetzung jedoch nicht .
Die Richter sind sich der Problematik bewusst - Rechtsextreme könnten dies als " Spielwiese " nutzen .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
When it comes to having past views that should frighten every American citizen , Ezekiel Emanuel ( see above editorial ) has nothing on the president ’s “ chief science adviser , ” John P. Holdren .
The combination of Mr. Holdren with Dr. Emanuel should make the public seriously concerned with this administration ’s moral compass concerning care for the old and weak .
Earlier this month , Mr. Holdren served as co-chairman when the President ’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology met for the first time .
It ’s a disgrace that Mr. Holdren is even on the council .
In “ Ecoscience : Population , Resources , Environment , ” a book he co-authored in 1977 with noted doomsayers Paul R. and Anne H. Erlich , Mr. Holdren wrote : “ Indeed , it has been concluded that compulsory population - control laws , even including laws requiring compulsory abortion , could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society . ”
In case compulsory abortion was n’t enough to diffuse his imaginary population bomb , Mr. Holdren and the Erlichs considered other extremist measures .
“ A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child , despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy , might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men , ” they wrote .
“ The development of a long - term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control . ”
It gets worse .
The Holdren - Erlich book also promotes “ Adding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods . ”
After noting that , well , yes , there were “ very difficult political , legal and social questions , to say nothing of the technical problems , ” Mr. Holdren and his co-authors express hope that their idea may still be viable .
“ To be acceptable , such a substance would have to meet some rather stiff requirements , ” they wrote .
“ It must be uniformly effective , despite widely varying doses received by individuals , and despite varying degrees of fertility and sensitivity among individuals ; it must be free of dangerous or unpleasant side effects ; and it must have no effect on members of the opposite sex , children , old people , pets or livestock . ”
Most Americans can be forgiven for thinking that mass sterilization through drinking water is never acceptable and that someone who supported such horrors should have no place on a prestigious White House council .
The question naturally arises why President Obama chooses to surround himself with extremists like Mr. Holdren or Dr. Emanuel .
No matter how much they claim their views have “ evolved , ” health and science under Obamacare would be a frightening prospect with people like this advising the president .

The headlines on many tech sites trumpet , “ WPA Encryption Broken ! ” Hardly .
A very small area of the Wi-Fi encryption method that ’s part of WPA and WPA2 is exploitable under very particular circumstances that do n’t reveal your network key or allow data to be intercepted and decrypted .
The problem with the coverage of this latest academic paper ( PDF ) , written by two Japanese researchers at Hiroshima University and Kobe University , is that the work is so darned clever – but also so darned technical – that it ’s easy to misinterpret the meaning unless you ’ve spent years deep in the wireless mines , hacking out understanding , like yours truly .
What the researchers discovered is n’t a generic way to crack WPA encryption – in fact , they improved on a method that German researchers revealed in November 2008 that allows just short packets of data sent from a base station to a client to be deciphered only if most of the packet ’s content was already known .
This exploit works only with TKIP ( Temporal Key Integrity Protocol ) , the only encryption method approved as part of WPA , and the older and deprecated of two methods – the other is AES - CCMP – available in WPA2 .
( I covered the German research for TidBITS in “ A Crack in Wi-Fi Security and How To Fix It , ” 2008 - 11-08 ; links in that article take you to more technical explanations . )
The German and Japanese approaches do n’t reveal the network ’s encryption key or passphrase .
You can not use these methods to intercept data and read the contents without having the network ’s key .
The crack applies only to a single packet at a time , because each packet in TKIP is encrypted with a separate key .
( TKIP turns a passphrase you enter into a master key , from which several kinds of keys are used to generate keys that can change regularly . )
This exploit lets an attacker replace and rebroadcast a single packet with address association information – ARP packets that connect IP addresses with Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapters .
The German academics had a 12 - to 15 - minute timeframe for cracking the per-packet key for these sorts of packets .
The new approach from Japan adds a physical interception stage – where an attacker has to operate a Wi -Fi relay between a base station and client – but reduces the attack duration to about a minute .
The attack succeeds in cracking the per-packet key about 37 percent of the time , but an attacker can discard bad results without alarming the client ’s defenses .
A falsified address association packet could be used to poison DNS , which could lead clients on the network to visit malicious sites or accept invalid security certificates .
Other short packets with mostly guessable contents could be used for other nefarious purposes .
( For more about such malicious uses , see “ Apple Fails to Patch Critical Exploited DNS Flaw , ” 2008 -07 - 24 . )
Both the old and new versions of this exploit require relatively close physical proximity ; the Japanese one needs to have a client far enough away from a base station to accept an attacker ’s signal as a connection to the legitimate base station .
That physical requirement makes the utility of this exploit rather small .
An attacker would need to develop a particular exploit for a particular network that they could get close enough to , while not being detected .
In homes , someone would likely not be able to insert a signal between your base station and your computer .
In corporations , additional security measures ( physical and network - based ) would likely spot this attempt .
The fact is that millions of point - of - sale ( cash registers ) and other systems are protected by WEP , the original 802.11 encryption system that can now be broken in as little as a few seconds .
And by broken , I mean the key extracted and data intercepted .
This low - hanging fruit makes it unlikely that anyone will focus on TKIP cracks unless a much broader exploit is found .
TKIP was meant just as a backwards - compatible transition option , and nearly every piece of gear introduced starting in late 2002 – including all Apple products – can use a better alternative : AES - CCMP .
This method , often incorrectly and generically called WPA2 , was designed to avoid WEP problems , whereas TKIP was an overlay that replaced WEP on older gear that lacked the processing power or flexibility to be upgraded to AES - CCMP .
( AES - CCMP stands for Advanced Encryption Standard Counter Mode with CBC - MAC ( Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code ) Protocol , in case you wanted to know .
Did n’t think so . )
( You can avoid all TKIP weaknesses by switching to AES - CCMP .
I provide detailed instructions for making this change in “ A Crack in Wi-Fi Security and How To Fix It , ” referenced above . )
I know that it ’s eye - grabbing and click - worthy to write headlines that suggest some major security element is broken .
And there certainly are days in which some ordinary Internet component we all rely on turns out to have a fatal flaw – like DNS last year .
However , Wi -Fi ’s current encryption system remains a reasonable choice .
TKIP should have already been on its way out as a safe way to protect your network from interception ; this latest research just moves TKIP even further away from being a reasonable choice .

No one can be certain exactly how much Earth 's climate will warm due to carbon emissions but a new study this week suggests that even the best predictions using current methods might be incorrect .
The study , which appears in Nature Geoscience , found that climate models explain only about half of the heating that occurred during a well - documented period of rapid global warming in Earth 's ancient past .
The study , which was published online today , contains an analysis of published records from a period of rapid climatic warming about 55 million years ago known as the Palaeocene - Eocene thermal maximum , or PETM .
" In a nutshell , theoretical models cannot explain what we observe in the geological record , " said oceanographer Gerald Dickens , a co-author of the study and professor of Earth science at Rice University .
" There appears to be something fundamentally wrong with the way temperature and carbon are linked in climate models . "
During the PETM , for reasons that are still unknown , the amount of carbon in Earth 's atmosphere rose rapidly .
For this reason , the PETM , which has been identified in hundreds of sediment core samples worldwide , is probably the best ancient climate analogue for present - day Earth .
In addition to rapidly rising levels of atmospheric carbon , global surface temperatures rose dramatically during the PETM .
Average temperatures worldwide rose by about 7 degrees Celsius -- about 13 degrees Fahrenheit -- in the relatively short geological span of about 10,000 years .
A new study suggests scientists ' best predictions about global warming might be incorrect .

Many of the findings come from studies of core samples drilled from the deep seafloor over the past two decades .
When oceanographers study these samples , they can see changes in the carbon cycle during the PETM .
" You go along a core and everything 's the same , the same , the same , and then suddenly you pass this time line and the carbon chemistry is completely different , " Dickens said .
" This has been documented time and again at sites all over the world . "
Based on findings related to oceanic acidity levels during the PETM and on calculations about the cycling of carbon among the oceans , air , plants and soil , Dickens and co-authors Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawaii and James Zachos of the University of California - Santa Cruz determined that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by about 70 percent during the PETM .
That 's significant because it does not represent a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide .
Since the start of the industrial revolution , carbon dioxide levels are believed to have risen by about one - third , largely due to the burning of fossil fuels .
If present rates of fossil - fuel consumption continue , the doubling of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels will occur sometime within the next century or two .
Doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide is an oft - talked - about threshold , and today 's climate models include accepted values for the climate 's sensitivity to doubling .
Using these accepted values and the PETM carbon data , the researchers found that the models could only explain about half of the warming that Earth experienced 55 million years ago .
The conclusion , Dickens said , is that something other than carbon dioxide caused much of the heating during the PETM .
" Some feedback loop or other processes that are n't accounted for in these models -- the same ones used by the IPCC for current best estimates of 21st Century warming -- caused a substantial portion of the warming that occurred during the PETM . "

It is the biggest mystery in Washington at the moment .
Here ’s what our colleague Bobby Ghosh says his sources are telling him :
Speculation abounds about the nature of the secret program Dick Cheney asked the CIA to keep from the Congressional oversight committees .
The most sensational reports suggest it was plan to find and kill top Al Qaeda leaders – like the covert Israeli campaign to take out the perpetrators of the Munich killings .
But two former ranking CIA officials have told TIME that there ’s another equally plausible possibility :
The program could have required the Agency to spy on Americans .
Domestic surveillance is outside the CIA ’s purview -– it ’s usually the FBI ’s job – and it ’s easy to see why Cheney would have wanted to keep it from Congress .
Both officials say they were never told what was in the program , and that they ’re only making calculated guesses .
But their theory gibes with other reports , quoting ex-CIA officials , that say the program had to do with intelligence collection , not assassinations .
“ People may want this to be about hit squads bumping off shady Saudis in Geneva , but that ’s very unlikely , ” says one official .
“ More likely , it was a plan to spy on some suspicious American citizens or organizations , without telling the FBI . ”
A third CIA official who is familiar with details of the program says it was deemed unworkable and cancelled in 2004 .
It is not clear when or why the program was revived as a possibility , but it never got very far from the drawing board , as Republican Congressmen who received a confidential briefing about it by CIA Director Leon Panetta .
Neill Blomkamp ‘s feature - length directorial debut does what really good science fiction does — it makes you think about the world you live in .
It also does what mainstream crowd - pleasing sci-fi does and entertains with a lot of well - designed action scenes and classic Hollywood tropes .
Using a stranded and impoverished alien race as a stand - in for the apartheid world that he grew up in in South Africa , Blomkamp ( who co-wrote the film with Terri Tatchell ) fills “ District 9 ” full of real - world parallels .
But what starts out as a heavy - handed — if not very clever — social lesson ( under the guise of a film cobbled together by news cameras and TV reports ) ends up a rousing chase picture with some unexpected emotional twists and turns .
I ’ve attached a slideshow that I made minutes after watching the movie last week as a tribute to its influences .
I tried not to get too specific , but as I was watching the movie , there were moments that reminded me very much of other iconic scenes .
To his credit , Blomkamp ( who expanded the movie from his 2005 short “ Alive in Joburg ” ) reappropriates these old ideas to make something new and fresh .
I ’ve always admired how “ Cloverfield ” used it ’s single - camera storytelling device as a way to cut back on budget and employ the less - is - more approach to special effects , but keeping all the action confined to one single viewpoint was sometimes quite limiting ( not to mention hard to stomach , thanks to a huge amount of shaky - cam ) .
“ District 9 ” grounds us in the reality that aliens have lived among humans in Johannesburg , South Africa for 20 years .
They are confined to a makeshift slum that bears the movie ’s title and are treated with open derision and hatred — their shrimp - like features earning them the nickname “ prawns . ”
From this simple high - concept premise , Blomkamp starts to tweak things just slightly .
Our hero is a bureaucrat named Wikus van der Merwe ( played by Blomkamp ’s childhood friend Sharlto Copley ) , who heads up a mission to evacuate the aliens to another camp .
It ’s a big performance for Copley , whose character undergoes a physical and mental readjustment that will drastically change his life in a matter of days .
There are powerful images of black people calling for the segregation and elimination of the prawns throughout the movie .
There is a kind of lost hopelessness that permeates these early scenes — mostly shot by “ news cameras ” — and everyone who is interviewed is talking about Wikus as if we already know what happened to him .
This creates a sense of dread and mystery that lasts throughout the movie .
The script takes swipes at the military and the government and the cinematography — some of it washed out in a blur of simulated VHS — enhances the reality and smooths out the CGI so it blends seamlessly .

The head of Australia 's building union says low levels of literacy among workers is a major safety hazard in a high - risk industry .
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( ABS ) show almost half of working Australians do not meet basic literacy and numeracy standards .
The Australian Industry Group ( Ai Group ) and the Federal Government are now launching a new national literacy program to address the issue .
Chief executive Heather Ridout says improved literacy means a safer and more productive workforce .
" The oeCD has estimated that a 1 per cent increase in our literacy skills could lead to a 2.5 per cent increase in our labour productivity , which is really needed , and a 1.5 per cent increase in GDP , " she said .
" As well , in industry we have major safety issues which will not be addressed unless people are literate . "
The Ai Group 's project , with the financial backing of the Federal Government , will work with 10 businesses across four states .
Each business will have more than 80 hours of literacy training .
Employment Participation Minister Mark Arbib thinks most people would be surprised by the literacy and numeracy findings .
" It is something that the Government is committed to improving , " he said .
" That is one of the areas in employment but it is also one of the areas in schooling . "
Australian Council of Trade Unions ( ACTU ) president Sharan Burrow welcomes the program and says improving workplace safety is paramount .
" Most professions rely on capacity to communicate , to make sure that work processes - particularly where there are dangerous goods or dangerous equipment - that those communication processes are absolutely clear
" But beyond safety , it is also an issue of opportunity , capacity to anticipate and productivity really for the employers themselves , so all round literacy is a key issue . "
Ms Burrow says there have always been issues in the workforce with literacy and it is not surprising , considering Australia 's demographics .
" We are a land of immigrants .
Our workforce is made up of immigrants , " she said .
" So as well as those people who struggle with literacy as Australian - born citizens , we have a responsibility to support migrant workers to get the literacy skills that are necessary ... to perform functional work , but also to provide them with an opportunity to up - skill , to take on career challenges and the like . "
Ms Ridout says poor literacy levels is not just an issue for migrant workers .
" One of the bright points has been that the skilled immigration program has actually added to our literacy performance , so migrants are not the area that we have got to blame , " she said .
" It is our own workforce and frankly we are going to do a major project , over the next 12 months or so with the support of the Government , to try to look at it from an employer in a workplace point of view and see what we can do from the grassroots in terms of lifting the literacy levels of the workforce . "
The national secretary of the CFMEU 's construction division , Dave Noonan , says the practical nature of the building industry could be one reason literacy issues are so prevalent .
" I think that it 's notorious that some people do struggle and find it hard to get through , " he said .
" The building industry is an industry that does attract people who are practical , who are " can do " people , and people that perhaps have n't found their strength inside a classroom .
" I think it has always been so that we 've had people in the industry that did n't do well at school . "
Mr Noonan says it is something that unions and business have to work together to address .
" The building and construction industry is an industry that turns over a lot of people , so we 've had a very positive impact , where we have been able to , in working on this issue with our members .
: But it is very clear that there is always new people coming into the industry .
There is always going to be an ongoing need for employers and unions and the community to work on this as a priority issue . "
For decades scientists have tried , mostly in vain , to explain where intelligence resides in our brains .
The answer , a new study suggests , is everywhere .
After analysing the brain as an incredibly dense network of interconnected points , a team of Dutch scientists has found that the most efficiently wired brains tend to belong to the most intelligent people .
And improving this efficiency with drugs offers a tantalising – though still unproven – means of boosting intelligence , say researchers .
The concept of a networked brain is n’t so different from the transportation grids used by cars and planes , says Martijn van den Heuvel , a neuroscientist at Utrecht University Medical Center who led the new study .

“ If you ’re flying from New York to Amsterdam , you can do it in a direct flight .
It ’s much more effective than going from New York , then to Washington , and then to Amsterdam .
It ’s exactly the same idea in the brain , ” he says .
Intelligence indicator
Instead of airports , van den Heuvel ’s team mapped the communications between tiny slivers of brain measured by a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) machine .
Rather than scan the brains of subjects performing mental tasks , as most fMRI studies do , researchers took 8 - minute - long snapshots of the brains of 19 volunteers , as they did nothing in particular .
The subjects ’ brains , of course , did n’t go completely quiet , and the researchers reasoned that any brain activity they measured represented underlying connectivity between brain regions , near and far .
This allowed van den Heuvel ’s team to build connectivity networks for each volunteer , and to measure the efficiency of each network .
“ It more or less reflects how many steps a [ brain ] region has to take to send information from one region to another , ” he says .
This measure proved a decent predictor of each person ’s IQ , explaining about 30 per cent of the differences between subjects , van den Heuvel says .
Intriguingly , the researchers found no link between the total number of connections in a subject ’s brain network and their IQ .
“ We show that more intelligent people do n’t have more connections , but they have more efficiently placed connections , ” he says .
IQ boost ?
Now that scientists are finally getting a grip on what features of the brain underlie intelligence , it may be possible to manipulate them , says van den Heuvel .
“ We ’re looking at communication between brain regions , so why should n’t we be able to influence that ? ”
The first order of business will be to determine what physical and biochemical properties create more efficient brain networks .
Other studies have shown that physical connections between brain regions via white matter that does n’t contain neurons are also related to intelligence .
One recent report found strong evidence that these white matter tracts are inherited , and van den Heuvel ’s team is now trying to determine if the same is true for functional brain networks .
“ If it ’s genetic , genes work through biology and , once we understand the biology , we have lots of ways to manipulate biology , ” says Richard Haier , a neuroscientist at the University of California , Irvine .
“ In my mind , one of the important directions of this kind of research should lead to ways to improve intelligence on a neurochemical basis . ”

State troopers say a man driving a tractor - trailer hauling a load of kerosene rammed a car that would n't move out of his way Thursday afternoon eastbound on the Thruway near Utica .
After the car pulled off the road , the truck driver pulled over as well .
Police say the truck driver walked up to the car and started choking and hitting the driver of the car .
Inside the car were a woman in her 40s and two children , ages 12 and 5 .
Troopers say the truck driver , Ronald J. Constable , Jr. , of Earlton , N.Y. , complained that the car was going 60 mph in the passing lane .
Police said Constable then started tailgating the car .
The driver of the car -- Carlos Perez , 21 , of Geneva - slowed down even more .
Constable then rammed the back of the car " a couple of times , " said Inv. James Hunt .
After Perez pulled over , Constable did , too , and attacked Perez .
Traffic started to back up on the Thruway and a passing trooper thought there had been an accident .
Instead , he discovered the altercation between Constable and Perez .
Constable was charged with felony reckless endangerment , endangering the welfare of a child and harassment .
He was arraigned in the town of Herkimer Court and held in the Herkimer County jail when he failed to post bail .
He is due to appear in Schuyler Town Court on Tuesday .
They look like plastic bath toys , but scientists say these tiny new robotic fish mimic the swimming style of real bass or tuna and can maneuver into crevices too small for traditional underwater autonomous vehicles .
Schools of the mini robofish could be used to detect pollution or inspect underwater structures such as sunken boats and submerged oil pipes .
Unlike other models of robotic fish , which are several feet long and contain hundreds or thousands of parts , the new five - to - eight–inch prototypes have only 10 components and cost just a few hundred dollars each .
" The main drawback of traditional robots is that they have way too many parts and are very complex , " said mechanical engineer Pablo Alvarado of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who helped design the fish .
" Traditional robots may work in the lab , but if you take them into a regular environment , like the ocean , they would n’t last more than a half hour . "
Alvarado and colleagues wanted to try a simpler approach to robot design .
Instead of patching together multiple mechanical parts , they built each fish using a single piece of soft , flexible polymer .
After assembling the motor inside a special fish - shaped mold , they poured liquid polymer around the mold and let it solidify .
That means there 's no chance of water seeping in between separate parts and ruining the motor in the fish 's belly , Alvarado said .
" These materials are very resilient , " he said .
" Water ca n’t do much to them and they can survive very high temperatures .
Unless another fish eats them , they could go on and on . "
Inside each robot's midsection , a motor generates a wave that travels along the polymer body and propels the fish forward .
By varying the stiffness of the material along the length of the robot , researchers can control the vibration of the fish 's body and mimic swimming motions of bass , trout or tuna .
Real fish can swim at speeds up to 10 times their body length per second .
So far , the robofish can only go about one body length per second , but researchers say that 's still a lot faster than previous models .
For now , the fish are also tethered to a power source , but the scientists hope to release a battery - powered version in the near future .
Given the resilience and low cost of the robofish , the researchers think they 'll be ideal for long - term monitoring of ports or underwater Navy exploration .
But Alvarado says he does n't want to stop at fish .
" From our perspective , the fish were really just one application , " he said .
" We wanted to prove that our idea works , that we could make robots from a compliant body and then apply a little force to control the vibrations and mimic motion in nature . "
But compared to other types of animal locomotion , Alvarado says the movement of a swimming fish is pretty simple .
Next he wants to tackle something more complicated , such as a scuttling salamander or a gliding manta ray .

No , really .
She ’s been getting a lot of grief from progressive bloggers for saying that extended unemployment benefits cause higher unemployment , and attributing that view to Larry Katz , who has gone to some pains to say that he believes no such thing .
But while Larry Katz does n’t believe that unemployment has surged because the government has made being unemployed such a great deal , Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago does — or at least he has been saying that unemployment is high not because employers have become less willing to hire , but because workers have become less willing to work .
So Ms. Malkin ’s theory of unemployment is no crazier than what ’s coming out of some of our leading universities .
By the way , since I had to go through Casey Mulligan ’s archives to do this post , I thought some readers might be interested in this gem .
Firm to Build First Utility - Scale Hydrogen Power Plant
July 16th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
[ social_buttons ]
A New Mexico - based company has announced plans to build what it is calling , the world ’s first utility - scale , zero-emissions hydrogen power plant .
Although most - often discussed as a high - efficiency transportation fuel , hydrogen ’s role in other sectors of the energy landscape is also making headway .
On Wednesday , Jetstream Wind Inc. announced it has broken ground on a new $ 219 million plant in Truth or Consequences , New Mexico that would use electricity from wind , solar and “ other renewable energy sources ” to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using a process called electrolysis .
The resulting hydrogen would then be burned to spin turbines , similar to those found in natural gas plants .
“ Basically , it ’s a scaled - up model of eighth - grade science , ” CEO of the privately - held Jetstream Wind , Henry Herman , told the Associated Press .
“ In eighth grade we took DC batteries , ran cables into water and produced hydrogen gas .
All we ’re doing is utilizing that on a much larger scale . ”
Hydrogen + Renewables = Symbiosis ?
The 10 - megawatt New Mexico plant would be designed to smooth the natural variability of the energy created by wind and solar generators , creating enough electricity to power about 6,000 homes and businesses .
“ Intermittent renewables can store their off - peak electricity for use later or for sale as a fuel , ” president of the National Hydrogen Association , Jeffrey A. Serfass , wrote in Renewable Energy World last fall .
“ Adding a hydrogen system to ensure reliability increases the value of renewables and gives utilities flexibility . ”
Just like having a back - up power system , utilities can use the hydrogen on demand to produce electricity when needed most , writes Serfass .
“ In this way , hydrogen technologies are a key enabler for the wider deployment of renewables . ”
But the economic viability of hydrogen as an energy source has long been one of its biggest sticking points , as has the question of where the hydrogen will come from .
The vast majority of hydrogen is currently gleaned as a byproduct of natural gas production , but reneawble electrolysis models promoted by companies like Jetstream and others seek to create hydrogen with less carbon - intensive processes like sun , wind and geothermal .
So whether these two sagging alternative energy sectors will lean on each other a little and help get each other back up and running remains to be seen .
But innovative projects like these give me hope .
Officials from Jetstream
Wind expect it will take more than a year to build the plant once the permitting process is complete .
The plant is expected to generate about 150 construction jobs and 30 permanent jobs .

I like to handle the girls and turn them on before hitting them up for a hardcore shoot .
200 miles northeast of Anchorage , there 's a massive military facility tucked deep in the black pine .
What goes on at the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program ( Haarp ) depends on who you ask .
Self - directed “ researchers ” like Nick Begich say the collection of transmitters and receivers is conducting secret tests of monstrous weapons for the Defense Department : mind control , weather manipulation , long - distance spying .
The military scientists in charge of this military installation insist that Haarp has absolutely no direct military applications whatsoever .
It " is and always was and was planned to be a research facility , " says Dr. Paul Kossey , the Air Force 's program manager .
Haarp 's antennas are being used to study the ionosphere , the electrically charged layer of Earth ’s atmosphere , by pumping it full of energy .
That 's why Haarp 's scientists are creating artificial Northern Lights , beaming radio waves into the crevasses of nearby Mt. Wrangell , and bouncing signals off of the Moon .
Naturally .
Last year , I got a rare chance to see Haarp for myself .
Here 's what I found .
Haarp 's main antenna array consists of 180 silver poles rising from the ground , each a foot thick , 72 feet tall , and spaced precisely 80 feet apart .
João Canziani
The Northern Lights are normally triggered by solar winds .
But with Haarp , aurora can now be man-made , too .

" Stare up and listen to the wind in the guide wires , " says one unidentified Haarp scientist .
" It 's as close to a religious experience as you 're ever going to get . "

Haarp is an unclassified facility .
But the flow of information there is tightly controlled .

feature article reporting portland metro arts and culture | police / legal Police Harass Saturday Market Artist , Threaten to < nobr>confiscate Work < / nobr > Yesterday ( Sunday Aug.9th ) my friend Audrey stopped by my house with a story .
She told me that police had approached her & told her that she was NO LONGER allowed to sell her artwork at Saterday Market because she did n't have a " permit " .
Even though she had been selling artwork at Sat .
Market for years with NO problems or complaints , all of a sudden cops were taking it upon themselves to enforce this " permit " rule .
She said that all the other people selling art / creative works as well as street entertainers were given the same warning for not having permits .
The Portland Office of Transportation ( 1120 SW 5th Ave 503 823-7002 ) is the govt .
agency which issues permits for street vendors .
Audrey said she tried applying for a formal permit long ago .
But apparently , the POT does NOT issue permits to sell ARTWORK .
They do issue permits to sell flowers & umbrellas ... but not artwork .
Nonetheless , Sat. Market has welcomed artists to sell their works with or without a permit for years .
Only yesterday have the police started issuing warning papers to people for not having permits .
Eventhough POT seemingly does not issue permits to sell art , cops were threatening artists that they would confiscate their work & fine them if they did not " comply " .

From mid July to early August 2006 , a heat wave swept through the southwestern United States .
Temperature records were broken at many locations and unusually high humidity levels for this typically arid region led to the deaths of more than 600 people , 25,000 cattle and 70,000 poultry in California alone .
An analysis of this extreme episode carried out by researchers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography , UC San Diego , put this heat wave in the context of six decades of observed heat waves .
Their results suggest that such regional extremes are becoming more and more likely as climate change trends continue .
The team , led by climate scientist Alexander Gershunov , examined meteorological conditions that lead to this and other recorded heat waves , when temperatures rose into the hottest one percent of historical summertime daily and nightly temperatures recorded in California and Nevada since 1948 .
The scientists found that heat waves in the region often fall into either of two types : the typical " daytime " events characterized by dry daytime heat and rejuvenating nighttime cooling , or the less typical " nighttime " heat waves characterized additionally by high humidity and hot muggy days and nights .
Since the early 1990s , nighttime heat wave events in California , which historically had been less common , have become more prevalent , increasing in both frequency and intensity .
The pinnacle of nighttime heat waves occurred in a 17 - day episode during July 2006 when a persistent warm pattern was aggravated by unusually humid conditions , associated with warm ocean waters off Baja California , Mexico .
" Water vapor is the main greenhouse gas .
During the night in humid environments , air does n't cool nearly as much as it does in dry conditions , " said Gershunov .
" Elevated humidity also causes heat waves to last longer .
Hotter nights pre-condition hotter days and the cycle feeds on itself until the winds change .
The weather pattern that traditionally causes heat waves in California is tending to bring with it more humidity , changing the character of heat waves from the dry daytime heat and cool nights typical for this region , to the muggy heat around the clock that locals are simply not accustomed to . "
A preliminary version of the study , co-authored by Scripps climate researchers Dan Cayan and Sam Iacobellis , appeared July 27 in the online edition of the American Meteorological Society 's Journal of Climate .
The 2006 event caused a wide variety of systemic impacts .
One percent of the state 's dairy cows succumbed , milk production was reduced by 10 percent , agriculture took a heavy toll and energy and water delivery infrastructure was stressed almost to the breaking point .
Electrical blackouts were avoided , but only barely through a series of heroic measures by California 's electrical power managers .
Additionally , the heat wave impacted emergency and social service networks as well as natural ecosystems .
The 2006 pattern of extreme muggy heat is actually part of a trend of increasing nighttime heat wave activity observed over the last six decades .
This trend has accelerated since the 1980s and has become especially prevalent in this decade .
The nighttime heat waves of 2001 , 2003 and 2006 were each unprecedented on record when they occurred .
The source of the moisture that propelled the heat wave was an area of the eastern Pacific Ocean where a strong increase in sea surface temperatures has been observed and linked to global - scale trends of human - induced warming of the upper oceans .
Humidity is the key ingredient forming muggy nighttime heat waves .
That same humidity usually provides some daytime relief by stoking afternoon cloud formation .
The authors note that in the 2006 event , however , and to a lesser degree in the next largest 2003 event , the convection that usually triggers afternoon cooling was stifled .
" This conspicuous relative absence of convection in the presence of so much moisture led to intense daytime warming which in turn promoted more intense and extensive nighttime heat , without any observed precedent , " the researchers wrote .
While mechanisms driving this regional anomaly are still under investigation , the researchers concluded that the trend towards more frequent and larger - scale muggy heat waves should be expected to continue in the region as climate change evolves over the next decades .
The study has spurred new collaborations with the public health and energy sectors .
In one follow - up project , Gershunov and colleagues are applying a similar analysis to wintertime temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast .
The newer study includes an explicit predictive component and is the first commissioned by corporate partners in collaboration with the Scripps Partnership for Hazards and Environmental Applied Research ( SPHEAR ) program .
Partners Chesapeake Energy , Citadel Investment Group and Susquehanna International Group plan to use the results of the study to better understand and forecast natural gas demand in these regions during winter months .
“ Each of the five justices asked some questions that seemed to home in on the absence of evidence , " said [ Peter ] Knapp , an expert on the Minnesota Supreme Court who has kept a close eye on the case .
" And when each of the five are asking those questions , that ’s significant . ”
... At one point on Monday , Associate Justice Christopher Dietzen , who was appointed to the court last year by Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty , complained to Friedberg that he was offering “ no concrete evidence ” to back up his theories .
“ The only thing growing faster than the federal government ’s deficit is Chris Matthews ’ man-crush on Barack Obama . "
Oh , there was never any chance they would be able to re-seat Norm Coleman ; he did , after all , lose the election and get fewer votes than Al Franken .
But that was n't really the GOP objective .
Half the people who vote for John Cornyn and Mitch McConnell may be part of what Charles Pierce refers to in his new book , Idiot America : How Stupidity Became a Virtue in the Land of the Free , but neither of the two congressmen , malevolent as they are , is stupid .
They funded a series of frivolous , pesky lawsuits for Coleman , not to get him into the Senate , only to keep Franken out for as long as they could .
And it 's worked for nearly half a year .
Since January , when the Coleman strategy of keeping Franken from taking his seat emerged -- and Harry Supermouse Reid 's boast that he would be seated by the first of April turned into an April Fool 's joke -- Franken has n't been able to vote on any of the crucial issues in the change agenda that Minnesotans were pumpin ' for when they cast their ballots for him and for Obama .
Worse yet , the Democratic caucus has been at the mercy of a couple of right - wing Democrats who conspire daily with the GOP to water down every reform Obama attempts .
Without Franken joining the family - friendly Senate Democrats , the caucus has been stuck catering to the corporate - friendly shitheads like Max Baucus , Ben Nelson , Blanche Lincoln and , now , Arlen Specter .
This morning Michael Falcone writes atthat the GOP game plan has finally run its course .
Law experts all agree that Coleman has no chance of prevailing and that Franken will be ordered seated by the state Supreme Court , which was astounded that Coleman came before them with his spurious assertions and , after almost 8 months , no evidence whatsoever -- none .
Pawlenty has all but declared that he 'll be spending the next three and a half years running for the Republican presidential nomination .
He 's giving up the Minnesota governor 's mansion -- likely to a Democrat -- and will concentrate on burnishing his image as someone who can appeal to Pierce 's , the only path to the GOP nomination now ( which is probably also a path to sure defeat in a general election ) .
Pawlenty wants to get the Franken thing out of the way as soon as possible now ; he 's already announced that if the Supreme Court tells him to sign the election certification that will allow Franken to take his seta , he 'll do so .
That is n't something that will go over well with the base and Pawlenty is working overtime to make sure the Republican Party opinion leaders -- Limbaugh , Hannity , Beck , the Cheney family , Savage , Coulter -- realize he 's one of them .

PC makers Dell and Hewlett - Packard , some of the world 's largest manufacturers of computers and their accessories , have announced their support for Microsoft 's bid to overturn a recent injunction preventing the Redmond - based technology giant from selling its popular MS Word software in its current form .
Back on August 12 , a Texas federal judge ordered Microsoft to stop the resale of Word because of XML patent conflicts with a small , Canadian company .
The order accompanied a gargantuan series of fines totaling $ 290 million , but the real financial threat for Microsoft -- and its major customers , like HP and Dell -- could be in the near and distant future , if the order is to go through .
HP , Dell Ask for Delays to Injunction
Earlier this week , PC maker Dell requested the judge overseeing Texas ' Eastern District Court consider the widespread implications of the injunction in favor of Toronto's i4i .
Dell asked that , the injunction be delayed 120 days at the very least ( and preferably 4 months ) for companies like itself to readjust for new market demands .
The brief , which was submitted by Dell on August 24th , has since been joined by Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) .
HP , also one of the industry 's heavyweights , was in agreement with Dell in stating : " The District Court 's injunction of Microsoft Word will have an impact far beyond Microsoft ... Microsoft
Word is ubiquitous among word processing software and is included on [ redacted ] computers sold by Dell . " ( Source : pcmag.com )
" Hostile Attitude "
Of course , i4i , which has vowed to remain vigilant in its case against Microsoft , would say that this " ubiquitous " position is part of the problem .
Chairman of i4i Loudon Owen was hardly impressed with Microsoft 's own appeal brief .
" It captures the hostile attitude of Microsoft toward inventors who dare to enforce patents against them .
It is also blatantly derogatory about the Court system , " Owen said .

As for Dell and HP , they 're worried about their own abilities to readjust the products they offer -- a process that could take significant time .
" If Microsoft is required to ship a revised version of Word in Dell 's computers , a change would need to be made to Dell 's images , " Dell noted .
" Making such a change would require extensive time and resource consuming [ tests ] . "
The United Nations says Australia is breaching its international human rights obligations by continuing the Northern Territory intervention .
The UN 's special rapporteur on human rights and fundamental freedoms of Indigenous people , Professor James Anaya , says the intervention is also discriminatory and has urged the Government to reinstate the Racial Discrimination Act .
Professor Anaya has just completed a 10 - day fact - finding mission of Aboriginal communities across the country .
He has described the intervention as an extraordinary measure which infringes on the rights and self - determination of Indigenous people .
" In my opinion , as currently configured and carried out , the emergency response is incompatible with Australia 's obligations under the convention of elimination of forms of racial discrimination and the international convention on political rights , " he said .
" I hope that amendments to the emergency response will diminish or remove its discriminatory aspects , " he said .
The Howard government initiated the intervention in 2007 in response to reports of widespread sexual abuse across Indigenous communities .
To do so it had to suspend the Racial Discrimination Act but the Federal Government has already indicated it will introduce legislation to reinstate the Act later this year .
When the Labor Government was elected in 2007 , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd promised to take steps to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in areas such as health and education .
Professor Anaya has also urged the Government to take more holistic approach to tackle Indigenous disadvantage .
" It would seem to me that the objectives of the Closing the Gap campaign , the emergency response and other current initiatives and proposals of the Government would be best achieved in partnership with Indigenous people 's own institutions and decision - making bodies , " he said .
He has also welcomed today 's proposal released by Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander Justice Commissioner , Professor Tom Calma , for a new Indigenous representative body .

Accounts from the disruption of the convergence are collected here and here .
Some have suggested that we should simply see the difficult events at the convergence as a reminder to address the issues of white supremacy and gentrification ; meanwhile , all manner of uninformed parties who were not present at the convergence have been commenting about it .
We humbly suggest that it might be more appropriate for those who were not at the convergence to focus on discussing gentrification , oppression , and abuse in their own experiences , while listening to those who were present at the convergence when it comes to questions pertaining to it .
Summary of Events
After seven years of rural convergences , the organizers of the 2009 convergence agreed it was time to experiment with a new format .
In doing so , they set aside a time - honed but predictable template , opening up the possibility of making new discoveries and new errors .
The original plan was to purchase a building in Pittsburgh and transform it into a community center in the course of the convergence .
One consistent criticism of the convergences had been that they contributed little to the local communities in which they occurred ; with this new approach , the organizers hoped to channel the temporary energy of the convergence into creating something of permanent use to the community that hosted it .
But this proved complicated on many fronts .
Purchasing a building is difficult enough in itself apart from the challenges of organizing a convergence .
Attempts to assemble a coalition of local collectives to share the community center did not pan out .
Finally , the announcement that the G20 summit would be happening in Pittsburgh indicated that the authorities would be especially eager to use any pretext to harass the convergence — which would be particularly problematic if it took place in a building that was not yet up to code .
On top of this , some locals argued that the neighborhood in which the proposed community center would be located was an inappropriate space for a predominantly white gathering .
In response to all these concerns , the local organizers shifted their plans , renting a building in the neighborhood where they themselves lived along with a great number of Pittsburgh anarchists .
Some of the considerations around this decision were addressed in a text included in the orientation ’zine distributed at the beginning of the convergence .
Meanwhile , behind the scenes , the organizing group suffered a schism , further complicating matters and subtracting energy and resources from the organizing itself .
In the end , it was impressive that the convergence came together at all .
Hosting a week - long gathering of hundreds of people is not easy .
Because the convergence is free of charge , organizers also had to come up with the resources to rent the building themselves , and to feed and provide for everyone .
The convergence site was a building on Penn Avenue , which forms the boundary between Bloomfield , Pittsburgh ’s Little Italy , and Garfield , a predominantly African - American neighborhood in the process of gentrification .
Some controversy persisted in the month leading up to the event ; local organizers felt they had made a real effort to open up dialogue , while an essay entitled “ Points of Consideration Before , During , and After the CrimethInc. Convergence ” appeared implying otherwise .
The first five days of the convergence were filled with workshops , games , and discussions .
Topics ranged from police tactics and legal support work to permaculture and the challenges of organizing with ADHD ; several different workshops dealt with race , gender , and cultural appropriation .
A ’zine library distributed hundreds of ’zines and books ; a free kitchen prepared delicious meals ; a mediation team addressed conflicts and accountability processes ; a free clinic served the medical needs not only of attendees but also of people from the neighborhood .
There were two lengthy workshops discussing gentrification : the first dealt with general issues , while the second addressed specifically how the convergence affected the neighborhood in which it took place .
At the second , it was decided that a letter would be written to be distributed in the neighborhood explaining what the convergence was about , and a potluck open to the community would take place on the final day of the event , to open dialogue and extend resources to locals .
The building itself , it turned out , was simply not big enough to accommodate everyone who came .
At previous convergences , the rural setting had offered ample space for participants to take space and time to themselves ; but in this context , in the center of Pittsburgh , that was impossible .
This exacerbated the challenges and frustrations common at events that include people of a wide range of backgrounds and levels of awareness .
For instance , some attendees of color have described the pain of feeling marginalized and isolated , and have stated that other attendees ’ oppressive behavior was not addressed ; some queer and trans attendees have recounted people asking inappropriate questions about their gender expression , and interactions with people who otherwise disrespected their identities .
Most of the frequently - cited examples of oppressive behavior reference a handful of individuals who had not attended previous convergences and were not representative of the majority of attendees ; but the fact remains that both the people who attended the convergence and the policies and structures put in place by the organizers failed to offset this .
On the evening of July 25 , approximately 200 anarchists and fellow travelers gathered upstairs in the largest room in the building for a participatory cabaret .
At the end of the performances , while everyone was still gathered , a commotion erupted at the back of the room .
A half dozen people of color were shouting at everyone else in the room :
“ Get out of this neighborhood !
Get out of Pittsburgh !
Do not return for the G20 !
GO BACK TO EUROPE ! ”
“ We are NOT pacifists !
This is NOT a safe space !
Get out of here ! ”
“ We have solidarity from hundreds of people all across the country ! ”
“ All your squats , all your infoshops , all your collective houses are gentrifying neighborhoods of color !
You think that just because people will nod to you on the street , they want you around ?
Get in your cars and leave ! ”
( “ Some people here ca n’t leave ! ” )
“ Too fucking bad !
Get in your car and leave ! ”
The individuals , since described as “ the disrupters ” by people of color at the convergence who oppose their action , began to grab people ’s belongings and throw them out of the space .
Others reacted with outrage , and a shouting match ensued ; threats were exchanged , but no blows were intentionally struck .
The atmosphere was extremely charged ; many broke down in tears , and some suffered panic attacks .
One person of color who opposed the disrupters ’ actions was called a “ race traitor . ”
The disrupters included four participants in the convergence and three people who had just arrived from out of town ; they were backed up by two white people who had come to the convergence with those who planned to disrupt it .
The two disrupters who had not been “ in on ” the action before that day disappeared early on in the events that followed ; one reappeared at the “ caucus ” at the end , while the other left Pittsburgh immediately and has since said that he regrets his participation .
At first , longtime organizers exchanged glances of confusion : however many convergences and conferences they had organized , however many riots they had participated in and fights they had broken up , no one had dealt with this before .
Many who were not there have been curious as to why no one defended themselves .
One complicating factor was that some of the disrupters were participants in the convergence who had been there the whole week , and even the ones who had just appeared were known to attendees ; people considered them comrades and wanted to take their concerns seriously .
Some young white participants who were still developing their understanding of race and privilege may genuinely have thought that being a white ally meant doing whatever angry people of color told them to do .
For others , it was immediately clear that the action was scripted to frame all white attendees as racist , and that almost any measures to resist it would play into this strategy .
Some concluded that the conflict playing out in that room at that moment was less important than the one that would play out in discussions over the following months and years , and the first priority was to make sure that nothing happened that could obscure the underlying issues in those discussions .
All these factors made it extremely difficult for people to know how to react , and the disrupters exploited this to the fullest extent they could .
As people fleeing the upstairs gathered outside , the police showed up .
Despite the volatility of the situation , they were successfully turned away , though they had been seeking an excuse to enter the space all week .
Eventually , without any formal decision - making , three basic responses crystallized .
Some people gathered downstairs , attempting to coordinate housing and rides for the distraught people making their way away from the confrontation .
Some remained upstairs , acting as intermediaries with the angriest and most emotional white people , urging them to withdraw from the space and making sure things did not escalate .
A couple people of color , not constrained by the fear that their actions could be misconstrued , confronted the disrupters .
This culminated in a physical altercation as several people of color opposing the disruption attempted to force the disrupters out of the room .
The two “ white allies ” who were there to support the disruption engaged physically in this conflict , while white organizers made sure other white people stayed out of it .
Ultimately , although significantly more people of color opposed the disruption than participated in it , some were mired into inaction that night by complicated feelings of alienation both from the disrupters and from some of the other convergence participants .
When all the white people had finally left the space , there was a brief attempt at discussion between the disrupters and the remaining people of color who opposed them .
The disrupters only repeated their dogmatic rhetoric justifying their actions ; both parties concluded that dialogue was impossible .
The disrupters came downstairs and stood around outside for a while before all leaving in a group .
Some convergence participants slept in the building that night , but many had already left the area to sleep in their vehicles , at locals ’ houses , in the nearby graveyard , or in other spaces such as at the Pittsburgh airport .
Some left Pittsburgh entirely .
On Saturday , people slowly regrouped at the building and then at the Really Really Free Market .
It was decided that the plans for that evening would be canceled so people could return to the building to discuss the previous night ’s events .
One concerned young white person worried that it would be disrespectful to return there after being told to leave , until he was reminded that the disrupters had demanded not only that white people leave the building but also that they go to Europe .
That night , the upstairs room was again filled with people .
At the suggestion of some of those who had physically resisted the disrupters , the discussion focused on the ways white people had reacted to the disruption .
A list was made of all the potentially oppressive or inappropriate things people had said or done in response , and the group went through them one by one , discussing the issues around each until everyone was satisfied .
This arduous process lasted late into the evening .
Unfortunately , some of the people who might have benefited most from this conversation had already left the convergence , or else were hanging out outside in reactionary disaffection .
In this regard , though the disruption did not end the convergence , it fractured it , causing a minority of attendees to leave and another minority to disengage .
CrimethInc. vs. CrimethInc. , APOC vs. APOC
Perhaps the first thing to emphasize about the events at the convergence is that it was not a rupture between CrimethInc. and Anarchist People of Color ( APOC ) , but rather twin ruptures within both of them .
CrimethInc. and APOC are not membership groups ; it is impossible for any single action to represent either .
Some of the most active participants in CrimethInc. projects are anarchist people of color , just as there are white people involved who need to do more to combat privilege and white supremacy .
Also , although the disruption was calculated to create the appearance of polarization , more people of color opposed and resisted it than participated .
The false opposition of “ CrimethInc. vs. APOC ” serves quite a few questionable agendas .
It ’s useful for critics who would love to discredit CrimethInc. by any means necessary and are willing to brush off the participation of people of color in order to do so .
It ’s useful for white people who do n’t want to have to question their own privilege and internalized racism — associating APOC and all questions about white privilege with the controversial actions of a few is all too convenient .
It ’s useful to all who , out of wrongheaded opposition to anarchist organizing and “ identity politics , ” would like to dismiss CrimethInc. and APOC alike .
It ’s useful to those who , like at least some of the disrupters , appear to have given up on white anarchists ever being good comrades to people of color and are casting about for corroborating evidence .
Worst of all , this false opposition is useful to fascists and nationalists , not to mention other hostile parties .
The “ Bay Area National Anarchists , ” for example — one of several fascist organizations attempting to appropriate anarchist rhetoric and aesthetics in order to seduce new recruits — enthusiastically posted the disruptors ’ statement on their website , lauding the “ separatist ” action as proof that there are “ irreconcilable differences between tribal and racial groups . ”
We can be sure that some of the discussion of the incident on anarchist websites has included posts from fascists or government agents intent on exacerbating the situation .
Likewise , we know from the events of the past few years that infiltrators are present at anarchist events , and we cannot rule out that they might take advantage of conflicts like this — though it is counterproductive to speculate further without evidence .
The point is that conflicts in the anarchist community frequently include hostile voices from outside it , voices which may not be easy to identify .
This makes it especially important to remain level - headed in the midst of them , acting according to our best judgment and refusing to let others persuade or provoke us into behavior that does not reflect our values .
It is also crucial that we not assume that the words or actions of a few represent everyone we interpret as similar to them .
For the record , we believe the APOC network is invaluable to the anarchist movement .
Everyone benefits from people of color having autonomous spaces to organize and strategize .
We challenge all white anarchists to respect the autonomy of people of color and to do more to combat white supremacy in all its forms .
We also respect the perspective of anarchists of color who have given up on white people ever being good comrades ; this is a coherent position , though it ca n’t usefully be our position , as people of a range of ethnicities participate in our networks and projects .
Our only “ irreconcilable differences ” are with fascists — and all others who legitimize domination , including those who defend the disruption .
Not Drama but Resistance
Fiascos like this can be extremely demoralizing for anarchists , especially newer anarchists who picture the struggle against hierarchy as an uncomplicated war against an external enemy .
They can seem like pointless distractions ; sometimes they drive people out of the anarchist movement entirely .
In some ways , this is equivalent to the attitude that conflicts in personal relationships are simply “ drama ” that outsiders should avoid getting embroiled in — even when they involve abuse and violations of consent .
It may seem easier to stay out of things , but standing aside rather than addressing abusive and oppressive dynamics can also force people out of the anarchist movement .
For us , being anarchists means contesting hierarchy everywhere it appears : struggling against external oppressors , against oppression and domination within our communities , and against those forces inside ourselves .
We must perpetually reevaluate how effective and appropriate various tactics are for these struggles .
In those regards , the disruption at the convergence is as important as any protest or direct action , and there is at least as much to learn from it .
The Challenges of Open Spaces
CrimethInc. occupies an awkward position when it comes to debates about privilege and oppression .
As a point of entry for many who are not previously familiar with anarchism , CrimethInc. brings together people with a wide range of critiques and levels of awareness .
Since the turn of the century , CrimethInc. projects have increasingly engaged with the power dynamics associated with race and gender , although this has not necessarily carried over to those discovering anarchism through those projects .
From one side , some reactionaries dismiss this engagement as mere “ identity politics , ” implying that it has nothing to do with revolutionary struggle .
From the other side , critics who know little about CrimethInc. projects besides the cover of a book published in 2001 continue to attempt to conscript the collective to serve as a straw man representing everything wrong with anarchism .
Being highly visible means that CrimethInc. projects are often associated with those who consume them more so than with those who produce them .
It also means that many people use CrimethInc. as a projection screen on which to impose the images of whatever enemies they wish to contrast against themselves .
Over the past few years , CrimethInc. convergences have served as an introductory space for hundreds of people curious about anarchist struggle and ways of life .
At best , they have offered an opportunity for aspiring radicals to challenge their conditioning and learn from each other .
One inspiring example of this occurred at the 2008 convergence outside Milwaukee , when first - time attendees performed an ill - thought - out racist skit .
Others approached them with constructive criticism , and the result was an important and beneficial learning experience .
Documentation of this can be found in comments here and here .
While too many attempts at calling out such behavior end with defensiveness and communication breakdowns , this was a rare success story .
There is a lot to be said for creating mixed spaces in which people can be exposed to new ideas and develop their own capabilities .
Such spaces are crucial for new participants to become involved in the anarchist movement .
Unlike most other anarchist conferences and events , the convergences have been emphatically self - organized , offering room for all attendees to put on their own workshops and try out their own ideas .
On the principle that people learn more from doing than from watching , this makes a great deal of sense ; on the other hand , it means that the atmosphere and organization of the convergence are determined in part by the least experienced or self - aware participants .
Like many events in this sector of the anarchist milieu , the convergences have attracted a predominantly younger , whiter crowd .
At worst , this means that more privileged participants can remain insulated within their comfort zones , creating — however unconsciously — an environment that is uncomfortable for those who do not share their privilege .
The preceding paragraphs make a pretty good argument for why aspiring radicals from privileged demographics can benefit from others ’ participation , but they do n’t explain why there would be any incentive for less privileged people to subject themselves to the same marginalization they already experience in much of society at large .
It may be quixotic to think that spaces in which the majority of people are white , male - bodied , or straight can ever be comfortable for everyone else — yet there must be ways to make them less alienating .
Meanwhile , the participation of a wider variety of people in these spaces is vital not only for people with more social privilege who stand to learn from others ’ perspectives , but also to the current participants with less social privilege who are already invested in them .
Was There Racism at the Convergence ?
Of course there was .
Racism is not confined to Klan rallies and prime - time television ; it pervades our society .
It ’s safe to say that every predominantly white space is bound to be affected by racist power dynamics ; much racism is simply a matter of ignoring others ’ needs and thoughtlessly utilizing privilege at others ’ expense .
This kind of behavior is default setting for most white people , and especially easy in mostly white spaces .
Was the convergence more racist than other predominantly white anarchist spaces or gatherings ?
We fear the answer is no , though this is no excuse .
The challenges we grapple with pervade the entire milieu , and white anarchists should not delude themselves to the contrary .
Even those who abhor CrimethInc. projects should be paying attention here .
The responsibility to deal with this challenge extends beyond CrimethInc. to the anarchist community at large .
On one hand , it is something of an improvement on other anarchist events that the convergence operates outside the exchange economy , guaranteeing food , housing , and participation to all who attend regardless of their means ( and without any humiliating “ scholarship ” applications ) .
On the other hand , the discomfort of being crowded together with limited facilities and practically no privacy attracts a narrower crowd , subculturally speaking , which can make it even more alienating for people from outside that subculture .
The fact that even a single person of color chose to participate in the disruption out of personal frustration is a serious red flag .
If we want to create environments in which people of various races , genders , classes , and walks of life can collaborate and learn from one another , we are responsible for trying to ensure that everyone can feel comfortable in them .
Those with privilege have to take the initiative , as they are the ones best positioned to redress the power imbalance .
We can separate issues of white supremacy at the convergence into two basic categories .
The first is structural , encompassing the organizing process , the site , and the relationship to the local community .
The second is social , comprising the behavior of individuals in the course of the week .
Up to this point , the second category has occasioned more internal criticism than the first , but the first is probably more important .
It ’s interesting to note how , at least for white attendees , incidents that seemed insignificant when they occurred assumed tremendous significance in the wake of the disruption .
Suddenly every comment that had seemed trivial to white ears took on new dimensions .
Perhaps this can convey the tiniest taste of what it is like never to be able to shrug off such comments .
This should also be instructive to white anarchists who assume the CrimethInc. convergence was targeted because it was a more racist space than other predominantly white gatherings : rest assured that if this had happened at another event , other supposedly insignificant incidents would have been cast in stark relief .
One more note : when addressing racism and white supremacy , it ’s important not to judge others ’ behavior according to classist criteria .
When people visualize a racist , they often picture a poor Southern white , even though wealthy whites are much better positioned to inflict and benefit from racist injustice .
Middle class people put a tremendous amount of focus on addressing issues of language and protocol , but addressing one ’s racist conditioning is more about communication than language , more about self - awareness than protocol , more about humility than expertise .
A rural working class white person who never went to college to learn about “ intersectionality ” can still be a better comrade to people of color than a wealthy white , however many anti-oppression trainings the latter has attended — or taught .
How About Gentrification ?
It is arguable that the convergence contributed to the gentrification of the adjacent Garfield neighborhood .
As discussed in the appendix , one tactic promoting gentrification is to maximize the visibility of white people , and the convergence certainly contributed to that .
It ’s worth pointing out , however , that the convergence was actively opposed by the Bloomfield Garfield Corporation ( BGC ) , one of the primary forces behind gentrification in the area .
Earlier on the day of the disruption , the BGC called in a false complaint to the Public Health Department ; sympathetic sources at the Department reported that the BGC stated “ We do n’t want those people here — they do n’t fit in with our plans for the area . ”
Gentrification is a topic worthy of much more detailed discussion than space permits here .
In brief , it seems that there are two basic approaches to combating it .
One is for white people simply not to move into neighborhoods that are at risk for gentrification .
This guideline is probably sufficient in some cases , but it does not take into account that often it is the poorest whites who are forced to move into such neighborhoods in order to find housing they can afford .
It does not seem any more appropriate to blame these people than to blame those who are forced to take minimum - wage jobs at McDonald’s .
Another approach to fighting gentrification is for those who move into targeted neighborhoods to take responsibility for establishing ties with their neighbors and counterbalancing the negative effects of their presence , for example by taking effective action against gentrification .
This can take many forms , including counter - development campaigns , anti-eviction organizing , and supporting local community infrastructure .
In this light , perhaps the issue to focus on was not so much that the convergence took place next to Garfield , but that it was not used more effectively to test and circulate strategies for fighting gentrifiers such as BGC .
As a general rule , approaches founded on resistance rather than guilt are bound to be more effective .
Critique of the Convergence Organizing
Midway through the week , one longtime attendee who had pushed hard for the 2009 convergence to experiment with a new model remarked that it was just like a rural convergence , only in a city .
Indeed , though this convergence took place in a different setting , the model that had been developed over the preceding seven years was transposed whole into this new environment .
This was a tremendous missed opportunity .
The model that had worked well enough in the countryside was not as suited for the city , and , more to the point , it offered few opportunities to engage with locals — which presumably would be the whole reason to have an urban convergence .
There were exceptions to this , such as the open hours at the free clinic , but in general the convergence occurred in a bubble , separated from local communities rather than integrated into them or reaching out to them .
This is not the model for radical organizing that most longtime convergence participants employ in our own hometowns , and it ’s unfortunate that we fell back into it here .
Scarcity of resources such as food and space was repeatedly cited as one of the obstacles to opening up interactions with more locals ; indeed , it ’s hard to demonstrate the advantages of the anarchist alternative with so little at our disposal .
But there was also a failure of imagination .
Much of this can be traced to glitches in the organizing process .
Because the original plan was to buy and repair a building , little thought was given to how else the event might interact with the local community .
Less that two months before the event , local organizers were still scrambling to keep open the possibility of purchasing a building , while putting little energy into developing a plan B .
The breakdown in the organizing group can only have made things worse .
This is a reminder of how important group dynamic issues are , and how far - ranging the effects can be when conflicts are not worked out .
It ’s also true that other recent models for anarchist gatherings have provided precious few examples of how to engage with local communities .
Conferences are frequently held on college campuses , which brings up as many issues around accessibility and class comfort as convergences in residential neighborhoods bring up about gentrification .
Bookfairs cast locals as consumers , limiting their participation according to economic means and offering few other points of departure besides passively listening to speakers .
We anarchists , long used to being outsiders , must be careful not to marginalize ourselves .
Future convergences that take place in cities should aim to interact with locals and interrupt the separations that characterize daily life under capitalism .
It is sad that the Pittsburgh Really Really Free Market , which could have been an opportunity for this , ended up largely being a space to process the effects of the disruption .
Participants also brought up concerns about structural issues that could have contributed to this year ’s convergence being an uncomfortable space for attendees with less social privilege .
Some suggested that the self - structuring nature of the convergence was a problem .
A couple people asked whether it would be better for it to be invite - only , though this was hotly disputed .
It was proposed that there could be a mandatory orientation workshop for first - time attendees .
Other top - down solutions were advanced , involving more structure and protocol .
Instead of proposing more infrastructure , one might ask why the existing infrastructure — such as the mediation team and the exclusion policy — was not effective .
One answer is that those who were most alienated by others ’ behavior felt least entitled to ask organizers for help dealing with it .
Another is that responsibility was not widely distributed enough — a six - person mediation team ca n’t hope to keep up with every potential conflict or uncomfortable situation without others also taking initiative .
Here again we return to the challenges of organizing events that include people who are at their first anarchist gathering .
Some of the aforementioned proposals focus more on how to curb the insensitive behavior of those who benefit from social privilege than on empowering those affected by it .
One proposal that took the opposite approach suggested that race and gender caucuses should be scheduled at the beginning of the convergence , rather than near the end ( when they have occurred the last few years ) , offering participants of those demographics the chance to confer and present demands to other attendees .
As privilege issues extend to an infinite range of facets beyond race , gender , and class , this would still be a limited solution , but it could at least be a starting point .
It also takes advantage of the self - structuring aspect of the convergence , rather than attempting to suppress it .
In a spatial rather than temporal version of this proposal , spaces could be designated for the same purpose .
This would have been particularly difficult in Pittsburgh , where there was so little space at our disposal , but we can at least put it in the toolbox for later .
One other factor at this convergence was that there were so few opportunities for individuals to address the entire convergence .
At previous convergences , there had been circles in the morning and the evening ; in Pittsburgh , due to space and time constraints , they only took place in the mornings , barely accommodating organizers and workshop presenters and offering no time at all for individuals to air concerns or frustrations .
Being a “ White Ally ”
In the discussions on Saturday night , one white person said something to the effect that he initially supported the disruption because , as an aspiring white ally , he unconsciously assumed that he should support whatever people of color seemed to be taking the most “ radical ” position .
This is a telling indicator of how simplistic many white radicals ’ conceptions still are of what it means to be a “ white ally . ”
Being a white ally — or , one might say less ostentatiously , a good comrade — to people of color is not a simple matter .
In a specific personal relationship , such as with a friend or neighbor , it involves becoming aware of one ’s advantages , checking one ’s tendencies to utilize them , and above all being approachable and open to criticism .
This is a lifelong project , but with healthy communication it is possible to measure one ’s success according to concrete feedback .
Aspiring to be a “ white ally ” beyond specific relationships is more complex and potentially problematic .
One can aspire to contest systems of white supremacy in general , but “ white ally ” is not a role or identity that one can earn with any amount of effort .
Endless questions open before any white person who sets out to be an ally to “ people of color ” in the abstract .
Whose lead do you follow ?
In conflicts between people of color , how do you decide which side to take , or how to stand aside ?
Is it possible to make this decision without simply identifying with those who seem less threatening to your white privilege , or who offer more opportunity to appease your white guilt ?
Too many white people approach the issue of white supremacy as if it is simply a bill they can pay and move on .
It is not a matter of individual guilt that can be absolved , but of engaging honestly and critically with one ’s position in an unjust system .
We are going to be struggling with power dynamics around race and gender for the rest of our lives , even if there is a capital - R Revolution .
Rather than setting out to persuade themselves that they are doing enough , white people need to understand that nothing they can ever do will be “ enough , ” and yet that they have everything to gain by trying .
Identity and Legitimacy
The disruptors imposed a framework for identity and legitimacy that has dominated dialogue about the events , even among many who oppose their politics as well as the action .
At worst , this has resulted in people pitting various identities against each other in a contest for legitimacy : “ Queer and trans folks were forced out onto the street in the middle of the night ! ”
“ People of color have been displaced from land for hundreds of years ! ”
It is important to avoid shallow critiques of identity politics that obscure the ways our various experiences of race , gender , class , and other factors shape our lives .
But we ca n’t simply use identities to confer automatic legitimacy on anyone ’s suffering , ideas , or actions .
We have to create frameworks that acknowledge the uniqueness of everyone ’s experiences rather than presenting individuals as mere collections of identities , and emphasize what everyone has to gain in dismantling oppression along all axes .
This is especially relevant in reference to justifications of the disrupters ’ behavior .
We all agree that violence is legitimate in self - defense .
Can this be extrapolated to mean that violence is always legitimate when a person lower in the social hierarchy attacks someone higher in it ?
If so , how do we establish exactly where people stand in relation to each other ?
Is race more determinant than class or gender ?
Are there complex equations by which we can work out who is entitled to evict whom from a space ?
Or is this the wrong line of questioning altogether ?
As anarchists , we might instead posit that violence is only legitimate to the extent that it creates or defends horizontal power dynamics .
Self - defense can be an instance of this , as can attacks on the repressive apparatus of the state .
It is not anarchist to prioritize any one form of oppression over others .
White people ca n’t understand or judge the experiences of people of color , but by this same principle no one can fully understand or judge another person ’s experience , and that increases exponentially according to all sorts of differences .
The point is not to rank oppressions , but to offset their effects while fighting them .
Forms of political shorthand such as “ all white people benefit from white privilege ” and “ there is no such thing as reverse racism ” are useful for this , but they cannot justify turning a blind eye when people of oppressed demographics victimize others on the basis of presumed privilege .
About the Disruption
Feelings are always legitimate .
It is a crushing tragedy that anyone felt excluded or silenced at the convergence .
When one feels excluded and silenced , there is something to be said for striking out , even when it is not in order to create the possibility of dialogue but simply to create space for oneself .
Calls for dialogue are cheap coming from those whose comfort excludes and silences others .
It ’s easy to be sympathetic to the person who accepted the last - minute invitation to participate in the disruption out of frustration with the atmosphere of the convergence .
All that said , not all actions are legitimate .
Many who experienced the disruption have identified it as dominating , abusive behavior .
The white people in the building were targeted on account of their identities rather than their actions , and everyone in the building was subjected to an extremely traumatic situation .
This was justified on the grounds that people of color have been subjected to much worse — which is true but beside the point .
Let no one say the action was not violent .
When the police evict a family from their home , they need not hit anyone for the eviction to be violent ; the threat of violence is enough .
Likewise , by screaming that they were not pacifists and physically seizing and damaging people ’s belongings ( including , incidentally , the belongings of people of color ) , the disrupters made their intentions clear .
Justifications after the fact about “ property damage ” not being violence are beside the point , not to mention a disingenuous misrepresentation of the anarchist case for anti-corporate vandalism .
Gentrification has been cited as one of the justifications for the disruption , along with the allegation that the organizers had not consulted the residents of the neighborhood where the convergence took place .
Of course , some of the organizers and participants were residents of the neighborhood , while none of the disrupters were even from Pittsburgh .
The disruption was supported by at least one local who was not present , but it ’s unlikely that the disrupters themselves consulted the residents of the neighborhood before acting supposedly in their interests .
By forcing hundreds of people out onto the street in the middle of the night and attracting the police , the disruption posed great risk not only to convergence participants , but also potentially to local residents ; if anything , it increased the negative effects of the convergence on the neighborhood .
In the statement the disrupters released several days after the convergence , they acknowledged , amid various fabrications , that the disruption had been discussed long before the convergence , when the organizers were still considering purchasing a building .
Rather than a response to any specific grievance , it seems that the disruption was an opportunistic attack on a target calculated to create the maximum notoriety while occasioning the minimum risk .
If this is so , it is particularly unscrupulous that those who planned it invited others to participate on the basis of their personal frustrations .
One might hope that an action like this might at least give rise to dialogue , and one person who joined in at the last minute has said that he did so hoping to achieve that goal ; but the disruption itself seems intended to bring out the worst in people and make dialogue impossible .
Forcing people out of the space , demanding that they not only leave the building but also Pittsburgh and North America , clearly created structural obstacles to any sort of collective processing of the event ; it was only by defying the disrupters ’ demands that attendees were able to address the inappropriate ways white people had responded .
Some of the disrupters have made it clear that they do not regard white anarchists as comrades ; it ’s not out of the question that they may have deliberately set out to create a situation intended to corroborate that perspective .
In any case , those who planned the disruption in advance have made it very difficult not to interpret their entire participation in the convergence as a malicious series of deeds carried out in bad faith .
In the subsequent statement , the disruption was called “ Smack a White Boy , ” but the only people who ended up in physical confrontations were people of color .
This was not an accident , but a structural result of the disrupters ’ approach .
What did they expect other people of color in the space would do ?
The disrupters imposed a situation on everyone in the building in which any white people who defended themselves or their belongings would be framed as racists ; the only ones who were immune to this setup were the other people of color , who were then forced to personally take on the disrupters , regardless of whether they were emotionally prepared for this .
As of this writing , most of those who knew about the disruption in advance have expressed regrets of one kind or another , but the core group of disrupters has continued to justify it in the strongest terms .
In our view , they are perpetrators of abuse who cannot be considered comrades unless they are willing to be accountable for their actions .
Critique of the Response
Whatever can be said against participants in the convergence , throughout the entire incident no one threw a punch or called the police .
It would be very difficult to find another mixed space of hundreds of people who would react to such a provocation without resorting to violence , whether their own or via the authorities .
But was the organizers ’ reaction appropriate ?
Under the circumstances , considering that there was no template for handling such situations , it may not have been the worst response ; if nothing else , it prevented anything from complicating the discussions that have taken place since .
But upon a great deal of reflection , we ca n’t endorse the way people handled the disruption as an appropriate model for responding to similar events in the future .
By choosing to stay out of the conflict , white organizers essentially accepted the terms of the disrupters , collaborating in forcing them on everyone else and forcing the people of color who opposed the disruption to do so alone .
This is an example of how a muddle - headed desire to be an ally can sometimes cause people to countenance abusive behavior .
White privilege is not the only kind of privilege , white - inflicted oppression is not the only kind of oppression ; in standing aside , white organizers essentially joined the disrupters in prioritizing one form of oppression over others .
This is neither responsible nor anarchist .
If this response sets the precedent for such situations , it will be impossible to defend anarchist events against disrupters of all stripes .
Unfortunately , there are incentives for people of all walks of life to dominate and abuse others , and it ’s not out of the question that worse enemies than these particular disrupters might attempt to take advantage of what they see as a weakness among anarchists .
If there is a next time , we urge people to draw on this example and take action to prevent people from coercing others and breaking up events .
This is not the first time that anarchists have clashed over issues of oppression , entitlement , and coercion .
History has shown repeatedly that apparently minor disagreements often foreshadow major divisions — in 1917 , for example .
We must stick to our principles even when others call on us to suspend them ; let us not forget what became of anarchists who suspended them in the past .
There is also much to critique about the response after Friday night .
It ’s interesting to note that both the disruption Friday night and the discussion Saturday night targeted the attendees as a whole , diffusing responsibility , when most of the grievances in question could be traced to specific individuals .
Anyone could have taken the initiative to approach the responsible parties personally , but few did .
The discussion Saturday night was good for helping participants hone their understanding of oppression and white supremacy , but many of those who most needed to hear it were not in the room .
At worst , this makes such discussions appear to be a sort of litany people recite to assure themselves of their good intentions , rather than a concrete way to change .
Granted , people were exhausted — but most of the important growth in consciousness around these issues results from personal conversations , not open discussions .
A few people have dared to be honest and vulnerable , such as the white people in the discussion Saturday night who owned up to the oppressive things they had said Friday , and the people who participated in or were forewarned of the disruption who have come forward to express their regrets and explain why they did what they did .
This humility sets a good example for everyone else .
Though many people have rejected the disrupters ’ demands that white people “ Go back to Europe ” and so on as absurd , perhaps it is insulting not to engage with them .
This is a coherent position — even if white people ca n’t be forced to return to Europe , one could argue that the only way for people of color to maintain their dignity is to refuse to legitimize their presence in North America .
Indeed , white radicals consistently give people of color reason to doubt that they can ever be good comrades .
White anarchists who do n’t want to see more debacles like this in the future should make a real effort not to give people of color reason to give up on them .
Ultimately , though it is tempting for most white people to focus on the disruption , the roots of the issue and the power to address them lie within white anarchists .
The disruption was not only a publicity stunt or a power grab within APOC ; the fact that even a single person chose to participate in it out of personal frustration indicates that we all have a tremendous amount of work to do .
Not Conclusions , but Beginnings
The various ways white people responded to the disruption show how far we have to go in developing a comprehensive anti-oppression politic that can protect against all forms of internal oppression and domination .
The way the disruption itself played out , becoming a conflict between people of color as well as between people of color and white people , shows that issues of identity and privilege cannot be simplified into one - dimensional imperatives ; we ca n’t just draw lines between black and white or right and wrong and fight it out , knowing ourselves to be on the side of the angels .
Though this has been emotionally exhausting all around , it ’s only one learning experience in a lifelong process ; we ca n’t let it discourage us .
We ’re in a long - term struggle ; we ’ll be organizing events for many years yet , along with other forms of activity .
This year , we ’ll discuss how to improve on the convergence models of the past , how to engage more with privilege and gentrification , and where to go from here .
Here ’s hoping this text can prompt more constructive discussions around all these issues .
Appendix 1 : “ History and Neighborhood ”
from the convergence orientation ’zine
This year ’s CrimethInc. convergence departs from past experiments through our decision to host it in an urban setting .
Along with this choice of locations comes a host of new dynamics , relationships , and histories that are important for all of us to be aware of as we choose our actions for the week .
Being in the city , this year ’s convergence space is also situated on the battlefield of a struggle raging in Pittsburgh and most other cities in the U.S.
There are many different names to describe this conflict — gentrification , “ urban renewal , ” community development , etc . — but at the heart of it is essentially the struggle over who has power to make decisions about the composition of a neighborhood , and how that power is structured .
Similarly , who benefits from decisions made about a community , and whose interests are being heard ?
And how do the actions of folks from different racial , class , and cultural backgrounds participating in those neighborhoods affect the outcome of these struggles ?
This year ’s convergence is taking place at the intersection of four major neighborhoods in Pittsburgh : Bloomfield .
Garfield , Friendship , and East Liberty .
For us to understand our relationships to these communities and how other folks in this city might feel about our presence here , it is important for us to be aware of the history and character of these neighborhoods .
Bloomfield is a traditionally white , working class neighborhood know as Pittsburgh ’s “ Little Italy . ”
Garfield has traditionally been a working - class neighborhood , changing as new waves of immigrants arrived in Pittsburgh and currently inhabited mostly by African - Americans .
East Liberty , following a disastrous redevelopment plan and white flight in the 1960s , has become a working - class , African - American neighborhood and home to refugees from the destruction of the Hill District to build the Civic Arena .
Friendship was invented as a neighborhood in the early 1990s by white , self - described “ urban homesteaders ” who sought to disassociate themselves from the “ blighted ” neighborhoods of Garfield and East Liberty .
At the moment , there is an attempt to further split part of East Liberty into a new neighborhood called “ East Side , ” the new home of a Whole Foods , Trader Joe ’s , Starbucks , a Trek bike shop , and other businesses appealing to the affluent .
In examining this history , what are the intentions behind terms such as blighted neighborhoods , urban renewal and urban homesteading .
Who has the power to make these definitions , and for what purposes are these labels used ?
Urban blight is a term generally used to describe the neighborhoods of poor people , immigrants , and people of color in order to justify holding power over these neighborhoods and making decisions about their future .
Urban blight says that no one should care about these places and they have no value .
Urban renewal in Pittsburgh is a history of highways expansions , new stadiums , and other publicly funded development that displace marginalized communities for the benefit of the elite .
This term was used as justification for demolishing the heart of Pittsburgh ’s Hill District in 1961 , the center of the black community at the time , to make way for an opera house serving Pittsburgh ’s white elite .
The term homesteading , meanwhile , is rooted in the time of westward expansion of white Amerika , when the government offered incentives for settlers to move out from the original colonies .
This movement was directly tied to displacement of Native Americans from their land , to the great detriment of the environment and for the enrichment of corporations .
Might the modern application of the word reflect a similar process of white migration into traditional communities of color ?
In planning and carrying out the CrimethInc. convergence this year , we need to be aware of our relationship to these historical injustices and the current struggles over defining the communities in our city .
Our initial hope in organizing an urban convergence was to use the strength in numbers of hosting this event to create permanent infrastructure that could empower radical activities in Pittsburgh .
We planned to buy a building that would host the convergence , use the momentum of the convergence to renovate it , and then have the building remain as a long - term anarchist resource for Pittsburgh .
This would have been a major departure from convergences of years past , which actually strive to leave nothing behind .
It sounds like synergy , but the size , logistical , and geographical needs of a convergence space and a long - term anarchist social center are actually pretty divergent .
After months and months of looking , we were n’t able to find something that would suit both projects perfectly .
Rather than buy a building for a one week event or get a building that we could use long term but that would make this event impossible , we decided not to rush it and to make other plans for the convergence .
Our revised plan was to rent a building for the convergence space .
In searching for a space to hold the convergence , we confronted the realities of being ( mostly ) white anarchists in a world shaped by the historical developments outlined above .
Whether it was through the art - world , ‘ hip ’ politicians , absentee landlords , or any other avenue we knew of other folks getting space , we were thwarted .
At the heart of it , hosting the CrimethInc. convergence ( like most anarchist activities ) is not in the self - interest of people who generally try to appeal to the world of corporate funding , “ community development ” grants , yuppie consumers , and the police .
On the other hand , we were too poor for almost all of the property in the city available for a traditional rental agreement , regardless of the political leanings of the owners .
The only neighborhoods where we could afford a space were either completely isolated from the local anarchist communities , or in neighborhoods targeted for gentrification .
In the end , we did n’t make much of a choice at all : we are hosting the convergence in the only legal space we could afford .
And it is situated ( to varying degrees , like most of Pittsburgh at this moment ) in a place where there is serious tension about competing visions for the future of a neighborhood .
One of the most difficult decisions we had to make this year was the decision to get a ‘ legal ’ space .
While we dreamed of other plans , all of them carried with them the more immediate threat of arrest .
We felt it would be irresponsible to thrust all of you into that situation without your consent , and we worried that not enough of us would be willing to face those risks for these wilder plans to reach fruition .
On the other hand , we felt a responsibility to all of you to make the convergence happen , and our only other real option we could see was a complete cancellation .
So , we ’re still trying the urban experiment , on what are the best terms we felt able to achieve , and we are still excited about what we can accomplish together .
The purpose of our analysis is not to feel guilt about the situation we are in , because we did n’t create this system , but rather to figure out how we can fight against it better , how we can be smarter and resist and overcome the way this world is to the best of our abilities .
This situation leads to a lot of difficult questions for all of us to think about :
Can white people exist in neighborhoods such as this without being a gentrifying force in the community , and how do we go about it ?
Is there an alternative to being outsiders in communities of color for white anarchists with little money , and what does that alternative look like ?
And finally , what are the possibilities for radical communities to exist of mixed race & class without becoming co-opted by the dominant trends of gentrification and capitalist development ?
We are committed to exploring these questions and many more with all of you during the CrimethInc. convergence this year .
In the meantime , as the local organizers , and with the input of other folks in our community , we ask you to please be aware of the following things to minimize our negative impact in this neighborhood .
Mitarbeiter des österreichischen Justizministeriums und der Gerichte konnten tagelang nicht auf eine Website mit kritischen Inhalten zugreifen .
Beim Versuch , die Website www.florianklenk.com aufzurufen , wurde ihnen sogar mit einem Disziplinarverfahren gedroht .
Die Sperre trat offenbar kurz nach dem Zeitpunkt in Kraft , nach dem auf der Website ein kritischer Bericht über Vorgänge im Justizministerium veröffentlicht worden war .
Das Ministerium stellt Zensur in Abrede und spricht von einem " blöden Zufall " .
Florian Klenk ist stellvertretender Chefredakteur der Wiener Wochenzeitung Falter .
Von einem Informanten aus dem Justizministerium hat die Redaktion Unterlagen über den Umgang des Ministeriums mit strafrechtlichen Untersuchungen gegen Prominente erhalten .
Es geht um eingestellte Verfahren gegen Politiker , Manager , Amtsärzte , Richter , Polizisten und Staatsanwälte .
Steuergelder für Parteiwerbung , Bestechung , Datenverrat , Geheimnisverrat oder Amtsmissbrauch sind einige der Vorwürfe , die nie vor einem Gericht aufgeklärt werden , weil das Ministerium gegen eine Anklage entschieden hat .
Der Falter berichtet in einer Serie über einzelne Fälle .
Die erste
Folge betrifft das mit erstaunlichen Argumenten eingestellten Verfahren wegen möglichen Amtsmissbrauches gegen den Kärntner Landeshauptmann Gerhard Dörfler ( BZÖ ) und ihm beziehungsweise seinem bei einem Autounfall getöteten Amtsvorgänger Jörg Haider ergebene Beamte .
Die Entscheidung des Justizministeriums , keine Anklagen zu erheben und so einen öffentlichen Prozess zu vermeiden , werden im Falter kritisiert .
Der Artikel ist seit Mittwoch auch auf Klenks Website online .
Am selben Mittwoch war die Website für Gerichts - und Ministeriumsmitarbeiter von ihren Dienstrechnern aus plötzlich nicht mehr erreichbar .
" Die von Ihnen angeforderte Seite enthält Inhalte aus den Bereichen Glücksspiel , Computerkriminalität , Pornografie , Soziale Netzwerke und Phishing .
Der Zugriff wurde daher verweigert " , wurden die Informationssuchenden informiert und gewarnt : " Internet - Zugriffe werden automatisch protokolliert und können im Falle eines konkreten straf - oder disziplinarrechtlichen Verdachtes ausgewertet werden . "
Am Montag reagierte der Falter mit einem offenen Brief an Justizministerin Claudia Bandion - Ortner ( ÖVP ) .
Darin wurde auch moniert , dass Klenk bei für Journalisten veranstalteten Hintergrundgesprächen im Justizministerium nicht mehr erwünscht ist .
Der Grüne Nationalratsabgeordnete Peter Pilz kündigte an , über seine Website den Zugriff auf die zensierten Klenk - Texte zu ermöglichen .
Eine Ministeriumssprecherin begründete gegenüber Klenk die Sperre damit , dass seine Website " Wörter und Inhalte " beinhalte " die in die unten angeführten Kategorien ( Kategorien Sex , Chat , Gambling , und Hacking bzw .
Spyware , criminal activity , violence , weapons , illegal drugs ) fallen und daher gesperrt wurden " .
Die Sperre wurde Montagnachmittag aufgehoben .
Zensur eines Kritikers erkennt man im Ministerium keine .
Die Schuld wird auf einen vom Bundesrechenzentrum installierten automatischen Filter geschoben .
Klenk ist darüber empört und erklärt seine Website für sauber .
Er habe zwar auf seiner Website über Frauenhandel und den Glücksspielkonzern Novomatic berichtet , aber bis vergangenen Mittwoch sei seine Seite für Justizmitarbeiter stets erreichbar gewesen .
Staatsanwälte hätten ihm immer wieder Kommentare übermittelt .
Erst nach seinem kritischen Bericht über die Weisungsabteilung des Justizministeriums , wo die Befehle an Staatsanwälte ausgegeben werden , sei der Zugriff auf seine Site gesperrt worden .

The invisible recovery is all around us if you would only close your eyes , and trust your instincts .
Contrary to the implosion of many state budgets , the Federal government amazingly seems to have an unlimited amount of money for select causes .
For example , Wall Street seems to get every single penny it desires without much question from both parties in Washington .
Sure , we ’ll have politicians on both sides of the aisle argue their case and fight for the common good while they get their pockets lined by Goldman Sachs , the insurance companies , or the real estate industry .
When it comes to real reform the status quo is still here even after the near implosion of the markets .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are showing us that when push comes to shove , they are servants of the banking elite and protecting the financial health of American people is simply a secondary consideration .
If this is the start of the recovery it sure seems funny .
A federal judicial panel has given California 45 days to clean up its inmate overcrowding problem .
Of course , this might take two years to implement if things go through but apparently this is how the recovery will look like in the state .
Another wonderful story showing us the new economics of the recession , banks are set to collect some $ 38 billion in overdraft revenues .
Good times .
Once again , people struggling to buy food with their WaMu Chase debit card need to be careful since they may be slapped with an additional fee .
Apparently peak overdraft fees are a leading indicator of an economic recovery .
Another fascinating story we keep hearing about is the greatness of a jobless recovery .
Too bad that earnings are off from depressed levels a year ago and people forget that losing a big fixed expense like say , an employee , will actually help your bottom line in the short - term .
These are three of the stories we are going to talk about in today ’s article .
40,000 Inmates or 40,000 New Potential Home Buyers ?
As we all know , California is in a dismal state of affairs .
In this year alone the state has had to balance some $ 60 billion in budget deficits including our latest battle with the $ 26 billion monster .
The disturbing thing is much of these cuts are going to be felt at a deeper level in the months to come as the cuts are enacted .
We will see this in less state spending but also with thousands being furloughed , you can expect people to be cutting back on purchasing goods and services .
The federal judicial panel is looking at the troubling state of the California prison system .
In California we have 155,000 inmates with 12,000 being housed in out - of - state institutions .
The 33 prisons in the state system were designed to hold 85,000 inmates but like our housing bubble , we like to overdo things a bit .
“ ( WSJ ) California Attorney General Jerry Brown has said he plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court .
The order comes just two weeks after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a budget deal that includes a $ 1.2 billion cut to the state prison system .
It is unclear how officials will execute the court ’s decision .
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said it is working on proposals to reduce the prison population , but those plans need to be approved by the legislature .
If the state does n’t comply with the order , it could be held in contempt and fined . ”
The state has two years to do this but given potential litigation , who knows if this will happen .
Yet the fact of the matter is cuts are being made and these are the implications :
Clearly this was unsupportable given the California budget situation .
Let us assume these inmates are released in the next year .
What work will they find ?
Ironically , this would only add to the high 11.6 % unemployment rate that the state currently faces .
Aspiring positive realtors will probably tell us that we will have 40,000 more potential homebuyers .
Maybe if we still had the subprime infrastructure in place they would qualify for $ 500,000 for a Real Home of Genius of their choice .
Apparently this is the sign of economic recovery here .
Over Draft
This !
Banks now have to resort to higher and higher overdraft fees to find additional revenues .
It is n’t enough that their crony capitalist system is rolling out trillions in rescue funds ; they now have to squeeze their much poorer client base with the Vise - Grip of money sucking vampires .
You might search in the seams of your couch for additional change but the bank is going to find additional methods to screw you each and every way without even thanking you for the generous life saving bailout .
Most of the headlines on Monday read :
“ Americans pay $ 38 billion in overdraft fees a year . ”
Which is stunning in itself .
But when you run the numbers , it becomes downright shameful
“( The Atlantic ) There are 300 million Americans , and , the FT reports , 130 million checking accounts .
$ 38 billion divided into 130 checking accounts puts the average yearly overdraft total at $ 300 dollars , which is the equivalent of 9 overdraft charges from large banks like Bank of America .
How many Americans really overdraft 9 distinct times a year ?
Moebs Services discovers , however , that one bad day for a consumer can mean gangbusters for the banks :
At BofA , a customer overdrawn by as little as $ 6 could trigger a $ 35 penalty .
If the customer does not realise they have a negative balance and continue spending , they could incur that fee as many as 10 times in a single day , for a total of $ 350 . ”
Many of you have experienced this once in your lifetime .
You decide to put the $ 10 sushi roll on your debit card and get reamed for $ 35 because you used the wrong card .
Most of us would suspect that this only happens once or twice in our lives .
But to account for $ 38 billion in fees ?
Why not deny the transaction ?
Clearly there is a systemic problem here .
I once had this occur and had to go through a long wait to talk with a bank representative to simply block any charges beyond the zero point .
The bank rep kept insisting the “ just in case scenario ” but given my love of paying the $ 35 fee , decided to simply block this by opting out .
Charging this kind of penalty is like having a loan shark pounding your knees for not coming up with the additional points .
So when you hear about those wonderful bank profits , just think of all those overdraft fees that are part of the new economic recovery .
No Jobs = 50 Percent Stock Market Rally
During the housing bubble one comment made me realize , “ this is going to end badly in an epic way . ”
A homebuyer who happened to buy one year before the peak had his home “ appreciate ” by $ 50,000 in one year .
What I thought was a joke was a serious contemplation on his behalf .
He uttered , “ with my home going up $ 50,000 per year , who needs to work anymore ? ”
Indeed , in this recovery work seems to be optional like clothing at a nude beach .
If you have n’t noticed , we did n’t exactly add any jobs last month .
The only significant improvement as you may have heard is that “ things are getting less bad . ”
This is like getting kicked in the shins instead of the stomach .
As the chart above highlights , job losses are still occurring .
But a few things occurred last month that made the numbers appear better :
( a) Big government hiring – a jump in auto activity with the wonderfully named cash for clunkers helped spur back some growth but also , the increased hiring for the 2010 Census helped .
Now you tell me , how many times are we going to do that 2010 Census ?
( b) Minimum wage – the increase in the minimum wage pushed up the overall hourly wage rate .
So those using this as a key point fail to miss a one - time gain .
( c) Seasonal adjustments – We are still adding jobs through the BLS Birth / Death model which has to do with new business growth .
Now when you think of invisible recovery , this is your mascot .
And another key point is we have now lost nearly a decade of job growth .
Even though we only had 247,000 jobs lost last month , we have now lost 6,664,000 non-farm jobs since the recession started in December of 2007 :
In 2000 : 131,785,000 ( non- farm employed )
In 2009 : 131,488,000 ( non-farm employed )
Welcome to the new recovery .
This kind of information is sufficient to cause a 50 percent stock market rally from the March lows .
Even though most institutions are way off in earnings from 2008 , they have revised their earnings to beat the street .
Now you show me an analysis of what industry is going to create some 7 million jobs and then I might consider the recovery legit .
Until then , let the invisible good times roll .

On This Date in History : Death Valley is 282 feet below sea level .
One can actually find some interesting wildlife in one of America ’s most inhospitable environments .
If you dig a few feet below the surface , you just may unearth Shorty Harris , who was buried standing up so that he “ could be ready to step into heaven . ”
Frank “ Shorty ” Harris was born in Providence , Rhode Island in 1857 .
At the age of 7 he became and orphan and by 11 he was a mill hand .
By the age of 14 , he had hit the road and before he hit his 20’s he had taken up prospecting out West .
Shorty was just under 5 feet tall but that did n’t prevent him from thinking big .
There was a cook , Bessie Hart , who towered over him at 6 feet tall and her 210 pound physique literally dwarfed him .
She worked at a mining camp at Ballarat , California .
Shorty asked her to marry him .
She let him down gently .
Shorty may have been unlucky in love but he became famous for his luck in the gold fields .
Several times he discovered gold but he had a penchant for not making any money .
Once , he found the glittering substance and sent his partner to file a claim .
On his way to the record office , the man went to a saloon and never made it .
Shorty by no means was a tea - totaler as on another occasion , had a claim but sold it for $ 1000 and three cases of booze .
His partner was the big winner though because he held on to his share and sold it for $ 40,000 .
But Shorty had a rather pleasant disposition and did n’t mind too much .
It did n’t take long for his partner to lose the money gambling at Ballarat .
In fact , it was in such short order that Shorty had n’t even finished off his case of whiskey .
On This Date in 1904 , the biggest gold rush in Death Valley history began when Shorty Harris and partner Ed Cross made his biggest strike at Bullfrog Mountain .
When first discovered , Shorty is reported to have exclaimed , “ Hellfire Eddie !
We ’ve struck the richest jackpot this side of the Klondike ! ”
Shorty got to drinkin’ and starting boasting to everyone about his strike and in a matter of days , the biggest gold fever rush ever seen in Death Valley was on .
The town of Bullfrog and the Bullfrog Mining District sprang up and the mountain where Shorty and Ed found the gold gained its moniker .
The reason was that the first chunk of gold they found was rather greenish in color and was about the size of a bullfrog .
As was often the case , the suppliers to miners were the only people guaranteed to make a fortune .
Burros were being sold at $ 500 a piece .
When the animals were all sold out , miners turned to handcarts and when they were all gone , wheelbarrows were used on the 75 mile journey to the gold fields .
Shorty had the prime claim .
But , I suppose Shorty ’s greatest reward must have been the hunt and the find .
Once again , Shorty sold his claim for $ 1000 after he went on a 6 - day boozing spree .
But , he soldiered on until his death in 1934 .
His coffin was standard length but he was so short that the gravediggers dug a short hole .
When they lowered the casket , it became wedged at an angle .
So , the gravediggers tried to lengthen the hole but sand kept pouring back in which eventually forced the casket into a nearly upright position .
Then , one of the gravediggers remembered that Shorty wanted it that way .
Even in death , Shorty was lucky .
So , he was buried in the upright position and the gravemarker left to mark his final resting place bears the epitaph written by Shorty , for Shorty : “ Here lies Shorty Harris , a single - blanket jackass prospector . ”
Of course , there is n’t any more gold mining left in Death Valley , but you can find several Death Valley Ghost Towns .
In the discussions which prompted me to write On Parsing Perl 5 , I 've read many misconceptions of how Perl 5 works .
The strangest example is a comment on Lambda the Ultimate which contains an incorrect suggestion that Perl 5 subroutines take the source code of the program as an argument to resolve ambiguous parsing .
Someone elsewhere gave the example that Perl gurus preface answers to the question " Is Perl 5 interpreted or compiled ? " with " It depends . "
( Part of the reason for that is that Larry himself often prefaces his answers to all sorts of questions with " It depends . " )
Perl 5's execution model is n't quite the same as a traditional compiler ( whatever that means ) and it's definitely not the same as the traditional notion of an interpreter .
There are two distinct phases of execution of a Perl 5 program : compile time and runtime .
You must understand the difference to take full advantage of Perl 5 .
Compile Time
The compilation stage of a Perl 5 program resembles the compilation stage as you may have learned it in a compilers class .
A lexer analyses source code , producing individual tokens .
A parser analyses patterns of tokens to build a tree structure representing the operations of the program and to produce syntax errors and warnings .
An optimizer prunes and rebuilds the tree for efficiency and consistency .
Unlike the compilation model you may expect from a language implementation which produces a serialized compilation artifact ( think of a C compiler producing a .o file , for example , or javac emitting a .class file ) , Perl 5 stores this data structure in memory only .
That 's one way in which Perl 5 differs from other language implementations ; it manages the artifacts of compilation itself .
Certain operations happen only at compilation time -- looking up function names where possible , binding lexical ( my ) variables to lexical pads , entering global symbols into symbol tables .
One common error which confuses novices is not realizing that my declarations have compile time effects while assignments have runtime effects .
Runtime
After Perl 5 has produced its tree -- the optree -- it begins executing the program by traversing the optree in execution order .
Even though the tree structure is a tree for ease of representing operations , execution does not start at the root of the tree and proceed leafward .
At this point in the program , the source code is gone .
Of course , certain runtime operations such as the eval STRING operator or require can begin a new , limited compilation time -- but they have no effect on source code already parsed into the optree .
This is important .
Executing Code During Compile Time
One of the difficulties in parsing Perl 5 code statically is that one Perl 5 linguistic construct executes code during compile time .
The BEGIN block executes as soon as Perl 5 has successfully parsed it .
( See perldoc perlmod for more information . )
Because BEGIN temporarily suspends compilation , it can manipulate the environment used by the parser to affect how the parser will treat subsequent source code .
An easy example is the case of importing symbols from an external module :
use strict ;
The Perl 5 parser treats use statements as if you 'd written something like :
BEGIN { require ' strict.pm ' ; strict -> import ( ) ; }
As soon as the parser reaches the semicolon , it executes this code .
This causes perl to try to load strict.
pm , compile it , and then call its import ( ) method .
Within that method , the strict module modifies lexically scoped hints , some of which cause the parser to require declarations of variables and barewords .
Other modules can insert subroutines and variables into the calling package 's symbol table ; the vars pragma does this for package global variable declarations .
When the BEGIN block ends successfully , the parser resumes at the point where it left off .
If the environment of the parse has changed , subsequent parsing may behave differently .
This is why this program gives a syntax error at compile time :
use Modern : : Perl ; $ undeclared_variable = ' Hello , world ! ' ; say $ undeclared_variable ;
... but works with a minor change :
use Modern :: Perl ; use vars ' $ undeclared_variable ' ; $ undeclared_variable = ' Hello , world ! ' ; say $ undeclared_variable ;
The equivalent code might be :
use Modern : : Perl ; BEGIN { require ' vars.pm ' ; vars -> import ( ' $ undeclared_variable ' ) ; } $ undeclared_variable = ' Hello , world ! ' ; say $ undeclared_variable ;
BEGIN blocks do n't have to do this ; they can execute arbitrary code .
use statements are the primary ( if implicit ) source of BEGIN blocks , however .
The Optree
A Perl 5 optree is a tree of C data structures all deriving from a structure called OP .
Each op has a name , some flags , and zero or more children .
Ops correspond to Perl 5 operations ( called ppcodes ) or Perl 5 data structures ( scalars , arrays , hashes , et cetera ) .
You do n't have to know any of this to write good Perl 5 code .
You can inspect the optree produced by the parser with the B:: Concise module :
$ perl - MO=Concise hello.pl 6 < g@ > leave [ 1 ref ] vKP / REFC ->( end ) 1 < g0 > enter ->2 2 <g ;> nextstate ( main 61 declorder .
pl:5 ) v: % , * , &, { , $ ->3 5 < g@ > say vK ->6 3 < g0 > pushmark s ->4 4 < g$ > const [ PV " Hello , world ! " ] s ->5
There 's a lot of detail in this output , but you can ignore most of it ; what matters is that it uses nesting to represent the tree structure .
Thus the top item ( leave ) represents the root of the tree .
The numbers in the leftmost column represent the execution order of the program .
The first op executed is the enter op .
The numbers in the rightmost columns identify where execution will proceed ; enter leads directly to nextstate .
As you may expect , when Perl 5 has finished parsing a BEGIN block , it begins the execution of the code in that block at the entry point and resumes parsing at the exit point .
On Bytecode
Language implementations such as Rakudo Perl 6 ( or anything else built on Parrot , for that matter ) also build up tree structures representing the program , but they do n't execute the tree structure directly .
They produce bytecode , which is a stream of instructions .
The effect is similar , but instead of serializing and restoring C data structures , the bytecode format has a design conducive to serialization and restoration .
You can execute bytecode one set of instructions at a time rather than inflating the whole structure into memory .
( I lie a little bit here ; some bytecode strategies require building some data structures before execution , but you get the point . )
Perl 5 has an experimental compiler backend in the form of the B ::* modules intended to give access to the compiler and optree from Perl programs themselves .
There have been attempts to serialize the optree and restore it later , but it 's never worked well .
Perl 5's execution model makes this difficult .
Infrequently Asked Questions
Wait , so Perl 5 does n't interpret every statement as it parses it ?
Not at all , unless you 're running a Perl 5 REPL or the debugger .
How does Perl 5 handle ambiguous syntactic constructs then , if it does n't resolve them at runtime ?
The example given in " Perl 5 is not Deterministically and Statically Parseable in All Cases " has unambiguous parses -- if you can execute code in BEGIN blocks .
Do n't get hung up on the word " statically " .
The Perl 5 parser as a wealth of information available .
If it really can't make sense of an ambiguous syntactic construct , it 'll give a warning and try to continue or give a syntax error , depending on the serverity .
How much work would it take to make Perl 5 use bytecode instead of an optree ?
Lots -- many developer - years of refactoring ( and likely a few deprecation cycles to migrate Perl 5 extensions to a better - encapsulated API ) might do it .
But Python 2.x always produces the same parse tree for cases where it does n't know if a symbol is a function name or a variable !
That 's because Python 's bytecode does n't distinguish between the two at compile time ; it prefers to try an operation at run time and give an error there .
( Before you write angry comments saying " Python is strongly typed and Perl 5 is weakly typed and your lawn is ugly , you big ninny ! " , let me give a few disclaimers .
First , I do n't know what Python 3.x does .
I 've only checked Python 2.6.2 .
Second , " strong typing " does n't mean much of anything .
Third , sigils give syntactic hints even to static parsers .
Fourth , language designers and implementers prioritize different things .
Perl tries to give really good error messages ; improving error messsages is a priority for Perl 6 .
That 's not to say that Python does n't care about error messages , but that distinguishing between container types at compile time gives Perl certain advantages here . )
When does the Modern Perl book come out ?
I hope to publish it in November 2009 .
Please join the fun by reviewing it and making suggestions .
What are your hopes and desires ?
Many in the United States and the Western world enjoy great blessings and have much to live with .
Sadly , many do n't have that much to live for .
The wise King Solomon moaned , " All is vanity . "
Sixty million Americans are overweight .
The ballooning of America may be indicative of a malaise that strangles true success .
I doubt if most people want to carry the extra pounds .
It just sort of happens - much like a lot of life .
Why are some people able to achieve more fulfillment and deal with the ups and downs of life ?
Perhaps there are keys that predict why some have a more meaningful life .
Ability to Make a Commitment
What do you want to do with your life ?
We all need dreams and goals .
Ready - made entertainment and distractions can easily fill the vacuum of a day , week , month and , eventually , a life .
If your goals are n't clear and powerful , they will drown in the sea of distractions around you like so many pieces of driftwood .
Make a Commitment
It is rare to find people who stay with a house , car , job or even a marriage for too long in the frenetic pace of this modern era .
With so many options and an urge to try the new , it is easy to abort plans and dreams .
Technology marches ahead and you are often out of date before you start .
Perhaps societal changes affect our ability to stay with a plan .
A few years ago , when outlining a baptismal counseling class , I realized I had to add a step in teaching about making a commitment .
That was how to gain the ability to make one !
Sadly , many are too influenced by the world around them , and staying a course ( any course ) is difficult .
Four hundred years ago America 's forefathers were driven by a dream of religious freedom and embarked on the adventure of their lifetime .
They sought for a New World and new way of life .
A transatlantic voyage was risky at best with the threat of sickness , bad weather and hostile Indians .
When the United States began there were very trying tests that could have discouraged even the most valiant .
John Adams wrote to his wife and trusted confidante , Abigail , after the signing of the Declaration of Independence : " I am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure that it will cost us to maintain this Declaration , and support and defend these States .
Yet through all the gloom I can see rays of ravishing light and glory .
I can see the end is worth more than all the means " ( The Light and the Glory by Peter Marshall and David Manuel , 1977 p. i ) .
Anything worthwhile takes planning and commitment to bring success .
That means avoiding distractions and not caving in to the pressures and trials that can derail the best of intentions .
You first need to ask the question , " What is important to me ? "
Then commit your resources and time to learning and accomplishing this goal or dream .
Make the Commitment
Commitments need conviction coupled with a resolve to stay the course , no matter what happens .
When some wanted to be disciples of Christ , they were told to count the cost .
Two examples are worth mentioning : " If a man starts to build a house and only gets the foundations laid and then discovers he lacks the resources to finish it , he will be mocked for poor planning " ( paraphrased from Luke 14:28 - 30 ) .
Another example was of declaring war on an enemy and , after the battle begins , realizing you are outnumbered .
It is too late to say you were kidding ( verses 31 - 32 ) .
Real commitment takes the determination to stay the course through any adversity !
Christ also said that anyone who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of God ( Luke 9:62 ) .
This same attitude works for a career or a relationship .
Keeping the Commitment
Once you start a worthy project , the challenge is to see it to the end !
Good intentions and fair - weather sailors abound .
Perhaps the most important area to think about commitment is in the really important matter of life itself .
Where are you headed ?
Is life more than vanity and just passing of time ?
Do you want to be more driftwood in the sea of life ?
God has offered the gift of eternal life to those who are willing and able to make a commitment of living a life based on conviction .
Christ set the example for man by living as a mortal on the earth in the midst of the temptations common to all .
We are challenged to follow His example and build a life with concern for others rather than just ourselves .
The amazing discovery is that this commitment gives meaning and direction in a world that is hectic and confusing .
Can you make a lifelong commitment ?
How about making one that will make your life a real success ?

Some suggestions for making the most of comic conventions , based on personal experience ( mine and my wife ’s ) .
The list is focused on Comic - Con International in San Diego , but most tips also apply to other conventions and cities .
Planning
For SDCC :
If there ’s even the slightest chance you ’ll want to go , sign up for a Member ID on their website now , so you ’ll be eligible to buy tickets .
This will also sign you up to be notified when they go on sale .
Tickets are online pre-sale only , and sell out within an hour or two .
For other conventions , it ’s still worth pre-registering once you know you ’re going .
You ’ll usually save money , plus wo n’t have to stand in as long a line ( or at least the line you stand in will move faster ) .
Start checking deadlines early for masquerade , booths , tables , etc .
They may be months before the con .
Take an extra day off after the con to recover ( i.e. sleep ) , especially if you ’re traveling .
You ca n’t pick your days around specific events because the schedule is never finalized until about two weeks before the con .
But there are patterns : Wednesday / Preview Night usually has one or two screenings , and not much else .
Friday and Saturday usually have the highest - profile events .
Saturday is also the most crowded on the convention floor .
Friday also usually has a lot of Star Wars events .
Sunday is lighter on events , but also has a lot of kid-friendly programming .
Do n’t be afraid to skip a day when purchasing tickets .
Between offsite events / exhibits and unrelated attractions ( museums , zoo , harbor , etc. ) , you ’ll find something to do .
And it ’ll almost certainly be less stressful .
If you have the time , take the whole week off and make it a vacation .
Where to Stay
Keep an eye on when the convention hotel block opens .
SDCC hotels sell out in a matter of minutes .
The con has an “ early bird ” hotel sale for those who already have tickets .
Options are limited and non-refundable , but you actually get to choose .
Find roommates to share the cost of the hotel room ( or suite ) .
You can try to book directly through a hotel , or through a travel site like Expedia , Travelocity , Priceline , or Hotwire – but do it as early as possible ( I mean the previous fall , assuming they do n’t just block off those dates entirely ) , and expect to spend more than the con rate .
When booking with a hotel chain , either through the con or on your own , make absolutely certain you reserve at the right location !
( It seems obvious , but at 1 AM it ’s an easy mistake if the chain has several hotels in the same city . )
Look into short - term condo rentals , but again , do so waaay ahead of time .
Stay with friends or relatives who live in the area .
Stay farther out and commute .
If all you need is a place to sleep and shower , you do n’t have to stay downtown .
If you ca n’t get a hotel , or want a closer one , check again after deposits become non-refundable .
Some rooms always free up .
Ask your hotel about storing luggage if you check out before the con ends , or if you check in after it starts .
( You may also be able to arrange early check - in . )
Once you get to the hotel , do n’t be afraid to ( politely ) ask for extensions / changes .
I actually managed to extend my hotel stay by an extra night in 2013 because someone canceled that morning .
But do n’t rely on it being possible .
Right Before
Get cash at your local bank branch so you do n’t have to stand in line for the lobby ATM .
Use your bank ’s website to locate branches / ATMs near the con and your hotel before you leave .
Plan what you ’re doing each day before you arrive , but do n’t count on more than 3 big events a day .
Transportation
Parking downtown is scattered and expensive .
Park once and take public transportation if you need to go somewhere .
Comic - Con has started offering pre-paid parking .
Take them up on it !
Be sure your downtown map clearly marks the direction of one - way streets .
If you live near the Southern California coast , consider taking the train .
The Downtown San Diego station is next to a trolley stop , and about 20 - 25 minutes ’ walk from the convention center .
If driving , leave early to get a parking space .
They fill up quickly .
Shuttles run to most of the hotels in the con block , including downtown , Mission Valley , and near the airport .
Locate your hotel shuttle stop and see which section of the convention center is closest .
Trolley System
Get a multi-day Regional MTS pass to get around Downtown San Diego .
If you do n’t already have a Compass Card to reload , allow shipping time .
Mission Valley and Old Town have Green Line trolley service straight to the con .
There are 2 trolley stops near the convention center : Convention Center and Gaslamp Quarter .
Maps and schedules are on sdmts.com .
Here ’s a direct link to the trolley map .
Downtown trolleys run every 15 min/day , 30 min/evening , until around midnight ( later on weekends )
Trolleys are crowded , especially on Fri and Sat , so plan for at least 30 min delay .
Packing
Plan to walk a lot .
Wear comfortable shoes , even with costumes .
If you heavily use a power - hungry phone , carry a battery extender so you can recharge w/o a socket .
Bring a light jacket for the evening .
Sometimes it cools off right by the ocean .
Bring a spare battery for your camera so you can swap it out if it dies in the middle of the day .
Bring at least one set of nice clothes in case you want to go out one evening .
Remember to pack chargers and data cables for all your electronics .
At the Con
You will feel overwhelmed your first day , every year .
You may get used to it by the end .
feel overwhelmed your first day , every year .
You may get used to it by the end .
Arrange for meetups before heading to the con .
Cell phones are hard to hear on the floor .
Followup from @batmansgirl : set your phone to vibrate and use texting .
Check your phone regularly for new messages .
You wo n’t hear it ring on the floor , and you might not feel it vibrate .
Wear a watch .
It ’s a lot easier to glance at your wrist in a crowd .
Keep your camera easy to reach with a neck strap or in a front pocket .
Or carry it — but use a wrist strap so you do n’t drop it .
For exclusives , figure out exactly where the booth is and go straight there when the hall opens .
Find out specific autograph / giveaway procedures as early as possible .
Bring a backpack !
But remember you ’re wearing it when you turn around quickly .
Room security and Elite security are two different things .
If the room monitors ask you not to save seats , then do n’t save seats .
We ’ll all thank you .
It really is easier to get seated at a busy panel if you do n’t leave empty spaces in the middle of the row .
Visit the art show , but remember : no water bottles allowed .
Bring plenty of cash .
Use a debit / credit card where you can so you do n’t run out of cash for places you can’t .
That said , Square and similar phone / tablet - based payment methods have made it possible for a lot more vendors accept credit cards than used to in the old days .
Saturday is the most crowded on the main floor , but also the best day for spotting costumes .
If you wear a recognizable ( or sexy ) costume , expect to be stopped frequently for photos .
Stay healthy !
Wash your hands , bring hand sanitizer & cover your mouth if you cough .
Lots of people from different regions crowded together for a weekend is a recipe for the “ con crud . ”
If you buy something big or fragile that you do n’t want to take home in your luggage , use the FedEx shipping center in the lobby .
Kids
( From Comic - Con with a Stroller : Parents and the Under - Five Set . )
If you ’re overwhelmed , remember your kids will be even more so .
Try not to overload them !
With small children ( under five ) it ’s probably best to only bring them one day of the con .
That gives you time to meet most of your goals , and scout out things they might like to do on the day you bring them .
SDCC has Kids ’ Day on Sunday , but most of the programming is aimed for kids five and up .
SDCC also has an hourly child care open to attendees and exhibitors .
A few hours playing with other kids will give them a chance to recharge and you a chance to run around the con .
If your child is young enough , they ’ll need both a stroller and somewhere to run around .
Be careful , though : people in crowds do n’t see strollers , they see an empty space .
If your child needs a stroller , keep it small so it does n’t block the aisles .
And check the con ’s policy : SDCC bans double - wide strollers on the main floor , and all strollers have to be parked outside event rooms .
The LEGO booth is a great place to take a child who has run out of attention span .
If your child is into dress - up , let them choose a costume .
They ’ll have a great time cosplaying .
Be aware that people will want to take photos , and establish ground rules with your child .
Unless your child is very quiet , you probably should n’t bring them to panels that do n’t interest them .
Plan for lots of switching which parent is in a panel and which is hanging out with the kid .
Online , During and After
Wi-Fi is usually available in parts of the convention center .
It ’s frequently jammed , though .
If you see both free wifi and a paid hotspot on a service you already subscribe to , go with the paid service .
It ’ll be less crowded .
If you need to get online but ca n’t connect on the convention floor , hit a nearby hotel lobby .
Hotel internet access is often faster early in the morning than late at night , because fewer people are using it .
That ’s the time to upload your photos .
Cell reception can vary a lot by carrier in some convention centers , especially those with basement exhibit halls ( Long Beach , I ’m looking at you . )
If you want to update multiple social networks from the con , do n’t spend time posting to all of them on a busy connection .
Pick one and have it sync to the others using built - in connectors or IFTTT .
Tag your photos by convention + year and topic .
Examples : # ComicCon2016 , # SanDiego , #cosplay , # SDCC , # The Flash .
Look for photo pools / groups dedicated to the convention ( ex : SDCC on Flickr ) or topics .
If you are n’t posting photos instantly but do want to share them , post them nightly or as soon as you get home .
Interest drops off quickly after the con is over .
Events and Panels
Pick one major event per day and do n’t worry about trying to get to the others .
Allow 2.5 hours of lead time for the really big panels .
If you pass a restroom on the way to a long panel or line , use it while you have the chance .
The Quick Draw !
panel is always fun .
It ’s cartoon improv with Sergio Aragonés , Scott Shaw ! and a rotating third artist .
Scott Shaw ’s Oddball Comics presentation is also good .
The masquerade is free , but you need to get tickets Saturday afternoon .
If you ask a question at a panel , just ask the question .
Do n’t spend 5 minutes praising the show first .
Food
Buy a sandwich in the morning ( Ralph ’s , Subway , etc. ) and put it in your backpack for lunch .
Pack snacks and water so you can stand in event lines instead of snack lines .
When bringing in food from outside , bring a napkin too .
Or at least grab a paper towel from the restroom first .
There ’s an additional food court on the mezzanine where some of the small fan booths are .
Have a nice dinner or a good lunch at a restaurant in the Gaslamp District .
Tip well .
Visit the restaurant reservation desk near B2 in the convention center lobby for menus and prices .
Little Italy is another good area for restaurants .
Take a Break
Tour historical ships at the San Diego Maritime Museum one morning or afternoon .
See a play or concert at a downtown theater like the Spreckels , Lyceum , Horton Grand , House of Blues etc .
Visit Old Town San Diego .
Stop by the coffee house and buy some Highlander Grog .
If you have an extra day , check out the San Diego Zoo , the Safari Park , Sea World , or the Fleet Science Center .

Today , Konami Productions seemingly teased fans about announcing Metal Gear Solid 5 .
Although rumors have been floating around that the game would be announced at this year ’s E3 ( especially after Konami ’s announcement at GDC ) they seem to have jumped the gun by announcing it online instead – sort of .
Fans were suspicious of the new release with an animated countdown on the Konami website , where a flashing symbol in the background sported an ambiguous shape : either a “ 5 ” for “ Metal Gear Solid 5 ” or an “ S ” for “ Snake . ”
Fans have been asking for MGS5 since the release of MGS4 last June .
Although Konami stated Solid Snake ’s story was over , a sequel was always expected , possibly with Raiden taking center stage .
The countdown is now set for 200 hours , which lands on the Friday before E3 .
To further restore sense into the matter , the symbol now rotates from an “ E ” to a “ 3 ” to a “ 5 . ”
What are you trying to say Kojima ?
MGS5 @ E3 perhaps ?
First , Kojima announces at GDC that something would be announced at E3 and now this .
I ’ve heard of companies being secretive and all but , dammit it Kojima , could n’t you have given the fans at least a small taste of what ’s to come ?
Or is the stormy background a cryptic hint in and of itself ?
UPDATE 5/26 :
The countdown clock counted down faster than expected and is set to reach zero at 6 PM tonight .
Will Kojima have something to show or will it be just another countdown again ?

Britain ’s top Ultimate Fighting Championship exponent was taken to hospital for scans after his clash with Henderson went horribly wrong to leave him with an enforced three - month lay - off .
In a scene reminiscent of Ricky Hatton ’s fall against Manny Pacquiao here , Bisping lay motionless for more than two agonising minutes before coming around after a right hook that has now posed serious questions about his future .
In a woeful end to his appearance at the big UFC 100 bash , Bisping found himself on the wrong end of a series of brutal punches from 38 - year - old Henderson and admitted afterwards : “ I honestly do n’t know what happened to me out there .
“ I will just have to accept what the organisers say in their rules about when I fight next and take it on the chin .
But I do know that I have the ability to bounce right back and succeed in my aim of lifting the world title . ”
Bisping had been promised a crack at world champion Anderson Silva if he beat Henderson , his rival coach in a recent TV series which pitched a UK team against a USA one .
But Henderson just had too much in his armoury for him and it all left Bisping saying : “ I was found wanting and I know it .
“ Henderson won it fair and square and I have nothing but praise for him . ”
Bisping received a vote of confidence from the UFC ’s Marshall Zelaznik , who said : “ You have nothing to worry about when it comes to debating if Michael comes back and wins a world title or not .
“ He will certainly do that .
Of that I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever .
The thing about UFC , unlike boxing , is that losing a fight does n’t mean that you are finished .
“ You can lose fights in our organisation and still go on for world titles . ”
Bisping agreed , adding : “ I have seen people like my training partner ‘ Rampage ’ Jackson lose fights in one or two rounds and still go on to become one of the best light - heavyweight fighters of them all , so I am not disheartened in any way . ”
American Henderson certainly put in a vintage performance that now leaves Bisping at the back of the queue to challenge Silva .
And Henderson must be at the front after his brutal stoppage of ‘ The Count ’ earned him the $ 100,000 Knockout of the Night bonus .
Bisping had never even been knocked down before , yet even after getting rocked in the first round by Henderson ’s big right hand , he surprisingly kept circling into it and ultimately paid the price .
There was criticism for Henderson , who after knocking Bisping out clean on his feet , went on to slam in another power shot as the Lancastrian lay stretched on his back .
To add insult to injury , Henderson stated directly afterwards : “ Normally I ’m not that way in fights .
“ I know if the guy ’s out , I tend to stop .
I hit him hard but I got that last blow in just to shut him up a little bit . ”
In the main event , world heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar defeated Frank Mir in the second round to show again that he is the most feared UFC exponent around .
How on earth did these two men , who at first refused to identify themselves , come to be there , trying to ride the train into Switzerland carrying bonds worth more than the gross domestic product of Singapore ?
If the bonds were genuine , the pair would have been America 's fourth - biggest creditor , ahead of the UK and just behind Russia .
No sooner had the story leaked out from the Italian lakes region last week than it sparked a panoply of conspiracy tales .
But one resounded more than any other : that the men were agents of the Japanese finance ministry , in the country for the G8 meeting , making a surreptitious journey into Switzerland to sell off one small chunk of the massive mountain of US bonds stacked up in the Japanese Treasury vaults .
The murder of a British - born gem- mine owner in Kenya has revealed the dark underside of the country 's precious stones trade .
As the BBC Swahili service 's Kenneth Mungai reports , the death of Campbell Bridges was far from an isolated incident .
The landscape is dotted by scenic hills covered by dried shrubs and dense vegetation .
The hills and the ground underfoot hold unimaginable wealth - gemstones like green , red , rose and almandine garnet , tsavorite and ruby .
I 've had many problems since I dug up my own mine
Farmer Luka Kitimbi
On Tuesday renowned gemmologist Campbell Bridges was murdered - apparently by illegal miners known locally as " zururazururas " meaning layabouts .
This tragedy is painfully familiar to Luka Kitimbi , a farmer who discovered deposits of blue alexandrite while digging a toilet in his farm .
He has been miserable ever since .
A string of unknown people have been arriving at his farm , claiming ownership of the land - despite Mr Kitimbi having been there for 27 years .
Firstly he says more than 400 illegal miners invaded his farm and stole vast amounts of the mineral .
And in April a gang attacked his family - killing his 17 - year - old daughter and seriously injuring his wife .
" My home was attacked by four gunmen .
They killed my child and shot my wife but she did not die , " he says .
Mr Kitimbi was not at home during the attack , but he believes he would have been killed .
His house and furniture are pockmarked by bullet holes , and he now needs to defend his land from people claiming it on a daily basis .
" I 've had many problems since I dug up my own mine , I have had people saying this land belongs to them , that I have pegged my mine on my neighbour 's land , so they own it , " he says .
He now speaks of sleepless nights , strange phone calls and rumours about his impending murder .
Gemstone cartels
While minerals in these areas were discovered in the 1970s , little has been done by the government to regulate the industry .
Many of the miners who have been in the area for more than 30 years are badly paid and dirt poor - visibly haggard and malnourished .
Luka Kitimbi's walls are pockmarked by bullet holes
Many have turned to illegal mining , and often go back to the mineshafts at night to steal from the mines .
They live hand to mouth and would sell the gemstones just to eat a meal .
They end up taking the gemstones to market every Sunday morning in the dusty villages of Mkuki and Kamtonga .
They sell minerals worth more than $ 1,000 on the world market for as little as 150 Kenyan shillings ( $ 2 ) on the black market .
Cartels control the gemstone markets - and their agents buy up the gems and take them to Nairobi , making a huge profit .
About 12 mining companies are legally registered to mine in the area .
But miners are poorly paid , and locals often feel cheated of their land and resources .
Peter Kilelo Muindi , a local miner , says few Kenyans benefit from the gemstone trade .
" We have Asian businessmen who have invested here , bringing prices down , " he says .
" If you want Kenyan gemstones , you go and buy them in Bombay ( Mumbai ) .
This should be happening in Nairobi or here in Voi . "

Over the course of the weekend , it took me 5 hours and 15 minutes to see the credits of Shadow Complex — the 3D throwback to Super Metroid and Castlevania : Symphony of the Night from Epic Games that was announced at this year 's E3 — and in many ways I feel like I have just begun .
I have n't found all the items , I have n't seen the entire map , and I 've barely mastered all the powers the game grants you in my first playthrough .
If you 're a completist , if you have a hanking for some classic 2D game play , or if you just want to see how far downloadable titles have come since the launch of the Xbox 360 , come Wednesday , you need to put down your $ 15 and play a very energetic action title that wants you to explore its every shadowy corner .
For someone just looking for a camping trip , our hero is surprisingly well - trained
Title Shadow Complex Developer Chair Entertainment / Epic Games Publisher Microsoft Game Studios Price 1200 Points , or $ 15 Platform Xbox 360
The game stars Jason Fleming , a man who will actually call himself an everyman at one point in the game .
He also has a past with some fairly intense weapons training , but he decided against military service .
His father — in one of those epic bits of foreshadowing — hints that Jason simply may not have anything to fight for quite yet .
When he goes on what should be a fun weekend with his girlfriend and they discover a hole in the ground , the adventure begins .
There is something delicious about the setup .
You begin with a regular man in a tough spot , and by the end of the game you 've turned into a powered - up , insanely powerful killing machine .
The way the game segues from brightly colored nature scenes into a high - tech military facility ( and back again ) is magical , giving the area you 're exploring the feel of a real place that makes a sort of crazy sense .
Wait until you swim across the surface of the lake for the first time , and then see what 's under it a few hours later .
I do n't want to spoil things for you , but that cabin is n't merely the abandoned home of some unseen fisherman .
The game takes place in two - dimensional space ... mostly .
You 'll also be asked to shoot into the background , and the controls for aiming away from yourself can be awkward at first , but you 'll quickly get used to it .
The turret sequences are likewise refreshingly short and to the point .
The real fun is finding new weapons and powers and using them to unlock new areas of the base as you find out what 's going down .
Again , talking about the story is n't something I 'd like to do , but we find out through background conversations that after the revolution , the Cubs will be the first with their backs to the wall .
What do I need to blow up a purple door again ?
In a fun twist , you shine your flashlight onto doors and hidden hatches to reveal their color , showing you what weapon you need to access that part of the base .
You 'll need your foam gun for some sections , missiles for another , and of course you 'll find some underwater gear to explore the underground lakes and rivers .
The animation is worthy of a full - priced game , and killing the somewhat bland henchmen is kept fresh with a variety of both weapons - based and hand - to - hand killing animations .
You 'll level up quicker by killing people in interesting ways , so be sure to keep an eye on your surroundings .
The story offers some twists and turns — some more expected than others — but the voice acting and characters are well above average , especially for a $ 15 release .
There are some corners cut here and there , as the enemies are very similar throughout the entirety of the game , and boss fights tend toward now - familiar walking mech designs , but the real star here is the expertly designed world ; it opens like a flower , urging you to explore just one more corner before turning in for the night .
You 'll have to track down save points , but there are also auto - saves sprinkled around the world , so dying is rarely a frustration .
The end is the beginning is the end
The game falters in its final act , where you 're stuck running around a mostly unlocked map trying to track down a series of weapons .
When you finally have your super - powerful character unleashed on the world , the credits come sooner than expected .
My advice ?
Avoid the final conflict for a while in order to enjoy your now god - like powers ; you 'll be glad you did .
Even if you do beat the game , and my barely five - hour first try felt leisurely to me , you can try again at a higher level keeping your experience , but losing your items and weapons .
No matter , you 'll want to play again to see everything you missed .
There is also a set of training missions to practice using all the equipment you gain throughout the course of the game , as well as a series of challenge maps to test your skills against the clock and the rest of Xbox Live .
Do n't let my five - hour play time fool you ; the game is filled with replay value .
How many hours will you get out of it ?
That 's completely up to you and your playing style , but if you had to find every inch of the map when you played past Castlevania / Metroid games , you wo n't be putting this down any time soon .
This does n't feel like a downloadable title in quality or presentation ; everything from the graphics to the voice acting and the somewhat pulpy story impresses on multiple levels .
I can think of many moments and details and asides that stick out in my mind , but it 's better for everyone if you simply play for yourself on Wednesday , August 19 .
I 'm watching online videos and peeping screenshots , and I 'm finding ways to tackle situations and use weapons that I completely missed the first time through .
It seems odd that an Xbox Live Arcade title may be one of the best games this season , but there it is : this is a must - play for those looking for a classic twist on a fresh challenge .
Verdict : Buy
Before I review the episode , I have to express what may be a psychological problem of mine or an actual problem in the editing room .
There have been a few instances in all the episodes where the sound effects or the music overpowered the voices and I had to rewatch the scene .
I 'm not entirely sure where the problem lies because the actors seem to be doing a good job projecting in other instances .
The other thing I noticed is that there is occasionally a very shaky camera .
I distinctly remember one scene in this episode when Pete and Myka are talking in Claudia 's apartment and I really noticed the camera moving around like crazy .
There was another scene in last weeks episode that seemed to have the same problem but I assumed it was just a fluke .
Maybe it's in my mind , maybe it is n't .
I do n't look specifically for these kind of things , but I guess something caught my attention so I assume there is something .
I liked how the writers switched things up this episode and focused a lot on Artie instead of Myka and Pete finding an artifact .
Claudia , the title character of this episode , is in fact the hacker and knew Artie from a long time ago .
Her brother Joshua was being supervised by Artie had been in a lab accident and died when she was young .
We see this in a series of vague flashbacks showing the events leading up to the accident .
Claudia is kind of crazy , kidnaps Artie and brings him to the same warehouse her brother 's accident occurred .
Apparently he is still alive , but stuck in another plane or something .
We see him in intervals yelling from behind a cloudy thing .
I 'll admit the show does a poor job of explaining things , so stuff just happens , and Claudia is getting worse psychically from being there .
Pete and Myka come back to the warehouse and discover using a cool artifact that Artie is kidnapped .
Under orders of Mrs. Frederick and start investigating , leading them to Claudia 's apartment ( not her orders ) , and finding out that Joshua 's experiment had been teleportation aided by Rheticus 's compass .
I think I know why the procedural element of the show is so lacking .
They go through very few steps , simplifying the whole thing , but at one point , someone takes a huge step forward in the case without any deduction or induction .
Myka or Pete just comes up with something and then runs with it .
There does n't seem to be any build - up .
In this episode , it was pretty clear .
Pete randomly thinks Rheticus put puzzles in his artifacts so he thinks the compass has a hidden panel with other rules .
The team gets to Artie and Claudia and tell Artie their discovery .
Artie and Claudia touch Joshua and get sucked into his realm .
Artie grabs the compass , finds the panel , follows the instructions , and saves Joshua .
Mrs. Frederick expresses deep concern over the information Claudia knows and has to deal with it .
I liked the characterization of Claudia .
She was n't too crazy , still wanted to get her brother back after so many years , and was n't too stiff .
One thing I like about the scifi- lite genre , even in the most dire situations , the dialogue can still be funny .
The shows needs some serious cleaning up to do , but I think the dynamic between Myka and Pete , the mysteriousness of Mrs. Frederick and Leena , and Artie and definitely the strong points of the show .
Now only if they could make a coherent storyline ...
Score : 8.7/10 ( same as last week 's )
The commander of Iran 's Ground Forces says the country has developed its defense doctrine based on the military capabilities and the ' weak points ' of its enemies .
" " Iran 's armed forces , including the Ground Forces , have managed to develop the necessary weapons to confront any threats and this is achieved through analysis of the enemies ' capabilities and weak points , " " IRNA quoted Ahmad - Reza Pourdastan as saying . " " For example we have found that the enemies suffer weaknesses in conducting operations in close range fighting , " " he noted .
As a result , the Ground Forces developed " " innovative weaponry " " in a move , which apart from improving the country 's defense capabilities has boosted the Iranian service members ' morale , Pourdastan said .
The commander concluded that Iran 's modern arsenal " " will inflict serious damage " " upon any aggressor .

It seems the trend that started in the U.S.A. has finally crossed the atlantic .
Virgin Media , the only cable operator left in the U.K. , has added one new trick to their internet pipes crippling policies !
They are now doing DNS hijacking too !
If this is the kind of stuff that comes out of Digital Britain , I ’d like to say a big NO Thank You !
The good news is that you can opt out very easily .

EUROPE 's companies negotiate a costly and tortuous patent regime .
Inventors apply to the European Patent Office , with which all 27 members of the European Union and nine other European countries co-operate .
Once granted , patents must be validated , translated and annually renewed in all those countries in which a firm wants protection .
Litigation is on a national basis , so courts in each country can in effect overturn patents granted by the EPO , or uphold patents which have been invalidated by it .
As a result , a new paper estimates that it can cost between four and ten times more to get a patent in Europe than in America , Japan , China or South Korea , depending on how many countries are involved .
In 2008 the burden was reduced somewhat by an agreement under which countries can waive the right to have patents translated into their national language .
So far , however , only 14 countries have agreed to do so .

Due to lack of motivation and needed recovery from the Hamfighters softball party , I did n’t write a post yesterday .
To make up for my laziness , today will be a double post day .
In this issue of Crown Gems I will recap some news items from the previous week and drop a few links as well .
Tonight ’s post will deal with recent DFA moves in baseball and of course the DFA of Sidney Ponson .
Noteworthy News and Notes on the Farm :
RF - Jordan Parraz was promoted to AAA and made his debut for the Omaha Royals on Tuesday July 28th .
After 3 games he was 0 - 9 , but he recovered to go 7 - 12 with 3 doubles in his last 3 .
Overall , Parraz now has a line of 0.333/.391/.476 in his 21 AAA at bats .
He is now hitting 0.356/.442/.557 in 264 at bats covering his time in Omaha , NW Arkansas , and his 4 game rehab stint in Idaho Falls .
On Sports Radio 810 WHB this morning there have been a couple of negative comments about Mike Moustakas so I thought it would be appropriate to provide another update .
In his last 10 games , Moose has hit 0.316/.381/.632 with 4 doubles , 1 triple , 2 home runs , and 12 RBI .
Even with his “ struggles ” this season the power , production , and talent are still apparent .
He is among the Carolina League ’s top 10 in ; HR ( 9th ) , RBI ( 4th ) , 2B ( 4th ) , and Total Bases ( 6th ) .
22 year old RHP - Daniel Gutierrez made his 2009 season debut in Wilmington on July 28th and pitched 1 scoreless inning of relief allowing only 1 hit .
He made his 2nd appearance on Friday and pitched 2 scoreless innings allowing 1 hit while striking out 2 . Gutierrez was drafted by the Royals in the 33rd round of the 2005 draft and remains one of the Royals top prospects .
Last year in Low - A with the Burlington Bees , he compiled a 2.70 ERA , 1.200 WHIP , 4.16 K/ BB , and 10.4 K/9 in 90.0 innings pitched .
His 2009 debut had been delayed due to injury .
The promotion of Parraz and the debut of Gutierrez were n’t the only significant events on July 28th .
LHP - Danny
Duffy left his start that day with tightness in his back after throwing only 3.1 innings .
He has n’t missed his turn in the rotation yet so I do n’t know if this is something to be legitimately concerned about or not .
Hopefully Duffy is healthy and back on the mound quickly .
Thus far this season I have neglected to mention 24 year old RHP - Juan Abreu who , on Friday , gave up his first runs of the season as a member of the NW Arkansas Natruals bullpen .
Prior to his July 20th debut in Double - A , Abreu was pitching in Wilmington .
With the Blue Rocks , he pitched 21.1 innings with a 1.69 ERA , 1.031 WHIP , 2.00 K / BB , 11.8 K/9 , and racked up 12 saves in 20 appearances .
Despite his rough outing on Friday , he still has a 2.84 ERA , 1.263 WHIP , 1.57 K / BB , 15.6 K/9 and 2 saves through his first 5 appearances as a member of the Naturals .
“ Programming ” Note : The Pitching Perspectives series is being dismantled and rebuilt .
It will return in the near future with a new name , Rotation Review , and a new focus .
Notably , it will no longer include bullpen statistics .
It will now focus on the starts from the previous week not only the ML rotation , but the rotations of Omaha , NW Arkansas , Wilmington , and Burlington as well .
My plan is to put it together and publish it early in the week , but I ’m not sure whether it will appear on a weekly or every other week basis .

A wireless alarm method is the best decision considering the fact that lots of management panels is often mounted devoid of penetrating any of your partitions .
They are effortlessly eliminated and taken to your following area that you simply shift to .
Do I have to pay for for Property Safety ?
There is always a price to only about almost everything .
Tend not to be fooled through the ads that say you can get a totally free protection procedure .

You ’ve got a number of possibilities while in the amount of money of money that you simply pay but there ’ll often be a expense .

This is often a onetime price until you decide on to broaden and incorporate more gadgets .

The expense of the gear are going to be exactly the same .
Should you do your individual installation and wish to get monitoring by an experienced organization then they are going to demand you at least a provider simply call plus a monthly charge for checking .

Understand that everywhere you go should have a built in markup around the gear .
Option Four - Professional Install with Checking
Companies most economical method of getting a safety procedure with the small term .
I say short term as the alarm set up corporation gives you a absolutely free safety process .
On the other hand the program is going to be restricted in gadgets .
The everyday no cost offer is three door sensors and 1 motion detector .

Am I required to possess a mobile phone line or mobile phone for my protection procedure ?

If you prefer to have your private home monitored then you really should choose for getting a telephone line or else you can use mobile know - how .
This does not suggest which you have to have a cell cellphone .
The command panel contains a GSM product that employs cell cell phone towers to communicate into the central station as a substitute in the common mobile phone line .

Your checking service will range between $ 24.ninety nine to $ 65.00 for each thirty day period relying over the alarm firm plus the characteristics you are employing .
In the event you opt to make use of a cell phone line you will be introducing an additional $ 20.00 per thirty day period .
Is Mobile superior than Landline checking ?
In my view cell cellphone monitoring is the greatest form of checking .
A landline can easily be disabled by a savvy burglar .

By then the alarm would ’ve now been brought on .

Music and art instruction in American eighth - grade classrooms has remained flat over the last decade , according to a new survey by the Department of Education , and one official involved in the survey called student achievement in those subjects “ mediocre . ”
The survey , released on Monday , was conducted as part of a nationwide test of music and arts achievement administered last year .
As the first federal effort since 1997 to examine instruction and measure student achievement in music and the arts , the survey has added new evidence to the debate about whether American schools are cutting back on the subjects they teach to concentrate on improving students ’ basic skills .
In the test , formally known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress in Arts , administrators at 260 public and private schools were asked how much time they devoted to art and music instruction , and 7,900 eighth - grade students were tested on art and music concepts , a small sample compared with other federal assessments .
For example , in 2007 , the department tested 700,000 students in reading and math , and 29,000 in history .
The small number of students tested , and the 11 - year gap since the most recent federal arts test , limited the assessment ’s usefulness for reaching conclusions about achievement trends , federal testing officials said .
Part 1 : The explosive growth of the iTunes App Store
Part 3 : The iTunes App Store Bannings and Rejections
The iTunes App Store was revolutionary in that it made it possible for independent developers to compete on the same playing field as big time publishers .
The idea that any developer with a good idea could showcase a product to millions of potential customers with no significant barrier to entry has forever changed the way people develop mobile software .
While big name developers like EA have undoubtedly had their fair share of success with the app store , it ’s been the small - time developers , and often individuals , who have charmed the public with stories of iPhone success , and garnered national media attention in the process .
Here , in Part II of our iTunes App Store retrospective , we take a sequential look at some of the smaller developers who were able to strike it rich with the app store .
The Successful App Store Developers
Trism
The first App Store success story belonged to Steve Demeter , the developer behind the popular puzzle game Trism .
Early this fall , and just 2 months after the debut of the iTunes App Store , Demeter noted that Trism had netted him over $ 250,000 in profits .
What made Demeter ’s story so compelling , and unusual at the time , was that he coded the game entirely by himself over the course of 4 months , while still maintaining his day job as an ATM software designer .
Demeter comically noted that a buddy of his came up with the name ‘ Trism ’ , and that he subsequently paid him a few grand for his marketing efforts .
Demeter subsequently quit his day job to launch a new company , called Demiforce , to focus exclusively on iPhone development .
The success of Trism opened up everybody ’s eyes to the potential of the iTunes App Store as a business .
250 grand is n’t chump change , and Trism ’s impressive profits served to highlight that that you did n’t need a team of professional developers working with corporate funding in order to succeed on the iTunes App Store .
i Fart Mobile
While Apple ’s app store acceptance policies are still far from perfect , it was n’t too long ago that Apple policed the app store with puritanical authority .
No farting apps , no drinking apps , and basically no fun apps were allowed .
Luckily , Apple soon came to its senses , and once that happened , in came the farting and vomit apps by the dozens .
But one app in particular proved to more successful than most , and that was iFart .
iFart , as the name suggests , is a $.99 novelty iPhone app that plays a wide variety of fart sounds .
It was initially released in mid December and over a 2 week period it earned over $ 80,000 in profits .
Even more impressive is that over a 2 day period covering Christmas Eve and Christmas Day , iFart famously made over $ 40,000 in profits with over 58,000 people purchasing a copy .
iSteam
In mid-January , a couple of 22 year olds announced that they had already made over $ 100,00 with their iPhone app called iSteam .
iSteam is a program that makes it appear that you have a layer of steam on your iPhone .
Users can then wipe their fingers across the screen to write messages , and / or reveal what ’s on the screen , mimicking an actual steamed up bathroom mirror .
The developers of iSteam payed a lot of attention to the UI and included nice touches such as realistic sound effects when “ writing ” messages , and also , if you turn your iPhone upside down , droplets begin to slowly move downward .
Now that ’s real , baby !
i Shoot
Just one month later came the impressive story of iShoot .
i Shoot is an iPhone artillery game developed by Ethan Nicholas , who subsequently quit his job as an engineer at Sun after his app raked netted over $ 600,000 in just one month .
In an interview at the time , Nicholas stated , “ I ’m not going to be to be a millionaire in the next month , but I ’d be shocked if it did n’t happen at the end of the year . ”
The success of iShoot was significant because it was the first app to successfully use the strategy of offering a “ lite ” version in order to generate a lot of download volume , which in turn directed fans of the game to the then $ 3 paid full version of the game .
As with Trism , the success of iShoot highlighted just how much money individual programmers could potentially earn with a hit application .
And in a somewhat motivational twist , Nicholas noted that prior to developing iShoot , he had never coded in Objective - C before .
Enigmo / Cro Mag Rally
One of the more impressive , though less heralded , app store success stories has been that of Pangea Software , the development house behind popular iPhone games like Cro Mag Rally and the physics based 3D puzzle game Enigmo .
At the SXSW conference last March , Pangea founder Brian Greenstone explained that his company ’s iPhone apps have been selling so well that they will no longer develop applications for the Mac , and will instead focus their efforts solely on iPhone and iPod Touch development – a pretty powerful statement coming from a company that ’s been developing Apple software for over 2 decades .
“ There ’s basically no point in going back to the Mac “ , said Greenstone , “ the iPhone is a more entertaining platform to develop for , and it makes 50 times as much money as the Mac . ”
Enigmo in particular has proven to be quite the cash cow for Pangea , and as of last March , it had already generated over $ 1.5 million in revenue with over 800,000 paid downloads .
That averages out to over $ 185,000 a month , and that ’s after Apple takes its 30 % cut .
Looking Forward
Since the iTunes App Store first debuted , the number of available applications has skyrocketed from 500 to over 60,000 .
With each passing month , it obviously becomes more of a challenge for a particular app to get noticed in the midst of literally thousands of other applications .
Because of this , many have proclaimed that the iTunes App Store is too bloated for its own good .
But while there is an undeniable amount of crapware in the app store , there are well over 40 million iPhone and iPod Touch users out there , and as a developer , those numbers are impossible to ignore , especially when iPhone and iPod Touch owners download more applications , on average , than users of any other smartphone .
Over the past 12 months , a large number of apps have generated an insane amount of money .
From Pocket God to Flick Fishing , many apps have generated millions of dollars in profits .
But the apps listed above were chosen because they , for the most part , represent what ’s possible with the app store from the vantage point of an individual .
EA will probably make a boatload of money selling SIMS for the iPhone , but it ’s the developers like Ethan Nicholas and Steve Demeter that inspire the masses to take a serious look into what coding for the iPhone is all about .
In 1995 - when Apollo 13 was a box - office hit , O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murder , and 168 people were killed in the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City - Chadwick , a corporate lawyer who grew up in Bryn Mawr , was embroiled in a nasty divorce .
In April of that year , he was arrested by two sheriff 's deputies at his dentist 's Center City office and taken to jail .

“ Sekhmet ” ~ by Laurel Green
As often happens my brain revs up to impossible speeds just as I ’m going to sleep .
I am certain that this is because “ normal working hours ” are at odds with the hours in which I work best .
I am NOT .
Bloody .
Diurnal .
If the average person has an 8 - hour window within which they can best rock the mike , mine is sure as fuck not 9 - 5 .
I ’m at the height of focus at the 6 PM - 2 AM shift .
I loved working graveyard , back in the day .
Every day I fight against the way I have been my entire life to squeeze into a system that is n’t working and never did .
My Mom has stories of literally walking me though morning as a kid , and yet finding me under the blankets with a book and a flashlight in the middle of the night .
Last few nights I have been flipping back and forth between thoughts about a solo show that is hammering on my brain … a story that I have to tell and it is becoming more important .
OK , fair enough .
Then I had a sudden series of thoughts on things I feel I need to say to other kinky folks .
OK , sure , great .
Now of course the internal committee calls a hasty meeting , roiling raucously and figuring out how best to hammer this idea to the wall so that it makes sense in the stupefying light of day .
It was something about Submitting , being fierce , embracing your Leather Identity … mull mull .
An acronym formed around this idea : S.E.L.F. Submissives … submissives what …… OK , Embracing Leather Fiercely .
Nice .
That was easy .
Snappy .
Sassy .
Win .
Now , what does it mean ?
I think too fast … far faster than I can type but in ten minutes I had the outline for a class on being submissive , and being fierce in your submission , and how to remain true to your identity , and not softening your fucking boundaries because you do n’t fit in .
It really struck a chord for me .
All of the times I am told “ You do n’t seem submissive . ” and “ You MUST be a top or a dom ! ” rushed back to me like so many gnats and I growled in my head .
Why ca n’t people see that you can be in service in a way that EMBODIES your strength , rather than draping it in fancies and fuckery so that you do n’t “ intimidate ” or even “ scare away ” a potential partner ?
Fuck .
That .
Fuck it right in the ear .
I wanna be the lioness .
The predator .
The top of the food chain , the Goddess … AND submissive .
Dammit .
One story of a God ’s progress that speaks to me is that of Sekhmet .
She was Egypt ’s warrior goddess , and badass as fuck .
Her job was to serve the God-King Pharaoh , protect him in battle , and all kind of coolness .
She also was a healer , and so was capable of fixing up anything she took down .
Additionally , Sekhmet had some anger management issues .
She was assigned with the awesome task of fucking shit up , all of the time .
She liked beer , a lot , so you can see how her mythology appealed to me .
Eventually , as she was wading through rivers of blood and feasting on it , to the detriment of the human race , Ra finally was all “ Shit , she ’s gonna wipe out every motherfucking thing .
“ So he dyed a shitload of beer red , Hathor thought it was blood and so she pounded it .
Evidently this mellowed her out enough that she gave up slaughter , blood drinking and burning the fuck out of everything and was smushed with a gentler deity ’s persona : Hathor .
Who is much more chill , and is all about the healing and the teaching .
I , of course , know nothing about drunken wrath * cough * but I DO know that being a fierce warrior is often NOT the purview of submissive .
Yet there is a broad spectrum of service .
From the person who wants to be a footstool and totally objectified to the slave who can bring home the bacon … fry it up in a pan…and tackle finances in Quicken with one hand .
There is a great deal more here , but my brain is on the job sorting it out for later regurgitation .
I think it is high time I talk about the collared lioness .
And how being a submissive sure as fuck can also mean fucking shit up .
( CNN ) --
A controversial bill that California legislators say would allow the early release of more than 27,000 inmates from crowded prisons will be taken up by the state Assembly on Monday .
Inmates at Mule Creek State Prison in Ione , California , interact in a gym modified to house them in August 2007 .
The Senate on Thursday passed the corrections package 21 - 19 , after Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , assured senators the changes would protect the public from the most violent offenders .
The legislation also would direct more resources toward parolees , he said .
Senate Republicans say the bill would undermine public safety .
All 15 Senate Republicans voted against the measure .
Both houses of the legislature are controlled by Democrats .
Consideration of the bill comes as California faces a mid-September deadline for reducing its prison population by about 40,000 inmates .
A special panel of three federal judges issued the order , contending the crowded prison system violates prisoners ' constitutional rights .
The judges said they will make the reductions themselves if the state fails to act .
The measure would save the financially strapped state $ 524.5 million , according to a statement from Steinberg 's office .
When coupled with budget revisions that lawmakers made in July , the total corrections savings would be $ 1.2 billion , he said .
That is the amount that Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wants as part of his efforts to cut state spending and balance the budget .
Republicans said the bill would lead to the release of about 27,000 prisoners , while Democrats estimated it would reduce the prison population by 27,300 in the 2009 - 10 fiscal year and 37,000 during fiscal year 2010 - 11 .
" It is undeniable that the real failure of our criminal justice system is that it fails to distinguish between violent offenders and nonviolent offenders , " Steinberg said .
" Of course , we want to keep violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities , and this reform package is a necessary step to do that because it concentrates our incarceration efforts on the violent criminals and ensures that nonviolent offenders have more contact with parole officers , " he said .
Some nonviolent offenders could serve shorter sentences .
According to Steinberg , each parole officer in California is responsible for about 70 parolees , many of whom recommit crimes and go back to jail .
If the legislation is passed , the ratio would be reduced to 45 to 1 , he said .
" They [ parole officers ] cannot adequately supervise those who are the most at risk and those who are the most risk to the public safety , " Steinberg said .
With a lesser workload , the officers also can make more home visits and arrange more meetings with the people they supervise , the lawmaker said .
Senate Republicans called the legislation a threat to public safety .
" Among the inmates who could be eligible for early release under the Democrat plan include felons convicted of human trafficking , stalking , identity theft , violent child abuse and threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction , " the Republican Caucus said in a written statement .
" Unfortunately , this proposal exploits a fiscal crisis in order to advance a dangerous liberal agenda that seeks to undo successful anti-crime laws , " said Senate Republican Leader Dennis Hollingsworth of Murrieta .
GOP lawmakers in the Senate also strongly opposed the creation of what they described as " an unelected and unaccountable sentencing commission that would be given broad authority to alter important public safety laws . "
The legislation would establish a 16 - member Sentencing Commission that would put in place new sentencing guidelines by July 1 , 2012 .
Unless vetoed by the legislature and governor , the guidelines would become effective January 1 , 2013 .
The 13 voting members of the commission would include the chief justice of the California Supreme Court , a judge appointed by the chief justice , the state public defender and the secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
A crime victim would be among the three ex-officio members .
California Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Los Angeles , issued a statement early Friday morning , explaining that the assembly recessed around midnight and will reconvene Monday .
On Thursday and into Friday morning , she said in the statement , " we have been taking into account many of the concerns raised by law enforcement , and are working toward a bill that the people of California can agree makes sense , " and that process will continue through the weekend .
" Our target remains a responsible approach that will achieve our public safety and budgetary goals , and allow us to prevent the wholesale release of prisoners by federal judges . "
" Relieving prison overcrowding and reducing recidivism are monumental challenges , but they are challenges that we will not retreat from , " Schwarzenegger told an audience of prosecutors in June .
California has a 70 percent recidivism rate .

The SPLC , for anyone who is n’t aware , is one of the nation ’s premiere organizations that tracks extremists such as white supremacists and the Klan .
The fact that they ’re weighing in on this one is very interesting .
One thing that I was wondering about , before I read the letter ( below ) , was the “ so what ? ” factor .
Meaning , yeah it ’s absurd to say that Obama was n’t really born in the states , but so what ?
We won the election , and anyone who is going to be believe Obama is n’t legitimate is n’t going to believe us any more if we get rid of Lou Dobbs .
And in any case , is n’t Lou Dobbs permitted to be a bit of an idiot at times ( often ) ?
Then I read SPLC ’s letter .
Do read the excerpt below .
I did not realize that the birther rumors , like many of the rumors Dobbs promotes , have their origins in the racist right .
That is why SPLC is getting involved , and that is a disturbing trend for CNN ’s Dobbs .
An excerpt of SPLC ’s letter to CNN head Jonathan King :
As he has in several other instances , Mr. Dobbs , in taking up the birthers ’ claims , is adopting an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that originated on the radical racist right .
As Gawker.com has reported , this particular conspiracy theory was first developed by an open anti-Semite and circulated by right - wing extremists who cannot accept the fact that a black man has been elected president of the United States .
Among its adherents was neo -Nazi James von Brunn , the alleged murderer of a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C. , this June .
Von Brunn had helped spread the birthers ’ claims on the Internet and attacked the “ dishonest & conspiratorial Media ” for not taking them up .
This is not the first time Mr. Dobbs has pushed racist conspiracy theories or defamatory falsehoods about immigrants .
We wrote you in 2007 to bring to your attention his utterly false claim that 7,000 new cases of leprosy had appeared in the United States in a recent three - year period , due at least in part to immigrants .
( The real number , according to official statistics , was about 400 .
Mr. Dobbs took his spurious information from the late right - wing extremist , Madeleine Cosman . )
In addition , Mr. Dobbs has reported as fact the so - called Aztlan conspiracy , which claims that undocumented Mexican immigrants are part of a plot to “ reconquer ” the American Southwest .
He has suggested there is something to a related conspiracy theory that claims the governments of Mexico , the United States and Canada are secretly planning to merge into the “ North American Union . ”
He has falsely claimed that “ illegal aliens ” fill one third of American prison and jail cells .
And Mr. Dobbs has routinely disparaged , on CNN ’s air , those who have had the integrity to point out the falsity of these and similar claims .
Respectable news organizations should not employ reporters willing to peddle racist conspiracy theories and false propaganda .
It ’s time for CNN to remove Mr. Dobbs from the airwaves .
And here is Jon Stewart ’s commentary on Dobb ’s coverage of this , after the jump .
Boing Boing reader Travis emailed me this photo , along with the following :
I found this odd tombstone in Walla Walla , Washington .
I liked getting high and strolling through the graveyard cuz there were a lot of really old masonic tombs .
But this is just …. the weirdest one I 've ever seen .
Maybe I missed something and someone on boingboing might have a clue ?
UPDATE : More photos here .
There are inscriptions on the back and on top of the tombstone .

Please rate this video with 1 star to show your hate for their ignorance .
Following yesterday's news that the Case - Shiller Index showed the second - straight month of home price gains in June , analyst Mark Hanson , of Mark Hanson Mortgage Advisors is out calling the numbers the " ultimate false bottom . "
The argument that the current bump - up in housing prices is meaningless is one that 's been going around for awhile and that we 've addressed before .
The idea is that foreclosures sales are home - price killers when they occur .
But they are non-seasonal and have basically held steady .
All that the home price increase reflects , then , is the expected seasonal increase in higher - end , non-foreclosure sales .
This chart from Hanson explains
He also makes an important observation about who is the current mid- to - high - end seller :
Now , think about those that are selling these mid-to - high priced houses .
It is not the person who bought from 2005 - 2007 on a Pay Option ARM with 5 % down because they ca n’t sell .
It is the person who bought years ago that has enough equity to dump the price , sell , and have enough left over for the down payment on the house they plan to steal in the desert .
Even with the price dump , a person who bought in 1999 for $ 450 k -- who saw their house price rise to $ 1.5 million by 2007 and subsequently drop to $ 700 k -- realizes a price gain and so does CS .
Even though CS reduces the weighting of pair sales the longer ago they occurred -- when this is all you have selling -- it carries most of the weight .
The bottom line is that CS may not be accurately representing properties purchased during the bubble years that are now worth a fraction of their purchase price because they are not transacting .
If they did it would put offsetting pressure on the index .
But the homeowner who bought at the peak in 2005 is sure feeling the negative - equity pain from the comparable sale at $ 700 k .
So much so , he is at an exponentially greater risk of loan default and foreclosure .
The kind - of good news : Hanson believes that home prices have probably stabilized at the low end .
But at the high end , where you 've got all those folks with their 2005 - vintage Pay Option ARMs , there 's still a long way to go down .
Why is it that stories of sexual violence against women have never been part of the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Civil War ?

I saw this commercial yesterday and could n’t find anything about it online or even on the KFC website .
I thought I had dreamed it up , but when it came on today I snagged it with my cellphone ( sorry ’bout the quality ) :
You just saw the KFC Double Down Chicken Sandwich .
Who dreamed this up ?
This is perhaps the most insane “ sandwich ” I have ever seen .
A fried chicken patty , 2 slices of cheese , 2 slices of bacon , and another fried chicken patty .
Wow .
Sorry I do n’t have much else to say , it is like the Monster Burger of chicken .
My mind is boggled … the funny thing about this sandwich is that it is part of the “ unthink kfc ” advertising , which has previously only been for grilled chicken .
So , upon seeing this I did what anyone would do and drove over to KFC to buy the beast .
The “ meal ” is $ 6.99 , but you can buy the sandwich for a mere $ 4.99 .
The description from the horse ’s mouth :
2 Original Recipe Filets
Bacon
Pepper Jack Cheese
Swiss Cheese
Colonel ’s Sauce
So , what does it look like ?
Check out some photos :
A bit of a closeup for ya …
So , what does it taste like ?
Well , let me let Jess tell you :
That ’s it ?
That is the sandwich ?
That ’s not worth five dollars .
< takes a bite >
Oh … oh my God .
That is the best thing ever .
I do n’t know what “ Colonel ’s Sauce ” is , but it is like a party in my mouth .
This is completely worth the five dollars .
Unfortunately I ’m going to end up weighing 700 lbs after this , but it is simply amazing .
Now , I did n’t get that orgasmic feeling from it , then again , I ’m not a huge fan of fast food .
So , there you have it .
Thoughts on this new offering from KFC ?

Warner said the deal would turn it into a global drugs giant
Irish drugmaker Warner Chilcott is buying the pharmaceutical business of Procter & Gamble for $ 3.1 bn ( £ 1.9bn ) .
The move will see Warner more than triple its annual turnover , and the firm 's US listed shares jumped 26 % following the announcement .
US consumer products giant Procter said it was ending its involvement in the production of prescription drugs .
Procter makes everything from Gillette razors to Pringles crisps , Duracell batteries , and Fairy washing liquid .
" The acquisition transforms Warner Chilcott into a global pharmaceutical company , " said the Irish company .
Warner is financing the deal through debt , and said the majority of the 2,300 employees in Procter 's pharmaceuticals unit would simply transfer across .
Analysts say that Procter said decided to exit the business because of the growth in competition from generic drugmakers .
Procter 's branded drugs , such as osteoporosis treatment Actonel , have annual sales of $ 2.3bn .
It 's hard not jumping on a soap box in regards to gaming violence , children , and the ESRB ratings .
But when Blizzard 's Jay Wilson says that he allows his 9 - year - old daughter to ( presumably ) play M-rated titles , and publically admits it , the soap box begs for a few preaching feet .
Wired actually stumbled across Wilson 's wife and daughter at BlizzCon while they played Diablo III , then later tracked down Wilson himself and grilled the lead designer about his daughter and what she plays .
So what was his answer ?
Basically , Diablo III is n't quite as personal as games with guns or first - person shooters with violence .
He boils it down to choice : is the game suitable for the child despite the ESRB rating plastered on the box ?
Ultimately , he hits the nail on the head : games children play depends on the final verdict of ( hopefully ) educated parents .
A T-rated game for one child may be suitable for one , but not for another of the same age group .
" Well , I feel like for every parent you have to make a choice about what kind of content is appropriate for your child and at what age , " he told Wired .
" At a certain age , I would n’t have let her play a game like Diablo because of the violence .
And honestly , I paused before letting her play . "
According to Wilson , as a developer , it 's hard not to share his work with his daughter , especially when she wants to see the progress on his latest project .
" I do n’t really want to deprive her of that , " he said , adding that he knows his daughter well enough to know if she would have any problem handling certain content .
" To do my official company line , too , one of the things we intend to do is add parental controls so that every parent can make their own choice about what ’s appropriate for their kids , " he said .
On the other hand , do n't expect Diablo III to appeal to a wider , general audience .
" Diablo is our Mature - rated series , and it ’s important for us that it be that .
It ’s our goal , and that ’s where we want it to be . "

We want to know .
Check out our slide show for more shots from the tournament and around the stadium .
It was a moment you knew was coming ever since the Cowboys unveiled the largest - in - the - world 1080 p HDTV screen hanging above midfield in their new stadium .
Saturday afternoon at an open house for Cowboys season ticket holders , Sony held a Madden NFL 2010 tournament -- the game 's due in stores a little over a week from now -- played on the 10 - story Mitsubishi screen , even as workers finished laying down the numbers marking yardage on the field below .
" Most of the folks here are both hardcore gaming fans and Cowboys fans , " Sony spokeswoman Crystal Braswell said , and , indeed , many of the games on the big screen were Cowboys - Cowboys match - ups .
Gamers could earn a place in the tourney ahead of time by submitting a photo of themselves doing a touchdown dance involving a PlayStation , and a few more competitors were picked in a drawing at the stadium Saturday .
Out of a field of 256 players , the winner took home a PS3 and a copy of the new Madden game .
Two - hundred and fifty six players entered the tournament , which ran for about five hours .
At 3 p.m. , winners of a side tournament had the chance to take on a real - life Cowboy , the now - retired Raghib " Rocket " Ismail , at another PlayStation setup on the side of the Sony trailer parked on the field .
While the season ticket holders milling around the stands paid spotty attention to the tournament , it did produce at least one notable stat : " It 's technically the first football game to be played at Cowboys Stadium , " Braswell noted .

How to interpret lshw 's output
lshw displays nodes with attributes in a tree - like structure ( that can be in indented plain text form , HTML , XML or graphically displayed in the GUI ) .
Each node has its individual status : it be CLAIMED ( potentially usable ) or UNCLAIMED ( no driver has been detected for this node ) , ENABLED ( this device is supported and can be used ) or DISABLED ( this device is supported but has been disabled ) :
a node is marked as CLAIMED if a driver ( usually a kernel module or a driver within the monolithic kernel ) has been loaded for it
a node is marked as UNCLAIMED if no specific support for it has been loaded ( or lshw has been unable to identify the driver )
has been unable to identify the driver ) a node is marked as ENABLED if a driver has been loaded for it and is fully functional
a node is marked as DISABLED if the node has been disabled by a configuration , some hardware failure , etc .
Each node can contain sub-nodes and can have a number of attributes , capabilities , resources and configuration values .

Remarks :
size and capacity can have various meanings depending on the device : for a processor , size is the processor 's frequency in hertz ; for a disc , it 's its actual storage capacity in bytes ( and capacity refers to its unformatted capacity , including bad sectors ) ; for a network interface , size and capacity refer to bandwidth in bits per second
the size of a node is always inferior or equal to its capacity
serial refers to the device 's serial number for discs , memory , processors , various boards , etc . but is used to report MAC address for network devices , GUID for disk partitions
Capabilities
Capabilities are used to report features of a given node .
The exact meaning of each feature depends on the type of node , it can be the presence of an arithmetical co-processor for a CPU , the ability to run at 1 GB /s for a network interface , etc .
In most cases .
capabilities reported by lshw are auto - documented ( both XML and HTML versions report a comment about each feature and that comment is displayed in the GUI ) .

Changes
Last week , we explained the difference between $ 100 and $ 100,000 speakers .
But in the name of clarity , we focused on traditional loudspeakers , around longer than Keith Richards .
Here are the newer crazier types .
Advertisement
Alright , so the way speakers generate sound is by moving air .
In your standard setup , an alternating current runs through a voice , turning it into an electromagnet that is attracted to and repulsed from the permanent magnet in the driver , which moves the diaphragm ( the cone ) back and forth .
Air is moved , sound is emitted .
Advertisement
But magnets are n't the only way to generate sound , obviously .
Here are a few other ways speakers can get air a - shakin ' :
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Electrostatic Speakers
Electrostatic speakers are probably the most well - known alternative to traditional loudspeaker design .
In some ways , they 're a lot like your standard speaker — a diaphragm moves back and forth .
What 's different is the shape of the diaphragm and how the system makes it move .
The diaphragm is a thin film with electrically conductive material that 's stretched out between two conductive plates called " stators " — perforated steel sheets in Martin Logan 's speakers — coated with an insulator .
Just as the voice coil in a regular speaker is turned into an electromagnet by a current , the diaphragm and stators here are charged , creating an electrostatic field .
As the charge alternates between positive and negative the diaphragm moves back and forth , generating sound .
The stronger the charge , the more dynamically the diaphragm moves , and the louder the sound .
Advertisement
The claimed advantage of electrostatic speakers is that the entire diaphragm is driven , not just the apex , like with a standard voice coil / cone setup , so not only do you get improved frequency range , you wo n't get distortion from the diaphragm flexing .
The flip side is that bass can be kinda weak — though size helps — and high volumes can pose some issues , given that the strong charges required for high volumes increases the chance for " pyrotechnical electrical discharge " ( in other words , electrical fire ) .
Oh , and they 're not cheap .
But they can sound pretty good !
Advertisement
Plasma Speakers
Plasma speakers are n't new , but they are badass , and you can build your own .
Or you know , just pay a lot of money to get some .
The basic principle is , same as always , moving air .
Except , instead of magnets or an electric field , a small electrical arc is manipulated , producing different pitches and volume as the intensity is shifted .
Maybe not the future , but putting the word " plasma " into any tech just makes it sound future -y .
Advertisement
Distributed Mode Loudspeaker
Distributed mode loudspeaker tech was developed by NXT .
It 's different from your standard diaphragm tech because traditional speaker diaphragms have to remain rigid .
They vibrate but they do n't bend , because that causes distortion .
Distributed - mode diaphragms are supposed to bend .
Basically , bending waves are produced in the panel by electricity , and those vibrations create sound .
Advertisement
One big advantage of distributed mode loudspeakers is that they can be really thin .
You do n't need a big box .
In fact , NXT 's big pitch is that almost anything can be a diaphragm — in 2002 , somebody actually tried to market inflatable speakers based on NXT 's tech .
But like other loudspeaker alternatives , it can have trouble with bass .
A bigger panel helps it out there , however .
Warwick Audio's suspiciously tinfoil - like new flat , flexible loudspeaker technology actually sounds similar in principle to NXT's DML — a thin membrane is excited and vibrates in time to the electrical signal .
Advertisement
Planar Magnetic
Hey look , it 's another technology using a thin membrane to move air !
Planar magnetic speakers use a thin film with a voice coil printed on it ( think back to traditional speakers ) .
The coil is suspended between a pair of magnets .
As the current alternates , the membrane moves and back forth .
As with most of these thin - diaphragm setups , you need to go bigger to get a better bass response , or just go with a separate woofer for low frequencies .
Oh , and they also cost lots o' dollars .
Advertisement
Carbon Nanotubes
Carbon nanotubes , the trendiest near - future material around , can of course be used to make speakers too .
Really thin ones .
They actually work very differently , too .
Nanotube speakers make use of thermoacoustics , just like thunder .
The nanotubes are formed into a film with electrodes attached at the end .
An electrical current is sent through the film , and as it changes , the air around the tubes heats up or cools down in response , expanding and contracting respectively .
Pressure waves are created , and boom , sound .
The fidelity supposedly " matches that of conventional loudspeakers . "
The nanotubes themselves do n't move at all , meaning that technically , if the technology were harnessed , it could be used to make high - precision , super - low - distortion speakers .
Advertisement
But here 's a really brilliant idea for future speakers that 'll blow you away :
Make 'em cheaper without getting crappier .
Now there 's innovation !
Still something you still wanna know ?

Obama Urges Groups to Stop Attacks – Advocates Should Turn Attention to Promoting Legislation , President Says
In recent weeks , liberal bloggers and grass - roots groups such as MoveOn.org , Democracy for America , Service Employees International Union and Progressive Change Campaign Committee have targeted Democratic Sens. Ben Nelson ( Neb. ) , Mary Landrieu ( La. ) , Arlen Specter ( Pa. ) , Ron Wyden ( Ore. ) and Dianne Feinstein ( Calif . ) .
Health - Care Activists Targeting Democrats - Sniping Among Liberals May Jeopardize Votes Needed to Pass Bill
In recent days -- and during this week ’s congressional recess -- left - leaning bloggers and grass - roots organizations such as
MoveOn.org , Health Care for America Now and the Service Employees International Union have singled out Democratic Sens. Ben Nelson ( Neb. ) , Mary Landrieu ( La. ) , Ron Wyden ( Ore. ) , Arlen Specter ( Pa. ) and Dianne Feinstein ( Calif . ) for the criticism more often reserved for opposition party members .
A good sign of a totally bogus argument is reliance on contradictory presumptions of fact .
When one is simply wrong , one can often make a convincing argument by inventing facts .
When one is being absurd , one can fall into the temptation to invent inconsistent facts .
In this article in the Washington Post Ceci Conolly is being absurd .
She argues that progressives ( such as MoveOn ) who attack Democratic Senators who do n't support a public option are endangering health care reform .
She presents two arguments one stated in her own name in what is supposed to be a news article and one ascribed to an anonymous source whom she does not criticize .
Lieberman hailed the Democratic victory eight years ago as nearing the political promised land .
In another allusion to Moses , he said : " You might say the Red Sea finally parted , and more Americans than ever before walked through be -hind President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore . "
Even Lieberman 's new charter airplane - - owned by Spirit Airlines - - fit with the theme of the day .
" The Spirit literally moved me , " he said with a chuckle , describing today 's maiden flight .
Incredibly , none of the three examples Connolly offered to highlight Gore 's compulsion for exaggerating were based on fact .
Eleven months later , and just three weeks before Election Day , the Post returned to the topic of Love Canal , reporting how Gore 's " clumsy " statements " suggesting he discovered the Love Canal disaster " had made him an easy target for ridicule .

The most recent WaPo article is by Ceci Connolly .
And , as I discovered , she is quite a piece of work .
I 'm not excusing Obama , not one whit , but Ms. Ceci seems to have had an agenda ... From Howie 's WaPo link here : Ceci Connolly sez- article linked above July 4 : Ceci Connolly from June 28 WaPo article- here .

Rally Car Driver Falls Off Mountain And Lives
Total Pro Sports – During a race on April 3rd , 2009 rally Car driver Jari-Matti Latvala , is lucky to be alive , following a frightening crash in Portugal a couple of days ago .
Not only did this guy almost die , but now his team wants to fire him , and I thought North American sports were cut - throat .
Apparently , someone forgot to tell this guy that there are no guardrails in rally driving .
After watching the video multiple times , I ca n’t believe the actually survived .
“ This was the biggest accident of my career , ” said Latvala .
“ All was going well as we approached a right bend over a crest before a slow left corner .
I was carrying too much speed into the crest and the car lifted .
It hit a bank , went up onto two wheels and over the barrier .
I rolled maybe 150 m off the road .
As we rolled there was an incredible noise and the roll cage started to fold in around us .
It was very frightening . ” ( Race Results )
The best part is all of this happened on his birthday .
What a great present !!!

Revolutionary patch to replace conventional injections
It is the perfect invention for those with a fear of needles .
A patch that takes the pain out of injections has been developed by scientists .
The stamp - sized patch is studded with dozens of tiny needles , each a fraction of a millimetre long - the equivalent of the width of a few strands of hair .
Coated with medicine , it reaches far enough through the skin to deliver the drug but not deep enough to hit the nerves that cause pain .
Researchers say the patch could be especially useful for sufferers of age - related macular degeneration , the most common cause of blindness in the elderly .
Although new drugs can improve symptoms , they must be injected directly into the eye each month - something that would be relatively simple by using one of the patches .
Dr Mark Prausnitz , of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta in the U.S. , said : ‘ It ’s our goal to get rid of the need for hypodermic needles and replace them with a patch that can be applied by a patient .
‘ If you can move to something that ’s as easy to apply as a plaster , you ’ve opened the door for people to self - administer their medicine . ’
The first tests on people could be carried out next year , the American Chemical Society ’s annual conference heard .
Dr Prausnitz added : ‘ Although it would probably first be used in a clinical setting , our vision is to have a self - administered flu vaccine patch .
So instead of making an appointment with your doctor to get your flu shot , you can stop by the pharmacy or even get a patch in the mail and self - apply .
‘ We think that could very much increase the vaccine coverage since it would be easier for people to be vaccinated . ’
The researchers administered flu vaccines to mice using conventional injections and microneedle patches .
They found that both produced the same number of immune system antibodies .
But other measures of immune response showed a better reaction with the patches .

A key congressional critic of the FBI ’s investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks called Friday for a broader inquiry into the government ’s handling of the case , saying he remained deeply skeptical of the bureau ’s assertion that a Maryland scientist acted alone in carrying out the country ’s worst bioterrorism attack .
“ Our government -- and specifically , the FBI -- suffers from a credibility gap on this issue , ” Rep. Rush D. Holt ( D - N.J. ) told an expert panel that convened in Washington this week to begin reviewing the scientific methods the FBI used to link the attacks to Bruce E. Ivins , a microbiologist who worked in the Army ’s chief biodefense lab at Ft. Detrick , Md .
The 15 - member panel was appointed by the National Academy of Sciences , at the FBI ’s request , to provide an independent review of the high - tech genetic analysis that ultimately led investigators to Ivins .
The review is expected to last as long as 18 months .
The start of the panel ’s work coincided with the first anniversary of Ivins ’ July 28 suicide .
He had been the FBI ’s prime suspect .

Friends and colleagues of the scientist and some independent experts have criticized the bureau ’s handling of the seven - year investigation , which for years focused on another Army scientist .
The FBI later said that scientist was innocent .
Holt , whose district includes postal facilities that were used to mail some of the letters containing anthrax bacteria , said the panel ’s focus was too narrow .
“ I ’d like to be able to assure my constituents in New Jersey that there is no longer a murderer at large , and that we ’re prepared to deal with the next bioterrorist attack , ” Holt said in an interview .
Five people died and 17 others were sickened when anthrax bacteria were sent in 2001 through the mail to media companies and U.S. Senate offices .
Ontario's " zero tolerance " policy on domestic violence has come into question following an unusual court case involving an Orangeville - area woman who was charged with assault after joking in emails that she could solve her marital problems with a gun , if only she could get one .
Alison Shaw , 40 , was forced out of her home and ordered to stay away from her three children after her estranged husband claimed to have been " frightened " by the online missive , which followed what a judge described as a " one- punch bar fight " over a month earlier in an area Legion hall .
The ruling is unusual on two fronts :
It 's a twist on what men's rights groups claim divorcing fathers have been suffering for years at the hands of police and the criminal court system .
And it 's creating buzz in legal circles because a well - respected family law expert who helped draft Ontario 's so - called " duty to report " policy 30 years ago now says it needs a review and better use of discretion .
" This is a gross overreaction by the Crown and by the police in response to what they thought is the zero - tolerance rule , " says Philip Epstein , a veteran divorce lawyer who sat on the committee that crafted the 1979 directive .
" We know so much more about domestic abuse now than we did back then .
It 's time to re-examine the policy and create some limited discretion for the police and Crown attorneys to deal with this problem , " he said .
Criticism of Shaw 's treatment first arose more than a year ago in a family law decision from Ontario Court Justice Bruce Pugsley , who said it's " commonplace " for the criminal justice system to be manipulated by estranged spouses claiming abuse , " no matter how remote the assault may be in time or , indeed , how trivial the contact . "
Epstein has highlighted the decision – and his concerns – in the recently released Reports of Family Law , a critique of interesting or unusual family law judgments .
He and other lawyers have praised Pugsley as being the first judge to so clearly tackle the thorny issue of how some warring couples use the criminal courts to get custody of their children and gain the upper hand in divorce cases .
The way such allegations are handled by police and Crown attorneys can have " the disruptive force of a hand grenade " for families , Pugsley said , setting in motion a chain of events that can wreak " havoc " on children .
Shaw 's treatment was fairly typical :
She had no criminal record , was charged and held in jail overnight until she could post $ 5,000 bail , and ordered to stay away from her home and kids " without any regard for children 's best interests , " the judge said .
Her bail conditions also restricted her from using the Internet .
" This is not for one moment to diminish the impact of spousal abuse on family members and children in Canada , " said Pugsley , a point Epstein also stresses .
But " the events after the arrest of Ms. Shaw do not , in retrospect , show the police , the Crown , counsel or the criminal judicial system in a good light . "
Shaw and her husband , Stephen , were estranged , but still living in the same house , when he hacked into her computer in late 2007 looking for evidence of an affair .
Instead , he found what Pugsley described as " vile language " and " gossipy joking " in an email to a girlfriend that talked about " solving her matrimonial problems with a gun , if she could only get one . "
The husband reported them to police , as well as an incident over a month earlier in a bar in which she is alleged to have punched him .
He returned to ask police to lay a charge of assault after meeting with a lawyer .
" I can only hope that no licensed lawyer in this province would have advised the father that the fastest way to get custody and exclusive possession of the family home was to report the mother 's transgressions to the police , " Pugsley said in his ruling .
While Epstein says false or trumped - up allegations are rare , and domestic abuse remains a " very , very serious and real issue , " they can unfairly cripple an accused legally and financially because Ontario 's court system is so slow and overburdened .
He added the legal aid system is so cash - strapped , it can take eight months to a year for a criminal case to be decided .
During much of that time , the parent has no access to their children .
( Pugsley moved quickly to give Shaw 50 /50 access to her kids on alternating weeks . )

Epstein had one case where a wife alleged abuse and then started clearing valuables out of the house while her husband awaited a bail hearing .
Some men have started fighting back , says one lawyer whose female client is being threatened with a $ 250,000 wrongful prosecution suit by her ex-husband .
Domestic violence experts such as University of Western Ontario professor Peter Jaffe says the research is clear on what constitutes domestic abuse , but more training of police and Crown attorneys is needed .
In fact , they point to what they consider a far more worrisome trend : Police who are simply throwing up their hands , charging both partners , and leaving it up to judges to sort it all out .
" The number - one problem in 2009 is n't minor allegations that are blown out of proportion or the potential for false allegations .
The number - one problem in Ontario in 2009 is that there are still 30 to 35 domestic homicides a year and that so many people are being abused and not seeking help , " says Jaffe .
The Quest
It usually begins with Carl Mäsak - this time was no exception .
First he sent us on big adventure , and then me on a particular quest by asking innocently if there were any vistor statics for the site http://perl6-projects.org.
Being curious myself I copied the access.log , started a log analyzer and voilá , we had a HTML page with some statistics .
But a tiny nagging voice in my head asked Ca n't you do that with Perl 6 ?.
Well , sure I can , with a bit of effort .
So I decided to spend some time of my weekend ( namely a travel by train and the time when my girlfriend took a nap ) on this , and wrote a web log analyzer that produced a bar chart of the daily number of visitors .
Here it goes :
If you use a browser that supports SVG , you can view the svg version directly ..
That was the short story .
If you are more of a geek , you might be more interested in some of technical details .
The Gory Details - SVG
The choice of SVG as output format was pretty obvious :
It 's text based , a vector format , and masak had already written a SVG module for Perl 6 .
Despite its name , it 's actually a module that generally transforms data structures of a particular form to XML - the only things specific to SVG in there are the name and the documentation .
Since it does n't know about SVG , I as the programmer had to learn some SVG .
So I downloaded the specs , and went offline .
Coordinate transformations
Skimming through the specs revealed something interesting : you can apply coordinate transformations to SVG primitives or groups .
Also the drawing area stretches from negative to positive infinity in both x and y direction .
In combination that means that the plotting module can start drawing without looking at the whole input data .
It just has to keep track of how much space it has written to , and then in the end it can apply a scaling to fit the canvas ( ie the visible drawing area ) .
There 's just one problem with this approach :
The text is scaled with the same aspect ratio as the chart , leading to distorted text .
Of course one could apply the reverse transformation to the text , but to avoid overlapping label text one has to know the size of the text anyway , so there 's nothing gained by letting the SVG renderer do coordinate transformation .
So I ended up doing the scaling in my program code after all .
Text in SVG
There 's one open problem so far : since the plotting program just emits SVG ( or more accurately , a data structure which SVG. pm turns into SVG ) and does n't know about its rendering , it can't know how much space the text will take up , making it impossible to calculate the spaces appropriately .
Inkscape and gqview render the text quite differently , I 'm sure other user agents will have their own interpretation of text sizes and scaling .
The specs talks about precomputed text width according to which text might be scaled ; I 'll have to see if I can make use of that feature to solve this problem .
SVG != SVG
Speaking of different user agents : Firefox and gqview only show drawing on the canvas , silently ( as per SVG spec ) dropping elements outside the canvas .
It was incredible helpful to have inkscape , which shows the border of the canvas , but also objects outside of it .
When I got a coordinate transform wrong , that was a good way to debug it .
Mandatory Options
I made one observation not tied to SVG , but to plotting in general : without having planned for it , I ended up with having about ten configuration variables / attributes , more to come when I include captions , axis labels and so on .
It just falls naturally out of process of writing the code , and thinking twice each time I used a numeric constant in code .
Perl 6 makes them very nice , the begin of the code looks like this :
class SVG :: Plot { has $ .
height = 200 ; has $ . width = 300 ; has $ . fill - width = 0.80 ; has $ .
label - font - size = 14 ; has $ .
plot - width = $ . width * 0.80 ; has $ .
plot - height = $ . height * 0.65 ; has & .
y- tick - step = -> $ max_y { 10 ** floor ( log10 ( $ max_y ) ) / 5 } has $ .
max -x-labels = $ . plot - width / ( 1.5 * $ . label - font - size ) ; has $ .
label - spacing = ( $ . height - $ . plot - height ) / 20 ; ... }
Basically I declare attributes with default values , which can be overridden by passing a named argument to the new constructor - and the subsequent declarations which depend on them simply pick up the user supplied value if present , or the default otherwise .
It seems easier to come up with a myriad of configuration options than choosing sane defaults .
The Result
... can be found on http://github.com/moritz/svg-plot/.
The log parser is included in the examples / directory .
It is far from complete , the interface is not yet stable etc , but it 's still a nice piece of software , IMHO .
The Future
I want to pursue development in a few directions : more meta data ( axis labels , captions , annotations , maybe clickable data points ) , other chart types ( lines and points ) , documentation , and maybe more styling options .
I do n't know yet how to write unit tests for it , and test driven development only works if you know in advance what to expect .
I do n't know if I 'll find the time to turn this into a full - blown charting module , but so far the work on it has been very rewarding , and I liked it .

Among those detained was one of the country 's most wanted fugitives , Franco Letizia , 31 , who had been on the run for more than a year .
It would be an exaggeration to say that Frank McCourt is the reason I 'm a writer , but to the extent that I 'm not a terrible writer , he deserves a lot of the credit .
McCourt was my high school English teacher .
I took several classes with him  anybody who took one always pulled whatever strings they could to get more .
It was from him that I learned to listen for " the poetry of everyday language . "
He despised ornament in writing , vastly preferring elegance .
If he heard a word in an essay that would n't have come out of your mouth , he 'd ask who was supposed to be speaking .
And while I can't fully agree with him that no writer should ever use the word " trudge " for that reason , I know that I 've never used it .
He squeezed out my teenage tendency toward melodrama and clich�d romanticism and drew out gimlet - eyed honesty .
He would not like that I just said " gimlet - eyed . "
As you can imagine , McCourt 's teaching method was largely storytelling .
And singing .
I will never hear Wild Mountain
Thyme without thinking of him .
He retired the same year I graduated , and by then he knew he was an inspiring figure .
He used to say that when we went on to use his advice to write a book , he 'd want 10 percent .
Of course , by the time my first book came out , I could have given him 90 percent and it would n't have begun to approach 10 percent of what his made .
Never has anyone deserved success more completely .
Over the years I 'd run into McCourt periodically and he was always warm and friendly .
I last saw him a few months ago at an event he did in Woodstock and when I gave him a copy of Rapture Ready !
he held it up for the crowd and beamed , " Former student ! "
It was perhaps the most rewarding response I 've had .
Beyond the practical lessons I learned in Frank McCourt 's class , I 'll always remember him as a model for how to be cynical without being jaded and sarcastic without being inhumane .
I 'm pretty sure he did not believe in God or an afterlife , but he had to believe that there is an immortality in living so that your words and actions transform the world around you in ways that will continue to reverberate forever .
No one with so much life in him can ever truly die .
And if there were an afterlife , I can guarantee you that somewhere right now , Frank McCourt would be mightily pissed off that he's not around for what 's sure to be a hell of a wake .

Advances in agricultural technology — including , but not limited to , the genetic modification of food crops — have made fields more productive than ever .
Farmers grow more crops and feed more people using less land .
They are able to use fewer pesticides and to reduce the amount of tilling that leads to erosion .
And within the next two years , agritech com­panies plan to introduce advanced crops that are designed to survive heat waves and droughts , resilient characteristics that will become increasingly important in a world marked by a changing climate .
Unfortunately , it is impossible to verify that genetically modified crops perform as advertised .
That is because agritech companies have given themselves veto power over the work of independent researchers .
To purchase genetically modified seeds , a customer must sign an agreement that limits what can be done with them .
( If you have installed software recently , you will recognize the concept of the end - user agreement . )
Agreements are considered necessary to protect a company ’s intellectual property , and they justifiably preclude the replication of the genetic enhancements that make the seeds unique .
But agritech companies such as Monsanto , Pioneer and Syngenta go further .
For a decade their user agreements have explicitly forbidden the use of the seeds for any independent research .
Under the threat of litigation , scientists cannot test a seed to explore the different conditions under which it thrives or fails .
They cannot compare seeds from one company against those from another company .
And perhaps most important , they cannot examine whether the genetically modified crops lead to unintended environmental side effects .
Research on genetically modified seeds is still published , of course .
But only studies that the seed companies have approved ever see the light of a peer - reviewed journal .
In a number of cases , experiments that had the implicit go - ahead from the seed company were later blocked from publication because the results were not flattering .
“ It is important to understand that it is not always simply a matter of blanket denial of all research requests , which is bad enough , ” wrote Elson J. Shields , an entomologist at Cornell University , in a letter to an official at the Environmental Protection Agency ( the body tasked with regulating the environmental consequences of genetically modified crops ) , “ but selective denials and permissions based on industry perceptions of how ‘ friendly ’ or ‘ hostile ’ a particular scientist may be toward [ seed - enhancement ] technology . ”
Shields is the spokesperson for a group of 24 corn insect scientists that opposes these practices .
Because the scientists rely on the cooperation of the companies for their research — they must , after all , gain access to the seeds for studies — most have chosen to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals .
The group has submitted a statement to the EPA protesting that “ as a result of restricted access , no truly independent research can be legally conducted on many critical questions regarding the tech­nol­ogy . ”
It would be chilling enough if any other type of company were able to prevent independent researchers from testing its wares and reporting what they find — imagine car companies trying to quash head - to - head model comparisons done by Consumer Reports , for example .
But when scientists are prevented from examining the raw ingredients in our nation ’s food supply or from testing the plant material that covers a large portion of the country ’s agricultural land , the restrictions on free inquiry become dangerous .
Although we appreciate the need to protect the intellectual property rights that have spurred the investments into research and development that have led to agritech ’s successes , we also believe food safety and environmental protection depend on making plant products available to regular scientific scrutiny .
Agricultural technology companies should therefore immediately remove the restriction on research from their end - user agreements .
Going forward , the EPA should also require , as a condition of approving the sale of new seeds , that independent researchers have unfettered access to all products currently on the market .
The agricultural revolution is too important to keep locked behind closed doors .

* Major economies consider setting " aspirational " goal
* Halve emissions by 2050 , 80 pct cut for rich nations
OSLO , June 25 ( Reuters ) - Major economies including the United States and China are considering setting a goal of halving world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 when they hold a summit in Italy next month , a draft document showed .
The draft conclusions for the Major Economies Forum , a group launched by President Barack Obama to contribute to a new U.N. climate treaty , were tabled by the United States and Mexico at talks in Mexico this week , without reaching agreement .
" We support an aspirational global goal of reducing global emissions by 50 percent by 2050 , with developed countries reducing emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 , " according to the draft text , obtained by Reuters .
The two - page text also said that developed countries , including the United States , the European Union and Japan , would take " robust aggregate and individual mid-term reductions in the 2020 timeframe . "
And it said that developing nations would have to take actions by 2020 that meant a " significant deviation from business as usual " to slow a rise in their emissions , mainly from burning fossil fuels , while working to end poverty .
Last year rich nations in the Group of Eight agreed a " vision " of halving world greenhouse gases by 2050 .
That goal was not adopted by developing countries , which have argued that the rich have to take the lead .
Leaders of the 17 - nation Major Economies Forum will meet on July 9 in Italy on the sidelines of a G8 summit to try to find ways to slow warming which may bring more floods , droughts and rising sea levels .
The major economies account for 80 percent of all emissions and an agreement among them would go a long way to settling a U.N. climate treaty due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December .
" The peaking of global and national emissions should take place as soon as possible , recognising that the timeframe for peaking will be longer in developing countries , " it said .

For a few weeks only , visitors to Westminster Abbey can gaze on the second - last resting place of Oliver Cromwell , the grave which the Lord Protector occupied for less than three years before being dug up , ritually executed , decapitated , and buried again in quicklime at the foot of the gallows .
The stone slabs engraved in the 19th century with the name of Cromwell and his relatives are usually covered by a blue carpet bearing the RAF crest .
Recently moths were discovered in the building 's historic textiles .
So the carpet has been lifted and sent off to be deep frozen to kill any grubs , leaving the chapel 's extraordinary history exposed until the end of August .
" Few people come here following the trail of Oliver Cromwell , but this opportunity adds one more layer to the extraordinary richness of the history of this building , " a spokeswoman said .
By the time he died of malarial fever in September 1658 aged 59 , Cromwell ruled in such grandeur that many speculated he would soon be crowned king .
Instead he was buried in the abbey in a tremendous ceremony modelled on the funeral of James I , in the same vault as his son - in - law Henry Ireton , one of those who signed the death warrant of Charles I , and John Bradshaw , president of the High Court at the trial .
The stone slab records simply " these [ remains ] were removed in 1661 " .
In fact the three bodies were not only exhumed by order of Charles II within months of his restoration ; they were hung , mutilated , and reburied at Tyburn like common criminals .
However , the unresolved mystery of Cromwell 's bones did not end there .
According to one account , a daughter begged the body from the executioner , and had it secretly buried .
Another version says the embalmed head was stuck on a spike outside Westminster Hall where the king was tried .
A quarter century later it is said to have blown down in a violent storm , to be stolen by a sentry who only admitted this on his deathbed .
Arthur MacGregor , archaeologist and recently retired curator of the Ashmolean museum in Oxford , has tried to disentangle the competing claims .
In the 18th century a skull claimed as Cromwell 's was displayed for money in London .
Another was once in his museum ‑ which also has Cromwell 's death mask ‑ but has vanished .
Yet another , which he thinks was probably fake because the fractures suggest a spike smashed through from above rather than from inside an impaled skull , surfaced in the 1990s in a family collection in Kent .
The one with the best claim was examined at a meeting at the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1911 , when it was said still to have part of a spike embedded in the bone .
That skull was buried in 1960 in the courtyard of Cromwell 's old college , Sidney Sussex at Cambridge , in an unmarked spot to dissuade ghoulish souvenir hunters .
By splendid irony , the unexpectedly available space in the vault at Westminster Abbey was soon filled ‑ with the bodies of a troop of illegitimate offspring of Charles II and their families , including the Earl of Doncaster , son of the king and his mistress Lucy Walter , and Charles Fitzroy , Duke of Cleveland and Southampton , his son by Barbara Villiers , the woman described by Bishop Burnet as " a woman of pleasure ... vastly expensive and consequently very covetous " .

http://www.FreeGaza.org[23 miles off the coast of Gaza , 15:30 pm ] - Today Israeli Occupation Forces attacked and boarded the Free Gaza Movement boat , the SPIRIT OF HUMANITY , abducting 21 human rights workers from 11 countries , including Noble laureate Mairead Maguire and former U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney ( see below for a complete list of passengers ) .
The passengers and crew are being forcibly dragged toward Israel .
" This is an outrageous violation of international law against us .
Our boat was not in Israeli waters , and we were on a human rights mission to the Gaza Strip , " said Cynthia McKinney , a former U.S. Congresswoman and presidential candidate .
" President Obama just told Israel to let in humanitarian and reconstruction supplies , and that 's exactly what we tried to do .
We 're asking the international community to demand our release so we can resume our journey .
" According to an International Committee of the Red Cross report released yesterday , the Palestinians living in Gaza are " trapped in despair . "
Thousands of Gazans whose homes were destroyed earlier during Israel 's December / January massacre are still without shelter despite pledges of almost $ 4.5 billion in aid , because Israel refuses to allow cement and other building material into the Gaza Strip .
The report also notes that hospitals are struggling to meet the needs of their patients due to Israel 's disruption of medical supplies .
" The aid we were carrying is a symbol of hope for the people of Gaza , hope that the sea route would open for them , and they would be able to transport their own materials to begin to reconstruct the schools , hospitals and thousands of homes destroyed during the onslaught of " Cast Lead " .
Our mission is a gesture to the people of Gaza that we stand by them and that they are not alone " said fellow passenger Mairead Maguire , winner of a Noble Peace Prize for her work in Northern Ireland .
Just before being kidnapped by Israel , Huwaida Arraf , Free Gaza Movement chairperson and delegation co-coordinator on this voyage , stated that : " No one could possibly believe that our small boat constitutes any sort of threat to Israel .
We carry medical and reconstruction supplies , and children 's toys .
Our passengers include a Nobel peace prize laureate and a former U.S. congressperson .
Our boat was searched and received a security clearance by Cypriot Port Authorities before we departed , and at no time did we ever approach Israeli waters .
" Arraf continued , " Israel 's deliberate and premeditated attack on our unarmed boat is a clear violation of international law and we demand our immediate and unconditional release . "

Nokia could follow service providers into netbook territory , by offering a machine of its own .
President and chief executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo is reported to have said in India : " We at Nokia is [ sic ] actively looking at this converged market ...
We are looking at the netbook market to see what kind of opportunity is there . "
If Nokia does deliver a device then it would join a trickle of other handset manufacturers also becoming netbook makers .
So far , it 's been OEMs like Asus and Dell , solidly versed in the build and delivery of PCs , who 've made most of the running , building and selling netbooks .
A Nokia netbook would also mean the company enters a market that 's being tested by the very service providers that typically sell its handsets .
AT&T and Verizon in the US and Orange and O2 in the UK have begun offering netbooks with data plans .
These netbooks are from PC markers and consumer electronics companies like Samsung that make PCs and mobile phones .
Questions remain over what a Nokia netbook would literally look like - whether it would fit the template of a small form - factor notebook , or would Nokia opt for a tablet or a smart - phone inspired design with a large screen and soft keys .
Also , there 'll be the question of operating system .
Would a Nokia netbook run the giant 's Symbian open - source operating system or would Nokia go with Windows or Linux ?
It seems reasonable to assume Nokia would stick with Symbian , but try to make its netbook useful by running Microsoft applications .
Nokia earlier this month announced a deal with Microsoft to put Office on its phones using native Symbian versions of Microsoft Office and also to extend web services such as SharePoint to devices .
Office is due next year .
Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin has encouraged the PC markets in the past to become more like Nokia by selling customized and subsidized machines in this high - growth market .
Zemlin has , naturally , championed the cause that netbooks should run Linux .
" Learn from Nokia - meld a kick ass , industrial design with customized software experience and have it subsidized by an alternative business model , be that subsidy or services offering , movies and entertainment - that 's a better way to skin this cat , " Zemlin told The Reg in March . ®

The density of population has an impact on a broad range of social and economic issues , such as land prices and housing costs .
For example , relatively densely populated countries such as Japan have higher land prices than less densely populated countries such as Australia , and even in that country , land prices have doubled and redoubled as the population has increased .
It is sometimes argued that reducing the populations of some areas , such as large cities , would have positive benefits for these reasons .
The worlds human population currently numbers about 6.1 billion people , and the figure grows by nearly 90 million people each year , or around 240,000 each day .
This annual addition to population is greater than ever before in history prior to the 1980s .
It stems in large part from the unprecedented size of current population .
The growth rate itself has actually declined since 1970 , from about 2 percent to about 1.5 percent today .
However , because this rate is applied to a much larger population than in 1970  when world population stood at 3.7 billion people the added yearly increments are larger .
If the population growth rate is not reduced further , world population will double by the year 2040 .
This growing global population affects the welfare of communities and ecosystems around the world .
In our lifetimes , humanity has become a force on the planet that rivals nature .
The reasons for this are complex and linked to changes not only in human population but in technology , consumption patterns , unequal distribution of wealth and the choices made by people , businesses and governments .
Research on these issues is far from complete .
At some point , however , the cumulative weight of the evidence argues for prudent efforts that will contribute to a stable world population within at least the lifetimes or our children .
The need is not to control population growth .
Governments cannot control childbearing and attempts to do so have sometimes led to coercive approaches to reproduction that violate human rights .
The need is rather to expand the power individuals have over their own lives , especially by enabling them to choose how many children to have and when to have them .
Population is a complex issue , closely tied to a wide range of other issues such as :
Clearly the environmental challenges facing humanity in the 21st century and beyond would be less difficult in a world with slower population growth or none at all .
Population is a critical variable influencing the availability of each of the natural resources considered here .
And access to family planning services is a critical variable influencing population .
Use of family planning contributes powerfully to lower fertility , later childbearing , and slower population growth .
Yet policymakers , environmentalists and the general public remain largely unaware of the growing interest of young people throughout the world in delaying pregnancies and planning their families .
In greater proportions than ever , girls want to go to school and to college , and women want to find fulfilling and well - paid employment .
Helping people in every country to obtain the information and services they need to put these ambitions into effect is all that can be done , and all that needs to be done , to end world population growth in the new century .
Comprehensive population policies are an essential element in a world development strategy that combines access to reproductive health services , to education and economic opportunities , to improved energy and natural resource technologies , and to healthyer models of consumption and the " good life . "
Together these can bring humanity into enduring balance with the environment and the natural resources upon which we will always depend .
Today more than 1.1 billion people live in the areas richest in species diversity and the most threatened by human activities .
While these areas comprise about 12 percent of the planet 's land surface , they hold nearly 20 percent of its human population .
The population in these biodiversity hotspots is growing at a collective rate of 1.8 percent annually , compared to the world 's population 's annual growth rate of 1.3 percent .
The planet 's major renewable natural resources  its fresh water , fisheries and forests  are already strained .
Our atmosphere has been dramatically altered .
Based on these trends , it is clear that the 21st century will witness even greater pressures on natural resources .
Current demographic trends offer hope , however .
Over the past 40 years the average number of children born to each woman has fallen from five to less than three .
Young people increasingly want to wait to have children and to have smaller families .
Policymakers have a choice .
They can do nothing , or they can help ensure that in the 21st century the world 's population peaks with fewer than 8 billion people , simply by committing the financial resources to meet the needs of couples who want to have smaller families and delay childbearing .
Population control is the practice of curtailing population increase , usually by reducing the birth rate .
The practice has sometimes been voluntary , as a response to poverty , or out of religious ideology , but in some times and places it has been government - mandated .
This is generally done to try to prevent a believed threat of Malthusian catastrophe , or overpopulation in general .
Given the nature of human reproductive biology , controlling the birth rate generally implies one of the following practices :
An important example of mandated population control is China 's one child policy , in which having more than one child is made extremely unattractive .
This has led to allegations that practices like infanticide , forced abortions and forced sterilization are used as a result of the policy .
The policies that contribute to the slowing of population growth are tested and cost - effective .
Improving access to a range of high - quality contraceptive services remains a central strategy for closing the gap between reproductive intentions and outcomes .
Lack of such access is a primary reason that today nearly two out of every five pregnancies are unintended , and that more than 150 million women do not want to become pregnant but are not using any form of contraception .
Similarly , making sure that all girls and boys everywhere complete secondary school not only improves human development and health outcomes , but also discourages early and frequent pregnancy and thus contributes powerfully to slower population growth .
The same is true of improving opportunities for women to find paying jobs or start their own businesses .
International agreements provide benchmarks for performance in these areas .
In particular , governments should support and fund the social investments called for by the Programme of Action of the ICPD , which both focus on womens well - being and promise to contribute to slower population growth and the conservation of critical natural resources .
When projecting future changes in environmental conditions , environmental and policy analysts should take into account scenarios suggested by the full range of population projections published by the United Nations Population Division and others , rather than merely those based on middle projections .
Both governments and non-governmental organizations should consider integrated , global community - based approaches that improve both natural - resource conservation and access to reproductive health services .
Family planning and reproductive health services can affect the lives of women , men , and children .
There are vast disparities in sexual and reproductive health and risks between rich and poor countries of the world .
The past century witnessed dramatic improvements in what we now call reproductive health ,  especially in the more developed countries .
There , near - universal access to high quality care in pregnancy and childbirth , to life - saving drugs and safe surgical procedures including safe abortion coupled with high levels of contraceptive use and low fertility , all contribute to good reproductive health overall .
The situation is quite different in the developing world .
In the year 2000 , fully 98 percent of the 3.43 million adult deaths from causes related to poor reproductive health occurred in the developing world .
In developed countries , a woman has only a 1 in 2,125 risk of dying in pregnancy or childbirth over the course of her lifetime .
That risk is 33 times higher , at 1 in 65 , for women in developing countries .
Sexual activity and childbearing early in life carry significant risks for young people all around the world .
Teen mothers face twice the risk of dying from childbirth than do women in their twenties , and their children are more vulnerable to health risks as well .
Every year , almost half of all new HIV infections and at least one - third of all new sexually transmitted infections occur to people younger than 25 .
Every year nearly 80 million unintended pregnancies occur worldwide .
More than half of these pregnancies end in abortion .
An estimated 150 million women in developing countries say they would prefer to plan their families but are not using contraception , and another 350 million women lack access to effective family planning methods .
Reproductive health services can help .
Voluntary family planning and other reproductive health services can help couples avert high - risk pregnancies , prevent unwanted childbearing and abortion , and avoid diseases such as HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections , that can lead to death , disability , and infertility .
Worldwide , more than one - fifth of all pregnancies nearly 46 million are terminated each year .
An estimated 36 million procedures take place in the developing world and 10 million in the developed world .
Twenty million of these abortions are carried out under illegal and often
unsafe conditions .
Women who want to terminate a pregnancy tend to ignore the legal status of abortion .
Many women are willing to risk unsafe abortions .
In the poorest countries , women face a much higher risk of death from unsafe abortion .
In Africa , one in every 150
abortions leads to death compared to one in every 85,000 procedures in the developed world .
Restrictive abortion policies mainly affect the poor who rely on the public sector for all their
health needs ; women who have the means can usually obtain abortions from the private sector .
Iron -deficiency anemia is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in the world today .
It is especially common in women of reproductive age and particularly during pregnancy .
The prevalence of anemia varies greatly among and within countries and is often related to poverty .
By some estimates , levels among pregnant women reach 70 percent in South Asia .
In sub -Saharan Africa outside of South Africa , levels exceed 40 percent .
Yet anemia can easily be treated with oral iron supplements .
Approximately one - quarter of pregnant women develop complications .
More than one pregnancy in 350 is fatal .
Adequate care during pregnancy and especially at labor and delivery are the most cost - effective interventions for improving maternal and newborn health , according to the World Bank .
Yet in the developing world some 45 million women do not receive prenatal care and 60 million births take place in the absence of skilled attendants .
AIDS is one of the leading killers of our time .
In 2000 , 4.7 million adults around the world became infected with the human immuno - deficiency virus ( HIV ) and another 2.5 million died of AIDS .
Over 95 percent of these deaths and new infections occurred in the developing world .
Sub -Saharan Africa is the epicenter of the pandemic , with more than 70 percent of all new infections and 80 percent of deaths in 2000 .
AIDS kills people at the height of their reproductive and productive years .
Dying young often leaves women enough time to bear children , but not enough to raise them .
Where the epidemic is well advanced , it adversely affects the well - being of families and precarious economies .
Where HIV infection rates are the highest in the world , condom use is lowest .
With growing numbers of infections among women due to the increase in heterosexual transmission of HIV , the need for female - controlled methods has taken on greater urgency .
Every pregnancy entails risk , especially where health care is poor .
Each year , more than 500,000 women worldwide die from pregnancy or childbirth - related causes , almost all of them in the developing world .
Most maternal deaths could be prevented with inexpensive measures .
The World Bank and World
Health Organization estimate it would cost just US $ 3.00 per capita per year to provide standard mother and baby care for women in low - income countries .
Reproductive Health
Over the past three decades , the world has made substantial progress towards improving reproductive health and slowing population growth , but many challenges remain :
Maternal and child deaths in developing countries are unacceptably high .
Every minute of every day , a woman dies in pregnancy or childbirth and some 20 children die of largely preventable causes .
And many more women are left ill or disabled by complications in pregnancy and delivery .
A mother 's health affects the health of her children .
Women who are in poor health or poorly nourished are more likely to give birth to unhealthy babies , and often cannot provide adequate care , diminishing the chances their children will survive and thrive .
The reduction in women 's productivity also places an economic burden on their families , communities and societies .
The death of a mother is devastating for her family .
Studies in Bangladesh show that when a mother dies after giving birth her newborn baby has much lower chances of surviving until its first birthday .
Children who survive a mother 's death are less likely to receive adequate nourishment and health care .
Older girls in families where the mother has died often drop out of school to care for younger siblings and do household chores .
Gender inequities , sexual coercion , and violence by intimate partners undermine women 's sexual and reproductive autonomy and jeopardize their health and well - being .
Women who lack sexual autonomy often are powerless to refuse unwanted sex or to use conception and thus are at greater risk of unwanted pregnancies , STI 's , and HIV .
The reproductive health field is attempting respond to the need to address the conditions of people 's sexual lives by sensitizing and training health workers , developing referral , and developing negotiating skills in both women and men .
At the community level , efforts to bring about more equitable gender relations are ever more common .
Pregnancies to very young mothers also carry increased risk for both mother and baby .
Children born to mothers under age 18 have a greater chance of dying before age five , compared with births to mothers aged 20 to 34 .
Teenage girls who are not physically mature are at greater risk of obstructed labor and complications during delivery .
They are less likely to obtain prenatal care and to have the means to safeguard the health of their infants .
Adolescent girls are also more likely to undergo unsafe abortions than older women .
Even where abortion is legal , access may be difficult for unmarried girls .
In many countries the number of abortions to adolescents is growing and unsafe abortion is a leading cause of death among teenage girls .
AIDS kills people at the height of their reproductive and productive years , with devastating consequences for families , communities , and national economies .
In sub -Saharan Africa , where HIV infection rates are the highest in the world , condom use is lowest , at 1 percent among married couples .
With growing numbers of infections among women due to the increase in heterosexual transmission of HIV , women account for 55 percent of all infected people in sub-Saharan Africa .
Comprehensive reproductive health services , especially care in pregnancy and childbirth and for sexually transmitted infections , are key to preventing disability and death and improving women 's health .
Better access to emergency care during childbirth and safe abortion services would also contribute significantly to lower maternal death rates .
Family planning diminishes risks associated with frequent childbearing and helps reduce reliance on abortion .
In the face of the AIDS pandemic and the spread of other STIs , efforts to educate the public and promote condom use are critical .
The threat of HIV / AIDS has also heightened the need for programs that help women and men-and especially young people - strengthen their communications and negotiating skills .
An important obstacle to couple negotiation of contraceptive use and protection from STDs including HIV is that most women have unequal access to resources and decision - making .
Yet women are more vulnerable to the consequences of unplanned pregnancies and often HIV / STI 's .
For these reasons , countering the prevailing gender stereotypes that increase risky behaviors and decrease couple communication is a key strategy for promoting good reproductive health .
Ultimately , good sexual and reproductive health benefits everyone .
Its consequences extend from the family to the entire planet .
Financing Population Programs : The Role of Donor Countries
Many developing countries lack the funds to provide universal access to good quality reproductive health care .
Most women and couples , therefore , rely for their reproductive health services on government programs funded through international population assistance .
Declining and irregular contributions form donor nations to the United Nations Population Fund , however , threaten continuation of these crucial services .
Concurrently , the last few decades have seen an enormous increase in the use of such services and rising demand could easily drain the dwindling resources the world provides .
Increased financial support from donor countries remains essential to improving reproductive health and slowing population growth .
Global Disparities in Reproductive Health
The risks associated with sexual activity and childbearing vary tremendously from country to country , reflecting differences in public health policies , income levels , and social and cultural practices affecting sexual relationships and access to healthcare .
In developed countries , one woman in 2,100 dies during pregnancy or childbirth over the course of her lifetime .
The situation is quite different in the developing world where a woman 's risk of death from maternal causes is 1 in 60 , fully 35 times that of her developed country counterpart .
More than a quarter of pregnant women in developing countries still receive no prenatal care and nearly half give birth with no help from skilled health personnel .
Status of Women
Improving the social and economic status of women , which greatly affect and are affected by poor reproductive health , is a vital concern .
Increasing a woman 's educational level and control over financial resources can improve her status within the household , thereby increasing not only her role in decision - making , knowledge about health and services available to her , and access to food and other resources that contribute to good health .
Ultimately , good sexual and reproductive health benefits everyone and its consequences extend from the family to the entire planet .
The vast disparities in reproductive health worldwide and the greater vulnerability of the poor to reproductive risk point to several steps all governments can take , with the support of other sectors , to improve the health of women and their families :
Give women more life choices .
The low social and economic status of women and girls sets the stage for poor reproductive health
Invest in reproductive health care
Encourage delays in the onset of sexual activity and first births
Help couples prevent and manage unwanted childbearing
Ensure universal access to maternal health care
Support new reproductive health technologies
Increase efforts to address the HIV pandemic
Involve communities in evaluating and implementing programs
Develop partnerships with the private sector , policymakers and aid donors to broaden support for reproductive health
Measure Progress
More and more young people on every continent want to start bearing children later in life and to have smaller families than at any time in history .
Likewise , in greater proportions than ever , women and girls in particular want to go to school and to college , and they want to find fulfilling and well - paid employment .
Helping people in every country obtain the information and services they need to put these ambitions into effect is all that can be done , and all that needs to be done , to bring world population growth to a stable landing in the new century .
Recent studies conclude that the underlying causes of biodiversity loss include population growth , migration to ecologically sensitive areas , poverty and inequity , policies that promote unsustainable resource consumption , and a lack of environmental awareness .
Growth in demand for food and housing , each rooted in population growth , has contributed greatly to the loss of biodiversity .
Both conversion of species - rich forests and wetlands to cropland and the increasing intensity of fertilizer and pesticide use are major factors in the extinction of species , and they are direct responses to increases in food demand .
More than 1.1 billion people now live in the world 's 25 biodiversity - rich hotspots .
The hotspots are home to around 20 percent of the world 's population , although the original boundaries of these regions enclose only about 12 percent of the planet 's land surface .
The forest - to - people ratio - a simple division of a country 's forest cover by its population - helps quantify the number of people living with low levels of forest resources both now and in the future .
Many are vulnerable to scarcities of key forest products such as timber and paper and risk the collapse of vital forest services such as control of erosion and flooding in populated areas .
In some countries the forest - to - people ratio declines even though forests expand , simply because their populations grow more rapidly than their forests .
The well - being of the world 's natural resources is closely linked to the health and well - being of women .
Investing in education for girls helps them to contribute to their national economies - and to postpone childbearing until they are ready for a family .
Providing credit and other economic opportunities for women creates alternatives to early and frequent childbearing .
Finally , better access to quality reproductive health services directly benefits women and their families .
These approaches increase human capacity , providing the greatest long - term return to societies , individuals and the environment .
Moreover , they are likely to lead to an early peak in world population in the coming century - quite possibly at levels that can co-exist with forests that teem with human and non-human life for centuries to come .
Clearly the environmental challenges humanity faces in the 21st century and beyond would be less difficult in a world with slower population growth or none at all .
Population is a critical variable influencing the availability of each of the natural resources considered here .
Access to family planning contributes powerfully to lower fertility , later childbearing , and slower population growth .

In greater proportions than ever , girls want to go to school and to college , and women want to find fulfilling and well - paid employment .
Helping people in every country to obtain the information and services they need to put these ambitions into effect is a critical step towards ending world population growth in this century .
Comprehensive population policies are an essential element in a world development strategy that combines access to reproductive health services , to education and economic opportunity , to improved energy and natural resource technologies , and to saner models of consumption and the " good life . "
Together these can bring humanity into enduring balance with the environment and the natural resources upon which we will always depend .
When pregnancy is not desired , either at least one of the participants must be sterile , sexual intercourse must be avoided , or contraception must be used prior to conception .
Contraception ( even vasectomy ) is not always 100 % effective .
More generally , in sexual behavior contact of semen with the vagina should be avoided .
For example , partners can restrict themselves to masturbation , oral sex , etc. , but they should not forget to keep not only the penis but also the sperm away from the vagina .
Abstinence is sometimes called the only ' sure ' way to avoid pregnancy .
If perfectly adhered to , it is .
However , some who habitually rely on it as their primary protection may cease to abstain and thereby incur the risk of pregnancy .
celibacy , or sexual abstinence ( these may be more properly called alternatives to birth control )
non-procreative sex , such as sex without penetration ( " outercourse " ) anal sex or oral sex
coitus interruptus
the rhythm method
Barrier methods condom female condom diaphragm
Chemical methods oral contraceptives ( " The Pill " ) Other chemical contraceptives ( implants , male pill , depo- provera ) .
spermicides morning - after pill
Other methods herbal contraception Intrauterine Device Natural family planning surgical sterilization , including vasectomy for men and tubal ligation for women chemical or surgical abortion ( not considered by some to be birth control , since pregnancy occurs )
Condoms and herbal birthcontrol methods existed before the modern era .
The herbal methods were of various effectiveness , and were available in China and Europe .
The official position of the Catholic Church regarding birth control is expressed very clearly in Pope Pius XI 's encyclical entitled Casti Connubii .
It was written in response to the Episcopalian approval of artificial means of contraception when used in cases of grave necessity .
Since , therefore , openly departing from the uninterrupted Christian tradition some recently have judged it possible solemnly to declare another doctrine regarding this question , the Catholic Church , ... in order that she may preserve the chastity of the nuptial union from being defiled by this foul stain , ... proclaims anew : any use whatsoever of matrimony exercised in such a way that the act is deliberately frustrated in its natural power to generate life is an offense against the law of God and of nature , and those who indulge in such are branded with the guilt of a grave sin .
In 1968 Pope Paul VI released a document called Humanae Vitae , which again forbade chemical and barrier methods but suggested natural methods such as the rhythm method or natural family planning might be considered in cases of necessity .
The public response to this suggestion was immediate and overwhelming .
There is dissent however .
Some priests and theologians accept only abstinence as moral and there are also those who assert abstinence within a marriage can be immoral .
Couples seeking marriage in the Catholic Church are required to undergo counseling by a Catholic priest .
In the past priests led couples seeking to delay children to rhythm , today they are instructed to point new couples toward the more effective natural family planning .
Individuals , too , can help bring about a world that is more secure and more supportive of life , health and happiness .
They can educate themselves on population dynamics , consumption patterns and the impact of these forces on natural resources and the environment .
They can be socially , politically and culturally active to elevate the issues they care about .
They can become more environmentally responsible in their purchasing decisions and their use of energy and natural resources .
And individuals and couples can consider the impacts of their reproductive decisions on their communities and the world as a whole .
What is needed is for government and the private sector to make reproductive health services available to all who seek them , to make sure that girls and boys can go to and stay in school , and to make economic opportunities as accessible to women as to men .
Combined with improved energy and natural - resource technologies and saner models of consumption and the good life ,  these strategies can bring humanity into enduring balance with the environment and the natural resources that people will always need .
The world 's ocean fisheries are already being fished to their maximum capacities or are in decline .
Global fish production climbed modestly in 1997 , the last year for which global data were available , almost entirely because the farming of fish expanded in the world 's most populous country , China .
While the number of fishermen continues to increase , the amount of fish each fisherman catches is falling steadily .
The poor have long depended on fish for complete protein but population growth has caused this important food source to be out of their reach .
Today about 1.8 billion people live in 36 countries with less than 0.1 hectare of forested land per capita , an indicator of critically low levels of forest cover .
Based on the medium population projection and current deforestation trends , by 2025 the number of people living in forest - scarce countries could nearly double to 3 billion .
Most of the world 's original forests have been lost to the expansion of human activities .
In many parts of the developing world , the future availability of forest resources for food , fuel and shelter looks quite discouraging .
Future declines in the per capita availability of forests , especially in developing countries , are likely to pose major challenges for both conservation and human well - being .
Why population growth matters to the future of forests
In some countries , forests and other vegetation are being burned away at alarming rates to satisfy the growing demand for agricultural land .
The world 's forests provide goods and services essential to human and planetary well - being .
But forests are disappearing faster today than ever before .
Due both to deforestation and human population growth , the current ratio of forests to human beings is less thn half what it was in 1960 .
Yet we not only need more forests , we need forests more than ever before to protect the world 's remaining plant and animal life , to prevent flooding , to slow human - induced climate change , and to provide the paper on which education and communication still depend .
More efficient consumption of forest products and eventual stabilization of human population a prospect that appears more promising today as birthrates decline will be needed to conserve the world 's forests in the coming millennium .
Half of the world 's original forest cover is gone , a loss that reflects humanity 's intensive use of land since the invention of farming .
Of the forest that remains , less than one - fourth could be considered relatively undisturbed by human activity .
The vast primeval forests of Europe and Asia survive today only as patchwork remnants of secondary growth , much of it vulnerable to logging , encroachment by development , pollution , fire and disease .
Forests are currently expanding in much of the industrialized world , while shrinking in most of the developing world .
In just the first five years of the 1990s , 65 million hectares of forestan area the size of Afghanistan were converted to other uses in developing countries .
By contrast , the industrialized countries gained 9 million hectares of forested land , an area about the size of Hungary .
The pattern of forest loss in developing countries today differs from past losses in Europe and elsewhere in two key respects : human populations are much larger than before , and the pace of deforestation is more rapid .
In the last four decades , an area half the size of the United States has been cleared of tropical forests , while population in developing countries has doubled to 4.7 billion .
Among the most encouraging trends for the future of forests is the fact that fertility and birthrates are now declining in developing countries , leading demographers to revise downward their projections of future population growth .
Population dynamics are among the primary underlying causes of forest decline .
Poverty , corruption , inequitable access to land and wasteful consumption practices also influence the decisions of governments , corporations and individuals to cut and clear forests .
The interaction of these forces is most evident in areas such as South Asia , Central America and sub-Saharan Africa , where poverty , rapid population growth and weak institutions contribute to forest loss and severe environmental degradation .
The dominant force in forest loss is growth in the demand for farmland .
Subsistence agriculture is the principal cause of forest loss in Africa , Asia and much of Latin America .
Slash - and - burn farming and other traditional techniques were sustainable for centuries when population densities were lower .
Today they are a major factor , along with the expansion of commercial farms and livestock grazing areas , in the permanent conversion of wooded land to agriculture .
The need to increase food production is expected to accelerate the forest - to - farmland cycle , especially in countries where alternatives for meeting this demand are limited .
A typical American uses 15 times as much lumber and paper as a resident of a developing country .
Total wood consumption has tripled during the 20th century .
Per capita consumption has changed little on a global basisactually decreasing slightly but consumption patterns vary widely between countries .
A typical American uses 15 times as much lumber and paper as a resident of a developing country .
Reducing wood consumption in the industrialized world is unlikely to stop forest loss in developing countries however , since most of the wood consumed comes from trees in the industrialized countries themselves .
Nevertheless , the consumption model offered to the rest of the world threatens accelerated forest loss as both populations and economies grow in developing countries .
Commercial logging of tropical forests has doubled since 1960 , accounting for 5 million to 6 million hectares of forest loss each year , an area nearly the size of Sri Lanka .
This is about one third the forest area lost each year in the developing world .
Illegal logging causes a significant , though unquantified , amount of additional forest loss .
Logging 's biggest role in deforestation , however , is more indirect .
Logging roads provide pathways deep into forests that farmers and other settlers then follow , permanently clearing the land for crops and pasture .
Nearly 3 billion people depend on wood as their main source of energy .
The production of fuelwood and charcoal accounts for over 90 percent of the wood harvested in Africa , 80 percent in Asia and 70 percent in Latin America .
Population growth is closely linked to rising woodfuel demand .
The effects of woodfuel scarcity are most severe in impoverished areas , where more modern fuels are inaccessible or unaffordable .
Women and children are the victims of woodfuel scarcity .
The search for fuel consumes the time , energy and health of women and their children .
As local wood supplies grow scarce , women risk spinal column damage and uterine prolapse from carrying heavier loads over longer distances .
Girls are often kept home from school to help their mothers gather wood , depriving them of educational opportunities .
Where wood is unavailable , women cook with inefficient fuels such as animal dung or crop wastes , depriving livestock of fodder and soils of natural fertilizer .
This endangers both the nutritional and respiratory health of women and their families .
Forest scarcity threatens the use of paper for education , the activity most likely to improve health and economic well - being .
80 percent of the world 's population lack access to enough affordable paper and reading materials to meet basic standards for literacy and communication .
Reducing paper consumption could help ensure enough paper for all .
These efforts are undermined , however , by broader inequalities in access to education and economic opportunity .
Closing the " paper gap " between rich and poor nations ultimately depends on government action to increase spending on education , health and social services in developing countries .
Future population growth and forest loss will largely determine whether and when this gap can be closed .
Population policies based on human development and the Scale of Human and Earth Rights offer the greatest hope for the future of forests .
This is not an argument for population " control " but for the social investments that allow couples to choose when to have children and how many to have .
Programs linking conservation activities with family planning services show promise for achieving both the sustainable use of forests and greater acceptance of reproductive health services .
Sustainable wood consumption is essential for the future of forests .
Individuals and institutions alike should promote the ecologically sound and socially responsible use of forest products .
Eco-labeling , or the environmental certification of wood products , could speed the adoption of more sustainable forestry practices .
Consumer demand for green - certified paper and other wood products is an important complement to recycling and other efforts to reduce wood consumption .
The well - being of the world 's forests is closely linked to the health and well - being of women .
Investing in education for girls helps them to contribute to their national economies and to postpone childbearing until they are ready for a family .
Providing credit and other economic opportunities for women creates alternatives to early and frequent childbearing .
Finally , better access to quality reproductive health services directly benefits women and their families .
These approaches increase human capacity , providing the greatest long - term return to societies , individuals and the environment .
Moreover , they are likely to lead to an early peak in world population in the coming century quite possibly at levels that can co-exist with forests that teem with human and non-human life for centuries to come .
The number of people living in countries where cultivated land is critically scarce is projected to increase to between 600 million and 986 million in 2025 .
Despite the Green Revolution and other technological advances , agriculture experts continue to debate how long crop yields will keep up with population growth .
The food that feeds the future will be raised mostly on today 's cropland .
The soil on this land must remain fertile to keep food production secure .
The minimum amount of land needed to supply a vegetarian diet for one person without any use of artificial chemical inputs or loss of soil and soil nutrients is .07 hectares , or slightly less than a quarter of an acre .
An estimated 415 million people already live today in countries that have less than that per person .
Easing world hunger could become unimaginably difficult if population growth resembles demographers ' higher projections .
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization defines adequate nourishment as consumption of at least 2,100 kilocalories ( often called calories informally ) per day .
Countries are shaded to illustrate the proportion of the population which does not have access to enough food to satisfy this requirement .
Having reached nearly 6.1 billion in 2000 , human population continues to grow .
UN population projections for the year 2050 range from 7.9 billion to 10.9 billion , suggesting the extent to which we can influence our future .
More people and higher incomes worldwide are multiplying humanity 's impacts on the environment and on the natural resources that are essential to life .
The planet 's fresh water , fisheries , forests and atmosphere are already strained .
Based on these trends , it is clear that the 21st century will witness even greater pressures on natural resources .
Current demographic trends offer hope , however .
Over the past 40 years the average number of children born to each woman has fallen from five to less than three .
Young people increasingly want to wait to have children and to have smaller families .
Policymakers have a choice .
They can do nothing , or they can help ensure that in the 21st century the world 's population peaks with fewer than 8 billion people , simply by committing the financial resources to meet the needs of couples who want to have smaller families , later in life .
The future of the relationship between people and critical natural resources has begun to appear more hopeful than it has for some time .
Human population growth is slowing down .
While slowing , however , significant growth continues , meaning that more people will be sharing such finite resources as freshwater and cropland .
And in some regions  notably in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia  large families and early pregnancies provide strong momentum for population growth that could continue for generations to come .
But the braking of this growth has been significant enough that many analysts of natural resources are more optimistic about their future availability than they were in the early 1990s .
The problem is worse than it often appears on the ground , because much of the fresh water now used in water - scarce regions comes from deep aquifers that are not being refreshed by the natural water cycle .
In most of the countries where water shortage is severe and worsening , high rates of population growth exacerbate the declining availability of renewable fresh water .
While 25 countries currently experience either water stress or scarcity , 39 to 41 countries are projected to face similar conditions by 2025 .
434 million people face either water stress or scarcity .
Depending on future rates of population growth , between 2.6 billion and 3.1 billion people may be living in either water - scarce or water - stressed conditions by 2025 .
For tens of millions of people in the Middle East and in much of Africa today , the lack of available fresh water is a chronic concern that is growing more acute and more widespread .
The problem is worse than it often appears on the ground , because much of the fresh water now used in water - scarce regions comes from deep aquifers that are not being refreshed by the natural water cycle .
In most of the countries where water shortage is severe and worsening , high rates of population growth exacerbate the declining availability of renewable fresh water .
While 25 countries currently experience either water stress or scarcity , between 36 and 40 countries are projected to face similar conditions by 2025 .
In biology , the carrying capacity of an environment for a particular species is a measure of the steady - state density that the species can have for a particular habitat to support sustainably .
When populations exceed the carrying capacity , famine and disease tend to reduce the size the population .
Humans are the only species known to possess the ability to increase their carrying capacity .
Overpopulation is a condition in which some population can , under certain circumstances , grow so large or dense that it exceeds the biological carrying capacity of its containing natural ecological system and thus will naturally reduce in numbers throughfamine , and lack of essential resources .
In the case of humans , or theoretically , any other specie that is able to extend its carrying capacity through agricultural and technological means , it means harnessing a natural system to sustainably support it with or without causing environmental damage , and the continuous ability to do so .
Overpopulation is regarded by many as a critical issue concerning the growth , and future size of the earth 's population .
There is a growing awareness that the unrestrained growth of populations should pay for itself .
Taxes and utility costs must escalate in order to pay for the growth .
In addition , growth brings increased levels of congestion , frustration , and air pollution .
In recent years , several industrialized nations have seen taxpayer revolts in the form of ballot questions that were adopted to limit the allowed tax increases .
The revolts have been in the nations that claimed to be the most prosperous because they had the largest rates of population growth .
These limits on taxes were felt to be necessary to stop the tax increases that were required to pay for the growth .
Unfortunately the growth has managed to continue , while the schools and other public agencies have suffered from the shortage of funds .
Communities can slow their population growth by removing the many visible and hidden public subsidies that support and encourage growth .
It clear that there will always be large opposition to programs of making population growth pay for itself .
Those who profit from growth will use their considerable resources to convince the community that the community should pay the costs of growth .
In our communities , making growth pay for itself could be a major tool to use in stopping the population growth .
Nations experiencing decreases in Total Fertility Rate ( TFR ) are nations that are very different from each other racially , religiously , and politically , implying that the drive to stabilize populations is a global movement .
It is being realized that more people now means less of everything else now and for generations to come , and that more people simply cause additional strain on already - strained resources .
In fact , decreasing fertility is an important part of an economic development strategy .
What happens to the idea of the dignity of the human species if this population growth continues at its present rate ?
It will be completely destroyed .
Democracy cannot survive overpopulation .
Human dignity cannot survive overpopulation .
Convenience and decency cannot survive overpopulation .
As you put more and more people onto the world , the value of life not only declines , it disappears .
It does n't matter if someone dies , the more people there are , the less one person matters .
Having reached 6.3 billion in 2003 , human population continues to grow .
It was estimated that the population of the world in year 2050 will be 9,084,495,405 .
UN population projections for the year 2050 range from 7.9 billion to 10.9 billion , suggesting the extent to which we can influence our future .
More people and higher incomes worldwide are multiplying humanity 's impact on the environment and on natural resources essential to life .
Based on these trends , it is clear that the 21st century will witness even greater pressures on natural resources .
Current demographic trends offer hope , however .
Over the past 40 years the average number of children born to each woman has fallen from five to less than three .
Young people increasingly want to wait to have children and to have smaller families .
Policymakers have a choice .
They can do nothing , or they can help ensure that in the 21st century the world 's population peaks with fewer than 8 billion people , simply by committing the financial resources to meet the needs of couples who want to have smaller families , later in life .
Many of the nations with high and relatively unchanging TFR's have several features in common :
they are still largely agricultural ,
there is much social inequity and poverty , and
women are held in very low status and poorly educated ( for example , in sub-Saharan Africa , 49 % of women between the ages of 20 and 24 years are illiterate ( for women older than 25 year , the illiteracy rate is 75 % ! )
Clearly the environmental challenges facing humanity in the 21st century and beyond would be less difficult in a world with slower population growth or none at all .
Population is a critical variable influencing the availability of each of the natural resources considered here .
And access to family planning services is a critical variable influencing population .
Use of family planning contributes powerfully to lower fertility , later childbearing , and slower population growth .
Yet policymakers , environmentalists and the general public remain largely unaware of the growing interest of young people throughout the world in delaying pregnancies and planning their families .
In greater proportions than ever , girls want to go to school and to college , and women want to find fulfilling and well - paid employment .
Helping people in every country to obtain the information and services they need to put these ambitions into effect is all that can be done , and all that needs to be done , to end world population growth in the new century .
Reproductive health services can help .
Voluntary family planning and other reproductive health services can help couples avert high - risk pregnancies , prevent unwanted childbearing and abortion , and avoid diseases such as HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections , that can lead to death , disability , and infertility .
Comprehensive reproductive health services , especially care in pregnancy and childbirth and for sexually transmitted infections , are key to preventing disability and death and improving women 's health .
Better access to emergency care during childbirth and safe abortion services would also contribute significantly to lower maternal death rates .
Family planning diminishes risks associated with frequent childbearing and helps reduce reliance on abortion .
An important obstacle to couple negotiation of contraceptive use and protection from STDs including HIV is that most women have unequal access to resources and decision - making .
Yet women are more vulnerable to the consequences of unplanned pregnancies and often HIV / STI 's .
For these reasons , countering the prevailing gender stereotypes that increase risky behaviors and decrease couple communication is a key strategy for promoting good reproductive health .
Individuals , too , can help bring about a world that is more secure and more supportive of life , health and happiness .
They can educate themselves on population dynamics , consumption patterns and the impact of these forces on natural resources and the environment .
They can be socially , politically and culturally active to elevate the issues they care about .
They can become more environmentally responsible in their purchasing decisions and their use of energy and natural resources .
And individuals and couples can consider the impacts of their reproductive decisions on their communities and the world as a whole .
The world 's forests provide goods and services essential to human and planetary well - being .
But forests are disappearing faster today than ever before .
Due both to deforestation and human population growth , the current ratio of forests to human beings is less than half what it was in 1960 .
Yet we not only need more forests , we need forests more than ever before to protect the world 's remaining plant and animal life , to prevent flooding , to slow human - induced climate change , and to provide the paper on which education and communication still depend .
More efficient consumption of forest products and eventual stabilization of human population a prospect that appears more promising today as birthrates decline will be needed to conserve the world 's forests in the coming millennium .
Population dynamics are among the primary underlying causes of forest decline .
Poverty , corruption , inequitable access to land and wasteful consumption practices also influence the decisions of governments , corporations and individuals to cut and clear forests .
The interaction of these forces is most evident in areas such as South Asia , Central America and sub-Saharan Africa , where poverty , rapid population growth and weak institutions contribute to forest loss and severe environmental degradation .
The dominant force in forest loss is growth in the demand for farmland .
Subsistence agriculture is the principal cause of forest loss in Africa , Asia and much of Latin America .
Slash - and - burn farming and other traditional techniques were sustainable for centuries when population densities were lower .
Today they are a major factor , along with the expansion of commercial farms and livestock grazing areas , in the permanent conversion of wooded land to agriculture .
The need to increase food production is expected to accelerate the forest - to - farmland cycle , especially in countries where alternatives for meeting this demand are limited .
Population policies based on human development and the Scale of Human and Earth Rights offer the greatest hope for the future of forests .
This is not an argument for population " control " but for the social investments that allow couples to choose when to have children and how many to have .
Programs linking conservation activities with family planning services show promise for achieving both the sustainable use of forests and greater acceptance of reproductive health services .
Sustainable wood consumption is essential for the future of forests .
Individuals and institutions alike should promote the ecologically sound and socially responsible use of forest products .
Eco-labeling , or the environmental certification of wood products , could speed the adoption of more sustainable forestry practices .
Consumer demand for green - certified paper and other wood products is an important complement to recycling and other efforts to reduce wood consumption .
Motivation , rather than differential access to modern contraception is a major determinant of fertility .
Individuals frequently respond to scarcity by having fewer children , and to perceived improved economic opportunity by having more children .
Economic development does not cause family size to shrink ; rather , at every point where serious economic opportunity beckons , family size preferences expand .
A ) Foreign aid conveys to the recipients the perception of improving economic wellbeing , which is followed by an increase in the fertility of the recipients of the aid .
B ) Migrations from regions of low economic opportunity to places of higher economic opportunity result in an increase in the fertility of the migrants that persists for a generation or two .
The need is not to control population growth .
Governments cannot control childbearing and attempts to do so have sometimes led to coercive approaches to reproduction that violate human rights .
The need is rather to expand the power individuals have over their own lives , especially by enabling them to choose how many children to have and when to have them .
The well - being of the world 's forests is closely linked to the health and well - being of women .
Investing in education for girls helps them to contribute to their national economies and to postpone childbearing until they are ready for a family .
Providing credit and other economic opportunities for women creates alternatives to early and frequent childbearing .
Finally , better access to quality reproductive health services directly benefits women and their families .
These approaches increase human capacity , providing the greatest long - term return to societies , individuals and the environment .
Moreover , they are likely to lead to an early peak in world population in the coming century quite possibly at levels that can co-exist with forests that teem with human and non-human life for centuries to come .
delay reproduction until later in life
Delaying reproduction is important in influencing population growth rates .
Over a period of 60 years , if people delay reproduction until they are 30 years old , you would have only two generations , while if you do not delay reproduction you would have three generations ( one generation every 20 years ) .
spread your children farther apart
to have fewer children overall
government commitment to decreasing population growth
Create policies that help decreasing the number of children being born .
Policies such as income tax deductions for dependent children and maternity and paternity leaves are essentially pronatalist and should be eliminated .
programs that are locally designed and that include information on family planning and access to contraceptives
educational programs that emphasize the connection between family planning and social good
The vast disparities in reproductive health worldwide and the greater vulnerability of the poor to reproductive risk point to several steps all governments can take , with the support of other sectors , to improve the health of women and their families :
Give women more life choices .
The low social and economic status of women and girls sets the stage for poor reproductive health
Invest in reproductive health care
Encourage delays in the onset of sexual activity and first births
Help couples prevent and manage unwanted childbearing
Ensure universal access to maternal health care
Support new reproductive health technologies
Increase efforts to address the HIV pandemic
Involve communities in evaluating and implementing programs
Develop partnerships with the private sector , policymakers and aid donors to broaden support for reproductive health
Measure Progress
More and more young people on every continent want to start bearing children later in life and to have smaller families than at any time in history .
Likewise , in greater proportions than ever , women and girls in particular want to go to school and to college , and they want to find fulfilling and well - paid employment .
Helping people in every country obtain the information and services they need to put these ambitions into effect is all that can be done , and all that needs to be done , to bring world population growth to a stable landing in the new century .

Ben Goldacre , The Guardian , Saturday 1 August 2009
This week the Food Standards Agency published 2 review papers showing that organic food is no better than normal food , in terms of composition , or health benefits .
The Soil Association ’s response has been swift , receiving prominent and blanket right of reply : this is testament to the lobbying power of this £ 2bn industry , and the cultural values of people who work in the media .
I do n’t care about organic food .
I am interested in bad arguments .
Theirs has three components .
Firstly , they say that the important issue with organic food is not personal health benefits , but rather benefit to the environment .
This is a popular strategy from losing positions : “ do n’t talk about that , talk about this “ .
It is diversionary , and we can separately talk about the environmental issues with organic food , but right now , we are talking about the health benefits .
Secondly , they say that the health benefits of organic food are related to pesticides , are positive , and cannot be measured by the evidence that has been identified and summarised in the FSA paper .
This , again , is gamesmanship .
Either you are proposing that there are health benefits which cannot ever be measured ( because it is too hard to disentangle the health benefits of eating organic food from other beneficial features of peoples ’ lives , for example , when you measure their health in a 30 year study ) .
In this case you have faith , which is not a matter of evidence .
Or you are proposing that there are health benefits which could be measured , but have not been yet .
In this case , again , you have faith rather than evidence , but you could at least start recruiting researchers now , using your £ 2bn , to investigate your beliefs with fair tests .
And thirdly , sadly , like many industries in a corner , the Soil Association seek to undermine the public ’s understanding of what a “ systematic review ” is ( which itself causes collateral damage to everybody ’s ability to engage in debates on evidence ) .
They say that the report has deliberately excluded evidence to produce the answer that organic food is no better .
The accusation is one of “ cherry - picking ” , and it is hard to see how it can be valid in the kind of study conducted by the FSA , because in a “ systematic review ” , before you begin collecting papers , you specify how you will search for evidence , what databases you will use , what types of studies you will use , how you will grade the quality of the evidence ( to see if it was a “ fair test ” ) , and so on .
Now : what are the Soil Association angry about the FSA report ignoring ?
As an example , from their press release , they are “ disappointed that the FSA failed to include the results of a major European Union - funded study involving 31 research and university institutes and the publication , so far , of more than 100 scientific papers , at a cost of 18 million Euros , which ended in April this year ” .
They gave the link to www.qlif.org.
I followed this link and found the QLIF list of 120 papers .
Almost all are irrelevant .
The first 14 are on “ consumer expectations and attitudes ” , which are correctly not included in a systematic review of the evidence on food composition .
Then there are 22 on “ effects of production methods ” : here you might expect to find more relevant research , but no .
The first paper ( “ The effect of medium term feeding with organic , low input and conventional diet on selected immune parameters in rat “ ) while interesting , will plainly not be relevant to a systematic review on nutrient content .
The same is true of the next paper , “ Salmonella Infection Level in Danish Indoor and Outdoor Pig Production Systems measured by Antbodies in Meat Juice and Faecal Shedding on - farm and at Slaughter “ : it is not relevant .
Furthermore , the overwhelming majority of these are unpublished conference papers , and some of them are just a description of the fact that somebody made an oral presentation at a meeting .
The systematic review correctly only looked at good quality data published in peer reviewed academic journals , and with good reason : we know that conference papers are unreliable sources of information , often change between conference and publication , and , in fact , we know that conference papers are often never published at all .
This raises the issue of transparency : we want the methods and results of scientific research to be formally presented , and accessible by all .
If a government report on anything relies substantially on unpublished and inaccessible research then we are correctly concerned : in fact , I raised such concerns , two weeks ago , because the key piece of evidence presented by the Home Office to justify retaining DNA from innocent people who have been arrested was an incompetently presented piece of unpublished and incomplete research .
I could go on , but in reality , this is not about organic food .
The emotive commentary in favour of organic farming bundles together diverse and legitimate concerns about unchecked capitalism in our food supply : battery farming , corruptible regulators , or reckless destruction of the environment , where the producer ’s costs do not reflect the true full costs of their activities to society , to name just a few .
Each of these problems deserve individual attention .
But just as we do not solve the problems of deceitfulness in the pharmaceutical industry by buying homeopathic sugar pills , so we may not resolve the undoubted problems of unchecked capitalism in industrial food production by giving money to the £ 2bn industry represented by the Soil Association .
Before you stash that huge sum of money in a bank , ask this question ; how much cash can I deposit without red flag ?
Money laundering and tax evasion are becoming rampant .
That is why there ’s a limit set by the financial regulatory agency to report bank deposits .
So , how much cash can I deposit without red flag is the question !
When you make deposits lower than $ 10,000 ( cumulatively ) for a while , it will not be red-flagged .
But when you make several smaller payments within 12 months , then the 15 days for reporting such transactions to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) starts counting once the total amount exceeds $ 10,000 .
Structured deposits may also attract a red flag ; that is when you consistently make deposits of $ 9800 within 14 days , to evade IRS .
In such cases , the financial institution needs to file the Suspicious Activity Report and send to the FinCEN .
So , that is it about bank deposits that trigger the red flag .
Continue reading for more information .
Why Do Banks Red Flag Deposits ?
It hurts to find that the money you legally deposited in a bank was red-flagged and attracted a series of questions from the authorities .
But the reasons banks red flag deposits are convincing , though .
They are also obliged by the law to do so .
Now , one of the reasons that banks usually red flag deposits higher than a certain amount is because of the BAS ( Bank Secrecy Act ) , which is also regarded as “ Currency and Foreign Transaction Reporting Act . ”
The main goal of this law guiding banks and other financial institution is to prevent tax evasion and money laundering .
Money laundering is a serious criminal offence responsible for many country ’s backwardnesses in terms of economic growth .
Cash meant for infrastructural development and to better the lives of the people , will be stolen and stashed somewhere one person or a group of people who call themselves called politicians .
There are many cases of money laundering across the globe .
It frequently happens in countries lacking severe punishment for corrupt political officeholders .
Most of the corrupt officers even got scot - free when tried in a law court in their home country .
That is how ugly the situation is .
When we say money laundering is a serious problem across the continent , it sure is .
A report by the International Monetary Fund shows why .
The body claims in its report that the whopping sum of $ 600 billion to $ 1.5 trillion is being laundered every single year .
Now that figure represents funds that could positively affect the lives of many .
But some political officer holders do n’t care about the people they are governing .
Like it or not , money laundering is a severe case around the world today .
Once these criminals steal and launder money , they immediately consider depositing the money to make it look like they worked and earn such cash via honest means .
So banks and other financial institutions have a reputation to protect and a duty to perform .
For transactions above $ 10,000 , which is the limit set by the BSA , they have to report to the IRS ( Internal Revenue Service ) .
How Do Banks Red Flag Deposits ?
When a client attempting to pay up a private business , walks into a bank and deposits $ 10,000 in cash or more , the bank has to report such transactions to the relevant body , IRS .
Most customers know this .
But for those ignorant of such reports , the bank has to notify them beforehand .
How is the report processed or sent by the bank to the IRS ?
It is by filling Form 8300 .
This form is there to help provide reports regarding transactions whereby the total cumulative sum is $ 10,000 or over .
What this means is that even if you make a cash deposit of $ 5000 and initiate another $ 5000 deposit at different times , the Form 8300 still has to be filled and the transaction red-flagged .
Note that this sort of related transaction is one that took place at a space of 24 hours .
The bottom line is when there is a connection between both transactions ; banks usually do not waste time when it comes to completing the Form 8300 and red-flagging the deposit .
What The Form 8300 Provides IRS And Fincen
First off , the IRS and FinCEN are two relevant agencies belonging to the U.S government .
The IRS ( Internal Revenue Service ) is saddled with the responsibility of tax collection and enforcement of laws relating to taxes .
The FinCEN and IRS are both under the department of the treasure .
The FinCEN ( Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ) was created to provide support to the federal , state , and international law enforcement .
The agency ’s responsibility is to analyze the information provided via the BSA ( Bank Secrecy Act ) .
The BSA ranks as one of the top tools deployed by the U.S to fight against tax evasion and money laundering .
However , for both agencies ( IRS and FinCEN ) to carry out their duties , the Form 8300 must have been filled , thus triggering a red flag .
This Form 8300 is a weapon in the hands of both agencies .
It provides valuable information , which invariably helps the agencies to clampdown drug dealers and money launders .
Money laundering fuels corruption and illegal deals .
It also facilitates criminal activities like terrorist financing , including drug - related transactions , which requires enormous sum .
Another critical question is who fills the Form 8300 ?
Well , the U.S law demands that businesses and trades report transactions involving cash payments that are $ 10,000 or over , to the government .
The simple way is by filing Form 8300 .
Failure to do so attracts a fine , mainly when the form is n’t filled within 15 days of the said transaction .
Here is a clear example of a case where a business needs to file Form 8300 to protect their client .
Michael Peters ( client ) approached a travel agency to help charter a private jet to transport a group of athletes to another city .
He then made another request for the agent to assist in booking hotel rooms for the players , including securing admission tickets .
Michael also proceeded to pay the agency with a transaction involving two money orders , with each of them totalling $ 6,000 ( $ 12,000 in total ) .
In the above scenario , you can see that the agency got over $ 10,000 from the client , Michael Peters , in the same transaction .
In this case , the agency must file the Form 8300 , and a copy of the form sent to FinCEN .
Credit unions and banks are required to send a report of such transactions to the agencies mentioned above , as failure to do so attracts severe penalties .
The Form , upon completion , can either be mailed to the IRS or filed electronically .
Filing The Form 8300 : What Transaction Would Warrant
This ?
Not all transactions require businesses to file the Form 8300 on behave of their client to avoid being penalized by the IRS .
Check the list below to see some of the transactions considered necessary .
Payments for pre-existing debt
Contributions involving escrow arrangements
Purchases involving negotiable instrument
Reimbursement of one ’s expenses
Selling of goods and services
Sale of an intangible property
Sale of real a property
How Depositing Over $ 10,000 Can Become A Problem
It ’s your hard - earned money you are depositing , so you should have no reason to worry .
But do you know that how you make your deposits can spell trouble with the authorities ?
Keep in mind that depositing over $ 10,000 is n’t the problem .
You can even deposit up to $ 100,000 and more , and still not have any issue with the authorities .
So what can create a problem ?
It is how you deposit the money .
There will be a red flag when you split your money into smaller deposits , but the aim is to deposit $ 10,000 .
In this case , it could be something like ; $ 3,000 , $ 2,000 and $ 5,000 , later on , to make up $ 10,000 .
You might not have a bad intention for depositing that way .
But the bank or IRS might not share the same view .
They may conclude that you are only structuring those deposits to circumvent the BSA ( Bank Secrecy Act ) , including the CTR process of the bank .
Structuring , which implies splitting deposits into smaller units that amount to $ 10,000 or more , is an illegal and punishable offence .
It makes the government and banks feel that you are trying to play a fast one on them .
You may not have heard , but such crimes have caused hundreds of people millions of their hard - earned money .
For example , in 2016 , the IRS reported that it seized $ 46 million from 600 individuals who deposited money .
The individuals whose monies were seized may not have gotten involved in illegal business .
Majority of them may not be into unlawful activity .
It ’s just that the method by which they deposited the money gave them away .
Your large deposit of $ 10,000 + split into smaller amount is not the only factors that count .
What counts is the frequency at which you deposited the money , too .
A single deposit of say $ 9,999 does not fall into the criteria for reporting .
But when you deposit $ 9,999 every single day , for at least two weeks , then there ’s going to be a red flag .
Conclusion
The Bank Secrecy
Act is a stricter law than one can imagine .
It was enacted to help combat money laundering , including tax invasion .
So before you start asking how much cash can I deposit without red flag , know that trying to circumvent the system is a punishable offence .
You could lose your hard - earned money to the authorities if your transactions are suspicious .
So , avoid structuring your payments or anything that could get you into trouble , even when a red flag is raised .

Tom Perriello ( D - Va. ) was one of a few lawmakers who received fraudulent letters opposing the House climate bill .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Lobbyists sent 13 fake letters to Hill
A lobbying firm working for a pro-coal industry group sent lawmakers a total of 13 fraudulent letters opposing the House climate bill — five more than initially believed , the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming said Tuesday .
The fake letters — sent to Reps .
Kathy Dahlkemper ( D - Pa. ) , Christopher Carney ( D - Pa. ) and Tom Perriello ( D - Va. ) — purported to be from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , senior citizens groups and Creciendo Juntos , a Hispanic advocacy organization .

In total , the firm sent 58 letters , and committee investigators suspect several more may be revealed to be fakes .
The newly discovered letters included one , allegedly sent from a senior center in Charlottesville , Va. , that the lobbying firm originally claimed was legitimate , the committee said .
Bonner and Associates , a firm that specializes in grassroots lobbying , was hired by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity and by the Hawthorn Group , an Alexandria - based public affairs firm , as a subcontractor .
Both companies have since denounced the company for the fake letters ; Bonner and Associates has told POLITICO that the letters were sent by a temporary employee who has since been fired .
“ As a part of both our internal examination and our full cooperation with the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , ACCCE is continuing to take all possible steps to determine the authenticity of all letters Bonner and Associates submitted under its limited scope of work with the Hawthorn Group on behalf of ACCCE , ” said Lisa Miller , a spokewoman for the group .
“ ACCCE is sharing the information from our review with the Select Committee on an ongoing basis . ”
Earlier this month , the Sierra Club formally asked the Department of Justice to open a criminal investigation into the letters .
New disclosures about the letters come as the climate debate heats up , with both sides using tactics that mirror those in the health care debate .
" We ’ve seen fear - mongering with our nation ’s senior citizens with health care , and now we ’re seeing fraud - mongering with senior citizens on clean energy , " said committee Chairman Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) , who ’s focusing his investigation on checking the other 45 letters sent to lawmakers by Bonner .
Last week , efforts by a petroleum industry group to get employees and retirees to attend rallies attacking climate change legislation sparked a fierce debate within the energy community .
In a memo sent earlier this month , American Petroleum Institute President Jack Gerard described “ energy citizen ” rallies to be held in 20 states over the last weeks of the August recess .
Environmental groups slammed the events as manufactured grass - roots outrage .
Repower America , a group founded by former vice president Al Gore , and the Blue Green Alliance are hosting more than 50 events in 22 states , arguing that climate legislation would create jobs in clean energy and other new sectors .
In late June , the House narrowly passed climate legislation that would establish a cap - and - trade system to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
The legislation faces a tough fight in the Senate , where it has come under fierce scrutiny from Midwestern and Southern Democrats .
The meeting took place on Wed 11 - Fri 13 November 2009 ( GHM ) and Sat 14 - Sun 15 ( FSCONS ) in Gothenburg , Sweden at the IT University .
The meeting was held during the three days prior to the FSCONS free software conference ( organised by FSF Europe , Creative Commons and Wikimedia ) .

I ’m not a Republican , but I know many people who are .
I have GOP friends , co-workers and family members , and for that matter I used to be a Republican myself .
A long time ago in a galaxy far , far away , to be sure .
But it ’s true .
It ’s no secret that I do n’t agree with the GOP on much of anything these days , but there ’s kind of an odd element to my conversations with Republican acquaintances lately : a lot of them profess significant disagreement with the platform and policies of their party , too .
Taken in a vacuum , this is hardly surprising .
After all , America is the land of disagreement , and there are n’t any parties out there that are acting in significant accordance with my views .
So individual Republicans at odds with their party and with others in the party ?
Makes perfect sense .
We do n’t live in a vacuum , though .
We live in a complex series of interrelated contexts , and in context the reservations of my Republican friends merit further scrutiny .
For starters , those who are n’t on the bus with our current media - enabled popular revolution seem to be the majority .
For these folks I have a word of advice : you have some ugly problems , and they need confronting today .
Republicans vs. the Republican Party
We recently had a little round - and - round here over Sara Robinson ’s article on “ Fascism in America . ”
Sara argues , persuasively and with detailed evidence , that the Republican Party represents a looming fascist threat for the United States .
She does n’t use the term “ fascist ” as a casual pejorative ; she uses the word in a specific way and she defines precisely what she means by it .
A couple of our readers took exception , with our friend Lara Amber ( a very smart , progressive mind , by the way ) finding something personal in the analysis :
Most Republicans are nice people , they are n’t “ racist , sexist , repressed , exclusionary , and permanently addicted to the politics of fear and rage . ”
( Nice way to shut down any discourse with anyone across the aisle by the way , way to go Sara ! - sound of head hitting desk ) .
My response there , which I stand by , was that Robinson was n’t talking about the individuals who comprise the party , but was instead describing its official apparatus .
To be sure , the GOP has members who are guilty of everything Robinson says in that passage , and probably more , but I do n’t read her as overgeneralizing to the extent that Lara believed .
Still , Lara is like me – there are Republicans in her life , good people whom she respects and cares about .
So the tendency to say “ hey , wait a damned minute ” is perhaps understandable .
But herein lies the proverbial rub : as Lara herself notes , the GOP is currently experiencing something of a leadership crisis .
Right now its visible leaders are ( to Party chair Michael Steele ’s dismay ) primarily media nutbags and hatespewers like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck .
It ’s also being “ led ” by a variety of well - funded astroturfers and “ activist ” organizations – these are the invisible hands manipulating the strings of the teabagger revolution , the birther conspiracy and the faux - ragers who have invaded the townhall health care “ debates ” – and fueled by the Fair & Balanced® press .
You have occasional appearances by political luminaries like Sarah Palin and Michele Bachman ( who ’s now saying she ’ll run for president if Jesus asks her to – where ’s Sam Kinison when you need him ? ) and plenty of yammering by Congressweasels in the pockets of the insurance industry who are desperately trying to distract us from opinion polls showing that a vast majority of citizens want real health care reform built around a public option .
And so on , and so on .
If you were asked to rebut Robinson ’s characterization of the GOP – “ racist , sexist , repressed , exclusionary , and permanently addicted to the politics of fear and rage ” – there ’s not a lot of evidence out there in the public eye this summer that would serve you very well .
So let ’s take all this and see if we can summarize in a way that we can more or less agree on .
How about this :
The Republican Party leadership is currently dominated by reactionary and corporatist voices that are not in line with the beliefs and values of a significant percentage of the party ’s members .
( Yes , I ’m more than aware that the Dem leadership is corporatist and out of step with what a good number of its members believe , too .
We ’ll deal with that another day . )
The second problem facing my GOP friends is even more troubling .
In short , your party , your voice and your official political agenda are being hijacked by the most ignorant , unsavory , hateful and toxic elements in American society .
Some examples :
I could go on .
But do I need to ?
If you ’re a reasonable Republican , all this has to trouble you ( and I ’ve heard enough Republicans say that it does to know that I ’m not imagining things ) .
The issue is n’t that all GOPpers are like the fruitcakes running loose here in the Summer of Hate .
In truth , this silliness is the work of a minority that is n’t big enough to do much damage at the ballot box .
So since they ca n’t win using the techniques prescribed by law – you know , campaigning , voting , that sort of thing – and since their opinions are shared by so few ( again , national polls on health care say over 70 % of Americans favor a public option , for instance ) , they ’re trying to get their way by being the loudest .
By resorting to rhetorical misdirection and deceit when reason and fact are so thoroughly stacked against them .
By pitching the most obnoxious tantrums .
By resorting to base terror , intimidation and thuggery .
By playing on the media ’s insatiable thirst for noise .
The worst part , from the perspective of the rational Republican , is that a lot of these barking loons probably are n’t even members of the party ( although the money behind their organized , choreographed hissy fits certainly is ) .
Of course , at least one GOP lawmaker seems more than willing to welcome the lot of them aboard , and the average citizen may not expend the energy necessary to differentiate all the players aligned against Obama .
The Mandate
If you do n’t control your image , your image will control you .
– Dennis Green
If you are , in fact , an educated Republican who prefers to deliberate your way to conclusions thoughtfully , these are dangerous times .
Because thanks to the way the system is rigged – and let ’s understand who rigged it this way and why – most of what you hear through Big Journalism channels is inaccurate , at best , and most of what you hear through alternative channels is noise , at best .
And those who do have something intelligent to say ?
Well , there are n’t many cameras pointed in their direction .
Reason and fact are n’t as exciting as townhall cage matches .
I spent a lot of years ( beginning in the early 1980s ) saying , to any coherent Christian who ’d listen , that they ’d better get serious about taking back their religion from the jihadists on the right .
Now I ’m saying it to every Republican who was offended by what Sara Robinson wrote and who is watching the Summer of Hate unfold with a little unease .
You need to find a leader and take back your party – either that or walk away from it in ways that make your disapproval unmistakeably clear .
You may think these people do n’t speak for you , but they are speaking in your name , whether you like it or not .
And at the moment , nobody is doing anything to correct the notion that everybody to the right of Barack Obama is a rabid hyena .

Web designers are a special breed – we ’re one of a small group of professionals that actively seeks out to improve ourselves and our craft through any means possible .
This generally means on our own , from each other , and through an awful lot of ‘ guess , test and revise . ’
Web design is n’t for the faint of heart or those with any fear of failure .
The most daunting ‘ learning experience ’ for developing developers is to make the jump from the HTMLs and the CSSs of the world to web scripting .
It looks good from the outside – all that added interactivity and animation and cool effects and features – oh my .
But for some designers , it proves to be a difficult lesson to learn , as scripting can require more focus , logic , and organization than the coding that you are used to .
Getting on Your Feet Fast
Let ’s take a look at bulletproof ways to ease into Javascript at an accelerated pace .
Javascript is the perfect place to start to learn scripting because it is generally less complex than other scripting languages , and is client - side – meaning that you will be able to test your scripts on your computer as you script it , in real time , without setting up servers or putting forth any more effort than you really need to .
However you code pages now is great – do n’t do anything differently to accommodate Javascript – she ’s easy to get along with .
The first place I start when looking to learn anything new is on the web – makes sense to learn the web from the web , right ?
Yeah , books are nice , and they can make you look intelligent , but the truth of the matter is that you ’ll find most ( if not all ) of that same information out on the web , and , out on the web , you can find the most updated tutorials .
If books suit you , there are a plethora of books out there on Javascript – feel free to help yourself to any of them .
Websites That Teach Javascript
Something to remember about Javascript websites as you scour the web for help – there are essentially two types of Javascript websites ; those that are focused on scripts , and those that are focused on teaching Javascript .
I say this because I ’ve worked with a lot of students that have stumbled across script websites , started reading scripts on those pages as if they were tutorials and then got confused and discouraged when they could n’t follow the code – this would be akin to trying to read Braille by shouting at it .
Javascript learning sites spend more time on simple logic and processes .
Stuff you will never really do on a website ( as you ’ll see below ) but it will get you into the scripting mindset and help you ease into the building blocks that will creep into every script you work with .
Let ’s take a look at two ‘ learning ’ Javascript sites .
I do n’t know where this site came from or remember how I found it , but I constantly reference Tizag for many of their tutorials .
They are straightforward and direct , but move through the topic in a way that makes it easy to understand .
Their lessons are n’t too long , giving you just enough to take out and test before returning for the next lesson .
This site is a step up from the rest in teaching you Javascript ( or anything for that matter ) and there ’s one really simple reason why – they let you try it for yourself right there in the tutorial .
A lot of people do n’t like learning from books because you ca n’t try it for yourself ; that is unless , of course , you find some ridiculous way to prop the book up against your monitor , so you can read it without holding it open and type all at once , but that ’s not very conducive to being able to focus on the script at hand .
About.com offers premium advice and tutorials on just about anything for free .
It ’s pretty much to a multi-information oriented site .
Fortunately , here you ’ll be able to find a variety of tutorials and workshops focused on begginer to advanced JavaScript users .
The Academic Tutorials site is very similar to the W3 schools learning center .
It provides extensive and well organized facts on JavaScript .
You will also find yourself with more hands - on experience than you thought , since almost every tutorial has various examples .
This site contains front - line examples and begginer JavaScript experiences for the novice of users .
Tutorials showcase several useful scripts and images that aid you in the advancement of your skills as a designer .
Walk Before You Can Run
Let ’s try it ourselves !
In Javascript , the word ‘ document ’ refers to the current page .
The word ‘ write ’ allows me to write text on the page .
In the majority of cases , your scripts will be included in a script tag – this is how the browser identifies that you ’ve switched gears .
It ’s just like the style tag , but it happens whenever you need javascript ( even in the body tag ) and uses a type of text / javascript instead of the more familiar text / css .
So , if I wanted to build a script to put my name on the screen it would look like this …
document.write ( “ My name is Matt ” ) ;
It ’s that simple – as you learn more , you ’ll do more impressive things , but , hey , we all have to start somewhere , right ?
Consider ‘ document.write ’ like the fast food job you had in high school .
It ’s probably not something you will impress your friends with , but once you ’re an investment banker , you ’ll look back on it with nostalgia .
Head out to w3schools.com , get into their Javascript tutorial , and choose the first example – use this and build your first script for yourself !
Replace the text with whatever text you want , or add additional ‘ document . write ’ commands to put more text in your page .
Subtleties of JS
Keep in mind that Javascript is like an oompa loompa in your web factory – its not building the page , its helping you build the code .
So , when you put text on the screen , the script you wrote is not putting text directly on the screen … its putting text in the code , and the browser is displaying it as it normally would .
Do n’t believe me ?
Try this :
Add a second ‘ document.write ’ command .
You should notice that the two pieces of text follow directly after one another on your webpage .
Now , between the “ quotes ” where your text is , add HTML tags .
Add a paragraph tag on each command .
You should have something like this :
document.write ( " < p> My name is Matt </ p > " ) ; document.write ( " < p > This is my first script </ p > " ) ;
Because the Javascript will write this directly into the code , you can use things like HTML tags because the browser will be able to interpret and display them !
As you get to more and more complicated topics , the value of being able to code alongside the tutorials on w3schools.com will be invaluable to your ability to learn Javascript fast and feel comfortable doing so .
Put It to Use
The best way to motivate yourself is to see what you could do if you put the time into learning Javascript .
While there are a ton of ways to enhance your HTML , I ’ve included some tutorials and demos below that will show you how Javascript can play nice with your CSS to create some pretty impressive results , relying a lot on your current skill to help enhance the Javascript you are learning .
As you learn Javascript , you should know about suckerfish dropdowns .
Essentially , these dropdowns use a lightweight combination of both CSS and Javascript to create accessible menus that can be used to add additional links to your navigation .
What ’s interesting about this is that the Javascript is literally adding a class to the elements – so , think about it like this – you ’ve set up a class that determines a specific look and feel … but Javascript plays the role in ‘ invoking ’ that class – creative uses of such a trick like this could yield some very interesting results .
Here it is being used to apply hover effects to specific elements , but the application of this technique could be limitless .
You probably already know that you can use alternate style sheets on a page , but did n’t know how to switch them on the fly – Javascript will help you do this .
If you had different colored themes that you wanted your users to be able to customize , you could use Javascript to switch between the two .
You could even get creative – create a different theme for different times of day ( morning , day , night ) and display a stylesheet based on the user ’s local time .
This tutorial from CSS - Tricks shows us a way that we can use Javascript to change the way we are highlighting active fields in forms .
So , generally , the cursor blinks in that form field , and some browsers have taken it upon themselves to do something a little different , but this tutorial takes a look at how we can use Javascript and jQuery to improve the highlighting with a little style .
This tutorial will show you how to create a group of collapsible folders using JavaScript and some elements of JQuery .
The code will be featured in a way that allows for ease of implementation into a dynamic page — in this situation , the number of folders may be unknown .
Within this tutorial you ’ll be able to walk through the configuration and structuring of a javascript based progress bar that can be triggered by a variety of things .
For example , you could have it triggered by the progress of a sign - up sheet , or even by the amount of checkboxes that are checked .
This tutorial will aid you in creating a registration form that includes a password strength checker to tell the user how strong ( security wise ) their password is .
This form will also include several boxes for password use and other vital information .
The End of Our Road – Javascript Frameworks
j Query is what is called a ‘ Framework ’ .
Frameworks contain sets of pre-written controls which make it easier and more efficient for you to develop your scripts .
Instead of rewriting the same basic scripts over and over , or managing your own library , javascript frameworks such as jQuery , prototype , script.aculo.us , mootools , and others exist to save you the time .
In most cases , these frameworks are extended in ways that add more functionality .
Unfortunately , a complete discussion on Javascript frameworks comparing the functions included in each is a discussion for another time , but its something to know is out there .

From Countdown Aug. 3 , 2009 , Keith 's Special Comment on health care reform .
Michael Moore wrote this today about the Special Comment :
It is nothing short of brilliant -- and if all of America were to hear what he is going to reveal tonight , we are certain the vast majority of Americans would be on the phone to their elected representative immediately , calling for an end to the private , for - profit , rip - off health insurance companies who have wrecked our country .
Olbermann writes :
Tonight I will present what I believe is the longest Special Comment I have ever aired , naming names and citing dollar amounts to call out the politicians -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- who are paid by the Health Care Monopolies to bring to life one of my favorite quotes , the observation of the Belgian essayist Maurice Maeterlinck ...
Some of the highlights .
PBS pointed out that the health and insurance industries are spending more than a million , 400 thousand dollars a day , just to destroy the " public option " - the truly non-profit , wieldy , round - up and not round - down , government , from helping you pay your medical bills with about a billionth of the recklessness with which it is still paying Halliburton and its spinoffs to kill your kids .
And much of this money is going to , and through , Republicans .
But that 's the real point tonight .
Not all of it is going through Republicans ...

Congressman Mike Ross of Arkansas .
Leader of the Blue Dogs in the House .
You 're the guy demanding a guarantee that Reform wo n't add to the deficit .
I 'm guessing you forgot to demand that about , say , Iraq .
You 're a Democrat , you say , Congressman ?
You saw what Sandy Barham said ?
Sandy Barham is 62 years old , she 's got a bad heart , and she 's hoping her valves will hold together for three more years until Medicaid kicks in , because she can't afford insurance .
Not just for herself , mind you .
For her employees .
She needs the public option .
So do those six people who work at that restaurant of hers , Congressman Ross .
And why should you give a crap ?
Because Sandy Barham 's restaurant is the Broadway Railroad Café , and it is at 123 West First Street North in Prescott , Arkansas .
Prescott , Arkansas , Congressman Ross .
Your home town .
You are Sandy Barham 's congressman .
Hers , Sir. Not Blue Cross 's and Blue Shield 's , even if they do insure 75 percent of the state and they own you .
[.....]
I warn you all .
You were not elected to create a Democratic majority .
You were elected to restore this country .
You were not elected to serve the corporations and the trusts who the government has enabled for the last eight years .
You were elected to serve the people .
And if you fail to pass or support this legislation , the full wrath of the progressive and the moderate movements in this country will come down on your heads .
Explain yourselves not to me , but to them .
They elected you , and in the blink of an eye , they will replace you .
If you will behave as if you are Republicans - as if you are the pro
stitutes of our system - you will be judged as such .
And you will lose not merely our respect .
You will lose your jobs !
Every poll , every analysis , every vote , every region of this country supports health care reform , and the essential great leveling agent of a government - funded alternative to the unchecked duopoly of profiteering private insurance corporations .
We knew it , you knew it , everyone knew it : as soon as news of the sale broke , it was obvious that the Pirate Bay as we knew it would be no more .
And after a convoluted game of cat and mouse , in which big studios continued to sue the now nearly defunct site , while the new owner - to - be tried to secure the funding to actually purchase it , the story is now at its end : The Pirate Bay has been shut down by its ISP .
And as much as this piece of information would have caused a huge upset a couple of months ago , now it is likely to go fairly quietly , as most users have already moved on to other BitTorrent trackers .
Internet dinosaurs , such as myself , have seen this before : Napster , OiNK , Suprnova .
Essentially , nothing has really changed as far as piracy goes ; when it comes to the sense of actual defiance to certain established ideas of how copyright laws and regulations should be upheld , unfortunately , The Pirate Bay will be sorely missed .
The Teyjus system is an efficient implementation of the higher - order logic programming language Lambda Prolog .
The main strength of Lambda Prolog , a language developed by Dale Miller and Gopalan Nadathur , is the support it offers for what is known as lambda tree syntax , a new and effective way to view the structure of complex syntactic objects such as types , formulas , proofs and programs .
Lambda Prolog provides this support by using lambda terms as data representation devices and by including primitives for probing such terms in logically meaningful ways .
The new features present in the language raise several implementation challenges that have been addressed in collaborative work between Nadathur and his students and colleagues .
The name " Teyjus " actually stands both for a project and for a class of compiler and virtual machine based realizations of Lambda Prolog arising from the research carried out within this project .
Underlying the most recent version of the Teyjus system is a new and significantly improved virtual machine that has been designed by Xiaochu Qi as part of her doctoral dissertation work at the University of Minnesota .
This virtual machine extensively exploits a special form of higher - order unification known as pattern unification .

The long - disputed sale of Exempla Lutheran and Good Samaritan hospitals to Kansas - based Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health System has been settled , the parties announced today .
The sale makes Sisters of Charity the sole owner of the hospitals and means the hospitals will follow Catholic medical directives — no abortions , tubal ligations , vasectomies or a range of other reproductive - health services now available at the nonsectarian Lutheran and Good Samaritan hospitals .
The sale frees capital for Exempla to invest in improvements and expansions at the hospitals .
“ Our priority has been and remains to strengthen Exempla ’s ability to serve the Denver metropolitan community , and we welcome the opportunity to play a significant role in nurturing this vital local resource , ” Kenneth Eggeman , president and chief executive of Community First Foundation , said in a press release .
When the transfer is final , the Exempla system will be governed by a new board of directors , with Community First Foundation and Sisters of Charity each appointing an equal number of directors .
Exempla Inc. runs Lutheran in Wheat Ridge and Good Samaritan in Lafayette , as well as the Sisters of Charity hospital , St. Joseph in Denver .
Last year , Sisters of Charity , a co-sponsor of the three - hospital Exempla Healthcare System , offered $ 311 million for sole control to its co-sponsor , the Arvada - based nonprofit Community First Foundation .
The foundation was once the fundraising arm of Lutheran Medical Center but became co-sponsor of the Exempla system in 1997 when all agreed to consolidate the hospitals ’ management to save money .
There is no money attached to the sale , but Sisters of Charity plans to infuse money into Exempla Healthcare after the new board prioritizes the system ’s needs .
The Exempla board had opposed the transfer , saying Community First did n’t have the right to sell its stake .

Stack Overflow has been going nuts — after just six months in business , we ’ve had 3.5 million unique visitors per month .
We ’ve starting thinking about how to get that great tribe of developers together in the real world .
We decided to launch a series of Stack Overflow events : the first gathering of the tribe of great developers making Stack Overflow so successful that over 90 % of questions get answered
.
It ’s going to be in October , in five ten separate cities .
In each city , we ’re planning a one - day event .
We decided to cram as many diverse topics as possible into a single day event .
Like a tasting menu at a great restaurant , we ’ll line up six great speakers in each city .
This is not going to be just a Java conference or a .NET conference or a Ruby conference .
This will be completely ecumenical .
We ’ll have somebody to introduce Microsoft ’s new web framework , ASP .
NET MVC , but we ’ll also get someone to talk about writing code for Google ’s new mobile operating system , Android .
And in each city , we ’ll find one local computer science professor or graduate student to tell us about something new and interesting in academia .
For smart programmers who are interested in learning about something a little bit outside of their own immediate field , this is the conference for you .
We ’re doing it in the spirit of Byte Magazine .
Remember Byte ?
Every issue covered a wide range of topics and technologies .
Sadly , Byte disappeared , to be replaced by Mac - only magazines , IBM - PC only magazines , even Microsoft SQL Server - only magazines .
The conference is for programmers .
The conversation is going to be hard core .
Speakers are going to be writing code .
Putting on these conferences is really expensive — conference centers can charge you $ 1000 for one urn of coffee .
That ’s why typical developer conferences can cost $ 1500 , plus travel , hotel , and $ 73 for the Internet access in your hotel room .
With the current worldwide recession , that just is n’t gonna fly .
Many great conferences , like SD West , have been cancelled .
Attendance is way down at the conferences that survive .
So I got together with Ryan Carson , whose company , Carsonified , has been putting on great conferences like FOWA , and we tried to figure out how little we could possibly charge for this thing .
The answer : $ 99 per attendee .
That ’s it .
These one day conferences are just $ 99 .
You can bring your whole team for less than the cost of a normal conference .
We ’re doing it in five cities , so you may not even have to travel .
We ’ve got room for just 300 developers in each city :
October 19 San Francisco SOLD OUT
October 21 Seattle SOLD OUT
October 23 Toronto SOLD OUT
October 26 Washington , DC SOLD OUT
October 28 London SOLD OUT Update !
Due to popular demand , we ’ve added five more cities : October 7 Boston
October 14 Austin
October 16 Los Angeles
October 30 Cambridge , UK
November 2 Amsterdam
Register for Stack Overflow DevDays right now .
Given the huge demand and the limited number of tickets , I expect all five cities will sell out pretty much instantly .
OK , here ’s the FAQ :
Who will be speaking ?
I ’ll be speaking in every city .
Jeff Atwood will appear in San Francisco only .
We will line up about six speakers in every city .
What will be the topics ?
The topics have n’t been nailed down yet and depend on speaker availability .
I ’ll do my best to get speakers on as many of the following topics as possible :
Android
Objective C and iPhone development
Google App Engine
Python
jQuery
ASP.NET MVC
FogBugz 7.0
Mercurial and Distributed Version Control
Each talk will be fairly introductory but will be intended for advanced developers .
If you already know about a topic , say , iPhone development , you can wander outside and hang out with the other iPhone developers in the hallways .
Is this the same in every city ?
Not exactly .
Some topics will be repeated — my talk will be the same in all five cities — but we may not have the exact same topics and speakers in each city .
We aim to have at least one local speaker in each city .
I ’m hungry !
Me too .
I ’m always hungry .
Breakfast , lunch , and afternoon tea are included in the price of the ticket .
Half of the fun of this conference will be meeting other Stack Overflow members .
Where are the events ?
We have n’t booked halls yet .
The exact location will be announced .
There is a small chance we may have to adjust a date a little bit if we have trouble booking a space .
Note :
If your company is in one of these cities , and has a presentation space that is suitable for 300 people , we ’d love to have you as a sponsor .
Please email devdays@stackoverflow.com .
What should I wear ?
Make a T - shirt with your StackOverflow identity and reputation ( see sample at right ) .
You can order them here or make your own .
Are there academic discounts ?
There are a very limited number of subsidized student tickets at $ 10 .
Due to the cost of putting on the event , I regret that there are only a limited number of student tickets in each city .
How can I help ?
Ah !
Thank you for asking .
We need lots of help to pull this all together .
We need volunteers in each city .
If you live in one of these five cities , and would be able to help check tickets and just generally be useful during the conference , please email devdays@stackoverflow.com .
We need sponsors for the meals and breaks .
If your company would like to be a sponsor , please email devdays@stackoverflow.com .
This is a great way to recruit superstar programmers : sponsors will have the opportunity to set up recruiting booths at the conference .
I have more questions .
That figures .
Email them to ( you guessed it ) devdays@stackoverflow.com and Natasha at Carsonified will get back to you .

Facebook was not taken completely offline by the attack A " massively co-ordinated " attack on websites including Google , Facebook and Twitter was directed at one individual , it has been confirmed .
Facebook told BBC
News that the strike was aimed at a pro-Georgian blogger known as Cyxymu .
The attack caused a blackout of Twitter for around two hours , while Facebook said its service had been " degraded " .
Google said it had defended its sites and was now working with the other companies to investigate the attack .
" [ The ] attack appears to be directed at an individual who has a presence on a number of sites , rather than the sites themselves , " a Facebook spokesman told BBC News .
" Specifically , the person is an activist blogger and a botnet was directed to request his pages at such a rate that it impacted service for other users . "
Botnets are networks of computers under the control of hackers .
The machines were used to mount a so - called denial - of - service ( DOS ) attack on Thursday .
DOT .LIFE BLOG
' Up is down , left is right and black is white , ' a chief security researcher told me .
' These attacks do not make sense '
Read Maggie Shiels blog DOS attacks take various forms but often involve a company 's servers being flooded with data in an effort to disable them .
" Attacks such as this are malicious efforts orchestrated to disrupt and make unavailable services such as online banks , credit card payment gateways and , in this case , Twitter , for intended customers or users , " wrote Twitter co-founder Biz Stone on his blog .
Writing on his blog , Graham Cluley of security firm Sophos said : " This raises the astonishing thought that a vendetta against a single user caused Twitter to crumble , forcing us to ask serious questions about the site 's fragility . "
Silencing tactic
It is still not known who perpetrated the attack or why they may have targeted Cyxymu and his accounts .
However , in an interview with the UK's Guardian newspaper , the blogger blamed Russia .
Twitter updated users via a status page " Maybe it was carried out by ordinary hackers but I 'm certain the order came from the Russian government , " he said .
The blogger has previously criticised Russia over its conduct in the war over the disputed South Ossetia region , which began one year ago .
A previous statement by Facebook said that the attack on the websites where he held accounts was " to keep his voice from being heard " .
Other sites such as Live Journal , where Cyxymu has his blog , were also targeted in the attack on Thursday .
Only Google seems to have escaped unscathed from the attack .
" Google systems prevented substantive impact to our services , " the company said in a statement .
The company has not confirmed which services were targeted in the attack , but it is thought that its e-mail service Gmail and video site YouTube were under fire .
" We are aware that a handful of non-Google sites were impacted by [ an ] ... attack this morning , and are in contact with some affected companies to help investigate this attack , " the company said .
Protest tool
All of the affected services were keen to stress that users ' data had not been put at risk in the attacks .
" Please note that no user data was compromised in this attack , " wrote Twitter 's Biz Stone .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" This activity is about saturating a service with so many requests that it cannot respond to legitimate requests thereby denying service to intended customers or users . "
Twitter has had a meteoric rise since its launch in 2006 .
A ComScore study suggests that Twitter had about 45 million users worldwide as of June 2009 .
However , as many users interact with the service through mobile phones or third - party software , the actual number of users is likely to be higher .
However , that pales in comparison to Facebook , which claims to have 250 m active users worldwide .
Both sites recently garnered worldwide attention when they were used by Iranians to co-ordinate demonstrations following the disputed election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president .
Many protesters believed there was electoral fraud and that opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi should have won .
Twitter chose to delay upgrade work during the protests to allow communication to continue .
In a BBC interview , co-founder Evan Williams denied the move had been a response to a US state department request .

If you did n't watch Rachel Maddow 's debate with Pat Buchanan Thursday night , you missed an outstanding display of corporate media - financed white supremacy .
Pat Buchanan repeated the same exhausting argument that Judge Sotomayor is unqualified for the Supreme Court and therefore does n't deserve the nomination -- in fact , she 's been elevated , in Pat 's estimation , based solely on race and not intellect .
He said to Rachel :
I do n't think Judge Sotomayor is qualified for the United States Supreme Court .
She has not shown any great intellect here or any great depth of knowledge of the Constitution .
She 's never written anything that I 've read in terms of a law review article or a major book or something like that on the law .
Oh .
So qualifications are suddenly important to Pat .
While pissing all over Judge Sotomayor 's qualifications , judicial record , accomplishments and achievements , Pat Buchanan thinks Sarah Palin ! is qualified to be President of the United States .
Sarah Palin -- who could n't accurately describe the duties of the vice president during a nationally televised vice presidential debate .
Remember this ?
I 'm thankful the Constitution would allow a bit more authority given to the vice president if that vice president so chose to exert it in working with the Senate and making sure that we are supportive of the president 's policies and making sure too that our president understands what our strengths are .
Sarah Palin -- a politician who 's less intellectually curious than George W. Bush , has less experience and fewer credentials than the worst president in American history .
And Pat Buchanan thinks she 's the best Republican ever .
Presidential material .
But Judge Sotomayor is intellectually unqualified for the Supreme Court , right ?
And Sarah Palin is qualified for the highest office in the land .
What conclusion can we draw from this inconsistency ?
Easy .
Pat Buchanan hates brown people .
Read his latest awful editorial and tell me this is n't true .
If he does n't hate brown people , he simply , then , believes white males are far superior in almost every way ( to be fair , he admits to Maddow that blacks can run fast ) .
He continues by complaining that white people are being discriminated against and this is a terrible crime .
What Pat Buchanan will never admit is that for every one Frank Ricci , there are literally thousands of Americans with dark skin or " exotic " names who are being held back or punished or imprisoned for no other reason than their race or ethnicity .
It 's been that way for hundreds of years here .
This naturally does n't make discrimination against white people " okay . "
In an imperfect system , though , correcting our massive racial imbalance means that , unfortunately , a few Frank Ricci types fall through the cracks .
But if people like Pat Buchanan would embrace the spirit of correcting the imbalance , we'd be able to fix these cracks .
Ultimately , however , Pat Buchanan is an old white man who is clinging desperately -- and desperately is the appropriate adverb -- to the past , as Rachel pointed out .
He fears the inevitable browning of America and so he 's lashing out more and more often with this venomous , divisive , hate - mongering language .
The serious question here is whether MSNBC will continue to finance his clearly white supremacist views .
If there 's anyone in America who does n't deserve more air time , it 's people like Pat Buchanan .
They had their time and they failed .
Their reign was destructive and a blight on American history .
They have no place in the discourse anymore .
Time to step aside , Pat .
For the good of the country .

The headlines will tell you there are at least 85 sharia courts in Britain .
There are definitely more and they have little to do with gavels and wigs and more to do with upholding the cultural and tribal status quo in communities .
Having been on the receiving end of sharia rulings – I must make it clear that sharia courts are often nothing of the sort and are more likely to be an imam at the end of a phone – I can speak about the arbitrary and random nature of these bodies .
Contrary to popular belief , there is no central network , no supreme sharia judge , no sharia bar , no sharia AGM , no sharia ombudsman , no sharia HQ and no torts .
Sharia law is n't even written down and most Muslims will dip in and out of it when it suits them .
They might be very particular about getting a sharia compliant mortgage but ignore the advice on archery and wrestling .
Sharia courts / tribunals / whatever rarely have offices ( although they may have websites ) and they 're certainly not in the habit of swapping notes for best practice .
It 's a bad comparison but the fluid , almost nebulous nature of sharia courts is like al - Qaeda without the violence and their ubiquity like a Domino 's Pizza franchise .
Any topping as long as it's halal .
Sharia is so abstract , yet so everyday , it 's hard to ban , ( sorry Denis ) and you can't really adopt it either because much of it is at odds with British law and society in general ( sorry Rowan ) .
It tells Muslims how to live their lives in almost exhaustive detail .
It spans everything from hair removal to jihad .
To ban sharia law in the UK would involve banning imams – and we do n't know how many of those there are – and to deprogramme Muslims to stop their default setting being Channel Sharia .
You would also have to block websites and cut off access to phone lines and shut down mosques .
There are plenty of people on this site who might like to see that happen .
But I will leave that article to someone else .
When my father died , my mother decided that , although under British law she was entitled to everything , she wanted to settle things according to Islamic law so she could " die with a clear conscience " .
She asked my brother to call an imam .
The imam said my brothers would get twice the share of my sister and I and so on .
On learning that my father had a son by a previous marriage , the imam said my half brother must also have a share in my dad 's estate .
So , a man who is a stranger to us tells us that another man who is a stranger to us is entitled to a stake in our family home , where we have lived for 25 years and he has never set foot in .
The story about my half - brother is a complicated one and best left alone .
But he – according to sharia – is entitled to more of a share than my sister and me .
His claim would never stand up in a British court – he is not a citizen so I do n't know how he would contest it – but in this case sharia law overrides British law .
In another case , my friend 's husband died several years ago .
They were not married under British law , just Islamic law .
Upon his death she was unable to prove they were married – he was the father of her children and they shared a home – and no imam or sharia body was able to come to her assistance .
Sharia law , in this instance too , was found sorely lacking in common sense and justice .
Had she married under civil law the ghastly practicalities that follow a death might have been less protracted and there might have been less anxiety about the security of her family .
Had he been alive and had she chosen to divorce , her only remedy would have been a sharia divorce .
But there would have been an almighty tussle over the kids , not to mention enormous family pressure from both sides to stay with him .
Ultimately , from my own experiences and from those of my friends , sharia is driven by the needs of a community rather than an individual .
Whatever the protestations of its fans , this system of law does not favour women or local custom .
While it is impossible to outlaw it , a better and more realistic solution would be to educate people about the advantages of British law , which , while it has its flaws , is more developed and grounded in reality and fairness .
It may not be the first to come up with the bright idea of putting Android on a desk phone - esque device , but upstart Could Telecomputers may well be the most ambitious , with it boasting that its new Glass platform " makes the desk phone relevant again , " and is " smarter and more powerful than your ' smart cell phone . ' "
To that end , the company has basically paired a full - fledged , 8 - inch Android - based MID with a plain old corded phone , which will let you do things like dial numbers directly from your Outlook address book , pair up a cellphone via Bluetooth and , of course , take advantage of a whole range of Android apps that should put most other internet - connected desk phones to shame .
As you probably picked up , however , this is still a platform and not an actual product just yet , but Cloud Telecomputers does have some pretty heavy backers behind it , and it " anticipates " that the first phones should be available sometime in the first quarter of 2010 for between $ 599 and $ 699 .

Italian Herb Rub Salt
Pin 185 193 Shares
In spite of the appearance of these herbs , above , I assure you they ’re perfectly legit .
No , I did n’t open up my Pink Floyd double - album to remove any seeds .
And no , I was n’t listening to The Moody Blues at full - volume on my headphones hoping my mom would n’t smell anything funny coming from my bedroom , like when I was a teenager and took precautions by rolling up a towel and pushing it against the bottom of the door .
I ’ve left all that behind , and now that I ’m a law - abiding adult , I get my rush cooking , and this is my ‘ stash . ’
My friend Judy in Tuscany showed me how to make this easy herb mixture and it ’s so good , and versatile , that I now make it frequently .
It ’s a vibrant mixture of fresh rosemary and sage , chopped up with fragrant garlic and coarse salt , then dried .
To make this Tuscan herbed salt , take a very large bunch of fresh sage and pick the leaves off .
Then take a large bunch of rosemary and strip off the oily leaves of those .
A good proportion is about 2 to 3 parts sage leaves to 1 part rosemary .
Then take about 8 small peeled garlic cloves and a heaping tablespoon of coarse salt ( I use grey salt from Brittany ) then chop it all up until the herbs are very fine , as shown .
Discard any sticks or seeds .
Spread the chopped mixture on a baking sheet and let it dry for about three days .
( Hint : Do n’t keep it near an open window where there might be a breeze .
It would be a total bummer if you wasted your stash . )
Once dry , store your Tuscan herbed salt in a tightly - sealed in a jar .
I use it as an instant rub over poultry , tuna filets , and meat ; since I always have some on hand , it ’s simple to mix with some good olive oil and rub in well before roasting .
You can also mix some in a bowl of olive oil to use as a dipping sauce , too .

Mr Netanyahu has refused US demands for a freeze on settlement construction Israel 's foreign ministry has recalled one of its senior diplomats after he criticised his government for harming ties with the United States .
Nadav Tamir , consul - general in Boston , will travel to Jerusalem next week to give " clarification " to the ministry .
In an internal memo , Mr Tamir wrote that public clashes with Washington over settlement construction were " causing strategic damage to Israel " .
The government said he had violated protocol by expressing political views .
The three - page document , entitled " Sad thoughts on Israel - US relations " , was leaked to Israel 's Channel 10 TV .
" The way in which we are conducting the relationship with the US government is causing Israel strategic damage .
The distance created between us and the Obama administration has clear implications on Israeli deterrence , " Mr Tamir wrote .
There are people in US and Israeli politics who ideologically oppose Obama , and are willing to sacrifice the special relationship between the two countries in order to advance their political agenda
Memo by Nadav Tamir Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected President Barack Obama 's demand for a freeze on settlement construction , saying their " natural growth " had to be allowed .
All settlements are illegal under international law , though Israel disputes this .
More than 450,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank , including East Jerusalem .
Mr Tamir said in his memo that narrow political considerations were contributing to the deterioration of bilateral ties .
" There are people in US and Israeli politics who ideologically oppose Obama , and are willing to sacrifice the special relationship between the two countries in order to advance their political agenda . "
The " atmosphere of confrontation " , he warned , was alienating the US public and putting the Jewish community in a difficult position .
" Many of them are distancing themselves from the state of Israel because of this conflict , " he wrote .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has reportedly demanded to know how Mr Tamir 's letter was leaked to the media .

NZ needs to address boys ’ education concerns
Media Release
NZ needs to address boys ’ education concerns
New Zealand is behind the eight ball when it comes to addressing concerns over boys ’ education in schools .
That ’s according to Auckland - based teachers Alison Derbyshire and Nicola Agnew , who are spreading the word on their findings of research into boys ’ education .
Their research shows there is a significant gender gap in students ’ achievement , especially in literacy - based subjects such as English .
Latest statistics from the 2008 NCEA results support their claim , with girls outperforming boys at every senior level .
Nicola Agnew says New Zealand is also lagging behind when it comes to the amount of money being pumped into boys ’ education .
“ We really are behind the eight ball when it comes to the way boys learn .
It is quite frightening when you compare us to other nations , ” she says .
The pair will talk about strategies to help raise achievement and reduce barriers at the annual New Zealand School Trustees Association conference being held at the Skycity Auckland Convention Centre from July 3 - 5 .
“ The Ministry of Education has set up a boys ’ education website and there is an ERO booklet on best practice for boys , but it ’s nothing like what ’s going on in other countries , ” says Ms Derbyshire .
Australia , for example , has spent $ 19.4 m on boys ’ initiatives through its Success for Boys project , she says .
In New Zealand , Alison Derbyshire says boys will continue to achieve below their potential until schools accept that they learn differently from girls and look at initiatives to help them .
“ Some schools and some teachers just say boys need to focus more , but it ’s not about that .
They are different , they do learn differently and schools just need to accept that . ”
The pair hope their attempt to raise awareness of boys ’ issues will see boards of trustees and schools sit up and take notice .
They say boards of trustees must be open minded and encourage professional development , to allow staff to learn what they can do in the classroom to make it more boy - friendly .
“ It ’s about sitting back and looking at ways you can change the school environment to help boys thrive , ” says Alison Derbyshire .
“ One of the major things is understanding that there is a difference between boys and girls - girls naturally lean to the “ read and write ” way of learning , or the verbal and oral centres of the brain , whereas boys are much more spatially - orientated .
“ They ’re still capable of learning exactly the same things as girls , it ’s just about offering them different opportunities in the classroom , like allowing movement , ” she says .
“ I spent my first year of teaching telling boys off for swinging on chairs but now I encourage it - they ’re actually trying to keep themselves switched on .
“ You ca n’t see it as a way that boys are trying to be naughty , they love the movement and that ’s what keeps them going and focused . ”
Another key strategy is giving short specific instructions rather than a long list of instructions .
“ Capture boys ’ attention by making things relevant to them , always set high expectations and keep to them , and make sure there are always fair and consistent consequences for bad behaviour .
They are more likely to thrive in those situations .
“ Often if they ’re not catered to , boys get restless in class or unfocused and that ’s when they start doing things which get them into trouble . ”
Having implemented numerous initiatives in their own school , Ms Derbyshire says early indications are positive .
“ Boys are getting more books out of the library , they are getting more involved in leadership positions , more boys are having a visual presence around the school and we have very low stand - down rates . ”
The School Trustees Association conference will attract more than 650 trustees from all over the country .
It is based on the theme Effective governance : no excuses , no exceptions , high expectations .

11 . LUCIFER , THE LIBERATOR
Gnostic myths relate that Lucifer is the Messenger of the Unknowable God .
We had said that this God , the greatest one , unreachable and unknowable , is unable to penetrate this limited universe of impure and satanic matter .
But according to these myths , he can send someone , Lucifer .
Only with a supreme sacrifice can an incredibly Spiritual and pure being of antimatter fire break through into the infernal world of this universe .
According to Gnostic legends and myths , the great Unknowable God sent Lucifer , angel of indescribable fire and light , to show man the light and to help him wake up and see his true origin , the origin of his Spirit , which has been perversely imprisoned in this impure matter called body - soul .
He is an uncreated being , who came to the created world to bring Light : Liberating Gnosis .
The saving knowledge which can wake man up and help him free his imprisoned Spirit .
The knowledge which allows him to know who he truly is , why he is here in this world and what he has to do to liberate himself and fulfil his Spirit , which belongs to another uncreated and unknowable plane .
We have said that Lucifer came to the world to wake man up , to help him remember his divine origin , the divine origin of his Spirit , and to help him free himself from the body - soul in which he is trapped , and from created time and matter .
Gnostics consider that the biblical myth of creation can be explained as follows : the creator satan of the world trapped Adam and Eve in his miserable world , and Lucifer , in the form of a serpent , offered them the forbidden fruit of saving Gnosis , and showed them that the creator was deceiving them .
In other words , the creator said to man " but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat , for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die . "
On the other hand , the Serpent said " You will not surely die .
For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God , knowing good and evil . "
The bible continued : " And the eyes of both of them were opened " .
It does n't say " they both died " , it says " the eyes of both of them were opened " , like the Serpent had said .
Later , the creator says " And now man has become as one of us , to know good and evil " .
The creator lied .
He said that man would die if he ate the fruit , but man did not die .
The Serpent was telling the truth .
The creator himself ended up agreeing that the Serpent was right .
More precisely , Gnostics called the demiurge a liar as well as a plagiarizer .
For them , the entire creation is a failed attempt by the demiurge to imitate the unknowable world .
In this way , they think that the bible itself is a complete plagiarism , based principally on pre-biblical Babylonian and Egyptian texts .
Gnostics believe that this Serpent Lucifer is the liberator of man and the world .
It is wisdom , the liberating Gnosis that wakes man up and saves him .
Of course , this Messenger of the Unknowable God , Lucifer , is an opponent and an enemy of the creator of the world .
Gnosis states that the creator wants to keep man captive in this limited , inferior and impure sphere .
He also forbade man contact with the higher world , represented in the biblical myth by the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
But Lucifer , the Angel of Light , made a great sacrifice and descended into this satanic hell to give the forbidden fruit of Gnosis to man , and opened his eyes so that he would be able to remember his divine origin and his superiority in relation to the creator .
Gnostics consider that before the arrival of the Serpent in paradise , man was in a state of ignorance and was blind to his true situation .
They maintain that Adam and Eve were in a state of servitude until the Serpent Lucifer opened their eyes and fed them the fruit of knowledge , which made them remember their divine origin and become aware of the situation in which they found themselves .
Of course , the creator threw Adam and Eve out of this paradise in which he had placed them since he wanted them ( and still does ) to reflect him and be similar to him after his image and resemblance , and to carry out his precepts so as to be like him and not like the Unknowable God .
He wants the Spirit to stay asleep so he can take advantage of Its energy , preventing It from manifesting Itself in man and the world .
Lucifer , liberator of man and the world , has also been called Abaddon , the Exterminator .
But.exterminator of what ?
Exterminator of matter , because he abhors this created world of matter and time .
He would behave like a hostile antimatter force , extremely aggressive , because he hates all that has been created as he also hates the body and soul of man , since he belongs to the uncreated plane of the unknowable .
He is an exterminator , but an exterminator of matter , of the impure .
Such is the Gnostic legend of Lucifer .
Now we can go on to describe what uncreated entities exist in this created world .
Firstly , the Unknowable God , who is not in this world but who can infiltrate it with a tiny particle of Himself , a Messenger .
This Messenger is also uncreated , not having been created by the creator .
Secondly , the imprisoned Spirits of men , which also belong to the unknowable World of the uncreated and the eternal .
According to Gnosis all living beings have an uncreated Spiritual element enchained in their souls : the Spirit .
The Spirit locked within man is totally superior to that of animals , plants and other living beings .
The difference between man and the other living beings is very great , as is the difference between the Spirits imprisoned inside of them .
The Spirits of human beings are in an elevated Spiritual category .
Thirdly , another uncreated entity placed on this created plane is the saving and divine knowledge of Gnosis .
Knowledge that has come from outside , which has not been produced inside of this world .

Hey , guess what ?
I actually read a book !
You know , those things that are like really long Cracked articles but with like 80 percent less pictures of titties ?
Well I tried one of those , and it was pretty good .
In fact , it was fantastic !
You may have even heard of it .
It 's called the Holy Bible .
But while this book may indeed be the greatest story ever told , I looked around for a bit and I could n't find a single review of it .
Not one !
That 's just criminal .
This book deserves way more attention than it 's apparently getting , so while I may not have any of the credentials of a professional book critic -- much less the education , comprehension , vocabulary or moral equilibrium -- I 'm going to write up a quick review anyway .
The Holy Bible : A Book Review
" First God made heaven & earth .
The earth was without form and void , and darkness was upon the face of the deep ; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters .
And God said , " Let there be light " ; and there was light . "
With possibly one of the strongest opening lines in history , the Holy Bible really starts off swinging .
Here we 're not only introduced to the main character , named God , Â but are also informed that he 's some sort of magical being ( whether that 's a vampire or a wizard or something , we do n't know yet -- we just know he can fly and shoot laser beams ) .
The prose in this section is simply top notch , and you 'll find that the action , atmosphere and language of the Holy Bible are carried off with a master 's touch .
But accompanying this impressive show of skill is also one of the book 's greatest flaws : Verbosity .
One of the first things they teach you in any writer 's workshop is that every word in a novel should be integral to the story ; never leave anything in that does n't absolutely need to be there .
So , while we as readers start the book all sweeping through demons and darkness like Ronnie James Dio -- rocking out and firing lightbeams and building people out of dirt -- it all quickly gets bogged down in unnecessary detail .
As readers we 're enthralled by the mystic action ; wondering exactly what kind of creature this God is , why he has these powers and what on earth he 's going to do with them , and then all of a sudden we 're pulled out of the action and forced to sit idly while the author describes an entire week ( day by day ) in God 's life .
I mean , that 's great and all that we 're getting some backstory on his character , but honestly , what happened with paragliding through Hell ?
I do n't really care what your Wednesdays are like , or on which days you like to rest -- get back to the action !
Jesus , if we wanted to hear about your day , we would read your fucking LiveJournal , almighty .
It ’s been about 30 years since schoolchildren in Somerville created the artwork for a series of tiles - crudely drawn sailboats , rail cars , and clowns - that now adorn the Davis Square T station ’s brick entrance wall .
Many commuters walk by without a pause .
But a group of community arts organizers believes these 249 tiles tell the story of a neighborhood that has changed as much as any in Greater Boston in the 25 years since Davis Square got its own subway stop along the MBTA ’s Red Line .
In April , members of the Davis Square Tiles Project began an effort to track down the people - now probably between 35 and 45 years old - who created the artwork to find out how their lives have changed and how they view the changes in their old neighborhood .
They want to tell the collective story of the community ’s gentrification , with all the complexity and individuality that it entails , and start another conversation about the changes that may come when the Green Line extends into new neighborhoods in Somerville , and Medford over the next five years .
The work in progress , posted on www.davissquaretilesproject.com, is something like a reverse time capsule - coupling the ageless artwork of children with the words , insights , and in some cases photographs of the adults they grew into .
“ How many people walk by those tiles and think they were made by some third - grader this year ? ’’ said Sabino Lagattolla .
Lagattolla , who drew a sailing ship under a beaming yellow sun when he was in second grade , is now a 38 - year - old network engineer , living in Hudson with a wife , two children , and another baby due in November .
He visits his old hometown with his family , to soak up the past and to stock up on steak at McKinnon ’s Meat Market .
Lagattolla ’s personal history echoes parts of the neighborhood ’s transition from blue - collar working - class families to postgrad hipsters wearing pork pie hats in search of craft beers .
His father was a pipe fitter , his mother a seamstress .
They all moved to Somerville from Southern Italy in 1972 .
Lagatolla remembers the community ’s ills - the drug problems that plagued some of his neighbors - and a tight - knit spirit that allowed him to ride 15 blocks on his bicycle without worrying his mother .
He only regrets that he could not afford to take over the house he grew up in when his father died in 2000 .
Most motorcycle design is a compromise between function and form .
To our eyes , vintage scrambler - style motorcycles have a head start : road bikes that can also tackle loose gravel and light off - road work are often pleasing from an aesthetic point of view .
Unfortunately , Triumph has never quite got it right with its own Scrambler , unless the machine has been lightly modified .
And although Moto Morini offers its own stunningly good Scrambler , you ’ll be lucky to find a dealer .
But now the BMW accessories specialist Touratech has reworked the BMW F 800 R naked bike , and created what could be the definitive modern scrambler — the Touratech “ Streetline F 800 ScrambleR ” .
The finishing touches are still to be added to this bike , but the wraps came off at last month ’s BMW Motorrad Days in Bavaria .

Mason Tvert , executive director of SAFER ( Safer Alternative For Enjoyable Recreation ) , which ran a successful 2005 campaign to legalize possession of up to one ounce of marijuana in Denver , has long been the merry prankster of Colorado weed activists -- a prankster who knows how to have serious impact .
When photos surfaced of Governor Bill Ritter 's son hitting the booze at a governor 's mansion party , Tvert and his posse threw a media - grabbing kegger on the mansion lawn to prove the point that the encouragement of alcohol but not pot was a total party foul .
He was also responsible for arguably the most successful billboard that never actually existed :
In 2005 , as part of the Denver pot legalization campaign , SAFER proposed a billboard celebrating Miami Dolphins running back Ricky Williams , who 'd been suspended for marijuana use .
The billboard attracted national attention -- even though Tvert never actually put it up .
Now Tvert , with the help of two other pot activists , has distilled his central argument into book form -- Marijuana is Safer : So Why Are We Driving People to Drink ? -- and , true to style , he 's found a way to upend the publishing industry .
Yesterday , Marijuana is Safer hit number 14 on Amazon 's bestselling book list , beating out heavyweights like Malcolm Gladwell 's Outliers and the newest installment of the Twilight saga -- even though Tvert 's straight - to - paperback tome wo n't actually be released until September 15 .
The secret to Tvert 's success was a little something he cooked up called " The Great Marijuana Book Bomb of 2009 , " in which as many people as possible flooded Amazon.com with orders for the book to boost it up the charts .
It 's just another token Tvert move to attract attention to his cause -- though he would have preferred the event be on 4/20 instead of 8/20 .
The book 's official launch transpires this Sunday at a blow - out at 8 Rivers Café , 1550 Blake Street , from 2 to 5 p.m .
Tvert will also be reading from the book at Tattered Cover downtown , 1628 16th Street , at 7:30 p.m. on August 31 , and at the Boulder Book Store , 1107 Pearl Street , at 7:30 p.m. on September 1 .
If you go , be warned : With Tvert in full effect , things are bound to get interesting .
You were probably too busy shielding your eyes the first time , but if you actually rewatch Quentin Tarantino 's ear - slicing scene — you know , the one where Michael Madsen 's psychotic Mr. Blonde struts around to '' Stuck in the Middle With You ' ' and douses a cop hostage with gasoline — you might be shocked at just how much is n't shown .
The camera pans away during the worst of it .
Ironically , that just makes the whole thing that much more unbearable .

The Law of Non-Contradiction : New Philosophical Essays , edited by Graham Priest , JC Beall , and Bradley Armour - Garb , is dedicated to dialetheism -- the view that some contradictions are true ( a state of affairs known as a dialetheia ) .
Since dialetheism has , in recent years , scrounged its way from being a view easily defeated by the dreaded incredulous stare to being a major ( but still sometimes ignored ) contender in the contest for an adequate logical account of the semantic and set - theoretic paradoxes ( or an adequate logical theory in general ) , the volume is to be commended merely for its existence .
The fact that it contains , not just a number of good philosophers taking this view seriously , but also a lot of seriously good philosophy increases its worth .
Since the volume weighs in at over four hundred pages and contains twenty - three distinct , and very different , essays , it is impossible to do full justice to its contents here .
Thus , I will merely outline the contents , pausing at appropriate points for a deeper discussion of a few of the more interesting issues .
The volume begins with an excellent introduction by JC Beall .
In fewer than twenty pages Beall manages to : ( 1 ) introduce the reader to the idea that contradictions might be true and motivate this initially outlandish idea in terms of common paradoxes ; ( 2 ) survey the problems with various definitions of " contradiction " and how they affect our formulation of the dialetheist thesis ; ( 3 ) explain the distinction between a proposition being a ( formal ) contradiction ( a syntactic notion , involving something like being , or being equivalent to , a proposition of the form P∧¬ P ) and a proposition being ' explosive ' ( an inferential notion , involving the proposition entailing every other proposition ) ; ( 4 ) explain the difference between merely paraconsistent logics ( in which contradictions such as P∧¬ P are not explosive ) and dialethic logics such as Priest 's LP ( which allow for the truth of propositions of the form P∧¬ P ) ; ( 5 ) present a model theory for the most common dialethic logic , the aforementioned LP ; and ( 6 ) discuss the various philosophical ramifications tied up with ( 1 ) through ( 5 ) .
As a survey of a difficult subject , Beall 's introduction is a tour - de - force and should be required reading for anyone interested in true contradictions or the philosophy of logic more generally .
The first section of the volume , Setting Up the Debate , contains but one paper -- Graham Priest 's " What 's So Bad About Contradictions ? "
( The only reprint , this paper shows the subtle lie in the subtitle of the volume .
Of course , perhaps the dialetheist can believe that Priest 's paper both is and is not new . )
This paper does not attempt to provide a positive defense of dialetheism ( although the view 's various theoretical virtues are mentioned along the way ) .
Instead , Priest attempts to defuse the five most prevalent objections to dialetheism : ( 1 ) Contradictions Entail Everything ( answer : not in an appropriate logic , such as LP ) ; ( 2 ) Contradictions Cannot Be True ( answer : logical arguments for this claim tend to be circular , and the inductive evidence suffices only to show that true contradictions are unlikely and uncommon -- a point Priest accepts ) ; ( 3 ) Contradictions Cannot Be Rationally Believed ( answer : the criteria governing what we should believe are constrained by more than mere consistency , and in some cases other criteria might outweigh the pull of consistency ) ; ( 4 ) If Contradictions Were Acceptable , Then No One Could Be Rationally Criticized ( answer : the acceptability of some contradictions in no way implies the acceptability of all , so some contradictions are not rationally acceptable , and their acceptance can therefore be criticized ) ; and ( 5 ) If Contradictions Were Acceptable , Then No One Could Deny Anything ( answer :
If we abandon the Fregean equation of denial with assertion of negation , then we can deny Φ without asserting the negation of Φ ) .
Priest 's goal is to block the traditional refutation - by - stare response to dialetheism mentioned above and the quick two - line arguments inspired by the stare .
As I hope this summary makes clear , Priest is successful -- dialetheism emerges as a serious position within the philosophy of language and logic -- no more absurd , on the face of it , than its competitors .
With the possibility of quick apriori refutation eliminated , the view deserves to have its theoretical merits and drawbacks carefully examined -- a task begun in the remaining essays .
The second section of the book ( What Is The LNC ? ) examines the status of the Law of Non-Contradiction and the claim that dialetheism amounts to a denial of the same .
The Law of Non-Contradiction ( hereafter , " the Law " ) , intuitively understood as a prohibition on the truth of a contradiction , is often expressed propositionally as ¬ ( P∧¬ P ) .
The immediate ( but not only ) problem is that ¬ ( P∧¬ P ) is a theorem of LP ( while some instances might also be false ) .
In this section Ross T. Brady , Patrick Grim , Greg Restall , R. M. Sainsbury , and Achille C. Varzi examine various means by which to formulate a definition of " contradiction " and the corresponding Law , various types of negation that might be used in these endeavors , and whether any of these do justice to the thought that dialetheism entails denying the Law .
While the arguments provided here are interesting , I postpone deeper consideration of these issues until the discussion of Stewart Shapiro 's paper , below .
The third section ( Metholodological Issues In The Debate ) contains papers examining whether dialetheism amounts to diagnosis ( in the traditional sense ) of the Liar paradox ( " Diagnosing Dialetheism " , Bradley Armour - Garb ) ; whether logic , understood , not as a codification of the preservation of truth , but instead as a codification of the preservation of ' correct assertion ' , requires a dialethic logic instead of a merely paraconsistent one ( " Knowledge and Non-contradiction " , Bryson Brown ) ; and how dialetheism fares within various accounts of the mechanics of logical revision ( " Logical Non-apriorism And The ' Law ' of Non-contradiction " , Otavio Bueno and Mark Colyvan , and " Revising Logic " , Michael D. Resnik ) .
The most interesting entry in this section , however , is the inclusion of extracts from two letters by David Lewis .
The two missives , jointly titled " Letters to Beall and Priest " ( Armour - Garb joined the project later ) and sent in response to an invitation to contribute to the volume , explain ( ironically enough ) why Lewis chose to turn down the invitation , claiming that " there 's really nothing much to say about [ dialetheism ] " ( p. 176 .
The letters were included posthumously by permission of his widow ) .
In the first letter Lewis argues that " To conduct a debate , one needs common ground ; and in this case , the principles not in dispute are so very much less certain than non-contradiction itself that it matters little whether or not a successful defense of non-contradiction could be based on them " ( p. 176 ) .
While the second letter , examining the fact that we do seem to reason about inconsistent situations , is interesting , this first letter is worth a bit more scrutiny .
At first glance one might be forgiven for assuming that Lewis 's claim that there is not much to say amounts to something little better than the dreaded refutation - by - incredulous - stare , but this is not Lewis 's point ( nor should it be , since the term ' incredulous stare ' has its origin in descriptions of standard reactions to Lewis 's modal realism ) .
Rather , Lewis is claiming that if we level the playing field , only allowing principles that classical and dialethic logicians agree on , then there is no chance for a successful defense of the Law , since any principle which might be used in such a defense is " less certain " than the Law itself .
In effect , Lewis is admitting that if the question is whether the Law of Non-contradiction can be defended without mobilizing some principle or principles equivalent to ( or stronger than ) it , then the answer is ' no ' ( and presumably the dialetheist wins , although Lewis did not take the point this far ) .
Thus , Lewis seems to have rather interesting , and controversial , views on dialetheism , especially for someone who claimed to have nothing to say on the topic .
The fourth section ( Part IV : Against the LNC ) contains various defenses of dialetheism .
JC Beall ( " True and False -- As If " ) argues that if we accept constructive methodological deflationism , a version of deflationism based on the idea that truth is a constructed notion , then we ought to accept the possibility of true contradictions and a dialethic logic ( this has the advantage of accepting dialetheiae while suggesting that , since they result from our own constructions , they are somehow our fault , not the world 's ) .
Edwin D. Mares ( " Semantic Dialetheism " ) defends a similar view : semantic dialetheism , where true contradictions arise as a result of a mismatch between our language and the world , and he contrasts this view with ( according to him , the much less plausible ) metaphysical dialetheism , where things in the world are actually inconsistent .
Jay Garfield 's amusing " ' To Pee And Not To Pee ? '
Could That Be The Question ?
( Further Reflections Of The Dog ) " outlines a position where , if we view logic as a normative account of rational inference , then our present epistemically hostile environment forces a dialethic logic upon us ( it is unclear , on this picture , whether this entails the existence of true contradictions .
The Dog officially " takes no position on the question of the actual consistency of the world . " p. 243 . ) Frederick Kroon ( " Realism And Dialetheism " ) suggests that philosophers who view dialethic discourses realistically have no reason to deny the possibility of trivialism ( the view that all sentences are both true and false , more on this below ) , since extant arguments show , at best , that we cannot rationally believe in trivialism , not that it fails .
Given the patent absurdity of trivialism , however , Kroon suggests that we adopt a fictionalist perspective towards any discourse that allows for true contradictions .
Vann McGee , tracing the history of non-classical semantics from Ramsey through Van Fraasen to Kripke and Fine , demonstrates that the differences between a theorist who accepts truth - value gaps and one who allows truth - value gluts ( the dialetheist ) are " surprisingly inconsequential .
What the gap theorist calls ' true ' , the gluttist calls ' non - false ' , and what the gapper calls ' false ' , the glut theorist calls ' untrue ' .
That 's all there is to it " ( p. 290 ) .
The most novel essay here , however , is Jon Cogburn 's " The Philosophical Basis Of What ?
The Anti-Realist Route to Dialetheism " .
Cogburn examines the Dummettian argument from the Recognition Thesis ( the thought that understanding is intimately tied up with recognition of potential verifiers or falsifiers ) to the Knowability Requirement ( the thought that a claim is true if , and only if , it is verifiable ) .
Cogburn argues that the only notion of verifiability which allows us to infer the Knowability Requirement from the Recognition Thesis ( even inductively ! ) involves a weak notion of defeasible warrant .
Since many claims will have warrants both for and against them in this weak sense , Cogburn claims that the anti-realist should be open to the existence of sentences that are both true and false .
The title of Cogburn 's paper immediately suggests that these dialethic considerations will require revisions to classical logic -- revisions different from accepting standard , non-paraconsistent intuitionistic logic ( the Dummettian anti-realist 's usual course of action ) .
Dummettian considerations motivate two claims -- constructivism ( or intuitionism ) regarding one 's logic , and dialetheism regarding truth .
The obvious next question , not addressed by Cogburn , is whether these two views can live together .
One problem with combining intuitionism ( or constructivism ) with dialetheism concerns negation .
Intuitionism does not just amount merely to an abandonment of excluded middle , but instead proposes such revisions within a framework imposing very specific meanings on the connectives ( in particular , negation and the conditional ) .
The standard Henkin clause for negation is :
A verification ( or warrant ) for ¬ Φ is a construction which , if applied to any ( potential ) verification of Φ , produces a verification of ⊥ .
Thus , when Cogburn considers a case where we have warrants both for and against a claim C ( so C is both true and false ) , he is too quick to conclude that this amounts to having warrants for both C and ¬C ( and thus for C∧¬ C ) .
In order to have a warrant for ¬ C , it is not enough that there be sufficient evidence against C , what we need is positive evidence for the claim that any warrant for C can be turned into a warrant for ⊥ .
It is not clear that Cogburn 's examples satisfy this stronger criterion , nor it is clear how any example could , since having both a warrant for Φ and a warrant for ¬ Φ would entail having a warrant for the primitive absurdity ⊥ .
This is not meant to be a serious criticism of Cogburn 's paper , but merely an indication that more work needs to be done .
In particular , if the anti-realist wishes to accept dialetheism while holding onto ( something like ) an intuitionistic understanding of the connectives , then he will need to draw a distinction between claims that are merely false and those whose negations are true ( presumably the latter would imply the former , but not vice versa ) .
Such an account promises to shed more light onto the connections between warrant , dialethic truth , and anti-realism , but I leave the task of working out the details for another time .
What is most interesting about this fourth section as a whole is not the fact that so many respected philosophers are defending a view once thought unworthy of serious consideration or detailed refutation .
Rather , the interesting thing is that these philosophers are defending different versions of dialetheism .
We have , at a rough count , dialethic deflationism , dialethic intuitionism ( or , at least , anti-realism ) , dialethic fictionalism , and an argument that dialetheism is equivalent to more well received ' gappy ' logics .
While there might be no principled reasons why one cannot adopt , say , intuitionism regarding one discourse and deflationism about another , we cannot adopt both positions with regard to a single discourse ( unless we wish to be dialetheists regarding talk about what logical view is correct , which does seem self - defeating ! ) .
Thus , as this section makes clear , dialetheism is a family of views whose common element is the assumption that at least some contradictions are true / rationally believable / assertible / verifiable / true - in - a- fiction / etc .
The final section , For the LNC , contains papers by Laurence Goldstein , Greg Littmann and Keith Simmons , Stewart Shapiro , Neil Tennant , Alan Weir , and Edward N. Zalta .
The papers by Goldstein , Littmann and Simmons , Tennant , and Zalta present more refined versions of the types of objection to dialetheism which Priest defuses in his own contribution .
Whether Priest will be able to develop more refined responses in answer to these objections is a topic better left to Priest and others .
What is clear , however , is that each of these philosophers takes dialetheism to be a viable contender for the title of undisputed correct logic , one worthy of principled opposition .
In " There are No True Contradictions " , Weir , in addition to propounding the standard sort of objections involving belief , assertion , the meaning of negation , etc. , argues that dialetheists have failed to deliver on the main selling point of their position -- a solution to the paradoxes .
Although dialetheism provide a uniform , and theoretically rich , account of semantic paradoxes such as the Liar , prospects for similar success with the set theoretic paradoxes seem bleak .
The problem , in a nutshell , is that naïve comprehension :
( ∃x ) ( ∀y ) ( y∈x ↔ F(y ) )
fails , within LP , to entail the existence of more than one object .
Thus , although naïve set theory is non-trivial within the dialethic framework , it falls short of providing a set theory powerful enough to support mathematics .
If dialetheism requires us to abandon traditional set theory in order to obtain a solution to the paradoxes , Weir asks " why take it seriously ? " ( p. 403 ) ( Weir 's discussion of dialethic set theory covers much more than this , and is recommended to anyone interested in the topic ) .
Shapiro's " Simple Truth , Contradiction , and Consistency " , however , is the perhaps the most troubling of the bunch for the dialetheist .
One of Shapiro 's many objections is that , although the dialetheist can indicate when a sentence Φ is both true and false ( an assertion of Φ∧ ¬Φ will do ) , she has no way of saying that a sentence is either true of false but not both .
Since the dialetheist is committed to the claim that trivialism is false , she is caught in a dilemma : the coherence of dialetheism depends on distinguishing it from the view that not just some but all sentences are both true and false , yet her language is incapable of expressing this claim ( Shapiro makes the point in a different , yet essentially equivalent , manner , pointing out that the dialetheist has no means by which to express the content of the claim that dialetheism is correct ) .
Shapiro canvasses , and rejects , a number of possible ways the dialetheist might attempt to express the claim that Φ is ( or is not ) a dialetheia .
A general argument can be given , however , for the claim that the dialetheist cannot , on pain of trivialism , express such claims ( Shapiro does not provide the general argument ) .
What we require is a sentence such that assertion of the sentence entails that Φ is not a dialetheia .
Since a sentence is assertible if , and only if , it is true , the sentence in question must be true if , and only if , Φ itself is not both true and false .
Thus , we need a predicate which corresponds to one of the following truth tables ( I assume familiarity with the semantics for LP ) :
Φ * 1 ( >) * 2 ( >) * 3 ( ) * 4 () T T B T B B F F F F F T T B B
Assume that the dialetheist 's language contains the resources to express at least one of these predicates ( call it * ) , and in addition assume that the language also contains Peano Arithmetic and the standard truth predicate :
Φ T( ) T T B B F F
Then , by diagonalization , we can obtain a Y such that :
Ψ
and :
( ∀P ) ( ( *( < Ψ > ) ∧T ( ) ) →T< P >)
have the same truth value(s ) .
( A→B = df ( ¬ A ) ∧ B ) .
We can now prove that every sentence in the language is ( at least ) true .
( The proof sketch is carried out in a classical metatheory , but this is not essential . )
Ψ is either simply true , simply false , or both .
If Ψ is simply false then T( ) is simply false , so *() ∧ T( ) is simply false , and ( ∀P ) ( ( *( < Ψ > ) ∧ T ( ) ) →T< P > ) is therefore ( at least ) true .
So Ψ can not be simply false .
If Ψ is both true and false , then ( ∀P ) ( ( *( < Ψ > ) ∧ T ( ) ) →T< P > ) must be both true and false , and thus ( at least ) false .
So , there must be some Q such that ( *( < Ψ > ) ∧ T ( ) ) →T< Q > is ( at least ) false .
So *(< Ψ > ) ∧ T ( > ) is ( at least ) true , so both of *( ) , T ( ) must be ( at least ) true .
But this implies that Ψ is ( simply ) true .
Contradiction , so Ψ can not be both true and false .
Thus , Ψ must be simply true , so ( ∀P ) ( ( *( < Ψ > ) ∧ T ( ) ) →T< P > ) is simply true , and therefore ( *( < Ψ > ) ∧ T ( ) ) → T<Q > is simply true for any sentence Q. Since *(< Ψ> ) ∧T( ) is ( at least ) true , by hypothesis and definitions , it follows that Q is ( simply ) true .
Since Q was arbitrary , this completes the proof .
Shapiro is , thus , absolutely correct , and if the dialetheist claims that one can , within his framework , express everything that is ( coherently ) expressible , then operations such as * ( and Boolean negation ) must be incoherent ( this is the standard dialethic response to such objections ) .
While this observation is significant ( and Littman and Simmons touch on similar points ) , there is a much more general , and perhaps more important , observation lurking in the vicinity .
Consider the Liar sentence :
L ↔ T< ¬ L >
within classical logic .
The problem in this context is that we can derive a contradiction :
L∧¬ L
from the Liar and , given explosion , obtain trivialism .
A two - centuries - old response to this is to reject the Liar as well - formed , somehow barring the expression of such self - refuting sentences .
Dialetheism ( along with other , more mainstream views ) can be seen as a ( partial ) rejection of this time - honored strategy .
What the dialetheist does is to provide a logic where neither the Liar nor sentences of the form Φ∧¬Φ are explosive .
Thus , by restricting the logic ( i.e. barring particular inferences such as disjunctive syllogism ) , we can allow more expressive resources into the language .
We can never , however , accept the coherence of every conceivable semantic notion ( unless we adopt a logic so weak that no interesting inferences are possible ) .
For any logic , there will be some concept which , if we allow it into the language , will cause triviality .
An example in the present context is the * predicate (s ) discussed above .
Thus , the common claim that LP is ' non-explosive ' is misleading -- rather , particular logics are explosive relative to particular ( classes of ) expressions , and thus the coherence of certain ( usually semantic ) expressions must be judged relative to particular logics .
Classical logic is explosive with respect to both expressions of the form Φ∧¬Φ and certain expressions which can be formulated in terms of the * operator , while LP is only explosive with regard to the latter .
As a result , the Liar is incoherent ( and presumably not expressible ) on the classical approach , while it is not for the dialetheist .
Presumably , a clever logician could formulate a logic even more restrictive than LP in which expressions involving the * operator were coherent .
The point is this :
The choice between dialethic logic and one or another non-dialethic logic is a familiar tradeoff between ( among other things , of course ) being permissive in terms of allowable inferences and being permissive in terms of what we can coherently express .
LP merely allows us more expressive power at the cost of some familiar patterns of inference .
Thus , dialetheism is not a radically new idea ( or even a radical old idea ) , but is just another node on the continuum of possible ways to balance the expressive power / inferential power trade - off .
Unfortunately , all of the essays in this volume ( like other writings on dialetheism , including the writings of its proponents ) tend to concentrate on the ways in which dialetheism is bizarre or seems to differ from its competitors and less on how the view fills a natural pre-existing space in the dialectic .
This is not to say that dialetheism is not important , or that it does not deserve the sort of attention that it receives in this excellent volume , or that the papers included do not constitute significant progress on a number of fronts .
On the contrary , once one views dialetheism as a natural companion to other , supposedly more ' traditional ' views such as classicism , intuitionism , and gappy logics , one wonders why it has taken so long for such an excellent volume to appear .

Jason Torchinsky is a guest blogger on Boing Boing .
Jason has a book out now , Ad Nauseam : A Survivor 's Guide to American Consumer Culture .
He lives in Los Angeles , where he is a tinkerer and artist and writes for the Onion News Network .
He lives with his partner Sally , five animals , too many old cars , and a shed full of crap .
First off , I love cars , I own an odd one , and , thanks in part to Make : magazine , I 've even raced them a little bit .
That 's why I 've deluded myself into thinking my opinion on this has any relevance here at all .
So , if you do n't mind , indulge me .
Recently , a study showed that people tended to prefer cars with " angry " faces .
Auto designers have known this for a while , as the vast majority of cars available today have " faces " ( you know , the front end arrangement of headlights , grille , and shapes that we tend to read like a face ) that are at least aggressive , and at most absolutely freaking livid .
This is across the board , too– from entry - level cars to minivans to expensive sports sedans– they all look like pissed - off turtle robots .
There are exceptions , of course , but many of the most notable ones ( New Beetle , Mini ) are modern updates of vintage designs .
Now , I think there is absolutely a place for aggression , determination , and even a bit of anger in auto design– some of my favorite cars use this as a major styling inspiration– it 's more about raw power and aggression becoming the default look for all cars that disturbs me .
Personally , the visual character I 've always sought out in a car is a certain degree of plucky fun– something upbeat , capable , but not so damn serious all the time .
Now , I do n't expect everyone to have the same tastes as me , but there seems to be a growing homogenization in auto design to favor these cars that look like douchebags .
The fact that the statement everyone wants to make by the vehicle they drive is one of intimidation and power seems like it's the symptom of something unpleasant going on in our culture .
Maybe someone smarter than me can shed some light on this ; I know people want to seem successful and powerful , to some degree , so maybe that 's it .
I do n't think this is the case in all cultures , as Japan seems full of cars so confusingly cute you want to spit .
Cars form part of the constant background of our visual lives , so it 's worth taking a look at them every now and then and seeing how they make you feel .
Lately , when I look around a parking lot , it feels more like I 've stumbled into a den of demented robot land - sharks .
If I had it my way , the land sharks would still be there , but there 'd be a good assortment of other faces out there , some of which would be looking like they just want to chug some 87 octane , go fast and have fun .
Oh , and maybe get your ass to work on time .
The Chinese government is a little worried about how much virtual cash is being traded in the country , The New York Times reports .
In fact some virtual currency , like the QQ coin , is actually affecting the market for the renmibi , China 's actual currency .
Much of the $ 2 billion in virtual currency is used to play games , but significant chunks , David Barboza writes , are now being traded for real physical goods , like clothes , food and services .
The shift of using virtual currency to pay for real products is part of what 's freaking out the Chinese central bank .
Beijing is so concerned about the virtual life of its citizens that the Times says , " it has repeatedly sought to tame the online gaming market with new regulations ( and even Internet addiction camps ) but the activity continues to grow . "
Here in the states the virtual gaming market is starting to undergo a similar boom .
Zynga , creators of the Mafia Wars Facebook game , is due to rake in somewhere north of $ 100 million this year on its virtual offerings .
Competitor Playfish has seen 100 million installs of its games in little more than 18 months .
Both companies handle payments on their own or through third parties right now , but Facebook sees a revenue opportunity in managing payments and virtual currency in third party applications by itself , having recently rolled out Pay with Facebook in a limited trial .
No word yet on how concerned the Federal Reserve is with this latest development .

Ninjawords : iPhone Dictionary , Censored by Apple
[ Update , 6 Aug 2009 : Please see the follow - up to this story , which includes a response from Apple senior vice - president Phil Schiller . ]
Two years ago I linked to a web site called Ninjawords — a fast , simple online dictionary backed by a good data source ( Wiktionary ) .
The developers behind Ninjawords , Matchstick Software , have released an iPhone version , currently available from the App Store for just $ 2 .
Here ’s how they describe it :
Ninjas are three things :
They ’re smart
They ’re quick
They ’re deadly accurate Ninjawords is a dictionary for the iPhone built on these principles .
We made it because we saw that the low - cost dictionaries on the App Store are slow , cluttered , and all use the same bad data source ( WordNet ) for their definitions .
Ninjawords takes a different approach .
We use awesome , fresh , high quality data with more words and synonyms than you can throw a ninja star at .
And best of all , when you look up your words , they all stay on the page .
No need to flip back and forth between different pages as you look up multiple words .
It ’s a terrific app — pretty much exactly what I ’ve always wanted in an iPhone dictionary , and , yes , with both a better user experience and better dictionary content than the other low - cost dictionaries in the App Store .
But Ninjawords for iPhone suffers one humiliating flaw : it omits all the words deemed “ objectionable ” by Apple ’s App Store reviewers , despite the fact that Ninjawords carries a 17 + rating .
Apple censored an English dictionary .
A dictionary .
A reference book .
For words contained in all reasonable dictionaries .
For words contained in dictionaries that are used every day in elementary school libraries and classrooms .
Amazon , of course , does not restrict the sale of English dictionaries , either in print or for the Kindle .
The Kindle , in fact , ships from the factory with a built - in dictionary , The New Oxford American Dictionary — the very same dictionary used by Mac OS X ’s built - in Dictionary app .
Like any good dictionary , it contains listing for all of the words deemed “ objectionable ” in Ninjawords by the App Store reviewers .
Even Walmart , notorious for its censorship of “ objectionable ” music and movies , neither restricts nor places warning labels on dictionaries .
Apple ’s App Store review team makes Walmart seem liberal by comparison .
I interviewed Phil Crosby , one of Ninjawords ’s developers , via email .
The App Store approval process for Ninjawords took two months .
Matchstick submitted the first build on May 13 ; it was rejected two days later .
Says Crosby , “ Our app was crashing on the latest beta of iPhone OS 3.0 .
We quickly fixed this issue and resubmitted . ”
Matchstick did not hear back from Apple until May 30 .
Then , says Crosby : “ We were rejected for objectionable content .
They provided screenshots of the words ‘ shit ’ and ‘ fuck ’ showing up in our dictionary ’s search results .
What ’s interesting is that we spent a good deal of time making it so that you must type vulgar words in their entirety , and only then will we show you suggestions in the search results .
For instance , if you type ‘ fuc ’ , you will not see ‘ fuck ’ as a suggestion .
This is in contrast to all other dictionaries we ’re aware of on the App Store ( including Dictionary.com ’s application ) , which will show you ‘ fuck ’ in the search results for ‘ fuc ’ , ‘ motherfucker ’ for ‘ mother ’ , etc .
In other words , the App Store reviewer (s ) explicitly searched for curse words they already knew , and found them .
( Reminiscent of the reviewer who rejected the e-book reader Eucalyptus after searching for , and finding , the Gutenberg edition of The Kama Sutra . )
This is the rejection email Matchstick Software received from Apple :
Thank you for submitting Ninjawords to the App Store .
We ’ve reviewed Ninjawords and determined that we cannot post this version of your iPhone application to the App Store at this time because it contains objectionable content which is in violation of Section 3.3.12 from the iPhone SDK Agreement which states : “ Applications must not contain any obscene , pornographic , offensive or defamatory content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , etc. ) , or other content or materials that in Apple ’s reasonable judgement may be found objectionable by iPhone or iPod touch users . ”
Parental Controls have been announced for iPhone OS 3.0 .
It would be appropriate to resubmit your application for review once this feature is available .
Regards , iPhone Developer Program
On July 1 , the app was rejected for the third time .
Crosby says , “ Someone from Apple called Dave [ Crosby ’s Matchstick Software colleague ] to tell him that we were being rejected again for illicit content ( he provided the single example ‘ cunt ’ , which we had indeed missed in our filters ) , and no matter what we did to our dictionary , it will have to be 17 + to make it to the App Store . ”
In other words , not only must the dictionary be censored — a dictionary — but even after being purged of “ objectionable ” words it would only be considered with a 17 + rating .
Even after agreeing to these terms , it took another two weeks for Ninjawords to appear in the App Store .
According to Crosby , “ We gave in and said fine , hoping that we could get on the App Store immediately since the solution to their rejection was a simple metadata change .
However , the App Store reviewer would have none of that .
We would have to resubmit an entirely new binary and get to the back of the queue before they would look at it again . ”
Ninjawords appeared in the App Store on July 13 .
The list of omitted words includes some which have utterly non-objectionable senses : ass , snatch , pussy , cock , and even screw .
( Ass and cock appear throughout the King James Bible . )
Every time I think I ’ve seen the most outrageous App Store rejection , I ’m soon proven wrong .
I ca n’t imagine what it will take to top this one .
Apple requires you to be 17 years or older to purchase a censored dictionary that omits half the words Steve Jobs uses every day .

We usually avoid shop talk here on Language Log .
So those of you who are here for the cartoons may want to move along , since I 'm about to ( mis - ? ) use this forum to announce a new journal .
The Journal of Experimental Linguistics is part of the Linguistic Society of America 's eLanguage initiative .
Like the rest of eLanguage , JEL is an Open Access online journal .
Regular publication will begin towards the end of 2009 .
JEL is a linguistic " journal of reproducible research " , that is , a journal of reproducible computational experiments on topics related to speech and language .
These experiments may involve the analysis of previously­ published corpus data , or of experiment­ - specific data that is published for the occasion .
Other relevant categories include computational simulations , implementations of diagnostic techniques or task scoring methods , methodological tutorials , and reviews of relevant new publications ( including new data and software ) .
In all cases , JEL articles will be accompanied by executable recipes for re­creating all figures , tables , numbers and other results .
These recipes will be in the form of source code that runs in some generally - ­available computational environment .
Although JEL is centered in linguistics , we aim to publish research from the widest possible range of disciplines that engage speech and language experimentally , from electrical engineering and computer science to education , psychology , biology , and speech pathology .
In this interdisciplinary context , " reproducible research " is especially useful in helping experimental and analytical techniques to cross over from one sub­field to another .
Publication is in online digital form only , with articles appearing as they complete the review process .
A rigorous but rapid process of peer review , designed to take no more than 4 - 6 weeks from submission to publication , will be supplemented by a vigorously­ - promoted system for adding moderated remarks and replies after publication .
The editorial board , in alphabetical order , is Alan Black , Steven Bird , Harald Baayen , Paul Boersma , Tim Bunnell , Khalid Choukri , Christopher Cieri , John Coleman , Eric Fosler­ - Lussier , John Goldsmith , Jen Hay , Stephen Isard , Greg Kochanski , Lori Levin , Mark Liberman , Brian MacWhinney , Ani Nenkova , James Pennebaker , Stuart Shieber , Chilin Shih , David Talkin , Betty Tuller , and Jiahong Yuan .
Mark Liberman is the editor in chief .
My involvement with this idea started with a Language Log post : " Executable Articles " , 1/3/2007 .
There was some further discussion , on the blog and off , and Dieter Stein asked me to organize a special session on " Open Data and Reproducible Research " at the Berlin 6 Open Access conference .
The JEL eLanguage proposal followed ; the LSA executive committee approved it ; after some infrastructure work in the background , we 're now ready to start accepting submissions ; and JEL should be on the air by the end of the year .

It seems I did n't announce it here , but Test - Run version 0.0120 was converted to Moose , the postmodern object system for Perl 5 .
After I uploaded all 0.0120 - related modules , I was looking for more Moosification , and decided to try and convert runprove to MooseX - Getopt , while still passing all tests .
After a lot of playing with the has attributes to get them I ran into what appeared to be a problem which I could not overcome : I could not configure it not to use Getopt - Long - Descriptive , in case it found it was installed .
I did n't want to use it , because I wanted my help display .
After talking about it on #moose , I was told that it is indeed a limitation .
I decided to fix it and did it by adding a new parameter .
However , t0 m told me that I should do it by extracting the non-GLD dependent functionality into a separate role , and doing it .
I did it , and he had some further comments which I incorporated into my MooseX - Getopt repository .
My enhancements are not in the CPAN module yet , but they are going to be soon .
And I 'll leave you with a #perl discussion about Chuck Norris : < Su - Shee > 2010 is planned more or less as a refactoring year .
< DrForr_ >
A whole * year * ?
What physical plane of existence do you reside on ?
< Su - Shee > DrForr_ : there 's also bugs to fix and systems to care for and things like that .
it 's not that we 're locked into the closet and a year later a new , shiny product is released .
;) < DrForr_ > Closet optional .
< Su - Shee >
I 'm not a wonderwoman refactoring half a million lines of perl in a week , sorry . :) < rindolf > Su - Shee : Chuck Norris refactors 10 millions lines of perl before lunch .
< Su - Shee > rindolf : hm. that 's the reason ..
I 'm not as hairy as chuck norris and I do n't have a beard ... < rindolf > Su - Shee : ah. < rindolf > Su - Shee : Chuck Norris also wrote a complete Perl 6 implementation .
< Su - Shee > rindolf : I heard , he already wrote Perl 7 . < rindolf >
Su - Shee : yes .
* rindolf wants to be as awesome as Chuck when he grows up .
< Su - Shee > rindolf : I envy you .
I 'll never be as awesome without a beard .
< rindolf > Su - Shee : heh. < rindolf >
Su - Shee : it does n't matter if you 're rigid on the outside as long as you 're rigid on the inside .
< Su - Shee > chuck norris does n't make mistakes .
< rindolf > Su - Shee : Chuck Norris corrects God . < Su - Shee > rindolf : I 'll apply as his secretary .
< rindolf > Su - Shee : as Chuck's ?
< Su - Shee > rindolf : yes . < rindolf > Su - Shee : OK . < rindolf >
Chuck Norris does n't code .
When he sits next to a computer , it just does whatever he wants .
< Su - Shee >
I 'll tell my boss tomorrow .
Chuck is who he wants .
< rindolf > Su - Shee : Chuck Norris is his own boss .
< rindolf >
Su - Shee : if you hire him , he 'll tell your boss what to do .
< Su - Shee > good point .
Bernard Madoff arrives at Federal Court where he is expected to plead guilty to securities fraud charges on March 12 , 2009 in New York .
Victims will also be in court to testify against the disgraced financier who is accused of masterminding a $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .

NEW YORK , Aug. 25 ( UPI ) -- Imprisoned New York financier Bernard Madoff 's former mistress says after losing everything to him her story is the only thing she can sell .
In an interview with ABC News , Sheryl Weinstein said she feels guilty because she invested her family 's money with Madoff and he " took everything . "
She has written a book about the relationship , " Madoff 's Other Secret : Love , Money , Bernie and Me . "

" Investing money , investing my family 's money was my responsibility , " she said .
" When this happened , the feelings of guilt , responsibility , failure became overwhelming .
I do n't have any art , I do n't have any jewelry .
What I have to sell is my story . "
Weinstein said she met Madoff 21 years ago , when she was the chief financial officer of Hadassah , the Jewish women 's charitable group , which also lost millions in Madoff 's Ponzi scheme .
The sexual relationship with Madoff lasted only 18 months , Weinstein , who is married , said .
She said she believes Madoff became more emotionally involved than he wanted or expected .
" I certainly hope that Mrs. Weinstein was more discreet about her investment decisions on behalf of Hadassah than she was about her sex life , " Madoff 's lawyer , Ira Sorkin , said in a statement .
You hired a designer , and worked with them to create a beautiful design for your website .
They finished the design and delivered the source files and said thank you very much for the business , but wait … what now you ca n’t make a website with this !
Do n’t panic , you ’ve got past the first and often most difficult part of building a website , and you have a few different options for taking those files and building your website .
Find out what they are after the jump …
Do it yourself
You do n’t need to be an expert in HTML / CSS to code up your design .
There are many tutorials that will guide you thru the process of slicing and coding a design in to HTML / CSS .
Not only is this very cost effective , but it will put you in a better position to manage your site in the future .
One you get past the basics you ’ll find even more detailed tutorials on all aspects of website coding .
Below you ’ll find a list of tutorials to get you started :
Designer sourced
Do n’t let your designer off the hook .
Even though they do n’t advertise the fact , many designer are very capable of turning their designs into functioning HTML / CSS .
Who better to code the design than the person who created it , they will need no instructions as to the intent or purpose of even the most complicated part of the designs .
Designer that are n’t able to the code the designs themselves , often have coders they work with on a regular basis .
The on - going relationship between the coder and designer often produces better results in less time than finding a coder yourself .
They may be able to sub - contract the work , or maybe give you a referral to someone they like to work with .
Slicers
A new crop of web development companies specialize in producing quality CSS - based layouts that are even optimized for search engines ( SEO ) .
You send them a PSD or PNG and they build out the HTML / CSS for you .
Prices range from $ 100 - 500 , and can take as little as one day for you to get your coded site .
One of the first of these type of companies was XHTMLized , although there are now many , many , options .
Most Sliced provides a comprehensive directory of these companies , and allows people who have used them to submit reviews of their services , helping you to find the best slicer for you .
Recently these firms have expanded their services and can often code your designs directly into popular Content Management System , such as WordPress , and ExpressionEngine , or into E- commerce solutions such as Magento and CubeCart .
This can me getting your website up and running even faster and cheaper than before .
Each of these methods might be right for you , depending on your skills , budget and time - frame .
I highly recommend going through some of the tutorials listed above , even if you decide to have someone else code the site for you .
This will put you in a better position to judge the quality of the work they produce , or even to help you decide who to use for coding the design in the first place .
Gordon Brown is to issue a list of specific spending cuts before the general election in an attempt to convince voters that Labour will reduce the soaring deficit in public finances .
The Prime Minister has been reluctant to use the word " cuts " , fearing that Labour would look no different to a Conservative Party committed to spending less than Labour .
But The Independent has learnt that as a key part of Mr Brown 's autumn fightback he will change tack on the issue which will be the central battleground in the election expected next spring .
Mr Brown will deny he is redrawing his favourite " dividing line " – contrasting " Labour investment versus Tory cuts " .
However , he has come under pressure from Cabinet ministers , led by the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , to change his language on public spending amid fears that Labour could lose the argument .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Initially , Mr Brown will seek to establish in voters ' minds the key differences between Labour and the Tories – on policy , government intervention to limit the impact of the recession and preserving frontline services .
Then he will acknowledge that the Government needs to go beyond the £ 35bn of efficiency savings it has already promised .
The aim will be to show Labour is serious about reducing the deficit , which is set to rocket to £ 175bn in the current financial year and to £ 173 bn next year .
Cabinet ministers will announce that some projects will be abandoned , shelved or delayed to save money .
One admitted yesterday : " Efficiency savings are useful but not a substitute for real savings .
There will be things that need to be put off , done more slowly or abandoned altogether . "
No specific decisions have yet been taken , but the move will fuel speculation that the Government may delay the £ 25 bn renewal programme for the Trident nuclear weapons system .
Aides insist that Mr Brown remains committed to retaining Britain 's deterrent .
Under a fightback plan being written in Downing Street , the Government will accept that efficiency measures must be taken by all Whitehall departments and real savings identified on top of them .
It will draw up a programme to cut future debt without harming the frontline services on which people will depend .
Ministers will argue that Britain 's future cannot be built without the " continued investment " safeguarded by Labour , combined with public service reforms .
The first signs of the new approach may emerge at next month 's TUC conference in Liverpool , when Mr Brown and the Chancellor will call for pay restraint among top earners in the public sector , calling on them to match the belt - tightening in much of the private sector .
To reduce the debt , Labour will be launching a drive to combat long - term unemployment .
A " Backing Young Britain " campaign will outline new measures that will help young people into work .
Ministers will trumpet the fruits of Labour 's " investment " as more new schools open at the start of the new term that at any time since Victorian era .
They will argue that spending money on education and skills is crucial to boosting long - term economic growth and therefore the speed at which public debt can be repaid .

But Mr Brown will seek to limit such intervention to a small number of high - profile areas , to avoid criticism that the Government is indulging in " micro-management " .
Although the Tories enjoy a healthy average 14 - point lead in the opinion polls , Labour strategists have advised Mr Brown it can be eroded by contrasting the Government 's record and plans with David Cameron 's more sketchy programme .
Labour 's internal polling reports claim the Tories are more vulnerable on policy than their current lead suggests because they are widely perceived as having little or no policy .
" This is the way back for Labour , " one strategist said .
Under the fightback plan , as the beginnings of economic recovery emerge , Labour hopes the Government 's actions will be seen to have stopped recession turning into depression .
It says the next challenge for the party will be to demonstrate how recovery will be sustained , where the jobs of the future will come from and how investment in frontline services such as health , education and police will be safeguarded .
Labour will defend its achievements in office and say more about its future plans on crime , immigration and improving society .
One senior Labour source said : " In contrast to David Cameron and George Osborne , we must offer leadership that convinces and inspires .
This means focusing on what really matters to the public , offering fewer but more substantial big interventions .
It means having a clear policy message , in contrast to the Tories , who increasingly present two faces to the public . "
In a speech today , the shadow Home Secretary , Chris Grayling , will liken conditions in Britain 's " broken society " to those shown in the hit American television series The Wire , based in Baltimore .
He will call for police to be given more powers to tackle anti-social behaviour by young teenagers ; anyone carrying a knife to face a custodial sentence and people no longer being cautioned or given light sentences for violent attacks against strangers .
Billboard Wars
Since Billboards have been used for advertising , Christian organizations and Churches have used them to advertise God ( as if a creator of the universe would need advertising ) .
Over the last few years , atheist groups have started to put up some billboards of our own .
Despite trying our best to be an unthreatening as possible , atheist billboards seem to always cause controversy .
I need your help .
I would like to compile photos of the worst Christian billboards you can find .
So if you are in a more religiously brainwashed area of the country or the world and you see a Christian billboard , snap a photo and e-mail it to me at DangerousTalk@gmail.com .
Let me know where this billboard was found ( city and state ) and so next time one of our billboards is challenged by Bill OReily or Father Morris , we will be able to give them a little comparison not that it will matter to them .
But it will matter to the general public who we are trying to reach .

Engineers have long looked to nature for clues that will help then build robots that move with anything close to the grace that living things exhibit .
Although the use of rigid metal and plastic parts tends to result in stiff , mechanical motion , a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( M.I.T. ) is experimenting with the use of a single piece of flexible silicon and urethane polymer to create robotic fish that smoothly wriggle through the water much like their natural counterparts .
Fish propel themselves by contracting muscles on either side of their bodies , generating a wave that travels from head to tail .
To mimic the motion , the M.I.T. researchers have created two different types of robo - fish .
The first type of aquatic automaton , which measures about 12.7 centimeters , mimics the carangiform swimming technique used by bass and trout .
Most of the movement takes place in the tail end of the body , says Pablo Valdivia y Alvarado , a research affiliate working in M.I.T.'s Mechatronics Research Laboratory who has teamed with Kamal Youcef - Toumi , an M.I.T. mechanical engineering professor and the lab 's director .
Fish that use this type of motion are generally fast swimmers , he adds .
The second type is a 20 - centimeter - long robo - fish designed to move more like a tuna or shark , which swim faster and for longer distances .
The motion of these fishes ( and dolphins , too ) is concentrated in the tail and the region where the tail attaches to the body .
M.I.T.'s robo - fish prototypes cut through the water at close to one body length per second — fast for a robotic fish , but no match for the genuine article , which can swim as fast as 10 times their body length per second , according to the researchers .
The robo - fish project is an extension of Valdivia y Alvarado 's doctoral thesis work at M.I.T. , which sought to create " a methodology for building mobile robots by exploiting the natural vibration of compliant bodies , " he says .
When people build robots , whether it is a humanoid , a quadruped or a fish , they tend to create very complex mechanisms , and this complexity often works against them by creating multiple points of potential failure , Valdivia y Alvarado says .
Because the robo - fish that he and Youcef - Toumi have created is made from a single piece of polymer , it is easier to make watertight than previous generations of robotic fish .
Valdivia y Alvarado and Youcef - Toumi benefited from a wealth of data produced by previous robotic fish research .
In 1994 M.I.T. ocean engineers demonstrated Robo- tuna , a 1.2 - meter - long robotic fish with 2,843 parts controlled by six motors .
Valdivia y Alvarado's robo - fish are powered by a single motor and are made of fewer than 10 parts , including the body and the wiring .
Other robotic fish experiments have been conducted by the University of Essex in England , the California Institute of Technology and several others .
Whereas Robo-tuna and several of those that followed in its wake were built to help researchers study fluid dynamics and how fish swim , Valdivia y Alvarado hopes his new generation of robo - fish will lead to autonomous underwater devices that can perform a number of jobs , such as inspecting submerged vessels and oil and gas pipes , patrolling waterways , and detecting environmental pollutants .
His initial prototypes are wired to an external power source , but the future will include battery - powered models .
And basic fish are just the first step .
By December , Valdivia y Alvarado and Youcef - Toumi plan to have built a prototype manta ray and salamander , both of which require more complex movements than the original robo - fish .
I ’ve been to Australia twice so far , but according to my father I ’ve never actually seen it .
He made this observation at the home of my cousin Joan , whom he and I visited just before Christmas last year , and it came on the heels of an equally aggressive comment .
“ Well , ” he said , “ David ’s a better reader than he is a writer . ”
This from someone who has n’t opened a book since “ Dave Stockton ’s Putt to Win , ” in 1996 .
He ’s never been to Australia , either .
Never even come close .

“ No matter , ” he told me .
“ In order to see the country , you have to see the country_side_ , and you ’ve only been to Sydney . ”
“ And Melbourne .
And Brisbane , ” I said .
“ And I have too gone into the country . ”
“ Like hell you have . ”
“ All right , ” I said .
“ Let ’s get Hugh on the phone .
He ’ll tell you .
He ’ll even send you pictures . ”
Joan and her family live in Binghamton , New York .
They do n’t see my father and me that often , so it was pretty lousy to sit at their table , he and I bickering like an old married couple .
Ashamed by the bad impression we were making , I dropped the countryside business , and as my dad moved on to other people ’s shortcomings I thought back to the previous summer , and my twenty - three - hour flight from London to Sydney .
I was in Australia on business , and because someone else was paying for the ticket , and it would be possible to stop in Japan on the way home , Hugh joined me .
This is not to put Australia down , but he ’d already gone once before .
Then , too , spend that much time on a plane and you ’re entitled to a whole new world when you step off at the other end — the planet Mercury , say , or , at the very least , Mexico City .
For an American , though , Australia seems pretty familiar : same wide streets , same office towers .
It ’s Canada in a thong , or that ’s the initial impression .
I hate to admit it , but my dad was right about the countryside .
Hugh and I did n’t see much of it , but we would n’t have seen anything were it not for a woman named Pat , who was born in Melbourne and has lived there for most of her life .
We ’d met her a few years earlier , in Paris , where she ’d come to spend a mid-July vacation .
Over drinks in our living room , her face dewed with sweat , she taught us the term “ shout , ” as in “ I ’m shouting lunch . ”
This means that you ’re treating , and that you do n’t want any lip about it .
“ You can also say , ‘ It ’s my shout , ’ or , ‘ I ’ll shout the next round , ’ ” she told us .
We kept in touch after her visit , and when my work was done , and I was given a day and a half to spend as I liked , Pat offered herself as a guide .
On that first afternoon , she showed us around Melbourne , and shouted coffee .
The following morning , she picked us up at our hotel , and drove us into what she called “ the bush . ”
I expected a wasteland of dust and human bones , but it was nothing like that .
When Australians say “ the bush , ” they mean the woods .
The forest .
First , though , we had to get out of Melbourne , and drive beyond the seemingly endless suburbs .
It was August , the dead of winter , and so we had the windows rolled up .
The homes we passed were made of wood , many with high fences around the back yards .
They did n’t look exactly like American houses , but I could n’t quite identify the difference .
Was it the roofs ?
I wondered .
The siding ?
Pat was driving , and as we passed the turnoff for a shopping center she invited us to picture a four - burner stove .
“ Gas or electric ? ” Hugh asked , and she said that it did n’t matter .
This was not a real stove but a symbolic one , used to prove a point at a management seminar she ’d once attended .
“ One burner represents your family , one is your friends , the third is your health , and the fourth is your work . ”
The gist , she said , was that in order to be successful you have to cut off one of your burners .
And in order to be really successful you have to cut off two .
Pat has her own business , a good one that ’s allowing her to retire at fifty - five .
She owns three houses , and two cars , but , even without the stuff , she seems like a genuinely happy person .
And that alone constitutes success .
I asked which two burners she had cut off , and she said that the first to go had been family .
After that , she switched off her health .
“ How about you ? ”
I thought for a moment , and said that I ’d cut off my friends .
“ It ’s nothing to be proud of , but after meeting Hugh I quit making an effort . ”
“ And what else ? ” she asked .
“ Health , I guess . ”
Hugh ’s answer was work .
“ And ? ”
“ Just work , ” he said .
I asked Pat why she ’d cut off her family , and with no trace of bitterness she talked about her parents , both severe alcoholics .
They drank away their jobs and credit , and because they were broke they moved a lot , most often in the middle of the night .
This made it hard to have a pet , though for a short time Pat and her sister managed to own a sheep .
It was an old , beat - up ram they named Mr. Preston .
“ He was lovely and good - natured , until my father sent him off to be shorn , ” Pat said .
“ When he returned , there were bald patches and horrible deep cuts , like stab wounds , in his skin .
Then we moved to an apartment , and had to get rid of him . ”
She looked at her hands on the steering wheel .
“ Poor old Mr. Preston .
I had n’t thought about him in years . ”
It was around this time that we finally entered the bush .
Hugh pointed out the window , at a lump of dirty fur lying beside a fallen tree , and Pat carolled , “ Roadkill ! ”
Then she pulled over , so we could take a closer look .
Since leaving Melbourne , we ’d been climbing higher into the foothills .
The temperature had dropped , and there were graying patches of snow on the ground .
I had on a sweater and a jacket , but they were n’t quite enough , and I shivered as we walked toward the body , and saw that it was a . . . what , exactly ?
“ A teen - age kangaroo ? ”
“ A wallaby , ” Pat corrected me .
The thing had been struck but not run over .
It had n’t decomposed , or been disfigured , and I was surprised by the shoddiness of its coat .
It was as if you ’d bred a rabbit with a mule .
Then there was the tail , which reminded me of a lance .
“ Hugh , ” I called .
“ Come here and look at the wallaby . ”
It ’s his belief that in marvelling at a dead animal on the roadside you may as well have killed it yourself — not accidentally but on purpose , cackling , most likely , as you ran it down .
Therefore , he stayed in the car .
“ It ’s your loss , ” I called , and a great cloud of steam issued from my mouth .
Our destination that afternoon was a place called Daylesford , which looked , when we arrived , more like a movie set than like an actual working town .
The buildings on the main street were two stories tall , and made of wood , like buildings in the Old West , but brightly painted .
Here was the shop selling handmade soaps shaped like petit fours .
Here was the fudgery , the jammery , your source for moisturizer .
If Dodge City had been founded and maintained by homosexuals , this is what it might have looked like .
“ The spas are fantastic , ” Pat said , and she parked the car in front of a puppet shop .
From there we walked down a slight hill , passing a flock of sulfur - crested cockatoos , just milling about , pulling worms from the front lawn of a bed - and - breakfast .
This was the moment when familiarity slipped away , and Australia seemed not just distant but impossibly foreign .
“ Will you look at that , ” I said .
It was Pat who had made the lunch reservation .
The restaurant was attached to a hotel , and on arriving we were seated beside a picture window .
The view was of a wooden deck and , immediately beyond it , a small lake .
On a sunny day , it was probably blinding , but the winter sky was like brushed aluminum .
The water beneath it had the same dull sheen , and its surface reflected nothing .
Even before the menus were handed out , you could see what sort of a place this was .
Order the pork and it might resemble a rough - hewn raft , stranded by tides on a narrow beach of polenta .
Fish might come with shredded turnips or a pabulum of coddled fruit .
The younger an ingredient , the more highly it was valued , thus the baby chicken , the baby spinach , the newborn asparagus , each pale stalk as slender as a fang .
As always in a fancy restaurant , I asked Hugh to order for me .
“ Whatever you think , ” I told him .
“ Just so long as there ’s no chocolate in it . ”
He and Pat weighed our options , and I watched the hostess seat a party of eight .
Bringing up the rear was a woman in her mid-thirties , pretty , and with a baby on her shoulder .
Its back was covered with a shawl , but to judge from the size it looked extremely young — a month old , tops .
Keep it away from the chef , I thought .
A short while later , I noticed that the child had n’t shifted position .
Its mother was running her hand over its back , almost as if she were feeling for a switch , and when the top of the shawl fell away I saw that this was not a baby but a baby doll .
“ Psssst , ” I whispered , and when Pat raised her eyes I directed them to the other side of the room .
“ Is that normal in Australia ? ” I asked .
“ Maybe it ’s a grieving thing , ” she offered .
“ Maybe she lost a baby in childbirth and this is helping her to work through it . ”
There ’s a definite line between looking and staring , and after I was caught crossing it I turned toward the window .
On the highest rail of the deck was a wooden platform , and standing upon it , looking directly into my eyes , was what I knew to be a kookaburra .
This thing was as big as a seagull , but squatter , squarer , and all done up in earth tones , the complete spectrum from beige to dark walnut .
When seen full on , the feathers atop his head looked like brush - cut hair , and that gave him a brutish , almost conservative look .
If owls were the professors of the avian kingdom , then kookaburras , I thought , might well be the gym teachers .
When the waitress arrived , I pointed out the window and asked her a half - dozen questions , all of them fear - based .
“ Oh , ” she said , “ that bird ’s not going to hurt anybody . ”
She took our orders and then she must have spoken to one of the waiters .
He was a tall fellow , college age , and he approached our table with a covered bowl in his hands .
I assumed that it was an appetizer , but it seemed instead that it was for the kookaburra .
“ Would you like to step outside and feed him ? ” he asked .
I wanted to say that between the wallaby and the baby doll I was already overstimulated , but how often in life do you get such an offer ?
That ’s how I found myself on the deck , holding a bowl of raw duck meat cut into slender strips .
At the sight of it , the bird stood up and flew onto my arm , which buckled slightly beneath the weight .
Parents often complain that their children are spending increasing amounts of time playing computer - based video games .
Kids get together and just sit in front of a computer or a television with a gaming console , and they do not talk to each .
They just watch the screen , which is probably damaging to their eye sight .
They do n’t get out enough and do not get enough exercise .
Etc .
What is all this video gaming doing to young brains ?
Certainly , the mind is the product of its environment and devoting a lot of time to any one activity will induce changes in the brain .
The question is : what changes does video gaming induce , are these changes beneficial or deleterious , and how do they affect behavior ?
Growing scientific evidence demonstrates that the human brain dynamically changes in response to experience and to changes in the environment , a phenomenon that is known as “ plasticity . ”
It is also believed that timing is crucial – our brains appear to be more susceptible to change early in our developmental lives .
Thus , a world with vastly different technology driven demands , opportunities and challenges , is surely going to lead to brain changes : the brain of our children will be different from those of the generations who rode their bikes , jumped rope , and played sports in the backyard , rather than throwing a football with Madden NFL 09 .
There has been increasing interest on the possibility that video games may actually induce brain changes that lead to behavioral benefits .
A number of applications of computer games have been developed for education and rehabilitation .
At least anecdotally , individuals who have played a lot of video games using joy stick controllers in their youth are supposed to make better airline pilots when they grow - up .
However , finding that familiarity with the motor skills required to operate a computer or a gaming console conveys advantages for the control of similar technology is not that surprising or exciting .
We have long known that practice can make perfect .
A recent study by Daphne Bavelier and colleagues at the University of Rochester offers the intriguing suggestion that playing video games may not only be beneficial because of practicing specific skills , but may also enhance core functions of vision – something that has been classically viewed as immutable as an adult .
These investigators have reported that playing certain action video games results in a significant improvement in “ visual contrast sensitivity , ” a measure of how well an individual is able to discern low - contrast targets .
Interestingly , it mattered what type of video game was played .
The study group that showed enhancements in contrast sensitivity played “ Unreal Tournament 2004 ” and “ Call of Duty 2 , ” -- both fast - paced and action - oriented games .
In contrast , control subjects played games like “ The Sims 2 , ” a visual engaging game of social interactions which is much less demanding in terms of visual attention and visuo - motor coordination .
It seems likely , the study suggests , that the specific characteristics and demands of a video game induce different brain changes and thus promote different behavioral advantages .
If action games that train visual scanning and visuo - motor coordination , like “ Unreal Tournament 2004 ” and “ Call of Duty 2 ” result in improved visual contrast sensitivity and improved fine motor coordination , perhaps games like “ The Sims 2 ” or “ Warcraft ” may be beneficial in promoting empathy or social interaction skills .
A careful scientific exploration of such issues may lead to the development of video games and technologies with targeted applications of different cognitive functions and even certain patient populations .
It is important to note that contrast sensitivity is only one measure of visual function .
Assessing other measures ( such as motion detection and luminance thresholds or critical flicker fusion frequency ) may also reveal changes over time and as a function of the type of game .
The findings raise the possibility of functional gains due to playing video games that would generalize to a vast number of tasks , and confer many specific advantages .
If confirmed , maybe all of us will end up spending sometime playing certain video games .
It is appealing to envision video games being utilized in the rehabilitation of patients and the prevention of cognitive decline , promotion of brain fitness , and development of fundamental skills .
However , more careful studies like those of Bavelier and colleagues are needed to realize such a goal .
To date , much of the claims around this rapidly growing area of technology - supported medical interventions are insufficiently supported by scientific data .
In this context , a major advantage of video games is the fact that they can be made entertaining and engaging .
Motivation is a powerful driver of brain plasticity .
The highly realistic and engaging nature of these games allows the gamer to immerse themselves and “ feel ” like the simulation is really real ( e.g. the intensity of combat ) .
Such realistic engagement and the resulting enjoyment promotes brain changes .
Of course , a video game is not the same as the real thing .
The motor plan to throw a football accurately ( e.g. grip strength , depth perception , tracking the running receiver ) versus the right sequences of touches on a game console are two different things .
The development of systems that more realistically simulate motor actions and responses will probably be important .
It is likely that the functional impact of the brain plasticity induced by greater technology dependence will be different for different behaviors .
For example , playing video games will train certain visuo - motor skill but also affect social development and interpersonal relation skills .
Parents may wish that their kids talked , rather than texted their friends , and played soccer in the backyard , rather than on a gaming console .
But technology - based communications , entertainment , and video games are here to stay .
The challenge is to learn enough about the brain changes induced by different technologies and types of games in order to be able to guide them , enhancing functions that result in a functional and behavioral advantage for each individual .
If done properly , the motivating , almost addictive , nature of these technologies , may actually prove a very valuable ally to achieve desired goals in education , medical treatment , and rehabilitation .

Have you recently read a peer - reviewed paper that you want to write about ?
Then contact Mind Matters co-editor Gareth Cook , a Pulitzer prize - winning journalist at the Boston Globe , where he edits the Sunday Ideas section .
And todays gays are n’t getting any royalties either , As the NAACP ’s Benjamin Todd declares to the NYT .
The N.A.A.C.P. , which just held its 100th annual convention amid much fanfare , was founded to advance civil rights .
Why has the organization failed to take a stand on same - sex marriage , one of the most urgent civil rights issues of our day ?
We ’re engaged in fighting a whole range of issues of urgent relevance to the gay community and people of color in our country , including school bullying , hate crimes and employment discrimination .
But we ’re a barge , not a speedboat .
We ’re not going to repeat the mistakes of so many other institutions that have literally torn themselves apart over this divisive issue .
Exit polling suggested that 70 percent of black voters — the largest by far of any minority group — voted to make gay marriage illegal in California by voting in favor of Proposition 8 last fall .
How do you explain that ?
The bond between black culture and church culture ?
You ’re looking at this from 50,000 feet .
I ’m looking at if from the ground , and I know that church leaders are on both sides of the debate .
Black voters have been scapegoated — so many pundits blamed the passage of Proposition 8 on them .
But it would have passed even if 100 percent of the black voters had voted against it .
Why do you think it ’s such a divisive issue in the black community ?
If gay rights groups want to change the opinion polls in the black community , they have to invest in it .
It ’s a long - term conversation .
The battle to oppose Prop 8 could have been much better run .
They came to the black community late , with the expectation that they were going to get certain results .
So you think gays should mobilize blacks instead of expecting you to ?
That ’s exactly right .
And how to you propose that should be done , Mr. Todd — seeing as you regard gay as entirely divisible from black ?
This is of course connected to his refusal to answer “ Why do you think it ’s such a divisive issue in the black community ? ”
That ’s because “ Do n’t Ask Don’t Tell ” has always been a black thing .
Yes the fabled “ Harlem Renaissance was a Gay and Lesbian movement .
But you ’re not supposed to mention that .
Especially whenever Langston Hughes is brought up .
As for Sweet Pea —
Beautiful , Nat .
But it ’s distingue traces , not “ distant gay traces . ”
But at least you did the verse , unlike Dana — who skips it for obvious reasons .
Billy Strayhorn was a teenager when he wrote this paen to ennui .
No wonder then that he was able to write the likes of this a bit later —
Of course that ’s a “ up ” tune .
He could write a lot of them too .
He could write all sorts of things .
The excellent TV documentary ( from which the opening clip comes from ) questions why Strayhorn clung to Elligton and his unbelievably stingy deal .
Fear of taking on the world on his own ?
Obsessive fealty to the powerrful ?
No real way to know .
But his legacy is being acknowledged .
And his gayness too .
As the documentary shows he had a white lover who he insitsted on being with him in his hospital room at the last .
Quite a feat — then as now .
For as we all know we ’re never so gay as when we ’re dying — as far as this culture is concerned .
And that ’s why we ’ve got to fight against all our enemies — black and white .
‘ Touche ’s lyrics for the above —
“ Daydream , why do you haunt me so
Deep in a rosy glow
The face of my love you show
Daydream , I walk along on air
Building a castle there
For me and my love to share
Do n’t know the time ,
Lordy I ’m in a daze
Sun in the sky ,
while I moon around , feeling , hazy
Daydream ,
do n’t break my reverie
Until I find that he ,
Is daydreaming just like me ”
We have two previous lists on bizarre deaths : 10 Truly Bizarre Deaths , and Top 10 Unfortunate Or Embarrassing Deaths .
Lists of this nature are always popular as they often expose the darker side of human nature .
This new list is no exception !
If you can think of any other bizarre deaths ( perhaps more recent ones ) and they do n’t appear on either of the previous lists , be sure to mention them in the comments for all to enjoy .
These entries are in chronological order .
10 Hypatia of Alexandria 415 AD
Method of Death : Murdered by monks with shells
Hypatia of Alexandria was a Greek scholar from Alexandria in Egypt , considered the first notable woman in mathematics , who also taught philosophy and astronomy .
Believed to have been the reason for the strained relationship between the Imperial Prefect Orestes and the Bishop Cyril , Hypatia attracted the ire of a Christian population eager to see the two reconciled .
One day in March 415 , during the season of Lent , her chariot was waylaid on her route home by a Christian mob , possibly Nitrian monks led by a man identified only as Peter , who is thought to be Peter the Reader , Cyril ’s assistant .
The Christian monks stripped her naked and dragged her through the streets to the newly Christianised Caesareum church , where she was brutally killed .
Some reports suggest she was flayed with sea shells and potshards and set ablaze while still alive .
9 Sigurd the Mighty 892 AD
Method of Death : Strap - on head infected him
Sigurd Eysteinsson ( aka Sigurd I The Mighty , ruled 875-92 ) was the second Viking Earl of Orkney , who succeeded his brother Ragnald the Wise .
He was a leader in the Viking conquest of what is now northern Scotland .
He died as a result of one of the native rulers he killed , Maelbrigte , moramer of Moray .
He beheaded Maelbrigte and strapped his head to his saddle .
As he rode , Maelbrigte ’s teeth grazed against his leg , causing a wound that became infected and killed him .
8 György Dózsa 1514
Method of Death : Eaten alive
György Dózsa , Székely man - at - arms and peasants ’ revolt leader in Hungary , was condemned to sit on a red - hot iron throne with a red - hot iron crown on his head and a red - hot sceptre in his hand ( mocking at his ambition to be king ) , by Hungarian landed nobility in Transylvania .
While Dózsa was still alive , he was set upon and his partially roasted body was eaten by six of his fellow rebels , who had been starved for a week beforehand .
7 William Kogut 1930
Method of Death : Suicide courtesy of MacGuyver skills
William Kogut was an inmate on death row at San Quentin , decided to commit suicide using only the rudimentary tools available to him in his prison cell .
He began by tearing up several packs of playing cards , giving particular focus to obtaining pieces with red ink ( at the time , the ink in red playing cards contained nitrocellulose , which is flammable and when wet can create an explosive mixture ) , and stuffed them into a pipe .
He then plugged one end of the pipe firmly with a broom handle and poured water into the other end to soak the card pieces .
He then placed the pipe on a kerosene heater next to his bed and placed the open end firmly against his head .
The heater turned the water into steam and eventually enough pressure built up inside the pipe so that when it burst , the explosion shot out bits of playing cards with enough force to penetrate Kogut ’s skull , killing him .
In a suicide note , Kogut stated that he and he alone should punish himself for his crimes
6 Sirkka Sari 1939
Method of Death : Fell down a chimney
In 1939 , well known Finnish actress Sirkka Sari ( Jahnsson ) was celebrating the premiere of her new film “ A Rich Girl ” at the hotel Aulanko .
During the celebration ( most likely in a drunken desire to have some mischievous fun ) Sari climbed the stairs to the roof of the hotel .
At the top of the stairs , she opened the door and saw a black rectangular area which she thought was asphalt .
She mistook it for a scenery deck , and jumped right in it .
Unfortunately for her it was actually a chimney .
She fell to her death in the boiler at the bottom .
5 The Collyer brothers 1947
Method of Death : Eccentricity
The Collyer brothers , extreme cases of eccentric compulsive hoarders , were found dead in their home in New York in 1947 .
The younger brother , Langley , died by falling victim to a booby trap he had set up , causing a mountain of objects , books , and newspapers to fall on him crushing him to death .
His blind brother , Homer , who had depended on Langley for care , died of starvation some days later .
Their bodies were recovered after massive efforts in removing many tons of debris from their home .
4 Georgi Markov 1978
Method of Death : Murdered with an umbrella
Georgi Ivanov Markov was a Bulgarian dissident writer .
In order to silence him , the Bulgarian government decided to have him killed and asked the KGB to help .
On September 7 , 1978 , Markov walked across Waterloo Bridge spanning the River Thames , and was waiting at a bus stop on the other side , when he was jabbed in the calf by a man holding an umbrella .
The man apologized and walked away .
Markov would later tell doctors that the man had spoken in a foreign accent .
Markov recalled feeling a stinging pain from where he had been hit , he assumed by the umbrella tip .
That evening he developed a high fever and was admitted to a hospital where he died three days later , on 11 September 1978 , at the age of 49 .
The cause of death was poisoning from a ricin - filled pellet .
3 John Bowen 1979
Method of Death : Killed by flying lawnmower
John Bowen , a 20 - year - old of Nashua , New Hampshire was attending a halftime show at a football game at Shea Stadium on December 9 , 1979 .
During an event which featured novelty and custom - made remote control flying machines , a 40 - pound model plane shaped like a lawnmower accidentally dived into the stands with its sharp blades striking Bowen and another spectator and causing severe head injuries .
While the other spectator survived , Bowen died in hospital four days later .
2 David Allen Kirwan 1981
Method of Death : Dove into a hotpool near boiling point
David Allen Kirwan a 24 - year - old attempted to rescue a friend ’s dog after it fell into Celestine Pool , a hot spring at Yellowstone National Park on July 20 , 1981 .
Despite numerous shouts from bystanders , Kirwan dove headfirst into the pool but was unable to save the dog .
After managing to swin back to shore , he was helped out of pool , where his injuries became apparent – the exposure to the 200 oF ( 93 oC ) water of the hot spring resulted in third - degree burns to 100 % of his body and had also blinded him .
After being led to the sidewalk , Kirwan reportedly stated : “ That was stupid .
How bad am I ?
That was a stupid thing I did . ”
When one of Kirwan ’s shoes was removed , all of the skin came off with it .
He died the next day at a Salt Lake City hospital .
Although there have been at least 19 deaths due to scalding at the Yellowstone , this was the only known case where someone died after deliberately jumping into one of the park ’s hot springs .
1 Dr. Hitoshi Nikaidoh 2003
Method of Death : Decapitated by an elevator
Dr. Hitoshi Nikaidoh ( pictured above , left ) , a surgical doctor , was decapitated as he stepped on to an elevator at Christus St. Joseph Hospital in Houston , Texas on August 16 , 2003 .
According to a witness inside the elevator , the elevator doors closed as Nikaidoh entered , trapping his head inside the elevator with the remainder of his body still outside .
His body was later found at the bottom of the elevator shaft while the upper portion of his head , severed just above the lower jaw , was found in the elevator .
A subsequent investigation revealed that improper electrical wiring installed by a maintenance company several days earlier had effectively bypassed all of the safeguards .

Blogger emptywheel has been on fire today .
In one post , she points us to an astonishing speech by Chris Christie in which he admits to the politicization of the US Attorney ’s office :
You know , we ’re going to ferret out waste and fraud and abuse in the government .
I think you know I ’ll do that better than anybody .
I ’ve got a group of assistant U.S. attorneys sitting down in Newark still doing their job .
But let me tell you , they are watching the newspapers .
And after we win this election , I ’m going to take a whole group of them to Trenton with me and put them in every one of the departments because they saw a lot of waste and abuse being investigated while we were in the U.S. Attorney ’s office that did n’t rise to the level of a crime .
So I told them , the good news is , when we get to Trenton we do n’t have to worry about beyond a reasonable doubt anymore .
As emptywheel notes , it ’s hard to say which of the four points is more disturbing :

The Gold Standard Institute
Canberra , Australia
Monday , August 24 , 2009
http://www.goldstandardinstitute.com/
I have written about " the last contango in Washington " before .
The phrase covers the gold crisis that has been brewing under the surface in the world for 60 years due to the insane gold policies of the U.S. Treasury .
As a result all newly mined gold , surpassing the quantity of all gold ever mined prior to 1947 , has gone into private hoards , from which it will be next to impossible to coax out .
The measure of this act of disappearance of gold is the vanishing of the basis , or the last contango .
In the technical jargon of the futures markets , the basis is the spread between the nearest futures price and the cash price in the same location .
The gold market has always been a carrying - charge market -- a contango market -- due to the monetary metal status of gold .
This means that the gold spread has always reflected the carrying charge , the opportunity cost , of carrying gold , most of which is foregone interest .
But a strange phenomenon has been manifesting itself for 35 years , since the inception of gold futures trading .
Rather than remaining constant , the basis as a percentage of the rate of interest has been vanishing and now has dropped to zero .
At the same time gold holdings registered at the Comex - approved warehouses have been dwindling .
Both indicators point toward a shortage of monetary gold that appears irreversible .
The support of the paper gold markets is at stake .
Without cash gold backing it up , paper gold trading is not viable .
When the gold basis goes negative , that 's the end not only to contango but also to gold futures trading as we know it .
Permanent backwardation in gold has never ever been experienced -- unless we imagine that there is a gold futures market in Harare .
Gold is not available at any price quoted in Zimbabwe dollars .
In that sense the last contango has first occurred in Zimbabwe .
Whatever paper trading of gold is still going on in the United States , it is at best a dress rehearsal for the Last Contango in Washington , which will be followed by the regime of permanent backwardation .
The meaning of this is that physical gold cannot be purchased at any price quoted -- this time , yes , in U.S. dollars .
The U.S. dollar rubbing shoulders with the Zimbabwe dollar ?
Mainstream economists and financial journalists shrug : " So what ?
We are not watching the basis of frozen pork bellies trading either when we make monetary policy . "
These gentlemen betray a lack of comprehension of the nature of the present financial and credit crisis .
Whatever else it may be , this crisis , first and foremost , is a gold crisis with an incubation period measured in scores of years .
It is about to reach its climax .
The world appears to be totally unprepared for it -- witness the silence surrounding the gold nexus .
Even the so - called sound - money Internet sites misread the situation .
They are talking about an imminent breakout of the dollar price of gold from its holding pattern below $ 1,000 per ounce .
Such breakouts have occurred from time to time since 2001 , when gold broke through the " resistance levels " of $ 300 , $ 400 , etc .
The coming breakout is not distinguished by the fact that $ 1,000 is an even rounder figure than the previous round figures that have been surpassed .
It is distinguished by the fact that we are confronting a world event the like of which has never happened .
It has never happened that gold was unobtainable at any price .
It has never happened that all governments have defaulted on their debt obligations simultaneously .
Still , we have to explain the relevance of this to the credit crisis .
It is no secret that the bonds , notes , bills , and other obligations of the U.S. government , or any other government , for that matter , are irredeemable .
That is , they are redeemable in nothing but more of the same .
For example , the bonds of the U.S. Treasury are redeemable in Federal Reserve credit , which is itself irredeemable and is " backed by " the self - same bonds of the U.S. Treasury .
Why is it , then , that these Treasury obligations are in demand where one might think that redeemability is a sine - qua - non of issuing them ?
What makes people participate in this shell game ?
How can such a crude check - kiting scheme mesmerize the entire population ?
Come to think of it , the sight of this Ponzi scheme would shudder the Founding Fathers of our great Republic .
This is not an easy question to answer .
But going through all the alternative explanations one by one , we come to the conclusion that the debt of the U.S. government is still redeemable in a sense , however limited or restrictive it may be .
The debt of the U.S. government has a liquid market in which it can be exchanged for Federal Reserve credit .
In turn , Federal Reserve credit can still be exchanged in liquid markets for physical gold , the ultimate extinguisher of debt , albeit at a variable price .
But if you break that final link , when gold is no longer for sale at any price quoted in U.S. dollars , then the rug will have been pulled from underneath this house of cards , and the international monetary system will collapse like the twin towers of the World Trade Center .
And this is the situation that we are confronted with .
Look at it this way .
There is a casino where the lucky gamblers can gamble risk - free .
Their bets are " on the house . "
This casino is the U.S. bond market .
There is only one catch .
The pile of the winning chips in front of each gambler may become irredeemable at the exit when the hairy godfather waves his magic wand .
As the gold markets enter their phase of permanent backwardation , all rational basis for holding U.S. Treasury debt -- or any debt , for that matter -- will disappear .
There will be a mad rush to the exits , and holders of debt will trample one another to death in trying to cash in on their winnings .
In July I attended the Santa Colomba Conference 2009 at the Palazzo Mundell near Siena , Italy .
There were 50 people in attendance by invitation of Robert Mundell of Columbia University , recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics 10 years ago .
They were mostly officials of various treasuries and central banks , ambassadors , bankers , professors of monetary economics , authors of monographs , and editors of financial journals .
Paul Volcker , a former U.S. Treasury official and chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , was present .
Prior to the conferernce I circulated several papers among the participants .
I was trying to show that the cataclysmic nature of the present credit crisis could not be understood without trying to understand gold , the ultimate extinguisher of debt .
We are all passengers on a runaway train on a down - sloping track , the brakes of which ( gold ) have been dismantled at the top of the hill .
The train is picking up speed beyond any safe limit , and a crash appears inevitable .
Our gracious host and the chairman , Professor Mundell , made two references to gold during the two days of the conference , asserting that , apart from wartime , the gold standard has been the most crisis - free monetary system in history .
( Of course , all monetary system have a habit of breaking down during wars . )
Yet not one participant picked up the ball dropped by Mundell .
They kept talking about " green shoots , " the recovery of the stock markets , and coming bailouts and stimulation packages .
As to my papers stating that this crisis is a gold crisis , I got just one bit of feedback , in private .
Apparently the rest of the participants have been turned off by the four - letter word " gold . "
It was not worth their while to read the ramblings of this loner on the problem of " putting spent toothpaste back into the tube . "
One of my papers was an open letter addressed to Volcker .
In it I asked whether there were contingency plans in the Treasury or Federal Reserve to meet the coming crisis of permanent gold backwardation .
Volcker declined to answer my question , in public or in private .
I am inclined to think that there are no such contingency plans other than " muddling through , " as they have in all previous monetary crises .
None of the policy - makers sees the uniqueness of the coming and predictable crisis , or the need to confront it with a comprehensive plan .
There is an overwhelming unwillingness to admit that the international monetary system as now constituted has been built on quicksand .
It is a mere makeshift that took its origin in the last gold crisis of 1971 .
Cracks have been papered over as they appeared after every subsequent crisis .
Every opportunity to sit down and work out a permanent solution was passed up .
This seems to have worked well enough in the past .
Policy makers see no reason why it would not work in the future .
Yet the Last Contango in Washington will be different from all previous crises .
It will be elemental , devastating , and apocalyptic .
It will destroy virtually all paper wealth and render virtually all physical capital idle .
It will involve hordes of unemployed people roaming the streets , caring for no law and order , pillaging homes and institutions .
It will destroy our freedoms .
It may destroy our civilization unless we take protective action .
On the positive side , it will sweep away the complacency of the managers of the regime of irredeemable currency and fundamentally weaken the sway of Keynesian and Friedmanite economics as it has a stranglehold on the teaching of economic science .
The Last Contango in Washington will eclipse the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Be prepared .

Social networks like MySpace still cannot be held responsible for assaults that happen offline , according to California 's Second District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles .
The court was asked to review the case of four underage girls ( referred to as Julie Does ) who , along with their parents , had sued MySpace for gross negligence and strict product liability after they were all sexually assaulted by older men whom they met on the service .
Despite the scary circumstances in which these events took place , the judge said that MySpace was protected under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and could not be held liable .
Who 's responsible for safety ?
Each of the Julie Does were between the ages of 13 and 15 at the time of their assaults .
The girls all met their assaulters on MySpace — men who ranged in age from 18 to 25 — despite MySpace 's automatic settings that keep the profiles of anyone under 15 private by default .
Some of these assaults were truly terrifying — according to court documents , Julie Doe III was drugged and " brutally sexually assaulted , " while Julie Doe IV was drugged by the guy she met plus one of his friends , who then " took turns sexually assaulting her . "
Some of the men in question have been handed prison sentences already , though others are still awaiting trial .
In each of the cases , the plaintiffs accused MySpace of making a conscious decision not to implement " reasonable , basic safety precautions with regard to protecting young children from sexual predators " despite being acutely aware of the dangers posed to minors .
The Does did not succeed at pushing this argument at the trial court level , however , which ruled that MySpace was protected by Section 230 of the CDA .
This is the same part of the law that has protected craigslist from being held responsible for discriminatory housing ads and SexSearch.com from being held responsible after a man was convicted for having sex with a minor he met on the site .
The Julie Does responded by amending their complaints in an attempt to get around the CDA .
They said that their claims were not based on content posted by another member of the site ( which is largely what the CDA covers ) , but rather " MySpace 's failure to institute reasonable measures to prevent older users from directly searching out , finding , and or communicating with minors . "
Essentially , they were trying to argue that MySpace was not responsible for the messages that went back and forth between the victims and their assaulters , but rather that the site was responsible for not doing more to prevent the assaulters from finding the girls in the first place .
However , the complaint still does not avoid the immunity granted by section 230 . " [ T ] hey want MySpace to ensure that sexual predators do not gain access to ( i.e. , communicate with ) minors on its Web site .
That type of activity — to restrict or make available certain material — is expressly covered by section 230 , " wrote the appeals court .
Unsurprisingly , free speech advocates are applauding the decision .
" The idea is , you hold the speaker responsible , not the soapbox , " Electronic Frontier Foundation spokesperson Rebecca Jeschke told Reuters .
" If you want any kind of social interaction on the Internet this is very important . "

You have three things to do : ( 1 ) take the final exam ( worth 40 % of your grade ) ; ( 2 ) write a 3,000 - word essay on the theological significance of intelligent design ( worth 40 % of your grade ) ; ( 3 ) provide at least 10 posts defending ID that you ’ve made on “ hostile ” websites , the posts totalling 2,000 words , along with the URLs ( i.e. , web links ) to each post ( worth 20 % of your grade ) .
Hey , get this :
EXTRA CREDIT :
For those who think they need mercy on missed or poorly answered quizzes , please get Saul Alinsky ’s Rules for Radicals and write a 750 to 1000 word reflection on lessons to be drawn from that book for Christian apologetics .
It ’s charming to see how the allegedly conservative Discoveroids so eagerly embrace leftist gurus .
Dembski seems to be running some weird kind of left - wing creationist madrasah .
Everyone else is criticizing Dembski , but that ’s not your Curmudgeon ’s style .
Instead , we ’ll offer a helpful suggestion .
Hey , Dembski :
In the interest of — wink , wink — academic freedom , we suggest that as an alternative to trolling , your creationist students should be given equivalent credit for visiting a museum ( a real one ) and voiding their colons on the floor in front of the evolution exhibit .
There are several reasons why a creationist might prefer this to trolling : 1 ) it ’s just as persuasive ; 2 ) it feels just as good ; 3 ) it ’s probably healthier ; and 4 ) it ’ll make a longer - lasting statement — unlike websites , museum floors do n’t have a “ delete ” button .
Anyway , we advise Dembski ’s students not to waste their precious time at the Curmudgeon ’s place .
Creationists ’ comments are swiftly deleted here .

Mayo Clinic researchers are reporting positive results in early leukemia clinical trials using the chemical epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) , an active ingredient in green tea .
The trial determined that patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) can tolerate the chemical fairly well when high doses are administered in capsule form and that lymphocyte count was reduced in one - third of participants .
" We found not only that patients tolerated the green tea extract at very high doses , but that many of them saw regression to some degree of their chronic lymphocytic leukemia , " says Tait Shanafelt , M.D. , Mayo Clinic hematologist and lead author of the study .
" The majority of individuals who entered the study with enlarged lymph nodes saw a 50 percent or greater decline in their lymph node size . "
CLL is the most common subtype of leukemia in the United States .
Currently it has no cure .
Blood tests have enabled early diagnosis in many instances ; however , treatment consists of watchful waiting until the disease progresses .
Statistics show that about half of patients with early stage diseases have an aggressive form of CLL that leads to early death .
Researchers hope that EGCG can stabilize CLL for early stage patients or perhaps improve the effectiveness of treatment when combined with other therapies .
The research has moved to the second phase of clinical testing in a follow - up trial -- already fully enrolled -- involving roughly the same number of patients .
All will receive the highest dose administered from the previous trial .
These clinical studies are the latest steps in a multiyear bench - to - bedside project that began with tests of the green tea extract on cancer cells in the laboratory of Mayo hematologist Neil Kay , M.D. , a co-author on this article .
After laboratory research showed dramatic effectiveness in killing leukemia cells , the findings were applied to studies on animal tissues and then on human cells in the lab .
In the first clinical trial , 33 patients received variations of eight different oral doses of Polyphenon E , a proprietary compound whose primary active ingredient is EGCG .
Doses ranged from 400 milligrams ( mg ) to 2,000 mg administered twice a day .
Researchers determined that they had not reached a maximum tolerated dose , even at 2,000 mg twice per day .
The findings appear online May 26 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology .
The study was sponsored by Mayo Clinic , the CLL Global Research Foundation , CLL Topics ( including contributions by individual CLL patients ) and the Commonwealth Foundation for Cancer Research .
Medication for the study was provided by Polyphenon E International .
Others on the research team were Timothy Call , M.D. ; Clive Zent , M.D. ; Betsy LaPlant ; Deborah Bowen ; Michelle Roos ; Charla Secreto ; Asish Ghosh , Ph.D. ; Brian Kabat ; Diane Jelinek , Ph.D. ; and Charles Erlichman , M.D. , all of Mayo Clinic ; and Mao-Jung Lee , Ph.D. , and Chung Yang , Ph.D. , both of Rutgers University .
To regard human beings as tools — as instruments — for the use of other human beings is not only unscientific but it is repugnant , stupid and short sighted .
Alfred Korzybski ( 3 July 1879 – 1 March 1950 ) was a Polish engineer , mathematician , and philosopher , most famous for creating the theory of General Semantics .

Manhood of Humanity ( 1921 ) [ edit ]
Alfred Korzybski ( 1921 ) , Manhood of Humanity : The Science and Art of Human Engineering , New York : E. P. Dutton & Company .
Let us imagine that the aboriginal - original human specimen was one of two brother apes , A and B ; they were alike in every respect ; both were animal space - binders ; but something strange happened to B ; he became the first time - binder , a human . …
He had thus a new faculty , he belonged to a new dimension ; but , of course , he did not realize it ; and because he had this new capacity he was able to analyze his brother " A " ; he observed " A is my brother ; he is an animal ; but he is my brother ; therefore , I AM AN ANIMAL . "
This fatal first conclusion , reached by false analogy , by neglecting a fact , has been the chief source of human woe for half a million years and it still survives . …
He [ then ] said to himself , " If I am an animal there is also in me something higher , a spark of some thing supernatural . " p. 67 .
Chapter : What is Man ?
Humans can be literally poisoned by false ideas and false teachings .
Many people have a just horror at the thought of putting poison into tea or coffee , but seem unable to realize that , when they teach false ideas and false doctrines , they are poisoning the time - binding capacity of their fellow men and women .
One has to stop and think !
There is nothing mystical about the fact that ideas and words are energies which powerfully affect the physico - chemical base of our time - binding activities .
Humans are thus made untrue to " human nature . " …
The conception of man as a mixture of animal and supernatural has for ages kept human beings under the deadly spell of the suggestion that , animal selfishness and animal greediness are their essential character , and the spell has operated to suppress their REAL HUMAN NATURE and to prevent it from expressing itself naturally and freely .

Tools are made by man but have not the autonomy of their maker — they have not man 's time - binding capacity for initiation , for self - direction , and self - improvement .
Such as contribute most to human progress and human enlightenment — men like Gutenberg , Copernicus , Newton , Leibnitz , Watts , Franklin , Mendeleieff , Pasteur , Sklodowska - Curie , Edison , Steinmetz , Loeb , Dewey , Keyser , Whitehead , Russell , Poincaré , William Benjamin Smith , Gibbs , Einstein , and many others — consume no more bread than the simplest of their fellow mortals .
Indeed such men are often in want .
How many a genius has perished inarticulate because unable to stand the strain of social conditions where animal standards prevail and " survival of the fittest " means , not survival of the " fittest in time - binding capacity , " but survival of the strongest in ruthlessness and guile — in space - binding competition !

1933 ; Lancaster ( Penn . ) 1941 .
There is a fundamental confusion between the notion of the older ' semantics ' as connected with a theory of verbal ' meaning ' and words defined by words , and the present theory of ' general semantics ' where we deal only with neuro - semantic and neuro - linguistic living reactions of Smith , Smith , etc. , as their reactions to neuro - semantic and neuro - linguistic environments as environments .
p. vii , as cited in : Schaff ( 1962;91 )

The only link between the verbal and objective world is exclusively structural , necessitating the conclusion that the only content of all " knowledge " is structural .
Now structure can be considered as a complex of relations , and ultimately as multi-dimensional order .
From this point of view , all language can be considered as names for unspeakable entities on the objective level , be it things or feelings , or as names of relations .
In fact ... we find that an object represents an abstraction of a low order produced by our nervous system as the result of a sub- microscopic events acting as stimuli upon the nervous system .

Quotes about Alfred Korzybski [ edit ]
" What is good in Korzybski 's work , " they say , " is not new , and what is new is not good . "
On the other hand , many " Korzybski-ites " proclaim that Korzybski's work has " nothing to do " with semantics .
They go so far as to say that the very term " general semantics " was an unfortunate choice ; that had Korzybski known what confusion would arise between semantics and general semantics he would not have used it at all .
Korzybski himself has maintained that while semantics belongs to the philosophy of language and perhaps to the theory of knowledge , general semantics belongs to empirical science : that it is the foundation of a science of man , the basis of the first " non-aristotelian system , " which has had no predecessor and which no academic semanticist has ever achieved .
Anatol Rapoport ( 1950 ) , " What is Semantics ? " , p. 14
Korzybski's book Science and Sanity is quite useless as a source of information about general semantics .
It is embarrassingly vague and dilettantish , and greatly oversized at that ( nearly 800 pages ) .
I can , however , recommend three excellent articles from the collection Language , Meaning and Maturity , New York 1954 , which includes selected papers chosen first of all from the periodical ETC for the period 1943 - 53 .
I mean the above mentioned work by Anatol Rapoport , " What Is Semantics ? " and two works by S. I. Hayakawa : " Semantics .
General Semantics and Related Disciplines " and " What Is Meant by Aristotelian Structure of Language ? " Adam Schaff ( 1962 ) .

Scientific language , which Korzybski used as his model of sane language , is almost exclusively extensional and denotative , or at least tries to be .
The language of the mentally ill , most obviously " un-sane , " is almost totally intensional and connotative .
This is the language that does not correspond to anything " out there , " and this is , in fact , how and perhaps even why the user is mentally ill .
Korzybski's concern with keeping the conscious " connection " or correspondence between language and verifiable referents is , for all practical purposes , paralleled by the process of psychotherapy .
In this process , which is largely " just talk , " the purpose is to foster closer and more accurate correspondence between the patient 's language and externally verifiable meanings .

I can't make any sense of the government 's attitude to financial risk .
When big companies or rich individuals are willing to take it , the official view is that they must be rewarded for having the courage to gamble .
That 's why PFI schemes are potentially so profitable for the private sector , why bankers still get bonuses , and why profits on share dealings are taxed at less than income .
Yet when it comes to the poorest people , the policy now is to push them into taking tremendous risks , with a high probability of loss , and no corresponding hope of tremendous gains .
The welfare - to - work reforms are intended to discourage everyone but the very ill or disabled from leading a life on benefits .
Fine , except for two problems .
The first one we all know about : as last week 's figures made plain , the jobs are n't there .
The second problem is just as serious .
Jobs are n't what they were .
The government and the welfare system tend to talk and act as if finding work is the end of the problem , and as if happy jobseekers will have nothing left to think about except the gold watch they 'll receive when they retire .
But many jobs on offer , particularly those advertised in jobcentres , are precarious , temporary or part - time , or have uncertain hours .
Leaving the security of benefits for jobs like these is like stepping out on to cracking ice .
And our antiquated welfare system has n't worked out where the life rafts and lifebelts ought to be .
Maeve McGoldrick , of the charity Community Links , which works with unemployed people in east London , says the benefits system simply can't cope with modern working life .
It is designed for predictability , and that is just what has become so elusive , particularly at the bottom of the market .
If a single mother , say , is offered a steady minimum - wage job for 24 hours a week , the system can deal very effectively with that .
It can calculate the tax credits and the housing benefit subsidy that will make work pay .
It falls apart , though , when it has to respond to fluctuating incomes or rapid changes in people 's circumstances .
McGoldrick says the majority of benefit claimants are now going into unstable jobs .
They may be commission - based , or agency work , or zero -hours contracts .
That means the income and hours worked can vary wildly from week to week .
Someone on zero hours , perhaps with a shop or a cleaning firm , may have to be available for work at any time over a 40 - hour working week .
But there 's no corresponding requirement on the employer actually to give them anything to do .
So a worker may do a three - hour stint one week , 17 hours the next , 32 in the third week , and four hours at the end of the month .
Trying to deal with that sends benefit offices into meltdown .
People earning a low wage can still be entitled to all kinds of financial help .
But if their incomes fluctuate from week to week , so will their entitlement , and the system can't keep up .
Weekly changes must be reported , and it can take weeks for each claim to be processed .
Meanwhile , panicking claimants may find that their housing benefit has been cut or suspended , or their jobseeker 's allowance withdrawn , on the assumption that what they earned three weeks ago is what they 're earning now .
The system is just as bad at responding to people who leave benefit for what turns out to be a short - term job .
Housing benefit is supposed to run on for the first month in work , while people wait to be paid , but half of all claimants do n't get it because that 's not generally known .
The Department for Work and Pensions claims to have a rapid return scheme to make it easier for long - term claimants who are laid off to get their allowances back .
In this age , you might expect that an official could just push a button for payments to restart .
Not at all .
Claimants must queue , phone offices and wait – frequently for weeks .
Delays like these mean nothing to people who have savings and equity and jobs .
They are savage , searing experiences to those who live as close to the edge as long - term claimants inevitably do .
These people have no resources .
A month or more without income can be just what it takes to pitch people into the arms of loan sharks , or find themselves in terrifying rent arrears .
Kate Wareing at Oxfam says that housing benefit is so badly run that it often takes six weeks to be reinstated .
That causes immense stress .
People sometimes lose their homes in that time .
The news that jobs of some kinds can't be trusted , and that the system wo n't protect you if you take them , runs like bush fire through New Deal courses .
It makes people scared to leave what they know .
That 's rational .
They may not have much but , if they stay put , at least they can be sure that their homes and essential bills will be paid for .
As the TUC 's report on vulnerable employment said last year , for this group " security of income has to be a priority .
The risks of a catastrophic fall in income when they change benefit status are too great . "
The significance of this widespread fear and insecurity is hopelessly underplayed .
The government thinks , for instance , that its tax credit scheme to support people in work is the answer .
Yet that too can make life worse for those who earn erratically , or switch between jobs and the dole .
At the end of the year , poor families can be asked to repay thousands of pounds – a shock they cannot absorb .
Instead , they may decide not to risk official work at all .
The government sticks to its mantra that work will always pay .
It preaches the virtues of entering the workplace , in any form , on the assumption that low - paid jobs are just a starting point , and that people can work their way up .
Its extra financial help to single mothers working under the New Deal runs out after a year , presumably because it thinks the mothers will be on higher pay by then .
That 's unlikely .
A Treasury analysis in 1999 warned that low - paid jobs were rarely a ladder to high - paid ones .
The days of moving from being a teaboy to MD have long gone , partly because the teaboy will now work , often precariously , for a contract catering company , and the MD wo n't ever know his name .
We have to deal with this new reality .
Otherwise it will make sense for people to cling to benefits , some constructing their own safety nets by working on the side .
The TUC and several of the poverty action groups think that nothing less than a rethinking of the welfare system for the 21st century will do .
Our government is responsible because it embraced the culture of flexible workforces and contracting out .
Companies have cut their risk by transferring it to the lowest possible level – the low - skilled worker .
These people are taking the full force of the economic storm , and yet they are the least able to bear it , either financially or psychologically .
There is now a whole stratum of individuals who are likely to spend their lives spinning between low pay and no pay .
The only way to make that tough existence even tolerable is to make the bridges and financial supports between the two much stronger than they are now .
Dear Garry .
I 've decided to end it all :
The full stop that trapped a killer
When police inspector Garry Weddell learned that his wife , Sandra , was having an affair , his revenge took the form of what he hoped would be the perfect crime .
Strangling the 44 - year - old nurse at their home in Bedfordshire in January 2007 , he put a cable tie around her neck and hung her body in their garage to make it look as if she had killed herself .
Next to it he placed a single sheet of A4 paper on which he had typed her ' suicide note ' - wearing rubber gloves to ensure he left no evidence .
Crime uncovered : Garry Weddell , right , murdered his wife Sandra and tried to pass her death off as a suicide
Weddell 's ingenuity drew on everything he had learned during 25 years in the force , but it did not help him evade capture , and some remarkable detective work led to his arrest .
Just months later , while free on bail , he travelled to the home of his mother - in - law , Traute Maxfield , in rural Hertfordshire , and shot her dead before turning the gun on himself .
In the ensuing controversy about how he had been freed to kill again , little attention was paid to the story of how his crime was uncovered .
But now a new book reveals how just one misjudged full stop on the forged suicide note contributed to his downfall .
To the book 's author , John Olsson , a dubious full stop can be as revelatory a clue as a blood - stained footprint or discarded weapon would be to a conventional sleuth .
A veteran of more than 300 investigations into crimes ranging from extortion to murder , Olsson is one of the leading experts in a still emerging field known as ' forensic linguistics ' .
His skill lies in identifying a suspect 's ' linguistic fingerprint ' - the distinctive use of language which makes each of us unique , whether we are writing letters , emails or mobile phone texts .
Thanks to Olsson and his colleaues and their work , police no longer have to depend on a crooked ' c ' or a missing ' m ' on a suspect 's typewriter to establish whether they have written an incriminating document .
Even in today 's high - tech culture , when villains use seemingly identical computers and mobiles in pursuit of their crimes , these modern - day Sherlock Holmeses can still track them down - simply through their choice of words , spacing and punctuation .
To understand how they go about this , we need to explore the origins of a technique which was most famously used in the conviction of American ' Unabomber ' Ted Kaczynski .
Word sleuth : John Olsson has helped solve hundreds of crimes by investigating the way suspects write
In 1978 , he began an 18 - year bombing spree which killed three people and injured many more .
He was caught in 1996 only after his brother David spotted similarities between phrases used in letters he'd received from Kaczynski and those sent to the New York Times by the Unabomber .
The investigation and Kaczynski's imprisonment for life were hailed as early successes for forensic linguists employed by the FBI .
Yet their methods were originally developed in Britain as a result of the notorious murders at 10 Rillington Place .
In 1953 , John Christie was executed for strangling seven women and a baby at this house in London 's Notting Hill .
With gruesome irony , he was hanged on the same gallows used to dispatch his 25 - year - old lodger Timothy Evans , wrongfully convicted of two of the murders in 1950 .
Though Evans was mentally retarded , and there were many inconsistencies in the case against him , his name was only cleared following a high - profile media campaign in the Sixties .
This attracted the attention of Professor Jan Svartvik , a Swedish linguist then working at the University of London .
He analysed Evans 's alleged confession for what linguists call ' register ' , a measure of how colloquially a person speaks .
Concluding that the confession contained many examples of ' policeman 's register ' , the formal language used by officers giving evidence in court , he concluded that it was unlikely to have been taken down verbatim from Evans and this helped prove his innocence .
The posthumous pardon Evans received in 1966 helped bring about the abolition of capital punishment three years later .
But this came too late for another alleged killer , whose name would also be cleared thanks to extraordinary research by forensic linguists .
Incriminating punctuation : From looking at other letters written by Sandra and Gary Weddell , Olsson discovered she was unlikely to have made this grammatical error - but he often did
Like Evans , Derek Bentley had a low IQ and he was just 19 when he was hanged in 1953 for the murder of a policeman during a break - in at a warehouse in Croydon .
Bentley 's conviction hinged largely upon his confession , and his claim that the police ' helped ' him with it was tested 40 years later by Malcolm Coulthard , then a linguist at the University of Birmingham .
What struck Coulthard was the unusually frequent use of the word ' then ' in Bentley 's ' confession ' .
In samples of everyday English , this word occurs on average only once every 474 words , but in Bentley 's statement it cropped up once in every 60 .
Rather than reading like run -of - the - mill English , this was much closer to the frequency found in samples of police reports in which the tell - tale ' then ' appeared once every 78 words .
Together with other evidence , this helped win a pardon for Derek Bentley in 1998 , adding to the growing credibility of forensic linguistics .
A postgraduate linguist alongside Coulthard while he was working on the Bentley documents , John Olsson began specialising in this new discipline in 1994 and he was soon working on murder enquiries across the country .
Few killers he came across went to such lengths to avoid detection as Sandra Weddell 's husband Garry .
The discovery of Sandra 's body at their shared home shocked friends and neighbours .
The popular mother - of - three was a devout Christian known for her kindness to others and they found it difficult to accept that she could have committed suicide .
Furthermore , detectives had concerns about the ligature placed around her neck .
Crime records suggested that , where cable ties had been implicated in previous deaths , they were always murders and never suicides .
Also , bruises on the body suggested that Sandra might have struggled with an attacker before she died .
This still left the question of the suicide note .
Could Olsson prove that it was bogus and , if so , that its author was Garry Weddell ?
Olsson 's experience found that faked suicide notes reflected society 's preconceptions about suicide victims being weak and unable to face their difficulties .
Justice : Olsson helped catch the man who murdered teen Jenny Nicholl after analysing text messages he sent from her mobile
Those who forge such notes frequently use words such as ' crazy ' , ' cowardly ' and ' selfish ' , but these are rarely found in the genuine items .
According to this reasoning , Sandra Weddell might well have killed herself , since her apparent suicide note made no reference to insanity or weakness .
But given her husband 's experience of police work , he might well have known which sentiments would ring true to the detectives .
His involvement could still not be ruled out .
In trying to establish the note 's authenticity , Olsson began looking for other clues , including the spelling , which could often betray the perpetrator of a crime .
In 2005 , Olssen had been called in by police investigating the disappearance of 19 - year - old Jenny Nicholl from her home in Richmond , Yorkshire .
For some time after the last sighting of Jenny , her parents received texts from her phone and the police were concerned that they were sent by an abductor who wanted to pretend that she had left home of her own free will .
Scrutinising these messages , Olsson discovered that they were longer than those known to have been sent by Jenny before she disappeared , and there were also differences in style .
Where Jenny tended to leave few spaces in her text - speak , using phrases like ' ave2 go ' to mean ' have to go ' , the later texts introduced gaps so that they read ' ave 2 go ' .
These small differences proved significant when , last year , Jenny 's boyfriend David Hodgson , a 47 - year - old married man with two children , stood trial for her murder .
Her body was never found , but the case against Hodgson included evidence from Coulthard , by then Professor of Forensic Linguistics at the University of Aston .
Coulthard had compared messages sent from Jenny 's phone with a selection sent from Hodgson 's mobile .
Abbreviations such as ' aint ' and ' didnt ' were found in both Hodgson 's texts and those sent from Jenny 's missing mobile , along with spelling mistakes such as ' mite ' instead of ' might ' , and ' of ' instead of ' off ' .
These findings helped bring about Hodgson 's conviction for murder and he was jailed for 18 years .
The problem for John Olsson was that there were no obvious spelling mistakes in the suicide note found in the Weddell 's garage , or in letters written by Sandra or her husband .
He would have to dig deeper .
In dealing with such cases , what he and his colleagues are looking for is sometimes smaller than the tiny specks of evidence sought by police forensics officers at crime scenes .
In 2005 , Olsson found himself on the trail of a comma .
That case concerned Julie Turner , a 40 - year - old mother - of - two who was last seen at her home in Sheffield .
Suspicion quickly fell on Howard Simmerson , a businessman with whom she had been having an affair .
Killer : Howard Simmerson was jailed for the murder of his girlfriend thanks to Olsson 's forensic linguistic investigations
But , although he admitted pressing Julie to leave her husband and move in with him , he claimed not to have seen her , and even to have received a text from her which effectively dumped him .
It read : ' Sucker .im stopping at my friends .
dont bother looking for me .'
Reading this , Olsson 's eye fell upon the full - stop which came immediately after ' Sucker ' .
Most people would put a comma there , but this matched the punctuation in a letter which had been written by Simmerson and later seized by police .
This suggested that he was the author of the messages .
The missing person inquiry became a murder hunt - with Julie 's body found in an oil drum in a scrapyard .
She had been shot through the head .
Less than six months after Julie went missing , Simmerson was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to life in prison .
Taken on their own , Olsson 's findings would not have been enough to convict him , but they made a vital contribution to establishing his guilt , just as they would in identifying Garry Weddell as his wife 's killer .
Olsson 's breakthrough in the Weddell ' suicide ' also depended on his eye for detail .
What finally struck him was the brevity of the sentences in Sandra Weddell 's alleged suicide note - and a quirk in its punctuation .
In a chilling echo of the Julie Turner texts , the first full stop appeared immediately after she had supposedly written her husband 's name .
It was this full stop that drew Olsson 's attention .
' Garry .
I am typing this note , because I know that if I were to hand write it and leave it for you , then I know that you would n't read it .
' I am so sorry for all the hurt I have caused you garry .
I never meant to hurt you or cause you so much pain . '
Brief , to the point - and peppered with full stops , most notably the first one - the letter was very unlike others known to have been written by Sandra , who favoured long rambling sentences , sprinkled with commas , dashes and semi-colons .
In fact , one of her past sentences was more than 130 words long - compared to the average word length of only 12 words per sentence in the suicide note .
Much closer to the style of what was allegedly her final missive were letters written by her husband who used full stops liberally and whose sentences averaged only nine words .
It was this and other evidence that convinced the police to charge Garry Weddell with murder - with the tragic consequences that followed .

A lot of folks have asked what I think of the essay “ The Omnivore ’s Delusion : Against the Agri-intellectuals , ” by Missouri corn / soy farmer Blake Hurst , published in The American , the journal of the right - wing American Enterprise Institute .
My first reaction is that I ’m thrilled this debate is taking place .
The sustainable - food movement needs to step up and start grappling with big questions .
I ’ve said for a while that I see three big challenges for the sustainable - food movement as it scales up : 1 ) soil fertility –in the absence of synthesized nitrogen and mined phosphorous and potassium , how are we to build soil fertility on a larger scale ? ; 2 ) labor–sustainable farming requires more hands on the ground ; who ’s going to work our farm fields , and at what wages ? ; and 3 ) access–in an economy built on long - term wage stagnation , how can we make sustainably grown food accessible to everyone ?
Hurst ’s essay begins to engage these questions –sort of .
I do n’t have the time or energy right now to take it on point by point .
But I will say that the discussion would be much richer if he acknowledged a few serious questions about the industrial - farming model he champions .
For example , he barely acknowledges climate change .
The EPA reckons [ PDF ] that half of U.S. greenhouse - gas emissions from agriculture come from fertilizer - related nitrous oxide–a greenhouse gas some 300 times more potent than carbon .
The Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen , an atmospheric chemist , has concluded [ PDF ] that the EPA is dramatically underestimating the amount of nitrous oxide produced by industrial farming .
Given that reality and the looming climate emergency , how long can U.S. farmers keep churning out titanic corn harvests ?
Hurst never goes there .
Of course , he ’s vice president of his state ’s branch of the American Farm Bureau Federation , which has both been vigorously fighting climate legislation ( on the grounds that climate change is a myth ) [ PDF ] and campaigning to make sure that any bill that gets though Congress has plenty of goodies for agribusiness .
So maybe be does n’t consider nitrous oxide emissions a problem ?
Another limiting factor is petroleum scarcity .
According to Hurst ’s byline at the bottom of the article , “ In a few days he will spend the next six weeks on a combine . ”
A combine is a massive , diesel - sucking machine .
How long does
Hurst expect to be able to casually spend six weeks burning gallon after gallon of diesel amid limited global petroleum supplies ( not to mention climate impacts ) ?
Again , no mention of energy scarcity .
( Cue “ drill , baby , drill ” plea from the Farm Bureau ? )
Then there ’s the whole problem of ecological blowback .
Hurst venerates large - scale confinement livestock operations –but he does n’t mention that these facilities rely on a prodigious cocktail of antibiotics to keep animals alive and growing .
Now we ’re getting outbreaks of antibiotic - resistant salmonella and staph ( MRSA ) directly linked to factory animal farms .
There ’s the distinct possibility that the latest novel swine flu strain emerged from the fecal mire of a vast hog operation .
How long does
Hurst think we can control these potentially deadly diseases ?
Also on the topic of ecological pushback , Hurst champions the practice known as chemical no-till–planting herbicide - tolerant GM seeds and then dousing the field with weed killer .
There ’s little evidence that this practice sequesters carbon in the soil ( see here and here ) – but plenty of evidence that it ’s generating herbicide - resistant “ superweeds . ”
Again , what ’s the plan–just a steady rollout of new poison - tolerant seed combos to clean up the messes of the previous ones ?
Finally–and this may be the most egregious omission , given that he ’s writing for a Cheneyite rag–Hurst fails to acknowledge that his farming style depends on a steady stream of government aid .
I personally believe that our society should support farmers , and that our commodity - subsidy system could be re-jiggered to support sustainable farming .
Indeed , for the reasons given above , I believe sustainable farming will remain forever a niche unless that happens .
Yet if I were writing for a think tank that ’s devoted itself for decades to dismantling state spending ( except for on military adventures and hardware ) , I might feel obliged to defend or at least acknowledge this position .
Yet Hurst is silent .
Let ’s have a look –shall we not ? –at the Environmental Working Group ’s commodity - subsidy database .
it ’s the black book of right - wing Farm Bureau types .
According to his bio , Hurst farms in Atchison County , Mo. EWG informs us that farmers in Atchison drew in a cool $ 131 million in government commodity payments between 1995 and 2006 .
That ’s good enough for 11th place among Missouri ’s 50 counties .
Drilling down , we find that Hurst himself took home $ 242,600 in that period ; and three close relations took in $ 400,000 , $ 388,000 , and $ 347,000 , respectively .
That ’s a cool $ 1.4 million in U.S. treasury cash for the family over 12 years .
Now , hold your howls of outrage .
These are corn and soy farmers .
They buy tremendous amounts of fertilizers and poisons ; they buy pricey GMO seeds from Monsanto ; they ’re paying huge notes on those combines , which they have to maintain and supply with diesel ; and they ’re selling their produce into a grain market largely controlled by two companies ( Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland ) that for most of those years paid them less than the price of production .
In other words , your $ 1.4 million payment to the Hursts did n’t likely stay long in family bank accounts .
More likely , it quickly passed into the coffers of Monsanto , John Deere , Mosaic ( the fertilizer giant two - thirds owned by Cargill ) , and other input suppliers .
( Of course , in the past couple of years , corn / soy farmers have seen lower subsidies and higher grain prices–borne up by another government program , corn ethanol . )
You see , while their friends at the American Enterprise Institute might mock them as such , it ’s not the Hursts who are “ welfare queens ” here .
It ’s their agribusiness suppliers and buyers .
And we ca n’t really debate the food system until we acknowledge their massive vested interest in it–and their vast political power , which they ’re not shy about using to maintain their income streams .
I look forward to participating in this debate as it plays out .

American women are preparing for protests this weekend against laws which allow men to remove their shirts in public , but treat women who do the same as guilty of misdemeanour .
The action will take place on Sunday 23 August when , according to the gotopless website ( PNSFW ) , " topless women will rally in great numbers across the USA to protest this gross inequality in the law and will demand that they be granted the fundamental right to be topless where men already enjoy that right according to the 14th amendment of the Constitution " .
The event is timed to coincide with the month in which the US constitution was amended to grant women the right to vote , and while bound to cause some amusement , there are grave stories behind it .
In 2002 , young mother and Peruvian immigrant Jacqueline Mercado had her children taken into care after family pictures of her bathing and breastfeeding them were flagged as " suspicious " by a photo lab technician .
Police raided the family home , and Ms Mercado and her partner were investigated in respect of child porn charges .
The indictment clearly characterised breastfeeding as sexual .
It charged Ms Mercado with " actual lewd exhibition of ... a portion of the female breast below the top of the areola , and the said defendant did and then employ , authorize and induce Rodrigo Fernandez , a child younger than 18 years of age , to engage in said sexual conduct and sexual performance " .
The case was eventually dropped and the family reunited .
Evidence of this blind sexualisation - even pornification - of breasts in any context is widespread .
Any public exposure ( such as Janet Jackson 's infamous Superbowl wardrobe malfunction ) is apt to cause outrage , clamours for apology and a flurry of legal action .
The Facebook ban on breastfeeding pictures , which has evoked a lengthy and at times virulent protest on its own pages , continues .
According to Facebook , it does " allow mothers to ... share photos of themselves breast - feeding " but not photos of a fully exposed breast - clearly this crosses a line of acceptability .
The gotopless site provides a long list of similar , lower profile stories .
Most recently it wrote about Gloria Stovell , a 27 - year - old Portland State University student who claims that two male Wackenhut security officers harassed her for attempting to ride the city 's light railway while topless .
This alleged incident occurred just a day after Portland police mostly turned a blind eye to the World Naked Bike Ride 's parade of nudes of both sexes on June 13 .
A week later , a San Diego art festival banned nipples from display .
While the focus of the gotopless campaign is legal discrimination against women , in the smut - averse US even male nipples can occasionally come in for censure , as one Cincinnatti man discovered to his cost a few years back , when he was charged with indecency for displaying his breasts in public .
Clearly the US has issues here ; but Europe , while historically more tolerant and broadminded , is also now displaying worrying tendencies to that end .
There is the case of Harrow council , echoed in other council interventions across the country , deeming female nudity not fit for family viewing .
Similarly , faux outrage ( PNSFW ) filled The Sun when model Kirsten Varley appeared nude on a Channel 4 lunchtime show Life Class , although the moral point was somewhat dimmed by the copious photographs with which the paper illustrated the piece .
It remains to be seen what , if anything , can be achieved by the US campaign , but if nothing else it indicates a growing backlash against stubborn puritanical attitudes which can cause real damage to the people they claim to be protecting . ®
Bootnote
However worthy the gotopless campaign , we are rather puzzled as to why it is underwritten by the Raelian Foundation , who appear to be acting under direct orders from " our human creators from outer space " .

Egy teljes napon át meztelenül dolgoztak egy Newcastle - i design és marketingcég munkatársai , hogy így javítsák a csapatszellemet .
David Taylor üzleti pszichológus azt javasolta egy Newcastle upon Tyne - i design - és marketingcég dolgozóinak , hogy fokozni fogja a csapatszellemet , ha egy napig meztelenül dolgoznak – olvasható a The Daily Telegraph online kiadásában .
A szakembert azért hívták a ki céghez , mert a hitelválság kezdetekor hat embert el kellett bocsátani .
A tanácsadó azt mondta a dolgozóknak , hogy így a gátlásaikat is levetkőzik , és nyíltabban , őszintébben tudnak egymással kommunikálni .
„ Arra kérni egy teljes szervezetet , hogy mászkáljanak meztelenül , a legszéls őségesebb technika , amelyet valaha is alkalmaztam .
Furcsán hat , de működik .
Ez a magukba vetett és az egymás iránti bizalom alapvető kifejezése ” – mondta Taylor .
A kezdeti húzódozás után csaknem mindenki teljesen levetkőzött .
„ Isteni volt .
Most , hogy láttuk egymást pucéron , nincsenek korlátaink .
Senki sem kényszerített minket .
Ha ruhában akartunk lenni vagy fehérneműben , azt is lehetett .
De én szeretem a testemet , és nem vagyok szégyenlős .
Mind szépek vagyunk , akár nagyobb testűek vagyunk , akár kicsik ” – mondta a 23 éves Sam Jackson , a két nő közül a teljes meztelenséget vállaló kolléga .
A kísérletet áprilisban filmre vették , és Meztelen Hivatal címmel júliusban fogja vetíteni egy kábeltévé - csatorna .
Meztelenkedéssel javítottak a munkahelyük közösségi szellemén ( hvg.hu )

In the final days before his infantry platoon entered Gaza last January against Hamas , " M. " and his reservist buddies were approached by a representative of the military rabbinate .
Would they be interested in a chat with a military clergyman during a break in training ?
With no objections , they were introduced to a " Rabbi Chen , " dressed in civilian clothes and red- bearded , who told the soldiers that " holiness of the people of Israel " would keep them safe .
The chat marked a more concerted effort by chief rabbi Brig .
Gen. Avichai Rontzki and the military rabbinate – traditionally simply a provider of such services as kosher food – to reach the hearts and minds of soldiers .
But what disturbed M. , who requested anonymity for fear of a court martial , was what he saw as a violation of the army 's code of ethics and ideological agnosticism .
Beyond charges of misconduct and war crimes , Israel 's recent war in Gaza against Hamas fanned accusations that Mr. Rontzki is trying to remake the soldiers in his own hard - line religious nationalist image .
At stake , critics warn , is the possible politicization of a military built as a people 's army above the political fray .
" All these activities of the chief rabbi totally contradict the norms and morals of our army .
We were raised on a humanistic army , " says Ran Cohen , a former parliamentarian from the secular left - wing party , Meretz .
" The minute our soldier will be educated as an antihumanistic soldier , it will destroy his moral resolve .
That is why it is dangerous , because it can change the character of the army . "
Beyond love of country , the core values of the Israel Defense Force ( IDF ) stress human dignity , life , and purity of arms – concepts meant to restrain force against noncombatants as well as proportionality .
But Chen said that " we should remember that this war is not just a regular war .
It 's the war of the children of light against the children of darkness ....
My first interpretation was that we are fighting a messianic war , " says M. , a reserve combat medic who hails from an Orthodox Jewish community in a West Bank settlement .
" For me , that completely contradicts the codes of war I learned as a young soldier .
Those ideals were dear to me . "
Pamphlet urged soldiers to show no mercy to ' cruel '
Soon after the war , the liberal Haaretz newspaper published excerpts from a pamphlet available in military synagogues that featured quotes from rabbinical scholars who argued that Palestinians were tantamount to foreigners and that soldiers should show no mercy to " the cruel . "
The pamphlet was printed by the rabbinate 's department for " Jewish awareness , " a new unit set up by Rontzki to help with outreach .
To be sure , Israel is not the only country where military chaplains discuss battlefield morals and the justification of war .
In the United Kingdom , military clergy lead discussions about war crimes and international conventions on war , says Tel Aviv University professor Asa Kasher , author of " The IDF Spirit , " a code of military ethics .
" Talking to the troops about the meaning of the war is a necessity , " he says .
" Meaning must be given . "
Discussions of war ethics and courage can be framed in a humanist or a religious discussion , Mr. Kasher says .
But the anecdotes about the rabbinate 's messages appear to undermine the IDF 's political neutrality as well as its effort to avoid harm to noncombatants , he says .
" Talking to them about who owns what parts of the Land of Israel ... is way beyond the limits . "
The Israeli army declined a request for an interview with Rontzki or any other representative of the chief rabbinate .
Army spokesman Elie Isaacson said the pamphlet and the motivational " chat " are viewed by the military as an " isolated " occurrence .
" Values are intrinsic to the way the Israeli army operates .
They are ... such a large part of the way you 're trained .
The military rabbinate is such a small unit .
Anything that they put out that would contradict the army line can't compete with what 's been drilled in from Day 1 , " says Mr. Isaacson .
Increase in religious nationalists
But in the past two decades , the face of the army 's combat corps has changed .
Nationalist religious conscripts have replaced soldiers from secular farming kibbutzim , and have risen to be mid-level officers .
A handful have become generals .
The more observant core might give a military chaplain more of an audience .
Hailing from Itamar , one of the more ideologically charged Jewish settlements in the West Bank , Rontski – also a former commando – was reportedly appointed to defuse a crisis of confidence between the army and national religious right after the 2005 evacuation of Gaza Strip settlements .
Religious settlers felt betrayed as the military carried out what they saw as an illegal policy ; youths debated whether to enlist .
Kasher said speculation about political appointments harms the army : " Ideally , I as a soldier , do n't know where my commander lives and what his political views are , " he says .
" Once ... there is a suspicion that his commands stem from his political position , that 's the end of discipline ....
That 's the end of being able to function as a combat unit . "
Chief rabbi ordered monthly Torah discussions
Regardless of questions surrounding the appointment , Rontzki sought a proactive role , bringing the rabbinate to soldiers instead of waiting to provide ritual needs .
He told an Israeli news outlet that he had ordered military rabbis to " ensure that every base and every platoon will have a discussion on [ the ]
Torah at least once a month . "
Rabbi Yuval Sherlow , who lost to Rontzki in heading the military rabbinate , gives him high marks .
" He sees himself as part of the spiritual leadership of the army , " he says .
" He 's speaking to soldiers and trying to improve their motivation and morality .
He spends the shabes [ Sabbath ] in the army .
He 's changed the status of rabbis in the army . "
But Rabbi Sherlow faults Rontzki for not anticipating the political fallout from spreading his spiritual beliefs .
Sherlow said that for Rontzki , issues like territorial compromise are , foremost , spiritual questions .
" Not withdrawing from territories for him is not a political issue but a spiritual issue , " Sherlow says of Rontzki , and that the rabbi feels " there 's no problem to disseminate that [ spiritual issue ] in the army . "
WASHINGTON  Former President Bill Clinton went to North Korea on Monday to negotiate the release of two American television journalists who were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor for illegally entering North Korean territory , a person who was briefed on the mission said .
Mr. Clinton landed in Pyongyang , the North Korean capital , early Tuesday morning local time , Central TV , a North Korean station , reported .
The White House declined to comment .
The journalists , Laura Ling , 32 , and Euna Lee , 36 , were detained by soldiers on March 17 near the North Korean border with China .
In June , they were sentenced to 12 years in a North Korean prison camp for “ committing hostilities against the Korean nation and illegal entry . ”

Binyam Mohamed has said he was tortured while in US custody
Two cabinet ministers have strongly denied allegations of collusion in the abuse of terrorist suspects overseas .
But Foreign Secretary David Miliband and Home Secretary Alan Johnson said it was impossible to remove all risk when using intelligence obtained overseas .
This came as a committee of MPs urged a probe into the transfer of terror suspects through UK territories .
Last week a committee of MPs and peers called for an independent inquiry into claims of UK complicity in torture .
The Joint Human Rights Committee said on Tuesday the government had not done enough to investigate these claims , because it had been unable to establish whether British officers were involved in mistreatment .
Now the Foreign Affairs Select Committee has also said it has grave concerns that British officers were complicit in torture .
' Hard choices '
But in a joint article in the Sunday Telegraph Mr Miliband and Mr Johnson said the UK " firmly opposed " torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment .
They said there was " no truth " in suggestions it was official policy to " collude in , solicit , or directly participate in abuses of prisoners " .
But " difficult judgments and hard choices " had to be made , they added , and while anyone detained in the UK would be treated well , the same guarantee could not be made about those held by foreign authorities .
" Operations have been halted where the risk of mistreatment was too high .
But it is not possible to eradicate all risk , " they wrote .
HAVE YOUR SAY I would prefer a practical real - world approach rather than an impossibly principled ' human rights ' one Jaques Hughes , Reading
The pair , whose departments are responsible for Britain 's intelligence services , were responding to Tuesday 's report , but MPs on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee also want action to ensure Britain is not complicit in torture .
Its chairman Labour MP Mike Gapes said : " The government has a duty to use information that comes into its possession , from whatever source and however obtained , if it believes this will avert the loss of life .
" At the same time , we strongly recommend that the government should continue to exert as much persuasion and pressure as possible to try to ensure world - wide that torture is not employed as a method of interrogation . "
The committee also said there had been inadequate investigation into the transportation of two men through the American airbase on the small British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia .
It said the government had a " moral and legal obligation " to ensure UK airspace and airports were not for rendition - which is the transfer of suspects to countries where torture is carried out .
And it urged ministers to pile pressure on the US to carry out a comprehensive check of its records to establish whether there have been other cases beyond two from 2002 it admitted last year .
Agency concern
The report warned of the dangers of turning a blind eye while using information obtained in countries known for their human rights abuses .
It said : " There is a risk that use of evidence which may have been obtained under torture on a regular basis ... could be construed as complicity in such behaviour . "
The committee had particular worries over Britain 's relationship with Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency , whose practices give " cause for great concern " .
It also accused the Foreign Office of " pulling its punches " over the " massive scale " of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia .
Mr Gapes also called on the government to publish the previous guidelines given to intelligence officers on the questioning of detainees overseas .
The committee rightly asks some very pointed questions about the use of UK airspace and territory
Tim Hancock
Amnesty International UK
The environment secretary , Hilary Benn , said the government 's position was " very clear . "
He added : " The government does not condone the use of torture , we are resolutely opposed to it , and that remains the case .
" Other countries , they 're responsible for what they do , but the position of the British government is absolutely clear . "
Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said a public inquiry was needed to " clear our name and remove the stain and the charge of hypocrisy " .
Scotland Yard is conducting a criminal investigation into claims MI5 was complicit in the abuse of Binyam Mohamed , a British resident who says he was tortured while being held at sites in Pakistan , Morocco and Afghanistan .
Tom Porteous , from Human Rights
Watch , said there should be a judicial inquiry .
" There are specific detailed and consistent allegations that have been made by my organisation , Human Rights Watch , by Amnesty International , by Reprieve , by other organisations and they need to be answered .
" Today again in the papers government ministers are here issuing blanket denials but not addressing the specific allegations and so there really is a need for a judicial inquiry . "
Inquiry call Amnesty International UK campaigns director Tim Hancock described the Foreign Affairs Select Committee report as " yet another voice in a growing chorus demanding greater transparency over the UK 's involvement in ' war on terror ' human rights abuses " .
He also demanded a full , independent inquiry .
" The committee rightly asks some very pointed questions about the use of UK airspace and territory , particularly Diego Garcia , in US rendition operations , " he said .
" Britain should stand firm in its opposition to torture , both through our words and our actions . "
Andrew Tyrie , the Tory MP who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition , said an inquiry should be held immediately .
" Neither the investigation by the police into the Binyam Mohamed case nor the other civil actions brought should stand in the way of getting to the bottom of this , " he said .
" It is the only way to give the public confidence that we have got to the bottom of all of this , to draw a line under it and to move on . "

BAGHDAD  Insurgents struck at the heart of the Iraqi government on Wednesday in two huge and deadly bombings that exposed a new vulnerability after Americans ceded control for security here on June 30 .
Nearby American soldiers stood by helplessly  despite the needs of hundreds of wounded lying among the dead  waiting for a request for assistance from Iraqi officials that apparently never came .
“ As much as we want to come , we have to wait to be asked now , ” said an American officer who arrived at one site almost three hours after the blast and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters .
At one blast site , American soldiers snapped pictures of the devastation before ducking out of the streets .
After weeks of escalating violence in Iraq , the powerful truck bombs on Wednesday killed at least 95 people and wounded nearly 600 at and around the Foreign and Finance Ministries in central Baghdad , assaults on symbols of government that lent an air of siege to the capital .
The bombs crippled the downtown area , closed highways and two main bridges over the Tigris River , and clogged hospitals with the wounded .
The bombings , the worst since American forces handed over security responsibilities for cities to Iraq at the end of June , shook the Iraqi government ’s confidence that it was ready and able to secure the nation .
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki called for a reassessment of his security measures , calling the attacks “ a vengeful response ” to his recent , optimistic order to remove blast walls from the streets of Baghdad .
A Defense Ministry spokesman , Maj. Gen. Mohammad al - Askari , was quoted by Reuters as telling American and Iraqi military officers : “ We must face the facts .
We must admit our mistakes , just as we celebrate our victories . ”
And Baghdad ’s security spokesman , Maj. Gen. Qassim al - Moussawi , told the state - owned television station Iraqiya , according to Reuters , that attacks were “ a security breach for which Iraqi forces must take most of the blame . ”
He said a number of security force officials were detained pending an investigation .

A senior Shiite politician went on Iraqiya to call on Mr. Maliki to fire the security and intelligence officials responsible for the areas that were attacked .
“ We must punish those who made mistakes , ” said the politician , Hadi al - Ameri .
The explosions , one close to the heavily fortified Green Zone and the other less than three miles away , sent plumes of smoke billowing over the capital , ripped a gaping hole in a compound wall and set cars ablaze , trapping drivers inside .
“ The whole thing is just so disgusting , ” the United States ambassador , Christopher R. Hill , said as he read reports from his staff about the extent of the damage while on an official visit to the northern city of Kirkuk .
“ They ’re just psychopathic . ”
Around 11 a.m. , the two truck bombs struck the Finance Ministry and the Foreign Ministry within three minutes , officials said , sending heavy smoke into the sky .
The first blast , near the Finance Ministry , killed at least 35 people , collapsed a main elevated highway nearby and left rubble littered with shrapnel and blood .
The second , more powerful blast near the Foreign Ministry killed at least 60 people , shattered windows inside the Green Zone and shook houses throughout Baghdad .
At roughly the same time , attacks in other parts of the city , including three roadside bombings and some mortar and rocket fire , left 17 people wounded , Iraqi officials said .
Though no one claimed responsibility for the attacks , Iraqis doled out blame both to their government and to the United States for coming to Iraq in the first place .
“ This country is finished , ” said one resident , Jamil Jaber , 45 , whose five - room home behind the Foreign Ministry had been flattened , crushing his 4 - month - old grandson .
“ It ’s just robbery and killing . ”
He cursed the United States and former President George W. Bush .
Since the beginning of July , bombings in northern Iraq  for which officials blamed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and an affiliate , the Islamic State of Iraq have killed at least 140 people .
The attacks on Wednesday might have been a signal from these groups that they could also assault the capital .
Every time a group of men under the age of 25 gathers for long periods of time , you can bet your last two cents that one of them ( probably you ) will be smoking weed .
Whether it's a road trip , a concert , or a day spent playing Halo 3 , someone is eventually going to bust out the green .
Most of your group is used to this , but there 's always the odd time a fresh face appears who may not be as chronic - minded as the rest of you , so you , being the good host ( and horrible corrupt person ) that you are , decide to let the newbie take a hit of the bong , just so he does n't feel left out .
What you do n't know is that you are about to set him up for one of the worst skull - fucks he could ever imagine .
The following is exactly what 's going through his mind as he smokes weed for the first time .
" I can't believe I 'm gonna go through with this , but I guess there 's a first time for everything .
You only live once , right ?
Huh , I thought it would look more like those leaves I 've seen on Dr. Dre albums ; this stuff just looks like little nuggets .
It looks like plant shit .
Okay so how does this work ?
I just suck until I get it all in my throat ?
Haha … that 's what she said .
Make a note to tell that to the guys .
They do n't seem amused by my witty observations , their loss .
Alright so I just light it and suck … .
HOLY SHIT !!!
That tastes like ass .
Seriously guys , that actually may be the most foul thing I 've inhaled since I visited my grandpa .
I 'm choking !!
Why can't I stop coughing ?
Is it possible to actually cough up a lung ?
This shit has been nothing but trouble , I do n't see the appeal … and why is everyone laughing at me …
Okay so is this it ?
Am I high ?
I feel the exact same , nothing 's spinning , no hallucinations .
Maybe I 'm just immune to it , like some kind of weird superhero .
Did I just refer to myself as a superhero ?
Wait , Superman got paralyzed on a horse and there was no Kentucky drug rehabilitation for him , right ?
Maybe I 'm high , but I feel do n't any different .
Wait what the fuck , did I just mix up ‘ feel ' and ‘ do n't ' in my mind ?
Ask if someone heard you .
Dammit of course not , it was in my mind .
Damn you , mind .
" Hey look , it 's Zeus !
The Gods always did have an eye for good weed , right ?
" I'm looking at my hands and honestly I can't tell what all the fuss is about , they 're just hands , with little fingers .
Why would anyone trip out to something so simple ?
Now nails … nails are trippy shit ; it 's like finger armor .
Holy shit look at that stucco ceiling , it 's got like faces in it .
Look , there 's Zeus right by the corner .
Right there !
Shit I lost him , maybe if I squint …
I should say something , I 've been quiet for like 20 minutes looking at this ceiling .
‘ Woah dude , I 'm high . '
Seriously , that 's the best you could do ?
Who are you , Keanu Reeves ?
‘ Woah dude ' ?
Step your game up !
Now everyone 's laughing at you again .
I 'm hungry .
Was I hungry before or am I hungry because of the weed ?
Is this the munchies thing that everyone talks about ?
What was the last thing I ate ?
… Cereal I think … .
Was that breakfast or lunch ?
Shit .
Okay well let 's take a walk to see what this guy has in his kitchen .
Holy shit , this all looks fantastic .
Why do I have a craving for everything ?
Nacho cheese , I love that stuff , I should make nachos !
Let 's open this bag up .
This bag is so smooth , what is this , plastic or foil ?
I bet if they made a field out of this stuff they could play some insane sports on it .
Friction - ball !?!
Note to self , do n't forget about friction - ball , could be a cash cow .
Okay the nachos are in the bowl , step one complete .
I should try one just to make sure that they 're good .
Wow , how can something so simple taste so good ?
It 's like salty AND crunchy and …textured ?
Why is my mouth dry ?
Oh my God , I 'm overdosing .
I knew drugs were a bad idea , I need a doctor !
Okay calm down , you 're being a pussy , just drink some water , you 're not overdosing just listen to your heart beat .
My heart is like beating to like …a rhythm .
I can hear my own heart beat .
Is that normal ?!
Just chill out and lean on something .
I 've been leaning on this kitchen counter for like 5 minutes , the nachos are starting to mock me from the bowl .
Fuck those nachos , they do n't even need cheese , I 'll just eat them raw .
WAIT !
Why have n't I ever seen this before , raw nachos are just chips !
Note to self : tell everyone you know about the nacho fraud .
I should see what everyone else is doing , maybe they want some nachos .
Fuck , I meant chips .
Halo 3 , huh ?
I guess I 'll just watch for a bit .
Jesus Javier
Christ this is sweet .
SHOOT HIM , oh fuck that was close , good call .
This is friggen awesome , was it always this sweet or is the weed making it better ?
I really think weed makes me smarter , I just talked in - depth to that guy about how Iron Man could totally beat up Batman in a fight .
I mean what chance does Bruce Wayne stand against repulsor rays ?
It 's like my mind has been opened up to a new realm of thought .
What the fuck , no he could n't .
Batman could just fuck up Stark by playing mind games with him and driving him to alcoholism .
Damn you , marijuana .
Should I apologize to the guy and admit that I was wrong ?
Fuck that , Batman would n't do that .
Oh shit , where 's everyone going ?
Oh , we 're going to go buy more weed ?
What 's the etiquette here , do I give them money or do I just sit still and hope they leave without me so I can look at this goddamn ceiling some more ?
Okay they 're gone , it 's just me and some other guy who looks like Charles Manson .
I did n't think this through .
No , dude , I do n't want to play Halo , knock yourself out .
Wow , looks like he took that personally .
Maybe I 'll just go lay down in the guest room .
I 'm so tired , this stuff is exhausting .
Note to self : smoke more weed . "

Dale Neumann , 47 , convicted of reckless homicide in US over death of 11 - year - old diabetic daughter
A man in the US accused of killing his 11 - year - old diabetic daughter by praying instead of seeking medical care has been found guilty of second - degree reckless homicide .
Dale Neumann , 47 , was convicted over the death of his daughter , Madeline , from undiagnosed diabetes .
Prosecutors contended he should have rushed the girl to a hospital because she could n't walk , talk , eat or drink .
Instead , Madeline died on the floor of the family 's rural home as people surrounded her and prayed .
Someone called an ambulance when she stopped breathing .
Sitting straight in his chair in the near - empty courtroom yesterday , Neumann stared at the jury as the verdict was read .
He declined to comment as he left the courthouse .
Defence attorney Jay Kronenwetter said the verdict would be appealed .
He would not comment further .
Prosecutors also refused to comment , citing a gag order .
Neumann , who once studied to be a Pentecostal minister , testified on Thursday that he believed God would heal his daughter and he never expected her to die .
God promises in the Bible to heal , he said .
" If I go to the doctor , I am putting the doctor before God , " Neumann testified .
" I am not believing what he said he would do . "
The father testified that he thought Madeline had the flu or a fever , and several relatives and family friends said they also did not realise how sick she was .
Leilani Neumann , 41 , was convicted on the same charge in the spring .
Marathon county circuit judge Vincent Howard set October 6 as the date for sentencing for both parents , who face up to 25 years in prison .
Their case is believed to be the first in the midwestern state of Wisconsin involving faith healing in which someone died and another person was charged with a homicide .
Last month , a jury in the western US state of Oregon convicted a man of misdemeanour criminal mistreatment for relying on prayer instead of seeking medical care for his 15 - month - old daughter who died of pneumonia and a blood infection in March 2008 .
Both of the girl 's parents were acquitted of a more serious manslaughter charge .
New Zealand 's first attempt at passing a " three strikes " law fell apart as rights holders and Internet service providers were unable to agree on a voluntary code of practice .
One of the biggest concerns was the lack of due process ; how could New Zealand avoid presuming that the accused were guilty yet still develop a means of judging accusations that was cheaper and faster than the country 's High Court ?
Given the rancorous debate over the subject , the government scrapped its law earlier this year and went back to the drawing board .
It convened a working group of " intellectual property and Internet law experts " to advise it on a fair solution to the problem of repeated online copyright infringement .
That group has now concluded its work , and New Zealand 's Ministry of Economic Development yesterday issued its policy proposal ( PDF ) for public comment .
More due process
The document shows that government officials clearly recognize the key problems , though whether the proposed solutions adequately address them remains a matter for debate .
" The main concern was that this could have led to the disconnection of the subscriber 's Internet account without due process , " notes the new report .
" Concern was also raised as to whether Internet disconnection was a proportional response to copyright infringement . "
( Google says it is not . )
Under the government 's new plan , Internet disconnection remains on the table , as do fines .
But the plan also gives those accused of infringement more power to contest the claims , to use mediation , and to ( possibly ) appeal penalties to the regular legal system .
The chart below shows a diagram of the proposed process .
It sure looks complicated , but the general outline is n't hard to grasp .
When rights holders first detect online copyright infringement , they must send a notice to an Internet service provider .
This notice must be forwarded by the ISP to the proper subscriber .
If infringement continues to take place , rights holders may then send a " cease and desist notice " through the ISP ( throughout this process , the rights holder still has no idea about the identity of the individual hidden behind the IP address ) .
The accused can contest these notices , and the ISP will make a judgment on whether they have merit .
If infringement continues after a cease - and - desist notice , rights holders can then go to the new Copyright Tribunal and request the identifying information for the subscriber in question .
( This process takes the place of filing a copyright infringement lawsuit and seeking a subpoena from the court . )
At this point , the rights holder can contact alleged infringers directly , notifying them that an allegation of " repeat copyright infringement " has been filed with the Tribunal .
The accused can then request mediation , if desired ; otherwise , the Copyright Tribunal will rule and can impose fines or cut off Internet access .
The proposal remains in the draft stages , and the government is seeking comment through August 7 ( submissions can go to copyrightact@med.govt.nz ) .
It particularly wants to know what sort of remedies the Tribunal should be allowed to impose , how long disconnections might last , and whether the accused should be entitled to appeal their case into the court system .
The Creative Freedom Foundation , founded last year in response to this issue , praised the concern with due process , but continues to have problems with overall scheme .
CFF Director Bronwyn Holloway - Smith said in a statement , " It 's unfortunate to see NZ not following international trends by holding on to internet termination as a punishment .
As artists , we do n't want people 's internet taken away to protect our copyright .
This is too severe a punishment , and many consider it to be a breach of human rights . "

TinyURLs can be very useful when you have a long url to type into something like an iphone or some other mobile device where the keyboard is rather tedious .
On a few of my sites I was looking for a way to automatically generate a tinyURL with the least amount of effort .
Since I use wordpress for most of them I decided to go with a shortcode .
Shortcodes seem to be gaining a fair amount of attention in the wordpress community and with good reason .
The Shortcode API , which was new in wordpress 2.5 , is a simple set of functions for creating macro codes for use in your posts .
Shortcodes are written by providing a handler function and they accept parameters too .
Here is a wordpress shortcode to generate a tinyURL for a post .
// Generate Tiny URLS For A Post function get_tiny_url ( $arguments ) { if ( empty ( $arguments ) ) $url = get_permalink ( $ post -> ID ) ; else $ url = urlencode ( $arguments [ 'url ' ] ) ; if ( $url ) { $ tiny_url = ' http://tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url='.$url; $ new_url = file_get_contents ( $ tiny_url ) ; } else $ new_url = " Error " ; return $ new_url ; } add_shortcode ( ' small_url ' , ' get_tiny_url ' ) ;
[ small_url ] // or [ small_url url= 'http://codytaylor.org']
If the url parameter is not defined then the function will attempt to use the wordpress function get_permalink ( $ post -> ID ) which will return the current posts url .
Also you can pass in a parameter if you want to show a tinyURL to another location .
Using curl instead of file_get_contents would probably be faster but I did n’t want to make the example to long .
The add_shortcode function is what tells the API to use the get_tiny_url function when it encounters the small_url shortcode .
Note that this will call on the tinyurl api every page view so it would probably be prudent to set the tiny urls in the database so you only have to check once on a production site although I ’m not sure if they expire or not .
This shortcode can be called in the post by typing :
Victor Garcia of Bakersfield was among several readers asking about the July 22 photo published online only with a Business article about the booming economy in the high desert city of Ridgecrest .
He wondered if the image had been altered , noting “ I do n't think you can see the road with all the houses at the top of the photo .
( College Heights Blvd. ) from Las Flores , the light signal next to the Toyota dealership ( the Toyota dealership is actually further south )
There is an Enterprise Rent - A - Car and a Speedy Lube at the corner of Las Flores and China Lake Blvd .
It could just be the way the photo was taken , but it may be worth looking into . ”
All such inquiries are worth looking into , and editors did so in this case .
It was taken with a long lens , which , as photographer Mark Boster said in an e-mail to the reader , " compresses the view . "
This inquiry is one of a growing number of questions that come in about the authenticity of published photos .
Other images questioned this year include one of actress Anne Hathaway ( someone thought she was too unrealistically ugly ) and a picture of a member of the Taliban ( readers thought he looked too nice ) .
One particularly adamant questioning of another photograph published earlier this year came from an online reader who said she teaches Photoshop at a continuing education department of a university in another state .
Even after being assured by editors who investigated the original digital files , the reader was unconvinced that the image had n't been manipulated .
In fact , in all such situations , editors peruse the originals and talk to the photographer to be able to assure readers the photos were n't doctored .
Photographer Boster sent editors his original files , notes on where he took the shots -- and even an offer to go back to Ridgecrest to review the area .
But this inquiry was a fairly open - and - shut case , says Deputy Director of Photography Calvin Hom , who added : " We seem to get queries whenever our photogs use long lens while shooting landscape .
It 's a technique that time and again seems to jolt the readers into thinking there 's something wrong with the photos . "
It should not be news to anyone that Google is working on a 2010 release timeframe for its newly dubbed Google Chrome OS .
What has been interesting is the chatter which has occured since then , many fingers pointing at Apple as the real beneficiary of this move .
However , nothing could be further from the truth .
What Google did was brilliant , very similar to its strategy with Chrome and I will outline it below .
The key to the Chrome strategy is that Google does not expect to get a large chunk of market share , what they want is to put pressure on Microsoft and Apple to add features similar to what Chrome OS has , which by nature will be very Web-centric .
This minimalist desktop approach that is tightly bound to cloud services is the core of Chrome OS , Microsoft and Apple will be forced to make adjustments that will be in Googles favor , just to compete .
Google is really in a win - win situation , as it was with their Chrome browser , that has a minimal amount of market share but was the initiator of more browser wars focused on Javascript speed and more stable browsing ; both of which are central to Google ’s cloud services taking off .
Google is not the only one who benefits , any company largely hedging their bets on the Cloud and / or web based applications has something to gain , even Microsoft does , however , Google does not have a dominant office suite or OS , they need this more than Microsoft or other big players do .
Their mental - market - dominance is the real force behind the change that will happen , not the quality of the OS they will release .
It becomes obvious that this strategy is mid-term in focus , Google is playing a game of Chess with Microsoft , with benefits being reaped slowly over time as their competition adjusts .
What is the next move and is it necessarily by Google or one of its competitors ?

The saturation coverage of Jackson ’s death is an example of our
collective flight into illusion .
The obsession with the trivia of his
life conceals the despair , meaninglessness and emptiness of our own
lives .
It deflects the moral questions arising from mounting social
injustice , growing inequalities , costly imperial wars , economic
collapse and political corruption .
The wild pursuit of status , wealth
and fame has destroyed our souls , as it destroyed Jackson , and it has
destroyed our economy .

While Michael Jackson 's funeral was being given 24/7 coverage by all the major networks , allied troops in Afghanistan were being shot at , maimed and killed .
While the press sought interviews with the monsters claiming to be Jackson 's friends and family , thousands of people lost their jobs in an economy teetering on the brink of ruin .
While we wondered who would gain custody of Jackson 's children , the insurance industry dropped millions of dollars to prevent working people accessing affordable health care .

Why ?
Because News is no longer about News - just a reflection of consumer desire .
The networks covered Jackson rather than issues that really affected their lives because they could make more money .
Covering Jackson meant ratings , and ratings meant dollars .
The corporate heads of CNN , MSNBC and Fox know that we 're more interested in the lives of celebrities than the lives of those in the armed forces , and can sell advertising at a much higher rate to bored housewives with multiple credit cards , and the coveted teenage demographic plagued with insecurities and eating disorders .
It 's a tragic state of affairs that our media institutions are not only criminally negligent in their coverage of current affairs , but are also complicit in fostering the dangerous celebrity obsessed culture that values fame over everything else .
The media is going through a huge transition at the moment , and an alternative culture sick of the garbage that passes for news has a chance to take over where the MSM is failing .
But to do that , it will have to take risks , and that means rejecting celebrity gossip and rejecting the easy money .
Right now , the task is even harder due to dwindling advertising spending and the lack of major political drama .
But in the future , we can have a robust press capable of cutting through nonsense , and above all , behaving responsibly .
It 's a war for our collective sanity , and one we must win .
Do blind people ever suffer from seasonal affective disorder ?
If so , can sunshine or tanning beds help ?
— Kirstin Steele , Charleston , S.C .
Circadian and vision neu­ro­scientist Russell G. Foster of the University of Oxford answers :
BECAUSE BLIND PEOPLE retain a newly discovered system of light - detecting cells , they , too , can suffer from seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) .
Patients who have SAD struggle with serious mood changes in the fall and winter seasons .
Symptoms include excessive sleepiness , low energy , and a tendency to crave sweets and starchy foods .
Normally our circadian rhythm is synchronized to the light / dark cycle , but in the absence of such cues our internal physiology starts to drift .
The body clock of SAD sufferers may lose synchronization under the shorter periods and lower levels of winter light .
Exposure to one to two hours of bright light in the morning often can help correct this disruption and alleviate SAD symptoms .
A link between the occurrence of cataracts — clouding in the eye that leads to visual loss — and the development of SAD further suggests that light detection by the eye is key in this disorder .
Puzzlingly , some people who are completely blind — lacking the eye ’s photoreceptors known as rods and cones — can experience SAD .
A decade ago scientists at Cornell University proposed that humans can detect light through their skin .
But when researchers in the Netherlands tested this idea by exposing just the skin of SAD patients to bright light , they found the treatment had no effect at all .
How , then , are they detecting light ?
In 1999 we found that mice lacking rods and cones were nonetheless able to synchronize their circadian rhythm to the light / dark cycle .
These observations led to the discovery of an additional photo­receptor system in the retina of humans and other mammals consisting
of a small number of photosensi­­tive retinal ganglion cells ( called pRGCs ) .
These cells are most sensitive to blue light , and , significantly , blue light is most effective in alleviating the symptoms of SAD .
We think that blind people can develop SAD because their other photoreceptor system — the pRGCs — remains intact .
Likewise , although there are no known studies of light therapy in those who are visually impaired , we suspect light could be used to treat SAD symptoms in blind patients .
Does postpartum depression serve some evolutionary purpose ?
— Clint Johnson ,
Ridgecrest , Calif .
Anthropologist Edward H. Hagen of Washington State University replies :
POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
( PPD ) , which afflicts 10 to 15 percent of new mothers , may have evolved as a strategic response to a lack of social support because it helped in passing on genes successfully .
Many doctors believe PPD is triggered by the changes in a mother ’s hormones after giving birth , yet studies have failed to find much evidence for a link between extreme hormone fluctuations and PPD .
The fact that fathers , who do not experience such changes , also suffer from PPD is strong evidence that it is not “ just hormones . ”
The finding that PPD often plagues people who have marital problems or little outside support led biologists Randy Thornhill and F. Bryant Furlow of the University of New Mexico and me independently to propose that PPD has an evolved function .
Many animals improve
their chances of passing on their genes if they desert their young when food or parenting help is scarce and invest instead in future offspring that are
more likely to survive and reproduce .
This “ parental investment theory ” should apply especially well to humans .
Human children are “ expensive ” to raise , requiring years of parenting before they can survive on their own .
When a mother lacks support from the father or other family members , she may unconsciously conclude she cannot successfully raise her infant .
The ensuing emotional pain from PPD operates somewhat like physical pain : stop what you ’re doing — it ’s harming your reproductive fitness !
Studies confirm that mothers with PPD do significantly reduce parenting efforts and often have thoughts of harming their baby .
This “ psychic pain hypothesis ” cannot explain the whole story , however , because few parents suffering from PPD abandon their newborn .
I propose an additional function of PPD that is like a labor strike , in which a mother ’s reduced interest in her baby may serve to elicit help from others .
Studies do suggest that higher levels of PPD symptoms in mothers motivate more child care by fathers , and increased social support is one of the
best predictors for the remission of PPD .
These hypothesized functions for PPD are far from proved .
If you or a loved one is suffering from PPD , contact a doctor immediately — treatments , including antidepressants and talk therapy , are available and effective .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A year - old website , inspired by the use of Twitter and Internet media reporting out of Iran , hopes to become the go - to forum for citizen journalists everywhere as traditional media pulls back .

Allvoices.com , a fledgling social networking - cum - news aggregator site launched in 2008 , uses algorithms to help it sort news from around the world in a manner akin to what Google Inc does .
Its twist is that it encourages and enables anyone to be a reporter and uses an in - house system to rate would - be journalists on popularity and credibility .
“ The barriers are gone .
The communications between citizens are free .
Trying to inhibit conversations is not going to work , ” said Erik Sundelof , co-founder and vice president of social media for the fledgling site .
Twitter underscored how the lines were blurring between traditional and new media when it carried citizen views and news from Iran , even as the government stifled other media .
The U.S. State Department has publicly acknowledged its importance as a communications tool .
Blogs and websites from Youtube to Twitter have mushroomed over the past decade , increasingly offering the public a channel through which to report and offer views on the news .
A growing crop of sites , such as iBrattleboro.com or OhmyNews in South Korea , cater specifically to would - be journalists .
Allvoices ’s founders point to a dwindling number of accredited foreign correspondents as traditional outlets cut costs to combat increasingly elusive advertising revenue .
“ How are you going to go out there and cover every single community ? ” asks Aki Hashimi , chief marketing officer .
Allvoices itself hosts a share of posted videos from Iran , including some that show cars burning and what appear to be demonstrations .
Quantcast says Allvoices monthly traffic is running to more than 3 million unique users , more than two - thirds of them outside the United States .
The company says they have 33,000 separate “ landing ” pages for countries , cities and other special categories -- each with its own following .
People can file to the sites from computers , or even by sending text messages from mobile phones .
CREDIBILITY
Allvoices , which is operating on $ 4.5 million in funding from Vantage Point Venture Partners , has started paying its most popular reporters .
They can earn anywhere from 25 cents to $ 2 per thousand page views .
Contributors are free to post almost anything .
Credibility is rated by people who read postings and by the in - house algorithm , which is designed to help measure postings against traditional media and other sources .
But throwing the site open to the public has its pitfalls .
One recent post with a high credibility rating said the Ark of The Covenant was about to be unveiled .
Other stories cite no sources , anathema in traditional journalism .
Sundelof said he had not looked at the Ark posting , but the in - house computer evaluation depends on feedback from many users and there had not been enough feedback on that piece .
Allvoices does not practice gatekeeping .
“ We have n’t worked out how to deal with these kinds of situations , ” he said .
“ Basically , we can only determine credibility based on the input we have . ”
Sundelof said a posting that starts as a rumor can evolve as more voices join and the rumor is verified or killed .
Susan Rasky , a senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California , Berkeley , was unfamiliar with Allvoices , but said many sites she had seen experimenting with citizen reporting had a place .
“ We have to acknowledge that there are voices outside we need to use as sources , ” Rasky added .
Last week the Daily Mail published a feature piece in which it claimed that security expert Adam Laurie had managed to hack an ID Card in 12 minutes .
The Home Office rubbished the article and claims that no hack has taken place .
Which version of events should we believe ?
The Mail ’s somewhat sensationalist article on the ID Cards hack describes how Laurie used a standard smartcard toolkit to clone a Foreign National ID Card ( which incidentally is n’t an ID card – it ’s a biometric visa document issued under the UK Borders Act ) .
He then modified the cloned card to change the details of the holder and add another message .
In its rebuttal , the Home Office pointed out that the card is subject to cryptographic controls that prevent modification or cloning , and that the Mail ’s hack is therefore not valid since the cloned card would be rejected by any reader .
In his blog , Robin reflects upon the challenge of reprogramming a card , and a key point is that without valid signatures the card ca n’t be cloned or modified : that is , unless the attacker has copies of the private keys , or has managed to subvert the cryptographic algorithm , the integrity of the card remains absolute .
It would , for practical purposes , be impossible to create a modified or cloned National ID Card – far simpler to try to create a false identity during the enrolment process , or subvert an official to tamper with the National Identity Register .
So all ’s well and good with the ID Card ’s security then ?
Not so .
The ‘ hack ’ highlights a fundamental flaw in the architecture of the National Identity Service : the fact that for any ‘ high assurance ’ authentication to take place , the relying party must be able to verify not only the content of the ID Card , but its signatures as well .
To do so requires a card reader that has access to the National Identity Register and associated databases so that the validity of the card and its data can be checked .
But the Home Office has yet to discuss plans for putting in readers in any environment outside of border and immigration controls and law enforcement – in other words , the only time a high assurance check will be achievable in the near future will be at an immigration desk or a police station .
That suits the Home Office ’s needs , but leaves the bit of plastic worthless for the rest of us , since creating a clone that looks like an ID Card and even scans like an ID Card will be trivially simple .
‘ Flash and dash ’ will become commonplace – individuals using fake cards to establish a false identity or false entitlements in the absence of any way to confirm the validity of the card .
The only way to avoid that problem will be to build a huge and expensive network of card readers in every location where the card might be needed .
A better approach would be to make the card itself ‘ unimportant ’ in the authentication process : to issue digital certificates that can be embedded in mobile phones and computers so that individuals can assert their identity without having to produce a piece of plastic .
This would open up online use of the scheme , and create a secondary market for ID , whereby commercial providers that have verified the individual ’s ID against the NIR can then issue further digital credentials : for example , underwriting m-commerce transactions using bank certificates to confirm the account - holder ’s ID and credit status .
Furthermore , if certificates complied with relevant open standards then they could be embedded into OpenID , SAML etc. to nurture the growth of a peer - to - peer ID infrastructure that would build trust between individuals , industry and the public sector without the need to issue card readers at all .
It worked in Sweden , where very few people actually have a plastic ID card , but most of the population use the associated digital certificates – so why ca n’t it happen here ?
Holodecks are on the Way
Motion tracking .
Multi -touch .
Facial recognition .
Sixaxis .
These are the buzz words that drive video game peripheral sales and innovation in controls .
But what about the actual feedback that games give us ?
We focus so much on how we interact with a game , yet very little on how a game interacts back ( outside of force feedback and shaking chairs ) .
Well , researchers at the Uni of Tokyo have come to save us from the doldrums of game unnovation !
Their answer : touchable holograms .
In this Siggraph 2009 video they explain how utilizing ultrasonic waves coupled with holographic imagery and motion tracking ( using a WiiMote ) the researchers has created a way to interact with the holograms … and potentially have them interact back .
The waves have shown to be pinpoint accurate in input , even to the level of creating texture .
Imagine picking up a hologram baseball and feeling the stitches and leather , moments before you hurl it at the screen in The Bigs 2018 .
Or better yet , imagine throwing the imaginary ball to your kid brother across the room as he swings an imaginary bat .

Addressing one of the more volatile complaints about healthcare reform that he is proposing , President Obama said today Tuesday that he does n’t want to set up government “ death panels ” that decide which Americans get health services and which do n’t .
Obama , speaking at a town hall - style meeting here this afternoon , also countered more serious critiques of his initiative , at one point calling for questions from “ skeptical and suspicious ” members of the audience and eliciting queries about whether a public health plan will give government too big a role in administering care .
“ Right now , insurance companies are rationing care , ” Obama told the crowd at Portsmouth High School .
“ They ’re telling you , ‘ You can have this procedure but you ca n’t have that procedure . ’ ” “ I want everybody to understand , ” he said , “ the status quo is not working for you . ”
The pitch came during a 45 - minute question - and - answer period at a meeting that was smooth and civil -- in contrast with the shouting matches that have broken out recently at meetings hosted by Democratic members of Congress home in their districts during their summer recess .
White House officials say they assembled the crowd of 1,800 by the same process they always use .
They sent out advisories to the local media last week , directing people to the White House website to sign up for tickets .
The host school and state and local officials also got a few tickets to distribute .
A few questioners raised concerns about the president ’s plans , in keeping with political tradition in New Hampshire , where town halls are a fixture of community life .
And lining the main drive to the town hall site were dozens upon dozens of demonstrators , many calling for healthcare reform while others shouted criticism of the Democrats ’ initiative .
One T - shirt embellished the rising - sun emblem of the Obama presidential campaign to include a communist hammer - and - sickle symbol , with the word “ Obamacare ” emblazoned beneath it .
“ Obama lies , Grandma dies , ” read a sign held by one young girl , while another read , “ No to government health care . ”
But the president ’s motorcade did not follow that route , according to people who were in it , and Obama saw mainly supporters waving signs as he approached the high school .
And inside the high school ’s gymnasium , with a marching band seated on the bleachers , Obama stood before a mostly supportive crowd .
At one point , he laughed off a comment by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who accused the president of wanting to set up “ death boards ” that would decide who lives and dies .
None of the current bills mention a panel remotely fitting the description .
“ I guess this arose out of a provision in one of the House bills that allowed Medicare to reimburse people for consultations about end - of - life care , setting up living wills , ” Obama said .
“ Somehow it ’s gotten spun into this idea of death panels .
Um , I am not in favor of that .
I want to clear the air . ”
But Obama also addressed a more fundamental and arguable point , that expanding coverage to nearly 40 million more Americans would require someone to ration care .
Ben Hershenson , a retired pharmacy professor who was in the audience , said he does n’t disagree with the president ’s argument that insurance companies do some of that now .
He just thinks it will get worse with a universal plan that covers so many more people .
“ When he says , ‘ Let ’s eliminate waste , ’ I say , ‘ Define waste , ' " said Hershenson , who asked the president about rationing during the meeting .
“ I honestly believe there will be rationing beyond what we currently have . ”
Some in the crowd said they were n’t yet supporters of the Democrats ’ healthcare plans .
Still , several of those interviewed said they want some kind of healthcare overhaul , and soon .
Mary Thoreson , a May college graduate with a bachelor ’s degree in psychology and philosophy , said she worries about how health insurers -- and potential employers -- will treat her chronic heart condition .
When she was a child , she said , a supervisor at her father ’s place of business recommended firing him because of the high cost of her heart surgeries .
He kept his job because he worked for a relative , she said .
But she does n’t have that option now , and her coverage by her parents ’ insurer expires soon because she has graduated .
“ Where am I going to work with family ? ” she asked .

Ali Larijani criticized the Interior Ministry for not preventing the violence .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) --
Iran 's influential speaker of parliament has condemned an attack on university students that they say was carried out by Islamic militia and police .
One student activist who declined to be named told Reuters four students -- three men and one woman -- were killed during the assault late on June 14 on the dormitory of Tehran University .
Tehran University Chancellor Farhad Rahbar denied anyone had been killed , the students news agency ISNA reported .
" What does it mean that in the middle of the night students are attacked in their dormitory ? " speaker Ali Larijani was quoted as saying by the same news agency .
Iran 's most prominent university has traditionally been a hotbed of dissent , before and after the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
The incident took place during widespread street unrest sparked by official results showing hard - line President Mahmud Ahmadinejad won a landslide against moderate Mir Hossein Musavi in last week 's election .
Thousands of students have joined protests against what they say was a rigged vote , a charge dismissed by the authorities .
Anti-Ahmadinejad demonstrators and riot police have clashed in the capital Tehran and elsewhere .
About 800 students staged a sit - in protest against the dormitory attack and suspected election irregularities inside the university 's gates on June 16 , an activist told Reuters .
Larijani , a conservative who has been critical of Ahmadinejad in the past , said the Interior Ministry should be held accountable for the university incident , as it was in charge of security .
" The Interior Ministry is responsible for this and should answer for it ... parliament is seriously following the issue , " ISNA quoted him as saying .
He did not say who had carried out the attack , but students told Reuters members of the religious Basij militia and plainclothes policemen did it .
Basij is a volunteer paramilitary force fiercely loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the final say on all matters of state in Iran .
State television said seven people were killed towards the end of a pro-Musavi rally in Tehran on June 15 .
An Iranian photographer said Basij members opened fire when people from the crowd attacked their building , killing at least one person .
Musavi , speaking at the rally before the shooting erupted , also condemned the university attack .
" They have attacked dormitories and brutally broken legs , heads , arms , and threw some of the students out of the windows and arrested a lot of people , " he said , according to his website .
A statement by students issued on June 15 said that " plainclothes police attacked the dormitory and started to beat up students ... riot police attacked and started to shoot at students " .
When students tried to take those injured to a university hospital the doors were closed and they were denied medical help , the statement said .
University officials denied on June 15 that any such attack had taken place .
" They beat our friends and at least 100 students were taken away by the attackers .
We have no news about their whereabouts , " said one student , who like others declined to be named .
There was no immediate comment from police on the incident .
During the past three days of violence , police have accused " bandits " of setting buses on fire , breaking windows of banks and other buildings , and damaging public property .
In Beijing 's latest move to exercise greater control over Internet use , Chinese officials ordered Google Inc. to stop showing some results from foreign Web sites through its Chinese Web site , the official Xinhua News Agency reported Friday .

Ground beef used in hamburgers is often more than just one animal .
The ground beef normally sold at supermarkets is usually a combined mixture of different muscle tissues from animals .
Some come from more than one cow , while others will have mixtures of pork and chicken in them .
Fruit snacks are coated in wax .
Colorful fruit - flavored snacks like gummy bears are often coated in carnauba wax .
This is what makes then have that glossy shine .

The popsicle was invented by an 11 - year - old .
According to the story , an 11 year old by the name of Frank Epperson left his soda mixed with water outside in a cup overnight .
When he returned , the mixture had frozen and he ate it .
He began calling this the Epsicle and sold it around Neptune Beach .
When Epperson had kids , they began calling it pops sickles which later on became popsicles .
Farm - raised salmon is naturally white .
Naturally , wild salmon is already pink .
However , farm - raised salmon do not have the same diet as wild ones do .
They are later dyed pink due to the plant additives that are added to their feed .
Apple pie is not American .
This delicacy is said to originate from Medieval England .
Variations of the original recipe were made popular by the Dutch which became the known favorite of today .
Potatoes can reflect your wi -fi signal .
In a 2012 experiment to test the wireless signals on new planes , potatoes were used and placed on the seats .
The results found that because of the high water content of the potatoes , they can reflect and absorb radio and wireless signals .
Human beings are also able to do the same .

Grapes will explode inside the microwave .
For it to explode , you must split the grape almost in half and place it inside .
This will create a fireball of plasma which is caused by radiation and heat .
The grape cannot absorb much power which leaves the microwave nowhere to work on .
This results in a concentration of energy which causes explosions .
Crackers give you cavities faster than candy .
When a cracker becomes sticky in your mouth and gets stuck between your teeth , bacteria gather around the area faster to feast .
The sticky texture that your mouth creates from the crackers allows the bacteria to dig longer into your teeth which causes cavities .
Chilli peppers are not spicy .
The burning sensation in your mouth is a mental reaction and not a physical one .
These peppers contain a chemical called capsaicin which naturally binds to the pain receptors in our nerves .
This is what causes your brain to believe you are eating something spicy .
Teh Crazy™ , Teh Wacky™ , and Teh Stupid™ .
Definitions are still somewhat fluid at this point , but the arch - birther and crackpot litigator has provided me with a perfect specimen of the Trifecta .
This being a website of media deconstruction , I have developed a hypothesis that the entire canon of wingnuttia can be distilled into three overlapping and mutually - supporting parts : , and .
Definitions are still somewhat fluid at this point , but the arch - birther and crackpot litigator has provided me with a perfect specimen of the Trifecta .
A note on “ Teh ” and the trademark symbol : “ Teh ” is a widespread internet meme used deliberately here to portray the slapdash logic of wingnuttia .
The trademark symbol lends gravity to these common terms used in this specific context .
Time to put my hypothesis to the test !
Teh Crazy ™ Need I justify the subheading ?
Granted , mental illness is a social construct , but she ’s a blithering loon .
“ Crazy ” is an unpopular term in the mental health field , but here I use it in its proper sense of a person who seems disconnected from reality .
And I ’m not even talking about her ideas yet , only her obvious issues .
A telling moment in this video is when the host asks her about the taxi ride to the NBC studio in Israel .
Taitz ’s immediate defensiveness speaks volumes ; so does her reluctance to answer the question of motivations : why would Obama ’s family go to such extraordinary lengths to give him citizenship ?
Taitz has developed a systematized , static , Manichean world - view in which Obama represents the summation of monolithic evil in the universe .
She is , to risk a cliché , a true believer .
“ In what ” does not matter .
As I will explain below , Taitz ’s particular religious preference is only a factor in what variety of Wacky ™ she produces ; scriptures , dogmas , and doctrines are flavor , not substance .
That her level of conviction admits no possibility of error , absorbing and perverting all new data into proof of that conviction , is the only important thing for us to examine .
Psychology has a word for this phenomenon : cognitive dissonance .
Her Crazy™ creates that dissonance .
Teh Stupid™ Since all new information is processed through her Crazy™ , Taitz has a psychological dilemma to solve whenever contradictory information arrives ( like , say , a Hawaiian birth certificate ) .
Her brain resolves these discrepancies by discounting evidentiary leads away from her goal ( “ proving ” Obama is not a US citizen ) , seeks discrepancies that lead toward her goal ( such as the redacted ID number on Obama ’s birth certificate ) , enlarges those discrepancies into scenarios ( “ the birth certificate might be forged ” ) , and finally presents those scenarios as evidence ( “ Obama forged his birth certificate ! ” ) .
The process begins with choice blindness and ends with false memory .
Repeating myself for clarity :
Discounting unhelpful information
Obsessing on details
Enlarging those details
Confusing theory with evidence
Teh Crazy ™ inevitably produces screwy results .
Holes appear in the foundations of wingnut logic .
Because the theory is not reality - based , it will never withstand rational scrutiny .
The result of this process ( ironically known to psychologists as rationalization ) is never rational ..
Holes appear in the foundations of wingnut logic .
To make matters worse , Taitz lacks enough legal education to correct herself .
She got her law degree from a correspondence school that is n’t recognized by the American Bar Association .
Thus we hear Taitz adopt a common misconception about citizenship law , arguing that Obama cannot be American because one of his parents was not an American .
As David Hart explains , this is just not true : According to US code , a natural born citizen is a person born in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof .
There are other criteria for determining citizenship in the alternative , not in addition to being born in the USA .
( Emphasis his )
Taitz is not unique ; miseducation is a hallmark of wingnuttia .
Campuses like Liberty University , Regent University , and Oral Roberts churn out biologists with no background in evolution , artists with no ability to draw nudes , and lawyers with no comprehension of constitutional law .
One important point must be made : the hypocrisy inherent in this process is a cognitive action — that is , people choose to believe Teh Stupid™ .
Taitz is no victim .
She has fooled herself on purpose .
Teh Wacky ™
Which brings us , at last , to the “ sharing ” phase of wingnuttery : spreading Teh Stupid™ to encourage Teh Crazy ™ in others .
What comes out of Taitz ’s mouth sounds , well , wacky — thus , Teh Wacky ™ .
A caveat : wingnuts often engage in Teh Wacky ™ without even passing through the other two ; they simply pick up someone else ’s Wacky ™ and integrate it into their belief system .
Sometimes , public figures will adopt and propagate Teh Wacky ™ with malice and deliberation when even they do n’t believe in it .
When Newt Gingrich told Rock Church in Virginia Beach that America is “ surrounded by paganism , ” he was channeling a belief system he likely does not have .
But Taitz is the trifecta .
She is out to spread a self - generated birther gospel , and I use that term in its correct sense ; she ’s encouraging Obama haters with “ good news ” that Obama is n’t really the president .
The reason birthers hold this belief so dearly is its power to dispel their own cognitive dissonance .
These are , after all , righteous and patriotic Americans .
If you simply asked them to engage in sedition and subversion , they would n’t do it .
They need an excuse for their disloyal opposition ; birtherism provides it .
I have no way of proving it , but my suspicion is that a close study of birthers would reveal two things : ( 1 ) a statistically significant correlation with the eight percent of Americans who still think Obama is a Muslim , and ( 2 ) an extremely high correlation with racism .
Not that most birthers would admit to being racists , mind you ; that in itself is a cognitive dissonance .
Indeed , the essential problem for wingnuts since November of 2008 has been the moral quandry of opposition to a black person : they can not admit to their racism .
Birtherism is a perfect solution for minds that need a more “ respectable ” reason to hate Obama .
This is a self - perpetuating cycle .
One final point about Teh Wacky™ : it differs from audience to audience , culture to culture .
Perhaps no place on Earth is more fraught with conspiracy theory than the Middle East , for example ; Islamic extremists and Zionist zealots can invent the most bizarre , convoluted narratives .
Wrapping your head around some of them is n’t easy .
So while the specific Wacky ™ can vary , the process of reaching it is forever and always the same .
Thus ends my unified theory of wingnuttia .
SOYLENT GREEN ….
I noticed Anonymous Liberal had a tweet this morning that struck me as funny :
Next GOP talking point : it ’s made out of people !!!
I laughed because just this week , a friend of mine emailed a similar point :
Bold right - wing activists have leveled with the American people and explained how “ Obamacare ” will lead to euthanasia .
Why have n’t they mentioned the second part of his nefarious scheme — to solve word hunger by converting the old folks into soylent green ?
And the reason it ’s funny is because it is n’t satire .
The soylent - green talking point is already being repeated on Fox News , as if it were legitimate .
It must be challenging to be a political writer trying to parody conservative arguments .
Prominent Republicans , who are either stark raving mad or pretending to be , are speaking publicly about “ government - encouraged euthanasia ” and “ death panels . ”
How does a satirist exaggerate for effect when the right - wing has gone mad ?
While I refuse to call this “ magic ” , the following has been confusing me for a long time now and I ’ve finally decided to post it to my blog and see if anyone else gets it .
It turns out that ActiveScaffold and YARD do n’t play nice together .
In particular , if YARD has previously been loaded ( say , to define a Rake task for it ) , ActiveScaffold initialization will fail with the following error :
uninitialized constant Helpers::ControllerHelpers
Using -- trace and following the source code , I find out that this is happening during ActiveScaffold ’s initialization , particularly at this statement :
ActionController :: Base .
send ( : include , ActiveScaffold :: Helpers::ControllerHelpers )
Debugging the ActiveScaffold initialization code yields this baffling result :
>> ActiveScaffold :: Helpers => Helpers >>
ActiveScaffold : : Helpers::ControllerHelpers NameError : uninitialized constant ActiveScaffold :: Helpers
It ’s the weirdest thing that I ’ve seen since I became a Rubyist and it is blocking me from using YARD to generate the documentation for my current Rails project .
Unfortunately , cutting out ActiveScaffold is n’t going to fly because the deadline for initial release is so close and so much functionality is implemented using it already .
It was n’t my choice ; if I had my way , I might never use ActiveScaffold ever again .
Over the years I 've listened to several opinions expressing doubt over the Linux sound stack .
There are lots of ill informed comments out there concerning various things sound related , both positive and negative , but more often than not commentators miss out very important aspects of a modern , multi-user , desktop sound stack .
So in this article I 'll attempt to discuss some of the misconceptions out there , provide a balanced view of the current state of affairs , discuss some of the perceived mistakes in the rollout of new sound stacks and where things are going in the future .
There have been a few articles , some picking up mainstream coverage talking about the Linux sound stack .
Some comments suggest that it's not that bad , but totally miss the point regarding what a desktop audio stack is all about , but most people are talking about how it's in a bad way and overly complicated and while such comments do have some merit , things really are not that bad , and I believe there is a really bright future .
ALSA vs OSS
A lot of the comments of late have been discussing things such as how amazingly brilliant OSS is .
Personally I do n't buy it .
I 've never really played overly much with OSS and as such this is probably a slightly ill - informed view - although that 's not to say it 's not accurate of course : D. Most of these kind of comments are made by people who do n't really understand ALSA and are bought over by the " ALSA API is overly complex " type comments .
Yes , the ALSA client library is rather complex and has numerous pitfalls - so much so that there exists now an unofficial " safe " ALSA Subset API .
But what people invariably fail to comment on ( and thus fully understand ) is that ALSA comes in two parts : the kernel driver and the userspace library .
ALSA differs from OSS in that all access to the kernel layer is performed via a userspace library .
I do n't know of any ALSA clients that communicate directly with the kernel layer without going through libasound .
What this means is that the kernel interface has the freedom to be re-factored and improved at any time , provided the userspace library is developed in parallel .
For this reason , the kernel layer is actually quite clean and well defined .
The rather rigorous quality control that goes on in the kernel is testament to the fact that on the kernel side of things , ALSA is doing pretty well .
Of course there can ( and will be ) improvements in this area in the future , but this side of things is certainly not in a poor state as people seem to assume .
The " too complex " argument relates to the ALSA userspace API .
In order to remain backwards compatible , the userspace API has undergone several refinements .
As will anything not designed from the top down , some parts of it are rather confusing and have sometimes been misinterpreted ( the classic example here being the confusion over snd_pcm_delay ( ) - it 's documentation hinting at a hardware based implementation that subsequently lead to some project ( i.e. WINE ) assuming that this function will eventually return 0 which is not true ; fortunately this problem is behind us now , but with a new API call added that does return the info the WINE guys ( and others ) needed ) .
So yes , the ALSA userspace API could use a complete top - down redesign , but in order to do that , we would immediately break compatibility with 90 % of the apps out there :
Not a great idea all in all .
Retaining backwards compatibility is a pain , but it 's also quite important !
But Sound Servers Suck !
What is in a name ?
That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet .
Some people seem to have some sort of built in hatred of " sound servers " as a concept without really thinking through what this means .
Yes , there have been some pretty awful experiences with some sound servers in the past ( EsounD and aRTs being the immediate examples that spring to mind ) , but that does n't mean the concept itself is flawed .
You may drive a couple of shit cars but does n't mean we should all abandon the roads .
In addition , the sound servers of old were really just mixers .
In the old days most hardware was not capable of doing hardware mixing and thus could n't produce sound from multiple apps at the same time , so a mixer was an essential component .
Nowadays , software mixing is the norm rather than the exception , even on high end hardware , and ALSA itself has a pretty solid sofware mixing in the form of DMIX , thus obsoleting large parts of the previous sound server functionality - certainly making the additional features they did offer seem disproportionate to the hassle they introduced .
In the early days DMIX was just another sound server .
Apparently this has changed these days , no longer needing an additional process .
While it achieves the job of software mixing very well , it 's not as fast or as flexible as other solutions can offer .
Modern Multi-user Desktop
So , these days a modern , multi-user desktop is quite a different beast to what it once was .
Components such as Console Kit track which users are currently active ( e.g. when more than one user is logged in simultaneously ) and tells udev to write appropriate ACLs to enforce this policy .
Users also want to use network attached sound systems , such as Apple Airtunes ( RAOP ) devices and UPnP media renderers etc. not to mention Bluetooth devices .
All of this is much further up the sound stack than the low level driver level and has to deal with various permission and authentication schemes .
This obviously needs a userspace component to govern this interaction .
Something has to be responsible for this and a " sound server " of some sort obviously fits the bill perfectly .
PulseAudio
So enter PulseAudio .
It 's had it 's fair share of bad publicity , but ultimately this important part of the Linux sound stack is taking on several roles that are important in a modern desktop .
It 's dealing with several different things :
Software mixing
Independent ( per-application ) volume control
Dealing with permissions ( is the user allowed to access the sound device ? )
Dealing with Bluetooth devices
Dealing with Network based devices ( UPnP , Apple Airtunes , Native PulseAudio etc ) .
Handling the moving of streams between outputs .
Handling sound from remote applications run via X11 over a network .
Dealing with routing policy ( Music goes to USB speakers , Desktop sound events to built in speakers , VoIP to Bluetooth headset )
Effects to promote HCI ( e.g. positional event sounds - button clicks etc , coming out louder on the left hand speaker when triggered from the left hand side of the desktop )
Power Consumption and Efficient savings .
Reduces risk of buffer under-runs .
So the people who talk about OSSv4 and how it can do mixing and per-app volume control and how this means that ALSA and PulseAudio are not needed are totally underestimating what 's needed in a modern audio stack .
There still needs to be some kind of userspace daemon to govern these other sound systems and deal with multiple users .
This is a non-trivial job and no other system out there is currently aiming to implement these capabilities .
One of the often overlooked advantages of PulseAudio is the " glitch free " system .
This is an approach that ultimately disabled interrupt driven audio and instead relies on system timers .
Modern kernels can provide these timers easily and reducing the number of interrupts and using larger buffers allows you to greatly reduce the number of CPU wake - ups thus saving power .
This is actually a very important technique to implement when dealing with modern mobile platforms .
Reuse
It 's obviously important to ensure efficient code reuse .
It does n't make sense for all sound producing applications to implement direct support for " exotic " sound systems such as Bluetooth , UPnP and Apple Airtunes etc .
To do so is very inefficient ( there are some exceptions to this - e.g. a media player that targets Win / Lin / Mac will maybe need to implement direct support if it is to be available across the board ) .
Keeping the implementation centralised and having a single app - > sound system API is essential here .
Consistency of UI
One of my big problems with many applications is inconsistent UI .
This is a problem on Windows as much as on Linux , but it 's something OSX has done mostly right .
Users got to a central GUI to configure their sound and which device is currently active / in use .
In Linux land all sound producing apps have their own config GUI for selecting sound devices .
This is insane .
Non-technical users do n't know that you have to go to Tool -> Preferences -> Advanced ->Sound in App A and Edit -> Settings ->Audio in App B .
Sure , those of us who are reasonably technical will generally find the options ( that 's how we use applications - we click and look at all the settings pretty early on ! ) , it 's going to be less than obvious for a massive number of users .
Keeping the preferences centralised so the user always know where to look is important and for a general purpose application that outputs sound , there should be no reason to provide any config option relating to this to the user - it should " just work " ( tm ) .
Incompatibility
Some users have complained that some proprietary applications have stopped working with PulseAudio , Skype being an oft mentioned example .
Well , I 'm sorry but that 's just tough .
If a closed source application does not implement an API cleanly and does bizarre things , there is nothing we can do to fix it .
The problems Skype has experienced with PulseAudio would also be experienced by any other plugin to ALSA .
I 'm sorry to say it , but in order to move forward , some applications have to suffer and / or be forced into action .
By not allowing the people who care about this stuff the right to improve things themselves you 're taking on the responsibility to do this yourself and you need to live up to your responsibilities .
Considering the last version of Skype for Linux was released more than one and a half years ago , it 's hard to consider it as anything more than abandon - ware at present .
Will there be more pain like this ?
Yes , probably but that 's just way things are - Free Software only truly works if the whole bundle is Free , if you mix and match you , as a user , have to accept this state of affairs .
I do .
Desktop environments need to ensure they integrate nicely with PulseAudio .
GNOME is obviously doing this , but KDE is lagging behind .
I do hope to rectify the latter situation personally , and have a pretty clear roadmap to making this happen - it 's just a matter of finding the time to do it !
Conclusion
So , with all this in mind , the sound stack has to be more than just a driver layer .
It needs a persistent userspace layer that can run and keep track of various permission problems , deal with network connections and generally govern things .
At present PulseAudio is fitting the bill pretty nicely and is continuing to add support for additional constructs in the Linux stack .
As things stand all the major Linux distributions are now using PulseAudio with commercial interest from Nokia , Intel and Palm among others .
Future
So the future ?
Well , the drivers in ALSA need to be further debugged and developed to ensure the accuracy of the timing information that has so far plagued the " glitch free " system in PulseAudio .
Nothing has pushed the ALSA drivers to such limits before , but the benefits of the glitch free mode are clearly worth the pain .
Applications using the ALSA API need to ensure that they are using it correctly and sticking to the safe subset whenever possible ( thus ensuring compatibility with PulseAudio 's ALSA plugin ) .
In addition , applications such as media players need to deal properly with latencies .
It 's a bit of a myth that low latencies are needed by such applications - higher latencies will ensure better battery life on mobile players and depending how the user wants to route their sound ( e.g. to the Bluetooth enabled hi- fi system ) latencies will be something beyond the control of the application in any event .
It 's therefore important to deal with this correctly and appropriately to ensure A/V sync .
It 's only been about half a year that the ALSA level limitations on buffer sizes were lifted after lobbying from the PulseAudio maintainer .
Intel are even experimenting with 10 second buffers ( that 's not the same as latency ! ) in order to save power !
Every day more and more applications are tightening up their ALSA implementations .
Every day the constructs of the Linux desktop are becoming more stable and solidified , offering a truly joined up multi-user and network aware experience .
I think this is particularly impressive considering the fact that ( as far as I know ) only three people are employed to look after the Linux sound stack : Takashi Iwai and Jaroslav Kysela on the ALSA side and Lennart Poettering on the PulseAudio side .
While there are numerous other contributors , this is still pretty impressive progress with the resources at hand .
It 's also worth noting that two of the three are employed by RedHat , the other by Novell .
While Mandriva will still provide an easy way to disable PulseAudio if you feel it's not right for you ( just untick the box - it 's not hard !! ) or need to use these closed applications such as Skype , I believe that this will not be necessary in the not too distant future .
So where is Sound on Linux ?
In my opinion it's in a pretty good state - there are still lots of things to do , and that will never change , but there is a firm and solid framework out there now and it 's getting better every day .
A corrupt election in Afghanistan
10 August 2009
It is widely acknowledged that the August 20 presidential election in Afghanistan will be characterised by vote - rigging and the bribing or intimidation of voters in the areas under US / NATO control .
In the ethnic Pashtun southern provinces where the Taliban - led insurgency , which has called for a boycott , is most active , it is predicted that there will be mass abstention .
The result will not be credible and the new government will lack any legitimacy .
The head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , Abdul Qader Nurzai , told the New York Times earlier this month that he expects a turnout of less than 30 percent in the south .
Pointing to the potential scale of the rigging , an anonymous Afghan electoral observer estimated that there are over 3 million duplicate voter registration cards in circulation , or close to 20 percent of the total of 17 million .
Richard Holbrooke , the Obama ’s administration ’s special envoy , admitted while in Afghanistan in late July : “ We are worried about voter registration fraud , and we are worried about voters who will be unable to reach polling places because of insecurity , and we are worried about the accuracy of the vote count , and we are worried about the ability of women to vote . ”
The British ambassador to Afghanistan , Mark Sewell , told a press conference on August 5 , “ We have to recognise that these elections wo n’t be perfect , they wo n’t be up to the standards that they would be in a Western democracy with an educated population . ”
The current president , Hamid Karzai , is predicted to win the “ imperfect ” election — possibly with more than 50 percent of the vote , which will rule out a second round run-off ballot .
Karzai is supported by various ethnic - based powerbrokers who backed the US invasion and as a result returned to political prominence .
Over the past seven years , under the protection of US and NATO occupation forces , they have once again transformed the north and west of the country into their personal fiefdoms .
Karzai ’s campaign is supported by a veritable rogue ’s gallery of the warlords and tyrants who plunged Afghanistan into years of brutal civil war from 1992 to 1996 , before they were driven from power by a Taliban - led insurgency .
Karzai ’s two vice - presidential running mates are Tajik strongman Mohammad Qasim Fahim and Hazari powerbroker Karim Khalili .
Karzai has been endorsed by Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum .
All three are accused of war crimes in the 1990s and effectively control the local governments , police , Afghan army units and electoral officials in their respective spheres of influence .
Karzai is also backed by anti-Taliban Pashtun warlord Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf , a fanatical Islamist who was accused of “ repeated human butchery ” during the civil war .
He has also been endorsed by Gul Agha Sherzai , a Pashtun powerbroker whose brutal rule over Kandahar from 1992 to 1994 was a significant factor in fostering support for the Taliban .
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation accused him in June of being one of the country ’s main drug barons .
Elsewhere , in the areas of the Pashtun south under occupation control , Karzai ’s campaign has rested on money and power that stems from the network of family and tribal connections he has developed since 2001 .
Karzai ’s elder brother , Mahmoud , a US citizen , is now the richest man in Afghanistan as a result of the nepotistic contracts awarded to his businesses .
He has been given ownership of the only cement factory in the country and distribution rights for Toyota vehicles .
Another brother , Ahmed Wali , has allegedly financed his major business operations and land holdings in Kandahar province through the opium trade .
With a mixture of intimidation and bribery to ensure his victory over 40 other candidates , Karzai has not bothered to take part in the few televised debates screened on Afghan television .
He also can rely on a thoroughly subservient media .
The state - owned newspapers have devoted 69 percent of their election coverage to Karzai and just 14 percent to his main rival , Abdullah Abdullah .
A Western intelligence official told Elizabeth Rubin of the New York Times magazine : “ The Karzai family has opium and blood on their hands .
They systematically install low - level officials up to provincial governors to make sure that , from the farm gate , the opium is moved unfettered .
When history analyses this period and looks at this family , it will uncover a litany of extensive corruption that was tolerated because the West tolerated this family . ”
This is the man who has been presented internationally as the symbol of the “ democracy ” being forged by the US and NATO in Afghanistan .
In recent months , US and NATO politicians , analysts and military commanders have voiced concerns that the corrupt character of the Kabul government has become a major factor in the growth of the Taliban - led insurgency .
Millions of Afghans correctly view Karzai as a puppet of the imperialist powers that are attempting to impose neo-colonial rule over the country .
Given the growing criticisms of Karzai , it is entirely possible that the Obama administration will decide to dispense altogether with the pretence of creating democracy in Afghanistan and impose some type of “ interim government . ”
Statements last week by David Kilcullen , the counter - insurgency advisor to General David Petraeus in Iraq , who has now been appointed as an aide to Afghanistan commander General Stanley McChrystal , point in that direction .
He compared Karzai with South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem , whom the Kennedy administration had removed from power and murdered in 1963 in a US - backed military coup .
Kilcullen told the US Institute of Peace : “ He [ Karzai ] is seen as ineffective ; his family are corrupt ; he ’s alienated a very substantial portion of the population .
He seems paranoid and delusional and out of touch with reality .
That ’s all the sort of things that were said about President Diem in 1963 . ”
The corrupt character of the Afghan election , and Kilcullen ’s veiled suggestion of a post - ballot coup , serve only to demonstrate that the official justifications for the Afghan war are cynical and threadbare lies .
American and NATO troops are not killing and dying in ever greater numbers for “ democracy ” or to prevent terrorism .
Like Vietnam , the Afghan war is a neo-colonial enterprise .
Its aim is to secure Afghanistan as a base of operations for the growing great power struggle for economic and strategic dominance in resource - rich Central Asia .
The neo-colonial war in the region has the potential to trigger open conflict between US imperialism and rivals such as Russia and China which have far greater military capacities than poorly armed Afghan tribesmen .

While the contract value is n't likely to exceed a few hundred million dollars , that 's enough to bump a small firm way up the ladder in the lucrative U.S. military aviation market – especially considering likely follow - on orders .
With Lockheed Martin neatly dominating the market for manned , jet - powered fighters , any competition for other types of combat planes should be welcome .
Hawaii - based Stavatti Aerospace is surely one of the dark horses in the light - fighter race .
CEO Chris Beskar said the company is pitching its Machete design , pictured .
The Machete , which is apparently still just a paper concept , will boast a 30 - millimeter cannon , armor , radar , a jammer , 700 - mile range and a load of up to 10,000 pounds of missiles and bombs , according to Beskar .
He called his plane " a 21st - century A - 1 Skyraider . "
While it 's unlikely to win , or even ever fly , you 've got to admit : Machete looks pretty cool .
Truth be told , Hawker Beechcraft with its T - 6 and Embraer with the Super Tucano have the advantage in this contest .
The Pentagon already owns hundreds of T - 6s for training purposes , and Iraq recently ordered seven modified to carry weapons .
The Navy has leased several Super Tucanos for a special , experimental fighter program .
But smaller companies – even previously unknown ones – might have a chance .
What the Pentagon is asking for is not a particularly complex machine .
Consider that when the military went shopping for Mine - Resistant Ambush - Protected ( MRAP ) blastproof trucks two years ago , several companies with little previous military experience snagged huge orders .
The light - fighter program could create new defense contractors , in the same way that MRAP did – and in the same way that growing demand for drones recently elevated Predator - manufacturer General Atomics to the rarified ranks of U.S. fighter - makers .

TCA Tour , Day 3 : “ Bored to Death ”
HBO ’s “ Bored to Death ” panel wins the award for Most Likely To Make Me Want To Watch My Advance Screener
When I Get Home , but , then again , it ’s already a testimony to how freaking busy I was before I left for California that I could n’t find the time to check out a series that features a triple - threat cast of Jason Schwartzman , Ted Danson , and Zach Galifianakis .
When the panel kicked off with this trailer , however , I knew that , even though much of my pre-TCA time was spent trying to help my wife put together our daughter ’s 4th birthday , I ’d clearly spent that time poorly .
By the way , that was obviously a joke about spending my time poorly ( the party was a huge success ) , but I ’m completely serious about wanting to watch the screener as soon as I get home .
In addition to the trailer , though , every single person on the panel was hilarious …even Schwartzman , who appeared via satellite due to filming commitments on “ Scott Pilgrim vs. the World . ”
HBO ’s nutshell synopsis of the series…or , at least , the opening paragraph of the press release for the show , which generally tends to be about the same thing … reads as follows : “ Jonathan Ames , a young Brooklyn writer , is feeling lost .
Heʼs just gone through a painful break - up , thanks in part to his drinking , canʼt write his second novel , and carouses too much with his magazine editor .
Rather than face reality , Jonathan turns instead to his fantasies – moonlighting as a private detective – because he wants to be a hero and a man of action . ”
The idea of Schwartzman as a man of action is funny enough in and of itself , but then you ’ve got Danson as the aforementioned magazine editor , Galifianakis as Ames ’s eccentric best friend , and a premise ( and cast ) which lends itself to high - profile guest stars .
Basically , if this show is n’t a hit , then it ’s at least destined to be remembered as one of the greatest cult sitcoms of all time .
Oh , and did I mention that Jonathan Ames is actually a real person ?
True story .
He ’s apparently a rather prolific author , in fact .
( My apologies : I was n’t familiar with him before this . )
Having listened to him chat during the panel for “ Bored to Death , ” I think it ’s fair to say that the stars of the shows are going to be in good comedic hands .
Personally , I was convinced of this when he was asked to explain why the show – which would appear on the surface to be anything but boring – was given a name which so readily offers journalists a chance to fire back with snarky punchlines .
“ It ’s a risky title , ” admitted Ames .
“ I had once called one of my books ‘ What ’s Not to Love , ’ fully anticipating them saying , ‘ Plenty . ’
I also subtitled it ‘ The Adventures of a Mild Perverted Young Writer . ’
And for the next ten years it was , ‘ Perverted Writer Jonathan Ames . ’
I ’m , like , ‘ Oh , God , why was n’t I like Dave Eggers and put the word ‘ genius ’ in the title .
But ‘ Bored to Death , ’ the original short story that I wrote , there were dead bodies and the guy was bored , and I thought it was a nice play on the detective story to say ‘ Bored to Death , ’ to imply the things that were going to happen .
And it carried over to the show .
What ’s interesting is that the lead character is infinitely curious and open to the world , and he ’s so curious that he does n’t have a chance to be bored .
But it ’s a fun title .
And so I hope that the reviewers wo n’t be like , ‘‘ Bored to Death ’ ?
We certainly were . ’
But I do n’t want to write your sentences for you , so just erase that from your mind . ”
Throughout the panel , Galifianakis kept everyone laughing , offering up one - liners which only serve to confirm that his current rush of popularity is totally warranted .
There were so many , in fact , that I can actually offer you a list of my top ten favorite moments :
10 .
When asked about building chemistry between himself and Schwartzman , he replied , “ Well , it ’s always difficult because Jason ’s always on satellite . ”
9 . When he and Schwartzman were jointly asked about committing to a series as their movie careers were thriving , he looked down at his phone , then said to Schartzman , “ I just got your text about how you were going to announce that you and I were not coming back to the show . ”
8 . When a critic wondered if he was feeling the heat from “ The Hangover , ” he first asked , “ From the movie , or from last night ? ”
7 . On why he chose to do “ Bored to Death ” : “ You do a show and you like doing it , and you ’re fortunate enough to be working , and that ’s the way I see it .
If this were a ‘ Reba ’ sitcom , then maybe it would be an easier decision , but this is something you would want to be part of , so I ’m very , very happy . ”
6 . When it was suggested that he ’d appeared in just about every film this year “ except that movie about the homicidal orphan , ” he snapped , “ I did props on that . ”
5 . On his sudden success : “ If I were 26 and this was happening , it would be all great , and I would probably buy like 17 Dodge Vipers .
But right now it ’s just a major inconvenience . ”
4 . When asked how many Dodge Vipers he did buy , he first replied , “ 17 , ” then recanted and admitted , “ I have n’t bought any .
They do n’t make them in station wagon form . ”
3 . On the matter of losing time for his stand - up because of his film career , he sighed , “ I ’m going to really miss the Uncle Chuckles in Tampa . ”
2 . “ I think as soon as I ’m a wash - up in a couple of years , I will return to stand - up . ”
1 . When Ted Danson was asked a question about working predominantly on cable television in recent years rather than on a broadcast network , he went for the joke and said , “ For Jason and Zach ’s sakes , I was on a show called ‘ Cheers . ' ”
Galifianakis promptly one - upped him and replied , “ I know , I know , I know !
You tell me every five minutes !
If it is n’t ‘ Cheers , ’ it ’s fucking ‘ Becker ‘ ! ”
By the way , after the considerable burst of laughter died down , Danson did get around to answering the question , though he still tried again to score with a joke …and , this time , Zach let him .
“ In this show , I play a character who ’s struggling with relevance , and I ’m finding it really fun and easy to play , ” Danson replied .
“ The good news / bad news is , I think , on cable you ’re playing to a smaller audience .
You tend to be able to be exactly who you are without trying to water it down and accommodate a committee , so I think the writing seems to be a little more authentic , but the truth is you can find good writing everywhere if you ’re lucky .
I mean , ‘ The Office ’ is an amazing show , and that ’s on network . ”
In conclusion , it should be noted that Schwartzman got the panel ’s final laugh : as everyone here in Pasadena said , ” Thank you , ” he said the same , then reached for his microphone and asked the folks in Toronto , “ Am I off with these assholes ? ”
“ Bored to Death ” premieres on Sept. 20th on HBO .

The nonprofit FreedomWorks is " one of the main political outfits of the conservative movement and an instrumental force within the tea party , " according to Mother Jones .
[ 1 ]
While FreedomWorks describes itself as " a grassroots service center " [ 2 ] , political scientist Theda Skocpol has described the group as one of the " big- money funders and free - market advocacy organizations " that " leapt on the bandwagon " of protests in 2009 to advance their existing political agendas .
[ 3 ]
FreedomWorks , registered as 501 ( c ) 4 , has a sister organization registered as a 501 ( c ) 3 , FreedomWorks Foundation .
FreedomWorks is an " associate member " of the State Policy Network , web of right - wing “ think tanks ” and tax - exempt organizations in 50 states , Washington , D.C. , Canada , and the United Kingdom .
FreedomWorks was created in July 2004 from the merger of Citizens for a Sound Economy ( CSE ) and Empower America . [ 4 ]
FreedomWorks was headed by former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dick Armey until 2012 , when he was replaced as President by Matt Kibbe .
Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch were co-founders of CSE in 1984 , but are not active with FreedomWorks .
News and Controversies
FreedomWorks Leads Effort to Reopen Economy Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic
FreedomWorks is behind the right - wing effort to reopen the American economy , while the coronavirus pandemic continues .
FreedomWorks is " is organizing some of the protests , holding virtual town halls , and 'igniting an activist base of thousands of supporters across the nation to back up the effort . '
The FreedomWorks website features a calendar of upcoming protests , and it is polling on the protests in swing districts , reportedly sharing the data with President Donald Trump ’s economic task force , " writes Alex Kotch for ExposedbyCMD . [ 5 ]
FreedomWorks is also working with the Council for National Policy , a coalition of far - right political advocacy and think tank figures that has worked largely behind the scenes since its founding in 1981 to promote protests and coordinate a coronavirus response strategy . [ 6 ]
FreedomWorks Memo on the Debt Limit
On August 25 , 2017 , POLITICO obtained an internal FreedomWorks memo which indicated that conservatives would not support federal debt limit increases without spending cuts attached .
According to Nancy Cook of POLITICO , " In an internal FreedomWorks memo obtained by POLITICO , the group ’s vice president of legislative affairs , Jason Pye , warned Republicans that conservatives will not support a “ clean ” debt limit increase — that is , one without any spending cuts attached .
That ’s a policy move that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed recently in an effort to dampen any potential Republican - on - Republican warring over government spending . " [ 7 ]
Dick Armey 's Resignation
Dick Armey resigned as chair of FreedomWorks on November 30 , 2012 , sending his resignation to their CEO and President Matt Kibbe .
Armey stated this was " effective immediately . "
Mother Jones reported his departure December 3 , 2012 , which was not made public by FreedomWorks . [ 1 ]
" The top management team of FreedomWorks was taking a direction I thought was unproductive , and I thought it was time to move on with my life , " Armey told Mother Jones .
" Obviously I was not happy with the election results , " he says .
" We might 've gotten better results if we had gone in a different direction .
But it is n't that I got my nose out of line because we should 've done better . "
Asked if his disagreements were ideological or tactical , he replied , " They were matters of principle .
It 's how you do business as opposed to what you do .
But I do n't want to be the guy to create problems . " [ 1 ]
As part of his resignation , Armey received $ 8 million in " consulting fees " from the group , paid in annual $ 400,000 installments . [ 8 ]
2012 Controversies Over FreedomWorks Leadership
On September 4 , 2012 , the day after Labor Day , Dick Armey and his wife , Susan , entered FreedomWorks 's Capitol Hill offices accompanied by an unidentified man with a handgun holstered at his waist .
The gun-toting man took FreedomWorks 's top two employees from the office , as the Armeys informed sobbing employees they'd be losing their jobs . [ 9 ]
Matt Kibbe , FreedomWorks 's president , and Adam Brandon , its senior vice president , were removed from the premises by the armed man , two weeks after a gunman shot up the offices of the conservative Family Research Council , also in Washington , D.C. [ 10 ]
One junior staffer , speaking anonymously , said “ So when a man with a gun who did n’t identify himself to me or other people on staff , and a woman I ’d never seen before said there was an announcement , my first gut was , ‘ Is FreedomWorks in danger ? ’
It was bizarre . ’ ”
A book , Hostile Takeover , had recently been published under president Matt Kibbe 's name , though FreedomWorks staff contributed to its research , writing , and promotion . [ 11 ]
Some of Armey 's umbrage stemmed from Kibbe solely collecting royalties , which could jeopardize FreedomWorks 's nonprofit status .
Armey was threatening to sue Kibbe over the book deal .
Armey was also frustrated with Kibbe and Brandon monopolizing media appearances while continuing to trade on Armey 's name to market the group .
Further complicating matters was Armey , as an old guard of the Republican Party , wanting to work with current GOP leaders .
Younger members of FreedomWorks found that abhorrent , and indeed would soon denounce House Speaker John Boehner 's proposed " fiscal cliff " compromise while Kibbe accused him of representing “ the failed political establishment ” and “ purging House committees of fiscal conservatives . ” [ 12 ]
On December 19 , 2012 , FreedomWorks 's blog celebrated Boehner 's " Plan B " proposal . [ 13 ]
The following day , in the same post titled " Two Cheers for Boehner 's Plan B , " they grimly note , “ When folks in Washington thought FreedomWorks was for the bill , they assumed it would pass .
When FreedomWorks came out against the bill , it failed .
. . .
After review of the Boehner Plan B legislation , pending in the House today , FreedomWorks has found it must oppose the legislation , and will be urging House members to vote NO on the bill .
We will post our formal opposition letter on our site , soon . ” [ 14 ]
There were many more intra-FreedomWorks disputes . [ 15 ]
When Rep. John Mica , the Republican chair of the House transportation and infrastructure committee , was challenged by tea party freshman Rep.
Sandy Adams in Florida in another primary race caused by redistricting , Kibbe wrote , Burnley , a transportation lobbyist , called Kibbe and " made it very clear … that he had a dog in this race . "
And on June 16 , when FreedomWorks announced its " Retire Hatch " campaign against Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) , C. Boyden Gray endorsed Hatch .
A month later , Gray held a fundraiser for Wisconsin senatorial candidate Tommy Thompson — two days before FreedomWorks endorsed tea party favorite Eric Hovde , who was challenging Thompson in the GOP primary .
On December 12 , James Burnley IV , a board member , and Gray sent Kibbe a letter informing him that they had received " allegations of wrongdoing by the organization or its employees . " [ 16 ] They notified Kibbe that the group 's board of trustees had retained two attorneys , Alfred Regnery and David Martin , to conduct an independent investigation of the allegations .
Burnley and Gray ordered Kibbe to cooperate with the lawyers , to make sure no records were " destroyed , deleted , modified or otherwise tampered with , " and to send Regnery a check for $ 25,000 to cover his initial fees .
( Regnery , a prominent conservative , is the past president of Regnery Publishing , a right - wing firm that has put out books by Ann Coulter , Michelle Malkin , Pat Buchanan , and other notable conservatives . )
The letter did not specify the allegations being investigated .
Shortly after receiving the December 12 letter , Kibbe wrote a memo outlining his beef with Armey , Burnley , and Gray .
In the document — titled " Republican Insiders Attempt Hostile Takeover of FreedomWorks " — Kibbe accused the three of being shills for the Republican establishment and undercutting the group 's standing as an independent , non-partisan , conservative organization . [ 17 ]
( FreedomWorks has at times endorsed tea party candidates in primary elections against mainstream or incumbent Republicans , drawing the ire of mainline Republicans . )
Kibbe charged that the three men were trying to punish him for defying their effort to steer FreedomWorks into the conventional Republican fold .
He contended that the divisive fight within FreedomWorks was not really about his book contract or other organizational matters ; it was a grand ideological clash pitting those fully loyal to the tea party cause ( such as Kibbe ) against backroom , Washington - centric pols attempting to wield their influence to benefit their pals .
Of Kibbe 's memo , Armey says " One of the most fascinating art forms in Washington is that of the perpetrator as victim .
Matt Kibbe seems to have maintained it with this memorandum . " [ 18 ]
Six days after walking in with an anonymous armed man to force key members out of FreedomWorks , Dick Armey agreed to an $ 8 million buyout .
It was leveraged by board director Richard Stephenson , and all five targeted employees were back with FreedomWorks within that week .
Stephenson is a 73 - year - old millionaire residing in Illinois , founder of the for - profit Cancer Treatment Centers of America , and a longtime player in conservative activism .
The Washington Post notes the episode illustrates the growing role of wealthy donors in swaying the direction of FreedomWorks and other political groups , which increasingly rely on unlimited contributions from corporations and financiers for their financial livelihood .
Such gifts are often sent through corporate shells or nonprofit groups that do not have to disclose their donors , making it impossible for the public to know who is funding them .
In the weeks before the election , more than $ 12 million in donations was funneled through two Tennessee corporations to the FreedomWorks super PAC after negotiations with Stephenson over a preelection gift of the same size , according to three current and former employees with knowledge of the arrangement .
The origin of the money has not previously been reported .
The $ 12 million came from two corporations set up in Knoxville , Tennesse within one day of each other , Specialty Investments Group and Kingston Pike Development . [ 19 ]
Both were established by William S. Rose III , a bankruptcy lawyer in Knoxville .
Rose has refused to answer questions about the donations .
Three current and former FreedomWorks employees say the money came from Richard Stephenson and his family .
Growing Membership through Insurance Sales
In 2006 , the Washington Post revealed that from 2001 - 2006 CSE / FreedomWorks engaged in a hidden deal with insurance brokers whereby the brokers would sell high - deductible insurance policies and tax - free medical savings plans to individuals at a group discount , and those who purchased the plans would automatically be added FreedomWorks membership list .
Customers unaware of the membership arrangement , for which they were charged extra fees .
Membership was a condition of getting the discounted insurance plan .
The arrangement was credited with helping increase the number of " members " FreedomWorks could claim belonged to the organization .
About 16,000 people " joined " the organization in this manner , causing $ 638,040 to flow into FreedomWorks 's coffers over 5 1/2 years in the form of monthly checks for " association fees " collected by the Medical Savings Insurance Company , that were forwarded to FreedomWorks . [ 20 ]
Activities
FreedomWorks has mobilized opposition to health care reform , taxes , union labor , " common core " education policies , network neutrality , and climate legislation .
Since 2009 , FreedomWorks has been involved in the Tea Party movement .
Mother Jones writes that " FreedomWorks , under Armey 's leadership , was a key player in the rise of the tea party in 2010 .
The organization helped elect tea party favorites " and works as a " connector between tea party groups around the country , organizing protests against Obamacare and expanding the ranks of the conservative movement . " [ 1 ]
2014 Midterm Elections
According to Rollcall , which interviewed FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe in June 2014 , the group 's " involvement in campaigns is centered on providing activists with the training and resources to mount a successful ground game . " [ 21 ]
Below are some of the major races in which FreedomWorks has been active in the 2014 election cycle .
Eric Cantor 's Loss and the Vote for House Majority Leader
Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost to Eric Brat in the Republican primary for Virginia 's 7th District on June 10 , 2014 . [ 22 ]
Brat was backed by Tea Party activists , but had little support from outside groups such as FreedomWorks . [ 23 ]
After Cantor lost , he announced that he would step down as House Majority Leader , prompting a June 19 vote for a new Majority Leader .
Ahead of the vote , FreedomWorks supported Rep. Raúl Labrador ( R - ID ) against the presumed front - runner , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy ( R - CA ) . [ 24 ]
The Washington Post described FreedomWorks as " one of the few outfits agitating for an alternative to McCarthy " when it " released a statement Friday morning [ June 13 ] urging Labrador to announce a run . " [ 25 ]
Kentucky
In Kentucky 's Republican Senate primary , FreedomWorks backed Matt Bevin against incumbent Sen. Mitch McConnell , the Senate minority leader .
FreedomWorks hosted a national conference for Tea Party groups in early April 2014 , during which speakers including Matt Kibbe and Glenn Beck attacked McConnell . [ 26 ]
FreedomWorks reported spending over $ 300,000 in the race , [ 27 ] part of over $ 1 million in spending by outside tea party groups .
Bevin lost the primary , winning only 35.7 % of the vote to McConnell 's 60 % . [ 28 ]
Mississippi
In the Mississippi Republican Senate primary , FreedomWorks supported state Sen. Chris McDaniel against incumbent Sen .
Thad Cochran , spending around $ 419,000 as of June 18 , 2014 . [ 27 ]
According to Kibbe , the group 's support included " printing door hangers and yard signs and other literature their members can hand out when canvassing " as well as spending on social media . [ 21 ]
Outside groups including FreedomWorks and the Chamber of Commerce had spent over $ 8.4 million on the race by early June .
The June 3 primary ended with McDaniel slightly ahead but short of a majority , prompting a June 24 runoff vote .
According to the Associated Press , FreedomWorks planned to spend an additional $ 350,000 in the runoff . [ 29 ]
North Carolina
FreedomWorks backed Dr. Greg Brannon against Thom Tillis in the North Carolina Republican Senate primary , spending $ 117,040 . [ 27 ]
After Brannon 's loss , Kibbe said in an interview that Freedomworks was considering supporting Tillis against Democratic incumbent Sen .
Kay Hagan by running " an " anti- Kay Hagan " campaign . " [ 21 ]
As of June 18 , 2014 , Freedomworks had already spent $ 44,776 campaigning against Hagan . [ 27 ]
Anti-Union Work ( 2011 - 2013 )
In January of 2013 , FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe announced a new " Save the States " campaign .
Four out of five issues in the campaign are tied to weakening unions , either directly or indirectly . [ 30 ]
In December of 2012 , FreedomWorks announced " an aggressive grassroots , state - based campaign " for 2013 to " push back against domineering unions . " [ 30 ]
After the 2012 presidential election , FreedomWorks promoted a petition to " support Michigan Governor Rick Snyder " in his anti-union push [ 31 ] , published multiple blogs attacking unions [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] , and released a study purporting to show the benefits of " paycheck protection " legislation to defund unions in Pennsylvania . [ 35 ]
FreedomWorks was also involved in an anti-union campaign in Ohio in 2011 , supporting Republican Gov. John Kasich 's " union - busting Senate Bill 5 " with " tens of thousands of door hangers and yard signs " as well as a website . [ 36 ]
Organizing " grassroots " Tea Parties ( 2009 )
FreedomWorks was one of the lobbying groups involved in orchestrating the April 15 , 2009 anti-Obama , anti-tax " tea parties " .
In February 2009 , the FreedomWorks website said the group was " now working with other groups to plan a massive , nationwide tea party protest day for Tax Day on April 15th , 2009 " [ 37 ] , the Tax Day Tea Party protests .
In summer of 2009 , FreedomWorks began pursuing an aggressive strategy to create the appearance of mass public opposition to health care and clean energy reform at Congressmembers ' town - hall meetings in their districts .
A leaked memo from Bob MacGuffie , a volunteer with the FreedomWorks website " Tea Party Patriots , " describes how members should infiltrate town hall meetings and harass and intimidate Democratic members of Congress :
" Spread out in the hall and try to be in the front half .
The objective is to put the Rep on the defensive with your questions and follow - up ...
You need to rock - the - boat early in the Rep 's presentation .
Watch for an opportunity to yell out and challenge the Rep 's statements early .
If he blames Bush for something or offers other excuses -- call him on it , yell back and have someone else follow - up with a shout - out ...
The goal is to rattle him ... " [ 38 ]
At the time , The New York Times reported on accusations by Democrats that such town hall opposition was " part of a coordinated effort to scuttle the White House political agenda rather than a true representation of public opinion , " and noted that FreedomWorks had " repeatedly been in the center of the controversy at town halls . " [ 39 ]
For example , in August 2009 , FreedomWorks supported the American Petroleum Institute 's " Energy Citizens " rallies to oppose the Waxman - Markey Climate Bill , held in about 20 states .
Other backers included the National Association of Manufacturers , American Conservative Union , Americans for Tax Reform and Council for Citizens Against Government Waste . [ 39 ]
" Grassroots " Anti-Bailout Website ( 2008 )
In 2008 , FreedomWorks was behind the creation of a fake grassroots web site called Angryrenter.com which rallied opposition to " the Obama Housing Bailout " ; the site claimed to represent " Renters and responsible homeowners against a government mortgage bailout " , and urged people to oppose bailing out mortgage companies .
Michael M. Phillips of the Wall Street Journal investigated AngryRenter.com and reported [ 40 ] :
" AngryRenter.com looks a bit like a digital ransom note , with irregular fonts , exclamation points and big red arrows -- all emphasizing prudent renters ' outrage over a proposed government bailout for irresponsible homeowners .
" It seems like America 's renters may NEVER be able to afford a home , " AngryRenter.com laments .
The Web site urges like - minded tenants to let Congress feel their fury by signing an online petition .
" We are millions of renters standing up for our rights ! "
Angry they may be , but the people behind AngryRenter.com are certainly not renters .
Though it purports to be a spontaneous uprising , AngryRenter.com is actually a product of an inside - the - Beltway conservative advocacy organization led by Dick Armey , the former House majority leader , and publishing magnate Steve Forbes , a fellow Republican .
It 's a fake grass - roots effort -- what politicos call an AstroTurf campaign -- that provides a window into the sleight - of - hand ways of Washington . "
Ties to the Koch Brothers
The founders of FreedomWorks ' predecessor organization , Citizens for a Sound Economy ( CSE ) , included Charles Koch , David Koch , and close Koch associate Richard Fink . [ 41 ]
According to the New Yorker :
" The Koch brothers , after helping to create Cato and Mercatus , concluded that think tanks alone were not enough to effect change .
They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street , and to attract the public ’s support .
In 1984 , David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization , and Kibbe joined them .
The group , Citizens for a Sound Economy , seemed like a grassroots movement , but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was sponsored principally by the Kochs , who provided $ 7.9 million between 1986 and 1993 .
Its mission , Kibbe said , “ was to take these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America . " " [ 41 ]
CSE received millions of dollars in funding from organizations with close ties to the Koch brothers , including Koch Industries , the Koch family foundations , and DonorsTrust and the Donors Capital Fund .
Ties to the Bradley Foundation
FreedomWorks has received close to a million dollars in funding from Bradley .
( See below . )
Ties to Tobacco
Tobacco Control [ 42 ] )
Connections between the tobacco industry , third - party allies and the Tea Party , from the 1980's ( top ) through 2012 ( bottom ) .
The thick black line connects CSE with its direct successor organisations ( Source :
According to the U.K. Guardian , FreedomWorks has received funding from the tobacco conglomerate Philip Morris .
The Guardian also reports that local branches of FreedomWorks 's sister organization Americans for Prosperity have also received tobacco money and opposes smoke - free workplace laws and cigarette taxes . [ 43 ]
Freedomworks also opposes tobacco taxes . [ 44 ]
Tobacco Industry and the Tea Party
According to a study published February 8 , 2013 in the journal Tobacco Control , " Rather than being a purely grassroots movement that spontaneously developed in 2009 , the Tea Party has developed over time , in part through decades of work by the tobacco industry and other corporate interests . " [ 42 ]
Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks , both of whom have worked to oppose smoke - free laws across the United States since at least 2006 , were major players in this effort , with help from the PR firm , DCI Group . [ 42 ]
History
Founding
In July 2004 , FreedomWorks was created from the merger of Citizens for a Sound Economy ( CSE ) and Empower America . [ 4 ]
( Although the FreedomWorks 's website stated until late 2007 that it was founded in 1984 [ 45 ] , it was CSE that was founded at that time . )
According to the New Yorker , CSE had split due to " internal rivalries , " with founders David Koch and Richard Fink leaving to found Americans for Prosperity . [ 41 ]
In late July 2004 , the initial FreedomWorks media release stated that " three of the most respected and accomplished leaders of the conservative , free - market movement " -- former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dick Armey , former White House Counsel and conservative luminary C. Boyden Gray , and Jack Kemp -- " will serve as the Co-Chairmen of FreedomWorks .
Bill Bennett will focus on school choice as a Senior Fellow .
Matt Kibbe is FreedomWorks ’ new President and CEO . " [ 4 ]
In this initial statement , FreedomWorks outlined that its initial plan was to " run major voter education campaigns and Get - Out - the - Vote ( GOTV ) efforts in key races " in the 2004 Congressional elections .
Kibbe stated that the role of FreedomWorks was to be a " powerful answer to the challenge presented by the Left and groups like America Coming Together ( ACT ) , MoveOn.org , and the Media Fund . " [ 4 ]
The statement said that FreedomWorks :
" ... boasts over 360,000 members and a legal structure that includes a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) , a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) , a 527 , a federal PAC , and various state PACs .
FreedomWorks is headquartered in Washington , D.C. , with full - time campaign staff on the ground in the battleground states of Florida , Illinois , Iowa , Michigan , North Carolina , Oregon , Texas , Washington , and Wisconsin .
The new organization also houses a sophisticated conservative political database containing over 600,000 activist names in all 50 states . " [ 4 ]
Ties of Founding Officers
Prior to 2004 , when Citizens for a Sound Economy split into FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity , Dick Armey was CEO / President and Tom Posey was Treasurer , with David H. Koch and C. Boyden Gray sharing seats at the the Board of Directors .
It is not clear whether CSE's Tom Posey is the same Thomas Posey who was deeply involved in the Iran - Contra scandal . [ 46 ]
Gray was heir to the American Tobacco Company fortune .
Funding
FreedomWorks is not required to disclose its donors .
However , documents filed by donor organizations show that conservative foundations , trusts , and individuals , some with close ties to the Koch brothers , have donated large sums to FreedomWorks .
These funders include the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation , the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation , the Sarah Scaife Foundation .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , FreedomWorks " received nearly 60 percent of its $ 15 million in revenues from just four donors in 2012 " who " gave between $ 1 million and $ 5 million each . " [ 47 ]
According to documents leaked to Mother Jones , in 2012 ,
" Eight donors gave a half - million dollars or more ; 22 donated between $ 100,000 and $ 499,999 ; 17 cut checks between $ 50,000 and $ 99,999 ; and 95 gave between $ 10,000 and $ 49,999 .
Foundations contributed $ 1.6 million in major gifts , and corporations donated $ 330,000 . " [ 48 ]
According to the Washington Post , FreedomWorks board member Richard Stephenson arranged for around $ 12 million in donations to be funneled to FreedomWorks in 2012 , and Stephenson reportedly promised to donate $ 400,000 per year for the following 20 years . [ 49 ]

Consumer advocates breathed a sigh of relief today as the House took a major step towards FDA reform by passing H.R. 2749 , The Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009 .
After the provision fell just short of the supermajority needed under a suspension of the rules yesterday , the bill passed easily ( 283 - 142 ) under a closed rule .
Caroline Smith DeWaal , Food Safety Director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest , released a statement hailing the passage of the bill .
“ FDA has been operating under the same law for 70 years and can do little more than respond to outbreaks after the fact .
This bill gives the FDA more authority and real enforcement teeth to help prevent more outbreaks , illnesses , and deaths . ”
“ I think it ’s a credit to the hard work of a lot of people and yeomen ’s work of 3 years of hearings , ” said Toni Corbo of Food & Water Watch .
“ It took a coalition of consumer groups to really put this issue on the front burner for this session . ”
Corbo also was quick to add that the bill ’s success was a tribute to the victims of foodborne illness , noting that the family members of lost ones played a key role in shoring up support for the measure .
Food Safety Advocate Bill Marler followed the debate and vote closely .
“ It was great to see consumers , producers and manufacturers come together to support the first real food safety legislation in 50 years , ” he said .
“ Now , however , the real work comes in working with the Senate and eventually a Conference Committee before it lands on the President ’s desk . ”
After meeting with over 200 members of Congress and over 80 Senators , Pat Buck , executive director of the Center for Foodborne Illness Research & Prevention whose grandson , Kevin , died from eating an E. coli-tainted hamburger , was ecstatic over HR 2749 ’s success .
“ This was a victory for the consumer today , it really was . ”
“ It is very exciting .
It shows me that , finally , the very people who should be taking leadership are acting in a timely fashion .
Congress is really responding to a 21st century need . ”
Buck stressed the importance of today ’s success , adding that some advocates were worried food safety would not have received another chance in the 111th Congress had HR 2749 failed .
Though HR 2749 was a key success , it only marks the beginning of a long fight to bring legislation to President Obama ’s desk .
“ This is the first step , ” said Corbo , who noted that Food and Water Watch would work hard to ensure a similar bill in the Senate in the face of a legislative agenda dominated by health care reform and appropriations bills .
“ It ’s quite an agenda .
We ’re going to make sure food safety is in the queue before the end of the year .
We need this legislation on the books so FDA can do its job properly . ”
The food safety bill continues to garner broad support from consumer , health , and industry groups and it is expected to come before the Senate this fall .

A short history of btrfs

You probably have heard of the cool new kid on the file system block , btrfs ( pronounced " butter -eff-ess " ) - after all , Linus Torvalds is using it as his root file system on one of his laptops .
But you might not know much about it beyond a few high - level keywords - copy - on - write , checksums , writable snapshots - and a few sensational rumors and stories - the Phoronix benchmarks , btrfs is a ZFS ripoff , btrfs is a secret plan for Oracle domination of Linux , etc .
When it comes to file systems , it 's hard to tell truth from rumor from vile slander : the code is so complex , the personalities are so exaggerated , and the users are so angry when they lose their data .
You can't even settle things with a battle of the benchmarks : file system workloads vary so wildly that you can make a plausible argument for why any benchmark is either totally irrelevant or crucially important .
In this article , we 'll take a behind - the - scenes look at the design and development of btrfs on many levels - technical , political , personal - and trace it from its origins at a workshop to its current position as Linus 's root file system .
Knowing the background and motivation for each step will help you understand why btrfs was started , how it works , and where it 's going in the future .
By the end , you should be able to hand - wave your way through a description of btrfs 's on - disk format .
: I have two huge disclaimers to make :
One , I worked on ZFS for several years while at Sun .
Two , I have already been subpoenaed and deposed for the various Sun / NetApp patent lawsuits and I 'd like to avoid giving them any excuse to subpoena me again .
I 'll do my best to be fair , honest , and scrupulously correct .
btrfs : Pre-history
Imagine you are a Linux file system developer .
It 's 2007 , and you are at the Linux Storage and File systems workshop .
Things are looking dim for Linux file systems : Reiserfs , plagued with quality issues and an unsustainable funding model , has just lost all credibility with the arrest of Hans Reiser a few months ago .
ext4 is still in development ; in fact , it is n't even called ext4 yet .
Fundamentally , ext4 is just a straightforward extension of a 30 - year - old format and is light - years behind the competition in terms of features .
At the same time , companies are clamping down on funding for Linux development ; IBM 's Linux division is coming to the end of its grace period and needs to show profitability now .
Other companies are catching wind of an upcoming recession and are cutting research across the board .
They want projects with time to results measured in months , not years .
Ever hopeful , the file systems developers are meeting anyway .
Since the workshop is co-located with USENIX FAST '07 , several researchers from academia and industry are presenting their ideas to the workshop .
One of them is Ohad Rodeh .
He 's invented a kind of btree that is copy - on - write ( COW ) friendly [ PDF ] .
To start with , btrees in their native form are wildly incompatible with COW .
The leaves of the tree are linked together , so when the location of one leaf changes ( via a write - which implies a copy to a new block ) , the link in the adjacent leaf changes , which triggers another copy - on - write and location change , which changes the link in the next leaf ...
The result is that the entire btree , from top to bottom , has to be rewritten every time one leaf is changed .
Rodeh 's btrees are different : first , he got rid of the links between leaves of the tree - which also " throws out a lot of the existing b- tree literature " , as he says in his slides [ PDF ] - but keeps enough btree traits to be useful .
( This is a fairly standard form of btrees in file systems , sometimes called " B+trees " . )
He added some algorithms for traversing the btree that take advantage of reference counts to limit the amount of the tree that has to be traversed when deleting a snapshot , as well as a few other things , like proactive split and merge of interior nodes so that inserts and deletes do n't require any backtracking .
The result is a simple , robust , generic data structure which very efficiently tracks extents ( groups of contiguous data blocks ) in a COW file system .
Rodeh successfully prototyped the system some years ago , but he 's done with that area of research and just wants someone to take his COW - friendly btrees and put them to good use .
btrfs :
The beginning
Chris Mason took these COW - friendly btrees and ran with them .
Back in the day , Chris worked on Reiserfs , where he learned a lot about what to do and what not to do in a file system .
Reiserfs had some cool features - small file packing , btrees for fast lookup , flexible layout - but the implementation tended to be haphazard and ad hoc .
Code paths proliferated wildly , and along with them potential bugs .
Chris had an insight :
What if everything in the file system - inodes , file data , directory entries , bitmaps , the works - was an item in a copy - on - write btree ?
All reads and writes to storage would go through the same code path , one that packed the items into btree nodes and leaves without knowing or caring about the item type .
Then you only have to write the code once and you get checksums , reference counting ( for snapshots ) , compression , fragmentation , etc. , for anything in the file system .
Chris came up with the following basic structure for btrfs ( " btrfs " comes from " btree file system " ) .
Btrfs consists of three types of on - disk structures : block headers , keys , and items , currently defined as follows :
struct btrfs_header { u8 csum [ 32 ] ; u8 fsid [ 16 ] ; __le64 blocknr ; __le64 flags ; u8 chunk_tree_uid [ 16 ] ; __le64 generation ; __le64 owner ; __le32 nritems ; u8 level ; } struct btrfs_disk_key { __le64 objectid ; u8 type ; __le64 offset ; } struct btrfs_item { struct btrfs_disk_key key ; __le32 offset ; __le32 size ; }
Inside the btree ( that is , the " branches " of the tree , as opposed to the leaves at the bottom of the tree ) , nodes consist only of keys and block headers .
The keys tell you where to go looking for the item you want , and the block headers tell you where the next node or leaf in the btree is located on disk .
The leaves of the btree contain items , which are a combination of keys and data .
Similarly to reiserfs , the items and data are packed in extremely space - efficient way : the item headers ( that is , the item structure described above ) are packed together starting at the beginning of the block , and the data associated with each item is packed together starting at the end of the block .
So item headers and data grow towards each other , as shown in the diagram to the right .
Besides being code efficient , this scheme is space and time efficient as well .
Normally , file systems put only one kind of data - bitmaps , or inodes , or directory entries - in any given file system block .
This wastes disk space , since unused space in one kind of block can't be used for any other purpose , and it wastes time , since getting to one particular piece of file data requires reading several different kinds of metadata , all located in different blocks in the file system .
In btrfs , items are packed together ( or pushed out to leaves ) in arrangements that optimize both access time and disk space .
You can see the difference in these ( very schematic , very simplified ) diagrams .
Old - school filesystems tend to organize data like this :
Btrfs , instead , creates a disk layout which looks more like :
In both diagrams , red blocks denote wasted disk space and red arrows denote seeks .
Each kind of metadata and data in the file system - a directory entry , an inode , an extended attribute , file data itself - is stored as a particular type of item .
If we go back to the definition of an item , we see that its first element is a key :
struct btrfs_disk_key { __le64 objectid ; u8 type ; __le64 offset ; }
Let 's start with the objectid field .
Each object in the file system - generally an inode - has a unique objectid .
This is fairly standard practice - it 's the equivalent of inode numbers .
What makes btrfs interesting is that the objectid makes up the most significant bits of the item key - what we use to look up an item in the btree - and the lower bits are different kinds of items related to that objectid .
This results in grouping together all the information associated with a particular objectid .
If you allocate adjacent objectids , then all the items from those objectids are also allocated close together .
The < objectid , type > pair automatically groups related data close to each other regardless of the actual content of the data , as opposed to the classical file system approach , which writes separate optimized allocators for each kind of file system data .
type
Thefield tells you what kind of data is stored in the item .
Is it the inode ?
Is it a directory entry ?
Is it an extent telling you where the file data is on disk ?
Is it the file data itself ?
With the combination of objectid and the type , you can look up any file system data you need in the btree .
We should take a quick look at the structure of the btree nodes and leaves themselves .
Each node and leaf is an extent in the btree - nodes are extents full of < key , block header > pairs , and leaves contain items .
Large file data is stored outside of the btree leaves , with the item describing the extent kept in the leaf itself .
( What constitutes a " large " file is tunable based on the workload . )
Each extent describing part of the btree has a checksum and a reference count , which permits writable snapshots .
Each extent also includes an explicit back reference to each of the extents that refer to it .
Back references give btrfs a major advantage over every other file system in its class because now we can quickly and efficiently migrate data , incrementally check and repair the file system , and check the correctness of reference counts during normal operation .
The proof is that btrfs already supports fast , efficient device removal and shrinking of the available storage for a file system .
Many other file systems list " shrink file system " as a feature , but it usually ends up implemented inefficiently and slowly and several years late - or not at all .
For example , ext3 / 4 can shrink a file system - by traversing the entire file system searching for data located in the area of the device being removed .
It 's a slow , fraught , bug - prone process .
ZFS still can't shrink a file system .
The result is beautifully generic and elegant : Everything on disk is a btree containing reference counted , checksummed extents of items , organized by < objectid , type > keys .
A great deal of the btrfs code does n't care at all what is stored in the items , it just knows how to add or remove them from the btree .
Optimizing disk layout is simple : allocate things with similar keys close together .
btrfs :
The politics
At the same time that Chris was figuring out the technical design of btrfs , he was also figuring out how to fund the development of btrfs in both the short and the long term .
Chris had recently moved from SUSE to a special Linux group at Oracle , one that employs several high - level Linux storage developers , including Martin K. Petersen , Zach Brown , and Jens Axboe .
Oracle funds a lot of Linux development , some of it obviously connected to the Oracle database ( OCFS2 , DIF / DIX ) , and some of it less so ( generic block layer work , syslets ) .
Here 's how Chris put it in a recent interview with Amanda McPherson from the Linux Foundation :
Amanda :
Why did you start this project ?
Why is Oracle supporting this project so prominently ?
Chris : I started Btrfs soon after joining Oracle .
I had a unique opportunity to take a detailed look at the features missing from Linux , and felt that Btrfs was the best way to solve them .
Linux is a very important platform for Oracle .
We use it heavily for our internal operations , and it has a broad customer base for us .
We want to keep Linux strong as a data center operating system , and innovating in storage is a natural way for Oracle to contribute .
In other words , Oracle likes having Linux as a platform , and is willing to invest development effort in it even if it's not directly related to Oracle database performance .
Look at it this way : how many operating systems are written and funded in large part by your competitors ?
While it is tempting to have an operating system entirely under your control - like Solaris - it also means that you have to pay for most of the development on that platform .
In the end , Oracle believes it is in its own interest to use its in - house expertise to help keep Linux strong .
After a few months of hacking and design discussions with Zach Brown and many others , Chris posted btrfs for review .
From there on out , you can trace the history of btrfs like any other open source project through the mailing lists and source code history .
Btrfs is now in the mainline kernel and developers from Red Hat , SUSE , Intel , IBM , HP , Fujitsu , etc. are all working on it .
Btrfs is a true open source project - not just in the license , but also in the community .
btrfs : A brief comparison with ZFS
People often ask about the relationship between btrfs and ZFS .
From one point of view , the two file systems are very similar : they are copy - on - write checksummed file systems with multi-device support and writable snapshots .
From other points of view , they are wildly different : file system architecture , development model , maturity , license , and host operating system , among other things .
Rather than answer individual questions , I 'll give a short history of ZFS development and compare and contrast btrfs and ZFS on a few key items .
When ZFS first got started , the outlook for file systems in Solaris was rather dim as well .
Logging UFS was already nearing the end of its rope in terms of file system size and performance .
UFS was so far behind that many Solaris customers paid substantial sums of money to Veritas to run VxFS instead .
Solaris needed a new file system , and it needed it soon .
Jeff Bonwick decided to solve the problem and started the ZFS project inside Sun .
His organizing metaphor was that of the virtual memory subsystem - why can't disk be as easy to administer and use as memory ?
The central on - disk data structure was the slab - a chunk of disk divided up into the same size blocks , like that in the SLAB kernel memory allocator , which he also created .
Instead of extents , ZFS would use one block pointer per block , but each object would use a different block size - e.g. , 512 bytes , or 128KB - depending on the size of the object .
Block addresses would be translated through a virtual - memory - like mechanism , so that blocks could be relocated without the knowledge of upper layers .
All file system data and metadata would be kept in objects .
And all changes to the file system would be described in terms of changes to objects , which would be written in a copy - on - write fashion .
In summary , btrfs organizes everything on disk into a btree of extents containing items and data .
ZFS organizes everything on disk into a tree of block pointers , with different block sizes depending on the object size .
btrfs checksums and reference - counts extents , ZFS checksums and reference - counts variable - sized blocks .
Both file systems write out changes to disk using copy - on - write - extents or blocks in use are never overwritten in place , they are always copied somewhere else first .
So , while the feature list of the two file systems looks quite similar , the implementations are completely different .
It 's a bit like convergent evolution between marsupials and placental mammals - a marsupial mouse and a placental mouse look nearly identical on the outside , but their internal implementations are quite a bit different !
In my opinion , the basic architecture of btrfs is more suitable to storage than that of ZFS .
One of the major problems with the ZFS approach - " slabs " of blocks of a particular size - is fragmentation .
Each object can contain blocks of only one size , and each slab can only contain blocks of one size .
You can easily end up with , for example , a file of 64 K blocks that needs to grow one more block , but no 64 K blocks are available , even if the file system is full off nearly empty slabs of 512 byte blocks , 4 K blocks , 128 K blocks , etc .
To solve this problem , we ( the ZFS developers ) invented ways to create big blocks out of little blocks ( " gang blocks " ) and other unpleasant workarounds .
In our defense , at the time btrees and extents seemed fundamentally incompatible with copy - on - write , and the virtual memory metaphor served us well in many other respects .
In contrast , the items - in - a - btree approach is extremely space efficient and flexible .
Defragmentation is an ongoing process - repacking the items efficiently is part of the normal code path preparing extents to be written to disk .
Doing checksums , reference counting , and other assorted metadata busy - work on a per-extent basis reduces overhead and makes new features ( such as fast reverse mapping from an extent to everything that references it ) possible .
Now for some personal predictions ( based purely on public information - I do n't have any insider knowledge ) .
Btrfs will be the default file system on Linux within two years .
Btrfs as a project wo n't ( and ca n't , at this point ) be canceled by Oracle .
If all the intellectual property issues are worked out ( a big if ) , ZFS will be ported to Linux , but it will have less than a few percent of the installed base of btrfs .
Check back in two years and see if I got any of these predictions right !
Btrfs :
What 's next ?
Btrfs is heading for 1.0 , a little more than 2 years since the first announcement .
This is much faster than many file systems veterans - including myself - expected , especially given that during most of that time , btrfs had only one full - time developer .
Btrfs is not ready for production use - that is , storing and serving data you would be upset about losing - but it is ready for widespread testing - e.g. , on your backed - up - nightly laptop , or your experimental netbook that you reinstall every few weeks anyway .
Be aware that there was a recent flag day in the btrfs on - disk format :
A commit shortly after the 2.6.30 release changed the on disk format in a way that is n't compatible with older kernels .
If you create your btrfs file system using the old , 2.6.30 or earlier kernel and tools , and boot into a newer kernel with the new format , you wo n't be able to use your file system with a 2.6.30 or older kernel any longer .
Linus Torvalds found this out the hard way .
But if this does happen to you , do n't panic - you can find rescue images and other helpful information on the the btrfs wiki .
WASHINGTON -- Sen.
Arlen Specter said Wednesday he thinks people who have been angrily disrupting town hall meetings on overhauling the health care system are " not necessarily representative of America , " but should be heard .
" It 's more than health care , " said Specter , 79 , who earlier this year left the Republican Party and became a Democrat .
" I think there is a mood in America of anger with so many people unemployed , with so much bickering in Washington ... with the fear of losing their health care .
It all boils over . "
Specter and Sen. Claire McCaskill , a Missouri Democrat , appeared on a nationally broadcast news show today , a day after town hall meetings -- including Specter 's in Lebanon , Pa. -- they hosted erupted in the same kind of catcalls , jeers and shouting that has characterized many such forums in recent weeks .
" There were a couple of tough moments , " McCaskill said of her experience , " but it lasted two hours and there were thousands of people there . "
Jeers and taunts drowned out both Specter and McCaskill on occasion Tuesday .
President Barack Obama was treated more respectfully at his town hall meeting in New Hampshire .
" You 'll be gone , by God the bureaucrats will still be here , " one man told Specter at a session at the Harrisburg Area Community College campus in Lebanon .
Arlen Specter hammered by comments at Lebanon town meeting
" If they do n't let us vent our frustrations out , they will have a revolution , " Mary Ann Fieser of Hillsboro , Mo. , told McCaskill at her Missouri health care forum .
McCaskill admonished the rowdy crowd , saying " I do n't understand this rudeness .
I honestly do n't get it . "
The bitter sessions underscored the challenge for the administration as it tries to win over an increasingly skeptical public on the costly and far - reaching task of revamping the nation 's health care system .
Desperate to stop a hardening opposition , the White House created a Web site to dispel what it says are smears and House Democrats set up a health care " war room " out of Majority Leader Steny Hoyer 's office to help lawmakers handle questions .
Specter , who has another such forum scheduled Wedneday at State College , Pa. , said he had been " impressed with the fact that people have been very well prepared . "
He said many have come to meetings with copies of the legislation and have cited specific provisions in their arguments .
" These people have a right to be organized , " the senator said on CBS 's " The Early Show . "
" I 'm not going to complain about being organized .
They have a right to speak , " he said , " but I think we have to explain , they 're not necessarily representative of America .
I think they 're vocal .
I do n't think they 're representative . "
Specter said he did n't think people opposed to various health care proposals have a right to disrupt public meetings on the issue .
Obama answered his critics indirectly .
At his town hall in Portsmouth , N.H. , he urged Americans to ignore those who try to " scare and mislead the American people , " telling a cordial audience , " For all the scare tactics out there , what is truly scary is if we do nothing . "
McCaskill said she was " proud of the people that showed up and I do n't take that personally .
It 's that they do n't trust government right now , " she said on NBC's " Today " show .
Paramount Pictures ’ strategy to shun big coastal cities and the critics paid off on opening weekend , but there ’s reason to wonder whether the momentum will last .
“ G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra ” earned a solid $ 56.2 million domestically and $ 44.1 million overseas , according to studio estimates .
Spyglass Entertainment covered 25 % of the picture ’s $ 175 - million production budget , while Paramount paid for the rest and spent about $ 150 million to market and distribute it worldwide .
The opening weekend total of $ 100.3 million is about $ 10 million behind that of “ Star Trek , ” Paramount ’s similar and successful attempt to revive a brand on the big screen in May .
The “ G.I. Joe ” launch was good enough , however , to potentially start a third summer franchise for the studio , along with “ Star Trek ” and “ Transformers . ”
Paramount Vice Chairman Rob Moore said development on a “ G.I. Joe ” sequel would begin soon .
Most of the film ’s principal cast is contractually obligated to return , though director Stephen Sommers is not .

Paramount focused more advertising money than usual on smaller cities in the Midwest and South for the picture , a strategy that was reflected in ticket sales .
Whereas movies typically earn about 50 % of their box - office revenue in the Northeast and on the West Coast , Moore said , “ G.I. Joe ” did 40 % of its business in those regions .
There was one statistic , however , that could prove worrisome for the studio :
Although opening - day audiences gave the movie an average grade of B - plus , according to market research firm CinemaScore , ticket sales declined 18 % on Saturday from Friday .
That ’s often an indicator of bad buzz among moviegoers .
Universal and Sony Pictures ’ “ Funny People ” experienced a slightly smaller Friday to Saturday drop of 15 % on its opening weekend .
This weekend , the film ’s second , its ticket sales plunged 65 % .
“ Star Trek , ” by contrast , saw its ticket sales increase Saturday from its Friday start and went on to more than triple its opening - weekend gross in the U.S. and Canada .

Such a fate seems unlikely for “ G.I. Joe , ” particularly since Sony ’s “ District 9 " opens Friday and is expected to perform well with males , who made up more than 60 % of the audience for this weekend ’s No. 1 film .
Moore said Paramount would attempt to counter that threat by focusing advertising more on families , which made up only one - third of the opening weekend audience for the PG - 13 - rated “ G.I. Joe . ”
“ We really have the month of August to go after families with a boy who ’s not too young and tell them this is a movie they ’ll be interested in , ” said Moore , who noted that upcoming male - targeted pictures such as “ District 9 " and “ Inglorious Basterds ” are rated R .
If “ G.I. Joe ” does fade quickly at the domestic box office , it could make up some of the difference on the international front .
The film did better than “ Star Trek ” in nearly every foreign country , particularly East Asia , where South Korean co-star Byung - hun Lee was featured in the advertising .
It has yet to open in several major markets , including Germany and Italy .

Sony ’s attempt to counter - program with a film aimed at adult women proved successful , as “ Julie & Julia ” opened to $ 20.1 million , a healthy start given the Nora Ephron - directed drama ’s production budget of about $ 40 million .
Moviegoers were 67 % female and 64 % over age 35 .
“ It ’s an audience that does n’t run out to movies necessarily , ” said Rory Bruer , distribution president for Sony Pictures .
“ That bodes well for our future because they have a tendency to keep going for weeks and weeks . ”
Sony should be helped by positive buzz , as moviegoers gave “ Julie and Julia ” an average grade of A and ticket sales Saturday increased 16 % from Friday .
It will face stiff competition next weekend , however , from Warner Bros ’ “ The Time Traveler ’s Wife , ” which is tracking well with women , according to pre-release polling .
“ Julie & Julia ” undoubtedly got a boost from largely positive reviews .
“ G.I. Joe ” was generally savaged by critics , but most reviews did n’t appear until late Friday or Saturday morning .
That ’s because Paramount did n’t screen the film ahead of time for print and broadcast media , a first this year for a big - budget event film .

Moore said he was confident it was the right strategy , pointing to a brutally negative review in the New York Times that called the film a “ gaseous emission ” and “ junk . ”
“ Why do I want that review to run on Friday ? ” he asked with a laugh .

Saturday was a burning hot day in the West Bank .
Combatants for Peace , a group made up of Israeli ex-combat soldiers and Palestinian ex-fighters , planned a protest at an illegal outpost adjacent to Shufa , a Palestinian village in the northern West Bank that is very close to the Green Line .
The illegal outpost was built by settlers from the settlement of Avney Hefetz over the last three weeks .
They simply took over a hilltop on Palestinian land and constructed makeshift tents that are guarded by the IDF .
While the tents are not settlements , the pattern is clear .
Build a tent , then build a house , then another one and you have a settlement protected by the IDF that then becomes a “ consensus area ” too populated to ever evacuate .
Combatants for Peace decided that the best form of protest for this illegal behavior was to build a structure next to the outpost itself .
We wanted to gauge the reaction of the IDF if we engaged in the precisely the same activities as the settlers – except for one major difference :
We were invited by the landowner such that our presence there was actually legit .
Over two hundred Israeli , Palestinian and international activists approached the hilltop from two different angles to confuse the two units of soldiers protecting the settler outpost .
The few soldiers that greeted us pronounced the area to be a ‘ closed military zone ’ .
Given the amount of people we had they could do nothing to bar us from the area .
We arrived at the hilltop and began to build our protest tent .
As soon as the structure — a few flimsy plastic tubes with cloth draped over them – was built , the IDF immediately moved in and destroyed it using stun grenades to remove anyone that was in the area .
Their faces burned as red as that of the triangle on the Palestinian flag .
We built the structure again and the IDF destroyed it again , finally deciding to confiscate the polls from us .
Combatants for Peace then held a press conference for the various Arabic language reporters on the scene .
There were no American or Israeli media outlets present despite invitations by Combatants for Peace .
The Arab media is evidently more interested in covering the story of nonviolent resistance to the occupation by Israelis and Palestinians than the US or Israeli media .
During the press conference , an Israeli member of the Combatants for Peace made an interesting point about the role of the United States in this conflict .
He proclaimed to the crowd , “ We must remember that this conflict is between us and our Palestinian neighbors , and if we do not continue to remind the Israeli society and government of this , we will continue to wrongly believe that if we reach agreements with the Americans everything will be OK .
No !
The agreement must be made with the Palestinians and the construction of another illegal outpost damages our chances of reaching such an agreement . ”
The conference came to an end and we began to leave the hilltop .
As we were leaving , a settler from the outpost ran towards the group .
The soldiers guarding the settler outpost immediately went after him as he was clearly looking for confrontation .
As the soldiers approached him he pulled out a gun and pointed it directly at the soldiers .
After a brief but tense pause the soldiers were able to get the gun from him .
Had one of the nonviolent peaceful protestors attempted such an action they would have surly been attacked or shot .
But there are two sets of laws in Israel and the West Bank : one for the settlers and one for everyone else .
Imagine someone in the United States pulling out a gun and pointing it in the face of a police officer or soldier ?
What would happen to that person ?
In the Wild West Bank these types of things happen every day and the violent people that perpetrate these crimes hardly ever have to answer for them .
Mr Linford said he was considering taking legal action against his accuser A former soap actor who was cleared of groping a woman in a nightclub has said those accused of sexual offences should be allowed to remain anonymous .
It took a jury just seven minutes to declare Lewis Linford , 22 , not guilty of assaulting the woman in 2007 at a nightclub in Hull , East Yorkshire .
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live , he said the identity of the accused should be private until a verdict is passed .
Mr Linford played gamekeeper Lee Naylor in Emmerdale until June 2009 .
' Everyone shocked '
Between 1976 and 1988 those accused of sex offences were granted anonymity , however the law was repealed after arguments that sexual offences should not be distinguished from other types of crime .
Mr Linford was accused of groping a woman and asking her for sex as they queued for a cash machine in the Pozition nightclub in December 2007 .

He said the woman had invented the accusations , and that she had actually attacked him .
Mr Linford , of Swanland in Hull , told the Victoria Derbyshire show : " After she'd hit me the first time everyone around us was shocked .
" They were asking ' Why are you hitting him ? '
There was a bit of a scene and she said : ' He 's just touched me up ' . "
During the scuffle the woman punched Mr Linford several times and another woman poured a drink over his head , Hull Crown Court heard .
Mr Linford said he thought the woman had persisted with the case because she did not want to admit that she had assaulted him .
He said he was considering taking legal action against her .
" In certain cases I do n't think it is necessary for people to have their name branded in all the newspapers , " the actor said .
" I think sexual assault crimes tend to stick with a person more once everything 's over and you 're found not guilty . "
He said that judges should be allowed to use their discretion over whether to name the accused in sexual assault cases .

Air Force Vet Breaks Silence on What Hit Pentagon on 9 - 11 By James P. Tucker , Jr. A veteran Air Force mechanic called to help clean up the Sept. 11 , 2001 explosion at the Pentagon says the U.S. government ’s blaming a plane for the damage makes no sense .
The evidence was staged , he said .
He agreed to a face - to - face interview with AFP on condition he not be identified for obvious reasons : the Air Force would punish him severely ( the same military harshness that gagged survivors of the 1967 USS Liberty attack for many years ) .
The airman , a tech sergeant , is richly experienced in hazardous waste cleanup , having been deployed twice to Afghanistan in the first Persian Gulf war under President Bush the Elder and , later , under George the Younger .
He has 17 years of Air Force service .
The scene at the Pentagon “ does n’t look right , ” the airman said .
“ There was only a piece of engine and sections of landing gear on the ground .
It was like they were placed there .
Where were the wings ?
Tail section ?
We expected to find a lot of debris but there was very little . ”
There were “ two massive engines ”
He indicated agreement with numerous construction experts interviewed by AFP who say the planes that struck the Twin Towers in New York could not have caused them to collapse as they did and bombs had to have been set off from inside .
Another oddity he noted was the story of young Israeli citizens , in this country illegally , who had set up a tripod camera on the roof of the warehouse where they worked and trained their camera on the Twin Towers shortly before the attacks .
Witnesses told police the boys celebrated the attacks by joyfully jumping and slapping hands .
Police held the men overnight and they were returned to Israel the next day .
All this was reported in the mainstream media , but the story was immediately dropped .
How did these Israelis know where to be and when to film the Trade Center disaster .
His “ first instinct ” is still with him .
The airman told AMERICAN FREE PRESS : “ We attacked ourselves to set up the invasion of Iraq . ”
If true , this is the exact definition of treason , the penalty for which is death .
AFP correspondent James P. Tucker Jr. is a veteran journalist who spent many years as a member of the “ elite ” media in Washington .
Since 1975 he has won widespread recognition , here and abroad , for his pursuit of on - the - scene stories reporting the intrigues of global power blocs such as the Bilderberg Group .
Tucker is the author of Jim Tucker ’s Bilderberg Diary .

( Issue # 32 , August 10 , 2009 )
The United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit has just thrown out the Federal Communications Commission 's ( FCC ) rule limiting each cable provider to no more than 30 percent of the overall video marketplace .
In the words of the justices ( PDF ) , the rule was " arbitrary and capricious , " and the FCC 's " dereliction in this case is particularly egregious . "
This " 30 percent " rule goes back to 1992 , when Congress passed the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act .
The law directed the FCC to write rules that would " ensure that no cable operator or group of cable operators can unfairly impede ... the flow of video programming from the video programmer to the consumer . "
In other words , Congress wanted to keep any one cable company from getting so large that it could single - handedly cause a TV channel to fail by refusing to carry it .
So the FCC went to work , and in 1993 decided that cable operators should be capped at controlling no more than 30 percent of all subscribers .
The 30 percent limit stayed fixed over the years , even as the FCC changed the underlying formulas it used to make these calculations .
It looked like the agency had settled on the number and was n't going to change it based on anything so pedestrian as the facts .
( Such , at least , is the view of the Court of Appeals , which included a snarky aside incorporating both French and Latin : " Based on the present record , however , the Commission concluded that no cable operator could safely be allowed to serve — mirabile dictu—more than 30 % of all subscribers .
Plus ca change , plus c'est le meme chose ? "
Federal judges , if there is any way to stop writing like this , please do it . )
What really galled the cable industry was the growth of satellite , which eventually came to serve about one - third of all pay TV subscribers .
More recently , telcos like Verizon and AT&T have also gotten into the pay TV game — but the FCC has never included either when calculating the 30 percent thresholds .
The Court of Appeals actually ordered the FCC to take satellite into account some years ago ; the agency never did , leading to the court 's charge of " dereliction . "
Given the changing market realities and failure of the FCC to heed the court , Comcast and the NCTA ( cable 's trade group in Washington ) asked the court to toss the entire rule .
The court did so today , vacating the FCC 's 30 percent subscriber limit and leaving the new , Julius Genachowski-led FCC the decision about whether to pursue such ownership caps or let the issue fade away .
Free market groups praised the ruling , calling the court " a backstop of rationality " and warning that the FCC should n't let " any ' ideological blinders ' concerning mythical ' media concentration ' get in the way of the actual marketplace realities . "
Groups like Media Access Project , which supported the FCC , were predictably disappointed .
" I 'm disappointed , but not surprised , " said CEO Andrew Schwartzman .
" Although Congress directed the FCC to establish limits on cable ownership in 1992 , the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has been disinclined to approve such regulations .
It is hard to imagine that any rule the FCC could devise would ever withstand review under the standards established in today ’s decision . "
The high - profile visit of US Vice President Joe Biden to Georgia has drawn a harsh warning from Russia .
Moscow said it would not allow Georgia to re-arm , and accused Tbilisi of provocation ahead of the anniversary of last summer ’s brief war .
Russia considers Georgia part of its sphere of influence , but President Mikheil Saakashvili said those days have gone :
“ Our choice is irreversible .
We decided to join the free world , Europe and the North Atlantic Alliance .
This was supported by the Georgian people , overwhelmingly in a referendum , a free poll , and nothing is going to reverse it . ”
Biden reiterated Washington ’s support for Georgia :
“ We are confident about your future and you should be confident about our willingness to stand with you . ”
Tension remains high over the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , with Russia accusing un -named states of hiding arms supplies to Georgia in shipments of humanitarian aid .
And Abkhazia claimed to have found a cache of weapons hidden by Georgia in the disputed Kodori Gorge .
Local defence sources said the arms were placed there eight months ago , ready for any Georgian attempt to re-take the strategic area .

Kimani Nganga Maruge started school in 2004 , aged 84 Kenya 's oldest pupil , Kimani Nganga Maruge , has died in Nairobi aged 90 .
The great - grandfather held the Guinness World Record for being the oldest person to start primary school , at the age of 84 .
His house in the Rift Valley was burnt down in post-election violence last year and he was later moved from a camp to an old people 's home in the capital .
Despite the disruption , Mr Maruge kept hard at his studies and had two years left to finish his primary education .
Mr Maruge , a veteran of the Mau Mau independence movement , never had the opportunity to go to school when he was younger .
The father - of - five said he wanted to learn how to read the Bible for himself and he was also suspicious that he might not have been getting his full pension so he was also keen to study maths .
In 2004 he enrolled at Kapkenduywa primary school , in Eldoret , a year after the Kenyan government introduced free primary schooling .
With one of the best attendance records he was made a prefect in the school .
Two of his 30 grandchildren , who had been at the same school , said he had eventually wanted to complete a veterinary diploma .
' Courageous ' Mumbi Kamuri , head of Cheshire Homes in Kenya where Mr Maruge spent the last year of his life , told the BBC he was dedicated to his studies right to the end .
Even after he was diagnosed with cancer in February he asked for teachers to teach him at home , she said .
" He was a very courageous man , " she said .
" Even if you do n't see it through to the end , you will still have achieved something . "
In 2005 , he travelled to the United States where he called on world leaders attending a summit to make education for the poor a priority .
The BBC's Will Ross in Nairobi says he will be remembered by many people as an inspirational figure who brought new meaning to the phrase , " it 's never too late " .

Budget limitations are common with non-profit and charitable organizations .
As a result , organizations often compromise on the need for an effective and attractive website .
However , the websites shown here represent some of the most well - designed websites of non-profits .
These organizations prove that non-profits can have great websites , and we hope it serves as inspiration for your own work .
If you ’re looking to create your own non-profit website , we recommend Shopify .
Those organizations that put a priority on the website can have seen benefits like increased donations , better involvement from members and supporters , increased visibility and awareness for their cause , and improved promotion for organization events .
All of these things can make it worth the time , effort , and cost to create an effective and attractive website .
The non -profit website must deliver the exact common message from thousands of needy people to the one who is willing to offer some of their amounts .
The website must appear to be valid and that is only possible when the clear and detailed motto is provided along with background information and all the other necessary information .
Characteristics of Effective Non-Profit Websites
Before we get into the showcase of some of the best websites of non-profit and charity organizations , let ’s take a look at what makes an organization ’s website effective .
Clear Description of the Organization ’s Purpose
Each non-profit organization exists for a certain purpose .
Website visitors who are not familiar with the organization should be able to quickly get an idea of the purpose when visiting the site for the first time .
Ideally , the homepage alone will give visitors a basic idea of what the organization does , and then maybe a more detail description of the purpose is provided on a separate page .
Details of Those Who are Served by the Organization
In order to add a personal touch to the website , information should be shared about the people who are benefitting from the services provided by the organization .
In some cases , it may be cases where specific people are named or shown , and their stories are shared with the website visitors .
In other cases it may be more general information about the audience served , sometimes using numbers and statistics to show the organization ’s impact .
Photos can also be very powerful and moving , and help to show the impact of the organization .
Many effective non-profit websites include photos of the people who are being helped by the organization , which adds a personal touch and makes it easier for website visitors to feel a connection and an impact .
Information About How to Get Involved
Almost every non-profit organization is highly dependant on the involvement of people and groups .
This primarily includes volunteer work and financial donations .
Volunteer opportunities should be clearly listed so anyone who is interested is able to get involved .
When it comes to financial involvement , most organizations now make it possible for visitors to donate online .
Information should also be provided to inform potential donors how their financial gifts will be used .
Some organizations provide details of different projects and allow donors to choose how they get involved ( an example would be the many organizations that allow you to sponsor a specific child through that you select through their website ) .
For others , getting involved may mean receiving the benefits of the organization ’s services .
Details should be provided to explain who the organization helps , and if appropriate , contact information should be listed so people can apply for assistance .
History of the Organization
The story of the organization will also be important to some website visitors and potential donors .
Most effective non-profit websites will include some sort of bio or history of how the organization came about , and any relevant accomplishments or stories of growth .
Details on Upcoming Events
Most organizations use events for fundraising , awareness , encouraging involvement , as well as for service .
The organization ’s website should list relevant details about upcoming events so that people can get involved in events that interest them .
Quality Design
Of course , the best websites are also well designed .
Having a quality design includes the overall visual appeal and the user experience .
Regardless of the industry , quality design is essential in order to maximize the impact of the website .
Many of these websites contain slideshow of high - quality images and the homepage contains engaging content that motivates the visitor to navigate deeply into the site .
All the content contained on the site should be linked to each other and there should be a good amount of valid information available to support all the facts and stances .
Good designs come in a wide variety of forms , and in the showcase below you ’ll see plenty of examples .

Information about the camp and camp life can be easily found through the menu .
The site includes plenty of photos of people in the refugee camp .
Why it works :
For an art - based organization , it makes sense to showcase art with the full - screen slider on the homepage .
Links like “ What ’s Happening ” , “ About ” , and “ Projects ” make it easy to find out more about the organization and what it does .
Opportunities for visitors to get involved in several different ways are provided , including donating money , buying items from the shop , and subscribing to the newsletter .
Why it works :
The homepage includes a slideshow of photos of people being impacted by the work of the organization .
Volunteer opportunities can be found lower on the homepage .
Important information like the organization bio and donation opportunities can be found in the main navigation .
Why it works :
The homepage engages the visitor with the list of achievements and objectives for tackling the poverty in a smart way .

This website has also mentioned how the programs in the past have helped the poor societies .

The vision of the governing bodies has been explained in all of the different formats .
The website mentions the vision in small and few categories with a great deal of curiosity and donators can always keep a proper eye on how their money is being operated .

The design is similar to a corporate site displaying tons of data and records .
Live support is always available .
The stories and news section has inspiring and heart - breaking stories bringing new innovative ideas in our mind .
Everything is mentioned in full detail so that the donator does not get confused with little detail and can talk to the support directly .
Another great and similar way to display all kind of information and detail about the organization has been mentioned in the footer section .
The impressive records and statistics have been mentioned so as to bring in the number of people ready to donate their hard - earned money .
Conclusion :
People who are interested in donating their amount will study each and every aspect of the website so that their money offers some real value to the needy people or businesses will produce huge returns from their money .
Nearly all of these websites have been designed in a similar way .
Great customer support must be offered and the charity program must be marketed properly in order to ensure that many people participate to raise huge funds .

Posted 2009 - 06 - 26 , evaluated by the judges panel
The Vagrance debuted with some LoZ : TP action back in December '08 and now returns with a visit to the ever - fertile lands of Chrono Trigger and ' Corridor of Time ' .
Samuel writes :
" I 've always wanted to do a DnB remix of this song , and this is not my first attempt as there has been at least 4 other start - ups that totally sucked .
I really felt going a liquid / atmospheric route would be best simply because that means I do n't have to devote half my time to the bassline .
Plus it gives me an excuse to use the hotpants loop which is about as close to pixie dust a drum loop can get .
I could explain some of my choices made in the song , but I 've always been told that if I have to explain a part of the song for others to like it , then I did n't do my job . "
Interesting ; I for one feel like artists can and should be able to describe their works without it feeling like compensation for something missing , but I do also see the " show do n't tell " - ish point Mr. Day is making - like so many things , it 's really contextual .
Either way , explanation or no explanation , this here 's a damn fine bit of dnb ; while OCR sees a good deal of electronica , this feels like pretty " pure " dnb to me , which we actually do n't see too much off .
Gotta love the swirling stew of aliased intro arpeggios , filtered hat lead - in , and ridiculously deep sub -bass .
There 's also some pretty crazy spectral effects going on circa 1 ' 20 " - really slick , distant textures .
One thing you 'll notice is that the intro arpeggios actually get more emphasis throughout than the melody , which is a nice twist - the synths carrying the main theme are softer than most of the other elements , and sort of trace around the outlines of the theme without putting it in your face .
This allows the drums , bass , and pads to do their thing , evolving and mutating in style .
Also interesting and even thought - provoking is the two - part quote that rounds the piece out , regarding languages dying out and being lost with each generation .
I 've actually thought about this topic before , and while I think the placement here suggests it 's being articulated primarily to convey the loss , there 's also a gain : more people speaking the same languages .
Variety of language - while academically interesting and culturally rich - necessarily carries with it the implication that , at any given point in time on the planet , fewer people will be able to understand one another .
I think it 's important that all human knowledge be preserved , so from a pure archiving perspective , you do have to appreciate what 's being lost , but I also feel like the process of language consolidation / mutation itself is quite natural .
Of course , I say all that as an English - speaker , so take it with a grain of salt .
Still , in terms of dropping pseudo - academic lecture - style quote samples into electronica tracks , you could do a lot worse , so I 'm gonna have to give a thumbs - up on that front .
A lot of judges weighed in on this one , so I recommend reading the decision .
When it comes to electronica , I tend to lean towards Vinnie 's decisions as being closest to my own thoughts , and this was no exception , so here you go :
" Cool concept .
I 'm a fan of DnB remixes that take the original melody and mess with the underlying chords .
In this mix , one gets the sense of hearing the original song through a haze .
I agree with Larry that it 's a little repetitive , but it did n't bother me that much .
I hear enough changes in the drums - missing beats , extra snare hits , filtering , added shakers - to keep me interested .
I would n't have minded a little more " foreground " to command attention , but I appreciate the haze effect you 're going for , and there 's a lot of movement in the background . "
Pretty much ; awesome to see The Vagrance follow - up the promise of his initial cut with some more excellent music .
He 's tread into some very familiar , oft - mixed territory and come up with something fresh that I think even the most jaded CT listeners should appreciate .

From the moment people started using passwords , it did n’t take long to realize how many people picked the very same passwords over and over .
Even the way people misspell words is consistent .
In fact , people are so predictable that most hackers make use of lists of common passwords just like these .
To give you some insight into how predictable humans are , the following is a list of the 500 most common passwords .
If you see your password on this list , please change it immediately .
Keep in mind that every password listed here has been used by at least hundreds if not thousands of other people .
There are some interesting passwords on this list that show how people try to be clever , but even human cleverness is predictable .
For example , look at these passwords that I found interesting :
ncc1701
The ship number for the Starship Enterprise
thx1138 The name of George Lucas ’s first movie , a 1971 remake of an earlier student project
qazwsx Follows a simple pattern when typed on a typical keyboard
666666 Six sixes
7777777 Seven sevens
ou812 The title of a 1988 Van Halen album
8675309
The number mentioned in the 1982 Tommy Tutone song .
The song supposedly caused an epidemic of people dialing 867 - 5309 and asking for “ Jenny ”
“ … Approximately one out of every nine people uses at least one password on the list shown in Table 9.1 !
And one out of every 50 people uses one of the top 20 worst passwords .. ”
Lists the top 500 worst passwords of all time , not considering character case .
Do n’t blame me for the offensive words ; you were the ones who picked these , not me .

In case you are just joining us , here is some background on the story below .
I know the identity of the mole .
The ball is now in CRU ’s court .
Steve McIntyre reports below and throws down the gauntlet .
Met Office / CRU
Finds the Mole
by Steve McIntyre on July 28th , 2009
More news on the Met Office / CRU molehunt .
Late yesterday ( Eastern time ) , I learned that the Met Office / CRU had identified the mole .
They are now aware that there has in fact been a breach of security .
They have confirmed that I am in fact in possession of CRU temperature data , data so sensitive that , according to the UK Met Office , my being in possession of this data would , “ damage the trust that scientists have in those scientists who happen to be employed in the public sector ” , interfere with the “ effective conduct of international relations ” , “ hamper the ability to protect and promote United Kingdom interests through international relations ” and “ seriously affect the relationship between the United Kingdom and other Countries and Institutions . ”
Although they have confirmed the breach of security , neither the Met Office nor CRU have issued a statement warning the public of the newCRU_tar leak .
Nor , it seems , have they notified the various parties to the alleged confidentiality agreements that there has been a breach in those confidentiality agreements , so that the opposite parties can take appropriate counter - measures to cope with the breach of security by UK institutions .
Thus far , the only actions by either the Met Office or CRU appear to have been a concerted and prompt effort to cover up the breach of security by attempting to eradicate all traces of the mole ’s activities .
My guess is that they will not make the slightest effort to discipline the mole .
Nor have either the Met Office or CRU contacted me asking me not to further disseminate the sensitive data nor to destroy the data that I have in my possession .
By not doing so , they are surely opening themselves up to further charges of negligence for the following reasons .
Their stated position is that , as a “ non-academic ” , my possession of the data would be wrongful ( a position with which I do not agree , by the way ) .
Now that they are aware that I am in possession of the data ( and they are aware , do n’t kid yourselves ) , any prudent lawyer would advise them to immediately to notify me that I am not entitled to be in possession of the data and to ask / instruct me to destroy the data that I have in my possession and not to further disseminate the sensitive data .
You send out that sort of letter even if you think that the letter is going to fall on deaf ears .
Since I am always eager to help climate scientists with these conundrums , I ’ll help them out a little here .
If , prior to midnight Eastern time on Thursday , a senior executive of the Met Office or the University of East Anglia notifies me that I am in wrongful possession of the data and directly requests me to destroy my copies of the CRU station data in question and thereby do my part in the avoidance of newCRU_tar proliferation , I will do so .
I will , of course , continue my FOI requests since I do not believe , for a minute , that their excuses have any validity nor am I convinced that the alleged confidentiality agreements actually exist nor , if they exist , am I convinced that they prohibit the provision of the data to me .

Diddy had Lindsay Lohan thrown out of a party .
The rapper 's security removed the ' Mean Girls ' star from a private concert by Prince at exclusive Los Angeles club Butter last Friday ( 16.06.06 ) after she got into a blazing row with rival Paris Hilton .
An eyewitness told America 's New York Post newspaper : " She went back to her table , there were only six tables , and everyone was sharing .
Diddy and his people wanted to sit with her on her table but Lindsay refused and began mixing it up with him .
" His bodyguards came over and picked Lindsay up to get her out .
" However , another reveller had a different take on the fracas .
They explained : " She kidded with him , asking what he was doing at her table .
" He did n't realize she was joking and he then yelled at her and told her to get
out .
Diddy was really mean to her . "
When asked about what happened , a spokesman for Diddy 's camp said : " Lindsay was being so loud and obnoxious .
His security became
concerned and came over to escort her away . "
Lindsay and Paris have been at loggerheads ever since the ' Mean Girls ' actress was spotted getting intimate with the hotel heiress ' ex-boyfriend Stavros Niarchos .
