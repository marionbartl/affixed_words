The White House said Wednesday that the widely condemned interrogation technique known as waterboarding is legal and that President Bush could authorize the CIA to resume using the simulated - drowning method under extraordinary circumstances .
The surprise assertion from the Bush administration reopened a debate that many in Washington had considered closed .
Two laws passed by Congress in recent years -- as well as a Supreme Court ruling on the treatment of detainees -- were widely interpreted to have banned the CIA ’s use of the extreme interrogation method .
But in remarks that were greeted with disbelief by some members of Congress and human rights groups , White House spokesman Tony Fratto said that waterboarding was a legal technique that could be employed again “ under certain circumstances . ”
Fratto said the nation ’s top intelligence officials “ did n’t rule anything out ” during congressional testimony Tuesday on CIA interrogation methods , and he indicated that Bush might consider reauthorizing waterboarding or other harsh techniques in extreme cases , such as when there is “ belief that an attack might be imminent . ”
For years ,
White House officials denied that the U.S. had engaged in torture but always stopped short of confirming whether waterboarding had been used .
The administration ’s latest stance -- described by Fratto during the daily White House briefing -- was denounced Wednesday by key lawmakers .
“ This is a black mark on the United States , ” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
“ The White House is trying to give themselves as much of an open field here as possible .
It says to others that we are prepared to use the same kinds of tactics used by the most repressive regimes and the most heinous regimes . ”
The White House comments came one day after CIA Director Michael V. Hayden testified publicly for the first time that the agency had used waterboarding on Al Qaeda suspects in 2002 and 2003 .
He also identified three prisoners , including self - proclaimed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who he said were the only detainees subjected to the method .
Waterboarding refers to a practice that involves strapping down a prisoner , placing a cloth over his face and dousing him with water to simulate the sensation of drowning .
The technique has been traced to the Spanish Inquisition and has been the subject of war - crimes trials dating back a century .
The White House position on the issue is in some ways consistent with its long - standing efforts to expand executive power and resist attempts by Congress to rein in the president ’s authority .
Still , the decision to reignite the debate over waterboarding struck many in Washington as peculiar .
The White House had previously argued that any discussion of CIA interrogation methods would only aid the enemy .
Further , the CIA halted its use of waterboarding nearly five years ago .
Calling renewed attention to the issue risks drawing fresh criticism from other countries at a time when the United States is seeking to shore up its image abroad .
The issue also has been divisive politically for Republicans .
Sen. John McCain of Arizona , now the front - runner for the GOP presidential nomination , has led efforts to outlaw waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods previously employed by the CIA .
In a recent GOP presidential debate , McCain said it was inconceivable that “ anyone could believe that [ waterboarding is ] not torture .
It ’s in violation of the Geneva Convention .
It ’s in violation of existing law . ”
The leading Democratic contenders for the White House , Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois , have taken similar positions .
Largely because the presidential candidates are consistent on the issue , many experts consider it unlikely that the CIA would resume using the method , because agency operatives would fear prosecution under a future administration .
“ On Jan. 21 , 2009 , there ’s almost certainly going to be a new president who understands that waterboarding is not only wrong but a very serious crime , ” said Tom Malinowski , the Washington advocacy director of Human Rights Watch .
However , Atty .
Gen. Michael B. Mukasey , challenged by senators to rule on the legality of waterboarding , declined last month to say it was illegal , even though he said he would consider it torture if he were subjected to it .
Congress has passed two laws -- the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005 and the Military Commissions Act in 2006 -- that ban the use of harsh interrogation methods and require all U.S. agencies to comply with the Constitution and the Geneva Conventions in their treatment of detainees .
In addition , the Pentagon published a new Army field manual in 2006 that limits interrogation techniques and bans harsh methods , including waterboarding , hoods and mock executions .
And the Supreme Court in 2006 struck down the Bush administration ’s system for holding and prosecuting detainees , saying it failed to provide protections under the Geneva Conventions .
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , one of the Republican sponsors of the 2006 Military Commissions Act , said in a telephone interview Wednesday that at the time the bill was passed he was assured by the Bush administration that the law would specifically prohibit waterboarding .
But Fratto appeared to contradict that , saying that the Justice Department had reviewed waterboarding and “ made a determination that its use under specific circumstances and with safeguards was lawful . ”
The CIA is not currently authorized to use waterboarding , he said , adding that “ we ’re not going to be able to speculate on what might be the case in the future . ”
Fratto outlined a series of steps that would be required before waterboarding or other coercive methods would be approved .
He said that the CIA director would have to make a proposal to the attorney general , who would have to review the interrogation plan to determine whether it would be legal and effective .
“ At that point , the proposal would go to the president ; the president would listen to the determinations of his advisors and make a decision , ” Fratto said .
Fratto ’s comments echoed statements by Hayden as well as Director of National Intelligence J. Michael McConnell in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday .
In referring to special circumstances under which more aggressive methods might be authorized , administration officials may be making the case for a kind of sliding scale for detainee treatment .
Malinowski said the administration may be seeking to define a loophole in international laws banning prisoner treatment that would “ shock the conscience . ”
That standard , the administration might argue , could shift dramatically if there was reason to fear the country was in danger of imminent attack .
But even so , McCain and Graham recently signed a letter to Mukasey saying that it was “ beyond dispute that waterboarding ‘ shocks the conscience . ’ ” And other experts said it would be more difficult to make such interpretations of the Geneva Conventions and other standards .
Feinstein has sponsored a provision in a pending intelligence bill that would require the CIA to abide by the stricter interrogation rules in the Army field manual .
The measure has already passed the House and is expected to be considered by the Senate in the coming weeks .
Bush has threatened to veto the bill .
During Tuesday ’s testimony , Hayden said that depriving the CIA of enhanced techniques would place America in greater danger .
After the hearing , a senior U.S. intelligence official argued that waterboarding should not be considered torture because the U.S. military has subjected its own personnel to the method to prepare them for the possibility of being captured .
“ Tens of thousands of American Air Force and naval airmen were waterboarded as part of their survival training , ” said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ We do n’t maim as part of our training .
We do n’t mutilate .
We do n’t sodomize .
Those are things that are always bad .
. . .
Intellectually , there has got to be a difference between [ waterboarding ] and the others ; otherwise we would n’t have done it in training . ”

The Basic Idea
by Waylon Vaughn
The Bremermann limit ( named after the late H.J. Bremermann ) is approximately 1.356x10 bits per second per kilogram .
It is the physical limit , given a certain mass , upon the maximum processing speed of a self - contained computer of that mass .
Now , in English :
Say that you want to build a fantastically powerful computer from a limited amount of matter -- let 's say 10kg ( about 22 pounds ) .
To do this , you devise a highly efficient power source and invent a fiendishly clever computer architecture -- the details do n't matter much .
What matters is that you 've built something that can and does process bits , for the ability to process a bit of data is the heart of computing .
In order to process bits , you need to have a signal that can send bits in quick succession .
The amount of data sent in one second is the frequency of the signal , expressed in bits per second , or hertz ( abbreviated Hz ) .
The higher the frequency , the smaller the interval between each bit , the more data is transmitted per second , the faster your computer can calculate .
Now for the physics .
No matter what your signaling method is , each bit requires a certain amount of energy to be sent .
Since you want your machine to be small and efficient , you 'd like to use as little energy per bit as possible -- without sacrificing any computing power , that is .
Quantum mechanics says that everything comes in discrete packets ; there is a smallest amount that you can have of anything , be it energy , light or electrical charge .
These packets are called quanta ( singular is quantum ) , hence the name " quantum mechanics . "
Your signal , just like everything else in the universe , must be quantized .
Specifically , the size of the signal energy quantum is directly proportional to the frequency of the signal :
E = hf
" E " is the signal energy quantum , " f " is the frequency of your signal ( i.e. your bitrate ) , and " h " is Planck 's constant , a fundamental constant of the universe equal to approximately 6.6x10 - 34 joule - seconds .
This equation limits the minimum energy that you can use to send your signal .
Why ?
Because in order to send the signal at all , you must be using at least one quantum of signal energy to send each bit .
In other words , you must use at least one " chunk " of energy for each bit sent .
To rephrase it once more ( and turning it around in the process ) , given an amount of energy , the maximum rate at which you can process data with said energy is given by :
E/h = f
Given our 10kg to work with , there 's a maximum amount of energy that we can possibly use in our computer ( since we 're talking a WHOLE computer here , power source included ) , and we can find this energy using an equation you 've probably seen before :
E=mc2
So , we substitute this in for the E in the previous equation , and we get :
mc2/h=f
Since both c and h are constants , we can call c2/h a new constant , B , and the equation is now :
Bm = f
B is the Bremermann limit ( as you can see if you substitute in the values of c and h in the equation above and compare it to the number at the top of this page ) and we now know how fast a 10kg computer can go , in theory : 1.3x1051 Hz , or about a million billion billion billion billion GHz .
This is a big number .
Really big .
I mean , you might think it 's a long way to the chemist 's , but that 's just peanuts compared to this .
Despite this fact , there are still some computational tasks that are so complicated that the Bremermann limit makes it essentially impossible to perform them .
For example , if we turned all the matter in the universe into the best computer possible , it would take at least 100,000 times the current age of the universe to compute all possible games of chess that can be played .
I believe you will join me in saying " Holy fuck . "
For the motivated student : the original paper in which Bremermann first proved all of this is available here :
http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Bremermann-HJ/QNaI.html.
It 's also worth noting that if Moore 's Law continues to hold for much longer ( unlikely for various reasons ) , we will hit Bremermann 's limit in approximately 300 years .
Overview
Beluga allows specification of formal systems ( such as lambda calculi and type systems ) using a foundation of contextual modal logic .
As in the Twelf system , we can encode object - level binding constructs using higher order abstract syntax .
We also pair terms with the contexts that give them meaning and then reason about these contextual objects .
Proofs in Beluga are represented by recursive programs according to the Curry - Howard Isomorphism .
Beluga is developed at the Complogic group at McGill University , led by Professor Brigitte Pientka .
It is implemented in OCaml .
To learn more about Beluga we recommend the following tutorial style papers and talks .
If you have trouble discerning Beluga code from older releases , consult the legacy syntax for clarification .

Overview Talks :
Students at Corinthian Colleges and other for - profit learning institutions are getting a painful lesson in credit - crunch economics :
Some lenders , including giant Sallie Mae , are turning off the money faucets for less credit - worthy applicants .
That means students at these commercial schools who use high - rate private loans to bridge gaps in their tuition costs or who fail to qualify for conventional loans and grants may have a harder time financing their educations .
It ’s the latest blow for Santa Ana - based Corinthian Colleges Inc. , which has nearly 68,000 students at 93 career training schools in 24 states and is one of the nation ’s largest for - profit providers of post - secondary education .
Corinthian ’s problems are echoing through the commercial education industry , which has seen company values plummet in the last few months as investors fret that a lending squeeze could reduce enrollment .
Corinthian said Monday that Sallie Mae , the nickname for SLM Corp. , would stop lending to current students who are considered high credit risks .
The loans are a kind of funding of last resort for students , with interest rates as high as 19 % .

Corinthian students who relied on private loans reacted with dismay even though their current loans would n’t be affected .
“ I would n’t be able to come to this school without my loan .
I do n’t think this is a good idea , ” said Valerie Barragan , 20 , as she left the West Los Angeles campus of Everest College , one of 12 Southern California schools owned by Corinthian .
Barragan , a single mother with a 10 - month - old child , is studying to become a medical assistant .
Corinthian said last month that Sallie Mae and two other lenders , College Loan Corp. and Student Loan Express , would n’t make new private loans .
Corinthian had assumed then that Sallie Mae would continue to offer loans to current students through the end of their educations .
Sallie
Mae also cut off such loans to two other big for - profit education chains .
They were Carmel , Ind. - based ITT Education Services Inc. , which has 49,000 students in 93 schools in 34 states , and Career Education Corp. of Hoffman Estates , Ill. , which has 90,000 students at 75 campuses in the U.S. , Canada and Europe .

The change could be a particular problem for Corinthian because about 75 % of the private loans to its students were of the sub - prime variety in fiscal 2007 .
Corinthian schools offer various programs in health , criminal justice , business , vehicle repair and maintenance , construction trades and information technology .
“ There has been a squeeze on student loan lending , especially from these non-bank lenders , ” said Mark Kantrowitz , president of MK Consulting Inc. , publisher of the student aid information websites FinAid and EduPASS .
“ Corinthian has a disproportionate amount of low - income borrowers , which have a greater tendency to default . ”
Investors brushed off the news , sending Corinthian ’s shares up 40 cents over the last two days to $ 8.19 .
Analysts said shareholders were encouraged by the company ’s assurance that Sallie Mae ’s decision would n’t hurt earnings .
“ We are confident we can arrange financing for the vast majority of incoming students , ” Corinthian spokeswoman Anna Marie Dunlap said in a statement Tuesday .
The company declined requests for further comment .

Some Wall Street analysts agreed that the credit squeeze was surmountable because other factors were helping Corinthian and other commercial educators .
“ If the job market is good , these people can work .
If it is n’t , they need to go back to school and get the skills necessary , ” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeffrey M. Silber .
“ This should be a great time for this company in this period of economic uncertainty . ”
Financial analysts said that some companies would be hit harder than others .
The University of Phoenix , Strayer College and Capella University were expected to weather the change well because “ they have very few sub - prime students .
Their students are typically working adults .
They have less exposure , ” said Amy Junker of Robert C. Baird & Co .
On Tuesday , DeVry Inc. said it had selected six financial services companies to make loans to its students and that it had n’t seen a “ material impact ” on enrollment .
Advertisement
“ We are confident that these lenders not only provide superior products and services for our students , but also have the capacity to withstand the current credit and liquidity issues that are affecting some student - loan providers , ” DeVry Chief Executive Daniel Hamburger said in a statement .
Lynne Baker , spokeswoman for Career Education Corp. , said that the company was sticking with a plan outlined Thursday , when Chief Financial Officer Mike Graham said it intended to finance some student loans on its own .
Student aid expert Kantrowitz said that no student should accept a private loan without first exhausting every other option for federal aid or grants .
He described private loan rates as “ better than credit card debt , but not by much . ”
Advertisement
Other experts expressed similar concerns .
“ These are low - income students , without a parent or other co-signor , borrowing more than they can borrow within the federal student - loan program , ” said Robert Shireman , director of the Project on Student Debt .
“ To ask a student to take a high - interest - rate loan , on top of federal loans , for an unknown possibility of a degree and a job is too much risk , ” he said .
“ Students should consider both other financing options as well as other schools . ”
These loans are often compared to credit card debt , with the additional unattractive feature of accumulating compound interest while the student is enrolled in school .
The result :
After a few years , the student ’s debt can double .
Advertisement
Student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy , so this debt can haunt a former student for life .
Some lenders do n’t want to finance some students at certain for - profit schools , Shireman said , because their graduation rates are poor and the graduates often have trouble getting work .
That makes repayment prospects bleak .
Default rates at for - profit schools run about double the national average , according to the Department of Education .
In 2005 -- the most recent year for which statistics are available -- the average default rate for commercial school students was 8.2 % compared to 4.6 % for students overall .
Community colleges offer classes that lead to the same degrees and job prospects as proprietary schools , Shireman said .
But , community colleges cost a fraction as much .
Advertisement
Pasadena City College , for example , charges $ 628 annually in tuition and fees to in - state residents , according to the College Board , a service that tracks higher education costs nationwide .
That gets students a wide range of education options , including two - year degrees in nursing and dental hygiene , among others , and general education requirements to transfer to four - year universities .
Those wanting a medical assistant ’s degree from Everest ’s campus in Colorado Springs , Colo. , would pay $ 11,045 for eight months of study , a telephone representative said .
Barragan , the student at Everest in West L.A. , took on an $ 8,000 loan at 8 % interest for an eight - week medical assistant course .
At a bus stop Tuesday morning , she waited with three friends , each with a similar loan .
The students said they knew that their loans were more costly than conventional financing , which they could n’t get .
They said they knew that repayment would be difficult on the $ 9 an hour or so they expected to earn if they got jobs .
Advertisement
But the loans meant opportunity .
Barragan ’s friends -- Daisy Garcia , 18 , of Lennox ; Anna Sandoval , 19 , of Venice ; and Stephanie Chavez , 19 , of Culver City -- said they were getting 75 % to 90 % of what they needed to get and keep a job .
“ If I did n’t have this , ” Barragan said , “ I ’d just be sitting at home right now . ”

British - Iraqi survey confirms one million deaths as a result of US invasion
By David Walsh
1 February 2008
Even as the Bush administration , virtually unchallenged by the Democrats or any significant voices in the media , claims ‘ success ’ in Iraq and makes clear its intention to establish permanent bases there , further polling data has emerged that underscores the dimension of the US war crimes in that country .
The British polling agency ORB ( Opinion Research Business ) issued survey results January 28 that confirm its earlier estimate that more than one million Iraqi civilians have died as a result of the American - led invasion and occupation .
The British agency carried out the work in association with its Iraqi research partner , the Independent Institute for Administration and Civil Society Studies ( IIACSS ) .
In September 2007 ORB made public its finding that an estimated 1.2 million violent deaths had taken place in Iraq since March 2003 .
The agency commented at the time that US - occupied Iraq had “ a murder rate that now exceeds the Rwanda genocide from 1994 ( 800,000 murdered ) , ” with another one million wounded and millions more driven from their homes into exile , either internal or foreign .
The American media , true to form , essentially took no notice of the report , despite ORB ’s indisputable pedigree — the firm has conducted polls for Britain ’s Conservative Party and the BBC .
The Democratic Party presidential candidates also ignored it .
Neither the White House nor the Pentagon felt obliged to comment on the research .
The ORB findings vindicated the study published in the Lancet , the British medical journal , in October 2006 , which put the Iraqi death toll then at approximately 655,000 .
As a co-author of the Lancet study , Les Roberts , wrote in an email to MediaLens in response to the ORB survey ’s publication in September , “ The poll is 14 months later with deaths escalating over time .
That alone accounts for most of the difference [ between the October 2006 Lancet paper and the ORB poll ] . ”
Roberts noted that the Lancet and ORB studies “ seem very much to align . ”
In its January 28 press release , ORB commented that “ further survey work ” had confirmed its earlier estimate of more than 1 million Iraqi deaths “ as a result of the conflict which started in 2003 . ”
The agency referred to presumably critical or skeptical “ responses ” to its earlier work , which was based on surveys undertaken primarily in urban settings , and explained , “ We have conducted almost 600 additional interviews in rural communities .
By and large the results are in line with the ‘ urban results ’ and we now estimate that the death toll between March 2003 and August 2007 is likely to have been of the order of 1,033,000 .
If one takes into account the margin of error associated with survey data of this nature then the estimated range is between 946,000 and 1,120,000 . ”
The results were culled from face - to - face interviews with a representative sample of 2,414 Iraqi adults aged 18 and over ( with a margin of error of plus or minus 1.7 percent ) .
Those surveyed were asked : “ How many members of your household , if any , have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 ( i.e. , as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age ) ?
Please note that I mean those who were actually living under your roof ? ”
Among those answering the question , some 20.2 percent reported at least one death in their household as a result of the US invasion and occupation .
Within those households , the average number of deaths was 1.26 people .
The last complete Iraq census in 1997 reported a total of 4,050,597 households .
The polling firm thus came up with the figure of approximately one million deaths since March 2003 .
The ORB - IIACSS team found that more than 40 percent of Baghdad households had lost a family member , higher than in any other area of Iraq .
Among those willing to declare their doctrine ( about 50 percent of the respondents preferred to describe themselves simply as Muslims ) , Sunni households were more likely to have known a victim or victims of the conflict ( 33 percent ) ; the corresponding figure among Shias was 16 percent .
The polling firm conducted 1,824 interviews in urban areas and some 590 “ around rural sampling points .
The survey methodology utilized multi-stage random probability sampling and covers fifteen of Iraq ’s eighteen governorates .
Overall 112 unique sampling points were covered — 92 in urban areas and 20 in rural locations . ”
For security reasons interviews were not conducted in Karbala and Al Anbar provinces , and in Irbil the local Kurdish authorities prevented the research team from conducting its work .
The head of IIACSS , Munqith Daghir , told Research magazine that Kurdish security forces asked “ to accompany our interviewers to the houses , just to be confident that we were not harming or harassing people .
Of course , this was just an excuse .
I knew they wanted to know what we were doing and they wanted to watch people , to discover how they talked to us . ”
The updated survey found that 40 percent of the violent deaths were attributable to gunshot wounds , 21 percent to car bombs , 8 percent to aerial bombardment , 4 percent to sectarian violence and 4 percent to accidents .
The figure for deaths from aerial bombardment , some 80,000 or more , must refer to fatalities resulting from US or British operations , since only their forces are equipped with airplanes and helicopters .
As was the case in September , the American media has chosen to ignore the ORB findings .
The web sites of the New York Times , Washington Post , Boston Globe and ABC News ran a brief Reuters news story about the ORB findings .
The Los Angeles Times , Chicago Tribune , Detroit Free Press , Wall Street Journal , CNN and CBS News have had no reference to the survey .
Neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton has commented on the death toll .
On his web site , Obama makes mention of displaced Iraqis , but has no reference whatsoever to civilian deaths .
In a speech Thursday in Las Vegas , George W. Bush unequivocally defended the invasion of Iraq and brushed aside public opposition to his policies .
Bush asserted , “ The decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision .
The world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power .
And so are the Iraqi people .
There has been some interesting progress in Iraq .
They wrote a constitution .
They voted .
Imagine a society going from a brutal tyrant to being able to vote in a short period of time . ”
The president boasted that his decision to launch last year ’s ‘ surge ’ in Iraq was “ based on the considered judgment of military people ” and not “ upon any Gallup poll or focus group .
It was based upon what was right for the future of the United States , and that is , as opposed to pulling troops out , send more in . ”
Bush explained that he intended to go on flouting the popular will : “ You know , a lot of folks say , well , what ’s next , Mr. President ?
And my answer is , we have come too far in this important theater in this war on terror not to make sure that we succeed .
And therefore any further troop reductions will be based upon commanders and conditions .
Iraq is important for our security .
I will be making decisions based upon success in Iraq .
The temptation , of course , is for people to say , well , make sure you do the politically right thing .
That ’s not my nature .
That ’s not exactly what we ’re going to do . ”
The Iraqi people , and thousands of Americans , will continue to suffer death and devastation until the international working class intervenes and puts an end to the neo-colonial occupation of Iraq .

A New York appellate court ruled Friday that valid out - of - state marriages of same - sex couples must be legally recognized in New York , just as the law recognizes those of heterosexual couples solemnized elsewhere .
Lawyers for both sides said the ruling applied to all public and private employers in the state .
Even though gay couples may not legally marry in New York , the appellate court in Rochester held that a gay couple ’s 2004 marriage in Canada must be respected under the state ’s longstanding “ marriage recognition rule , ” and that an employer ’s denial of health benefits had discriminated against the couple on the basis of their sexual orientation .
“ The Legislature may decide to prohibit the recognition of same - sex marriages solemnized abroad , ” a five - judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court ruled unanimously in rejecting a 2006 lower court decision .
“ Until it does so , however , such marriages are entitled to recognition in New York . ”
For more than a century , the court noted , New York State has recognized valid out - of - state marriages .
Moreover , it said that the Court of Appeals , the state ’s highest judicial body , has said the Legislature may enact laws recognizing same - sex marriages .
“ In our view , the Court of Appeals thereby indicated that the recognition of plaintiff ’s marriage is not against the public policy of New York , ” the court held .

The summer before I started my second year at NYU , I learned about 50 cover songs on my Fender Squire guitar .
Some of the songs were alterna - hits circa 1993 by bands like the Lemonheads and Too Much Joy .
There were some other songs that were not as cool , but I thought they would make good covers , like Pictures of Matchstick Men and Hetero - Sexual Man .
My idea was to start this kick ass cover band and play a whole lot of NYU parties and meet a lot of girls and have a lot of fun and be popular .
That fall , I hooked up with a guy named Chris Moses ( who sort of looked like Damone from Fast Times at Ridgemont High .
We threw together a 12 song set , which was mostly us rearranging the same three chords twelve different ways .
We had a lot of spunk , and always tried our hardest to entertain .
This usually involved things going up our nose or food being thrown at the audience .
Chris 's friend from Rhode Island , Tim McCarthy , played drums with us .
We rocked out ( to the best of our rocking our ability at that particular time ) at NYU sponsored shows and local clubs that would book every crappy Pearl Jam rip - off and Long Island hardcore band and put 'em right along side Dirt Bike Annie ( a Green Day rip off band ) .
Thanks to all of the NYU students who would go to these crappy shows and support us , we stayed together a lot longer than we should have .
In the Spring of 1995 , there was yelling and screaming and a drummer 's fist through some broken glass and the end of Dirt Bike Annie .
There were a few futile attempts to keep the torch lit , but neither the Moses party , nor the Rabuck seemed motivated .
About six months later , I found myself at a dorm party thrown by a chaturbate girl named Kat ( of MTV's The Real World fame ) , and that 's where I ran into a friend of mine named Dan Paquin .
Dan was currently in a band called The Sellabits ( who later went on to become The Chefs of the Future ) .
I had seen The Sellabits play at a NYU coffee house and I remember liking them a lot , mainly because Dan knocked over the entire drum kit by the end of their 15 minute set .
Ever since I had met Dan ( Fall 1994 ) , he had always liked to " jam . "
Personally , I hate " jamming "
It feels like a waste of time to me .
Regardless , at this party , he convinces me to go back downstairs to my room to " jam . "
I had taken a few hits of acid at the party , so I was pretty much down for whatever .
Dan played the drums and my roommate , Mike , played bass .
We started off with Sinead O'Connor quiet but eventually blow - out - my - speakers ear popping riffs accompanied with some inner cave man primal screaming .
At the time , it sounded pretty cool .
Dan must have enjoyed the experience because quicker than you can say , That ai n't no lie , " Dirt Bike Annie was playing its first show in forever with Dan on the bass and my other roommate , Dennis , on the drums .
Shortly thereafter , we cranked out our first 7 " EP on my eight track reel - to - reel .
It all happened in one room , my friends , one room .
Maybe a year went by , maybe it was six months , but either way , we had dented the New York Pop Punk scene and had hooked up with Egghead , Furious George and The Sea Monkeys .
Dennis left the band to study astrophysics out on Long Island .
In the down time , I tooled around with some old recordings I had done with Dennis at Jeanie Lee 's apartment , located at 88 Christopher Street .
Jeanie is a friend of mine from high school who attended NYU with me .
At the time , her band , Severna Park , had moved off to Seattle after our senior year of college , so she was constantly bugging me to join up with Dirt Bike Annie , and like a dumb ass , I was always like , " No , no , no " .
Little did I know , that Jeanie would be the best thing to ever happen to DBA .
Finally , one summer afternoon in 1997 , I was like , " Look , you can sing back - up vocals on these recordings " and when Dan and I heard how cool it sounded , we looked at each other , and , well , let 's just say , Jeanie has been in the band ever since .
Thanks to a desperate flyer we put up in Chime 's Video Store , we hooked up with an excellent drummer named Heth Weinstein , whom I absent mindedly renamed " Dirt Bike Deano . "
Mental note : do n't change people 's names with out consulting them first .
At this point , the Dirt Bike Annie lineup was stable , and remained this way for quite a while .
We recorded another EP ( this time for Mutant Pop ) and even went on a week long Tour .
In the year to come , we recorded a third EP ( Break Up Records ) and then our first full - length compact disc ( Mutant Pop ) .
In the summer of 1999 , we had a kick ass two - week tour and got to play with lots of awesome bands and made lots of great friends .
Unfortunately , later that summer , Dirt Bike Annie said " Good - bye " to Heth because they were not connecting with him on a personal level
During the last show of the summer 1999 Tour , in Burlington , New Jersey , a familiar pop punker came out to the show .
His name was Mike Yannich .
Mike 's a nineteen - year - old with his own record label and a lot of spunk .
Loyal till the last drop ,
Mike would always be in the front when DBA played .
I noticed that he would sing along to every word ( even the back up vocals ) , and every beat as was evident in his perfectly in synch hand pumping .
Before the Burlington show , I was buying beer for Mike 's friend ( because he forgot his ID ) and he told me that Mike was actually a really good drummer and would be really into playing for Dirt Bike Annie .
Stuck with a transition drummer that was a little too funky , DBA opted for the young upstart , and the line up 's more solid than a shit on acid .
After one week of rehearsals , we played our first show with Darlington , The Huntingtons , and The Heartdrops , and it was , to be frank , our best show ever .
Mike is the culmination of everything we needed in order to be and remain in the pocket : he does n't pussyfoot around when he comes to hittin ' the skins , he knows and loves the underground pop punk scene , and he's got enough vim and vinegar to tour and play sets repeatedly , just keep the Pepsi coming .
Dirt Bike Annie looks forward to a tour at the end of this summer , a new full length CD , two EP's , a couple comps , a few split 7 inches and a new used set of wheels from my parents .
In between gigs and releases , DBA throws intimate get - togethers at mission control : the Souse House in Jersey City , New Jersey .
There 's been three parties thrown so far featuring such pop punk favorites as The Shy Guys , Bitch and the Moans , Attention Deficit , The Grand Prixx , Wormbath , Grady , The Break Ups , The Lee Majors , The Lynnwoods , International Waters , The Ergs , The Proteens , and The Bravo Project .
Look to early May , for Mr. Paquin 's Wink - wink nudge - nudge surprise party .
To conclude , Dirt Bike Annie has taken on many incarnations , seen many different places , met many different people and fired many drummers .
Regardless of where our future takes us our present tense is getting better by the minute thanks to die - hard fans and loyal friends .
What we 've accomplished so far is just the prologue to big ass book , and it only gets us psyched up to see more places , meet more people and make more rock .
Keep coming to shows and we 'll keep hitting 'em .

4/9/01 - Kutztown , PA was a lot of fun on Thursday .
Thanks to Elfquest for the use of their drumkit and for putting up members of the Ergs and DBA for the night .
Thanks to Lew for setting up the show and Josh Rutledge for coming on down .
It was a cool place though we could n't crank it too loud because there 's an antique shop right above the venue and he does n't want his china to break .
Adam and Mike went with the Ergs who played a show Friday in Warren .
So , Jeanie and I drove the car back to JC .
Saturday we headed out to Pittsburgh for a birthday show for our friend Becca .
The show started at 2 .
We got there around 6 .
The place had to close at 9 .
By 8:30 pm there were 3 bands that still had to play including the Proms and Dirt Bike Annie .
Fortunately , we 'd played the area before and we knew we could move it either to Becca's
or to our friend Ryan Droppa 's house .
We decided to move it to Ryan 's since we 'd played there many times before .
We caravanned with about 20 cars following Ryan to his place .
About 40 minutes later everyone
arrived safe and sound .
Dirt Bike
Annie set up and went first , since Mike needed to go back to NJ that night with the Ergs .
I 'm glad the show got moved to Ryan's !
His basement was packed with about 50 people and the PA sounded much better in the smaller space .
Everyone rocked out and sang along .
Then the Proms played .
They sounded totally rocking .
They 're new album just came out on Imperfekt records .
Check out their site at www.imperfekt.com.
The record is great .
Then NY locals the Tattle Tales finished the set they 'd started at the Legion hall .
Finally , The Teen Sensation Glasses did an encore performance with me on insisting on playing drums for Sweet Pea and My Girl Left Me for a Chick .
The show even ended early for a
show , around 1 am .
Everyone hung out , the Proms , Ruth 's Hat , The ShyGuys , The Tattle Tales ... it felt like a family reunion .
Around 4:30 in the morning , I get the urge to get a pack of smokes .
So , Cha
Derkins volunteers to drive me and Ryan to the gas station about a mile away .
As we get into the car , Chad says " I do n't know what 's wrong with this gas gauge .
One minute it says full , and the next it's on empty ! "
Well , I guess the gauge was broken because the car fully ran out of gas less then a quarter mile from the gas station .
Ryan and I jumped out to push .
Some guys in a white pickup stopped and helped us push it too .
Chad bought me a pack of cigarettes for helping him out .
Thanks Chad !
It was a great time in Pittsburgh .
It was amazing seeing everyone pull together just to make the rock happen .
Special thanks to Ryan and Mr. Droppa for being saints and letting the rock happen at the last minute at their house !
4/4/01 - Holy cow we had an AMAZING SHOW last night at Brownies !
DBA sent out the call and so many wonderful people showed up , even people who had seen us do the same set at the Charleston in Williamsburg on Friday , March 30 .
Anyhow , we did very well .
The guy at the door said " management is very happy " and that 's all we wanted ( aside from just having a kick ass show ) .
This should mean more good shows at Brownies which I 'm psyched for !
The other bands were great .
The Sweet Sweet Bulbs were killer and brought out MOST of the crowd .
According to the door guy , 74 people .
Not bad for their 3rd gig as a band !
The Tarts were really cool too and had the indie - cool thing down pat .
I liked that right handed Gibson melody - maker being played lefty .
DBA had a great show .
What else can I say ?
The sound was great , the crowd was pumped , it was a TUESDAY night ...?
Not bad for a first show at a pretty big club .
We even had a delayed reaction
encore which was cool .
What was even cooler was that Jeanie insisted on doing " Loco Burrito " for said encore !
The Stryder kicked ass after us .
What 's weird is that one of their members had a band in hig
school that used to cover " Thanks for the Donuts . "
Scotty is a kick ass drummer .
There was a guy making a documentary about african - americans in punk bands .
Scotty was being interviewed .
At seperate points in the evening Jeanie and I both got to put in our two cents on the topic of minorities in rock n roll .
I think Jeanie might be more of an authority being Korean and female , but hey , I never decline the opportunity to give an opinion .
We have about 6 more shows in April then the tour in late May with the Hissyfits .
BOO YAH !
3/26/01 -
We had two really great rock shows over the weekend .
Friday we played at the Charleston in Williamsburg .
Due to an oversight on my part , a group of underage girls from Hastings - on - Hudson were turned away from the show .
Thank god for the pizza nook adjacent to the club .
At least they could hear the show , even if they could n't rock up at the front .
They presented the band with a very funny music video they made of " Chapped & Cracked . "
The Proms van broke down on the way to our house last night so they were late .
Before they arrived , 3 or the 4 Shyguys were kind enough to take the stage and sing a few .
The Proms , a little sleepy and confused from the NYC subway system , proceeded to rock the joint vigorously .
Then DBA played .
We liked the Charleston .
It seemed to me what playing the Souse House would be like if the basement had higher ceilings .
It just felt like a relaxed place to rock .
The Hissyfits were really on .
They even brought me up for guest vocals on " In my Dreams " and a cover of " Just What I Needed " by the cars .
We 're getting really excited about the tour with them coming up in May !
We have to thank Thunderbolt for not only rocking the box , but for also setting up the show with the Hissyfits and by proxy the Proms and DBA .
Saturday , MC Chris moved from the Souse House to Atlanta , GA .
Thanks to the Proms for helping him move !
He is pursuing a job working on a forthcoming Cartoon Network show called " Sealab . "
He should be releasing a Short - Run cd on Mutant Pop sometime soon .
He will be missed .
Sunday , we played Meow Mix with our gal - pals Dirty Mary .
They rocked .
ROCKED I say !
I was a little sleepy before we hit the stage but with the opening chords of " R U Ready 2 Dance " I got the energy up .
A bit into the set , Adam , Jeanie and I all got distracted by the oscars .
Julia Roberts won for best actress as I ended " Grape Crush . "
She deserved it .
Our next show on Tuesday , April 3 at Brownies is 16 +.
Dig it !
3/19/01 -
Thanks to our friends the Hissyfits , we now have a booking agent !
She 's booking a tour for us and the Hissyfits from May 24 - June 1 .
It 's going to be a tour of the South and we 're really excited .
The Hissyfits will go for another week and a half and are hitting the west coast .
At least now if we wanted to hit the west coast , we have someone who can book us for it .
New York shows will still be booked by the band .
We played a very fun show last Sunday at Meow Mix .
Unfortunately , our set got cut short and I had problems with the speaker input on my bass rig .
It was still fun though .
We 're looking forward to playing there again this Sunday with Dirty Mary .
We 're also looking forward to rocking the Charleston for the first time this coming Friday with the Proms ( our buddies from Columbus , OH ) the Hissyfits and Thunderbolt .
3/7/01 - We have many 7 inch projects in the works .
Enoch has the cdr and most of the artwork for a 7 " on his Knock Knock Records label .
It 's tentatively titled " The Shogun Warrior EP . "
Either that or " Night of the Living Rock & Roll Creation . "
It 's got Shogun Warrior , Happy Happy Birthday , Go Go Go , & Night of the Living Rock & Roll Creation .
We expect it to be in our hands in late April / early May , depending on when the rest of the artwork gets in .
Another 7 " is going to be released on Breakup Records , possibly around the same time .
We 're not sure of the title just yet , possibly either " Cecilia First " or " Superscope . "
The song list is : Roomates , Cecilia First , Simple with Attitude & Argument .
it 's a hot release .
We recorded basic tracks yesterday for YET ANOTHER 7 " project yesterday .
It looks like it 's going to be a double split 7 " with The Kung Fu Monkeys .
To be released on Whoah Oh records , the record is going to be called " The Wedding EP . "
It will have each band doing something old ( a new version of an old song ) , something new ( a new song ) , something borrowed ( a cover from the other band 's repetoire ) , and something blue will be the 7 " itself .
It will hopefully coincide with the marriage of 2 friends who are very close to both DBA & KFM .
We have a TON of shows coming up in March & April .
Very especially important is the show Tuesday , April 3rd , at Brownies in Manhattan .
At any rate , You should all be getting updates now via email .
If you are not , please sign the mailing list either at our shows or online !
2/7/01 - DBA went to Sellersville , PA about 2 hours from our house to play a show .
Our car broke down 1.2 miles from the VFW hall we were supposed to play at .
We walked there in the freezing cold .
Thank god our friends from Wormbath were there .
We played the show using their equipment , and then we stayed at their house about 40 minutes away .
Wormbath played a really fun set and the kids loved 'em .
We played a very cold set and a lot of people left .
The shitstank6000 , the dba vehicle was ( is ) very screwed up .
Jeanie and Mike went back to the city with Myke Kershner from Wormbath on Sunday .
Adam and I stayed with Pat and dealt with the shitstank .
It was n't pretty .
First we needed a new radiator .
That took 2 days and a snow storm .
Now it looks like we need a new gasket .
Whatever that is .
Myke Kershner 's parents drove Adam & I + the equipment back to Jersey City .
They are saints .
So , the Shitstank 6000 is still in PA .
It 's been an exciting 4 days .
1/31/01 - We had a really great show on Friday night ( 1/26 ) at Luna Lounge .
We got to the club and there was a sign on the door that said " Private Party . "
At first we were freaking out and wondering who had screwed up .
Then we walked in and found out that it was only going to 8:30 .
There was some food out and the hosts told us to help ourselves .
We did .
Mmmm , that roast beef was delicious !
Maybe stuff that 's free just seems better .
The show was rockin ' !
The room looked pretty packed from onstage .
Then Cherubino brought on their rock .
I think they were pretty pumped from our shoutout to them during " Go Go Go . "
They rocked .
We 're releasing something in the next month or so with our pal Mark Enoch on Knock - knock records .
Four songs : Night of the Living Rock n Roll Creation , Happy Birthday Enoch , Roomates & Go Go Go. I 'll keep ya posted right here ...
The material for the She 's Gone Release ( tentatively titled either " The Shogun Warrior EP " or " Cecilia First " ) is so close to being done it's KILLING ME !!!
1/18/00 - It 's been a busy week .
On Thursday , Jan. 11 , we played to a small but enthusiastic group of friends and fans at Maxwell 's with our good buddies The Proteens and our new friends from Miami , The Crumbs .
Everyone came back to our house afterwards and we partied our butts off .
The bands stayed at the Souse House until Sunday .
On Saturday , Jan. 13 , we played a show set up by our good buddy , and band in - law , Joey Erg in Oldbridge , NJ .
It was fun being on a bill with all those sloppy core and hard core bands .
Johnny Hotdog and the Condiments were unparalleled in slop , raucousness and humour .
Stick Figure Suicide were tight as hell .
I played tambourine with Mohawk Barbie , who were the first band I 've seen that had a Theremin player .
Yidcore were from Australia .
Sunday , Jan. 14 the Crumbs and the Proteens managed to get us a last minute gig at the Middle East , a rock club in Boston .
I 'd been wanting to play there for a long time as I have many fond memories of playing there with my ska band in High School .
The show ruled .
Jeanie and I both had some family in the crowd , and Jay and Adam from the Grand Prixx were there .
The kids were great .
The headliner , Drexel , were really tight and good .
I can't wait to play with those guys again .
We drove back home from Boston that night and got home at 5:30 am .
We 're still working on that material for the She 's Gone Records ep .
We 're VERY CLOSE .
We laid down some vocals this evening for a song going on a Sucker Punch Records comp with the Teen Idols , the Gammits the Plus Ones and some other pretty big bands in the pop-punk scene .
11/28/00 - The show at Luna Lounge on 11/21/00 kicked butt .
Thanks to everyone who came .
Dirt Bike Mike , my brother Peter and a guy named Costa all had birthdays on 11/22 , and by the time DBA sang " Happy Birthday " a couple of times .
There was only one cake and that was for DB Mike who turned 20 .
Yay !
It 's a little belated , but I wanted to point out that Adam celebrated a birthday when we played with the Murder City Devils at Maxwell 's on October 30 .
Worth bringing up because it was a great show .
MCD kicked out the jams and we did our best to look like the cast from Rocky Horror .
I do n't think anyone got it until we played " Time Warp . "
We do n't have any shows planned in December , so we 're going to take this opportunity to record some new stuff .
We intend to lay down basic tracks to at least 7 new songs on the weekend of December 16th .
I for one am looking forward to it .
11/14/00 - The Dirt Bike Annie / Proteens - Furburger 2000 tour RULED .
Another turning point for DBA : this is the first time we 've gone on tour more than once in a year .
It was just the four members of Dirt Bike Annie in the Ford Explorer ( aka , " Shitstank 6000 " ) this time around which made for a more cheerful DBA .
The Proteens were an absolute joy to tour with .
They rocked out every show , were amusing , and knew how to party after the shows .
Huge thanks to Chris Imperfekt for booking this tour .
DBA as a unit was way more relaxed because of it .
Besides that , the shows were really great .
There were a couple of double show days this tour .
Warren and Pittsburgh both rocked , even though we missed Pat Dull and the Media Whores , and Pittsburgh with the Parasites was frigid but a good rock show nonetheless .
We played 2 shows in Muncie , IN thanks to the Retreads .
There probably would have been a few more people at both Muncie shows had there not been severe downpouring and Tornado warnings that night .
Todd of the Proteens made up for the lack of audience at the second Muncie show by donning a pair of Dirt Bike Fannie panties and shakin ' his groove thing .
Columbus , OH on election night was a highlight .
After a day of thrift shopping with our friend Suzy , we played to a VERY energetic crowd that night .
There were audience members rolling around the stage and at the end of Go Go Go , DBA was tackled to the ground by members of the Proms .
DBA had to be untangled before we could get to our 2 song encore .
It 's very strange to be back home almost a week later and still not know who the next president will be .
A huge shoutout to the kids in 6W ( Matt , Bryan , Hammer , Jordan et al. ) at Michigan State who we partied with after a really fun rock show at a very cool record shop called the Lower Level in East Lansing , MI .
Thanks to Faith for putting us on the bill at her house party last moment in Cincinatti .
All in all , many fond memories from this tour .
Up next for DBA : a couple of NY area shows , one at Sarah Lawrence College with our good friends Attention Deficit and Cherubino , and at Luna Lounge in Manhattan the Tuesday before Thanksgiving .
Hopefully we 'll be getting down to the business of recording new material after Thanksgiving .
10/20/00 - What has Dirt Bike Annie been up to you ask ?
I 'm sure you know because , let 's face it , no one goes to the News section to find out what 's going on with the band because they know I rarely update it .
But I digress .
DBA went on tour for 20 days in late August .
We had an entourage with us including The Proms , The Ergs , and a fine young fellow named Mark Enoch .
At one point we also had members of The Shy Guys following as well .
At that point there were 16 people in the whole group .
Most of the time it was 13 .
Let me tell you , it makes a difference when someone in your band owns a car .
For the first time ever , DBA made some money on tour .
Not enough to even cover one month of rent at the Souse House , but it was a nonetheless a turning point for the band .
Speaking of car troubles , Enoch got a flat , as did the Proms .
Indeed , the Proms had to bail on the last 4 days of the tour because of car troubles and lack of finances .
That ended up being fine because 2 of the shows scheduled got canceled .
Mutant Pop
Fest rocked the hardest , with Louisville , Columbus and Boston all being well attended , much enjoyed shows as well .
Every show on tour rocked in some way or other .
Even Lafayette , IN on a Monday night with no microphones and stands ended up being a fine rockshow .
My mom came to the show in Boston as did my girlfriend , her parents , her parents friends , my best friend and his father and girlfriend , and Joe 's mother and brother .
I thanked everyone in the audience and their mother for coming .
My mom laughed .
So that is my impression of the summer tour 2000 .
Baltimore , Maryland was one of the shows canceled this tour .
The guy who booked it , Chris Imperfect of Imperfect records felt so bad that he asked us if we wanted to go with the Proteens for 10 days the first week of November .
We accepted his generous offer .
DBA has never done more than 2 weeks for a tour in a given year .
Another turning point has been reached !
This time the entourage will have 7 people .
DBA ( minus Joe Orlowski , Jeanie 's husband ) and the Proteens .
You all probably know about the Maxwell 's show Monday , October 30 .
We 're also having a party at the Souse House Friday , November 3 .
It 's going to be the kick off show for the tour with Cherubino and Dirty Mary
We finished recording material for a split with The Grandprixx .
The prixx are fast , funny , furious and from my homestate of Massachusetts .
They say " wicked " alot in everyday conversation .
One day we will release the Kickball ep .
We had basic tracks for 4 songs done but we decided to do all 7 songs at the same time .
Adam 's engineering skills have improved in leaps and bounds since we recorded the original session , so this decision is for the best .
Of course , we need to come up with 3 new songs before we can do anything !
I 'm sure once Adam leaves his job he 'll write enough material for the ep , other splits , and a new full length in no time .
Fun fact : a good portion of " Hit the Rock " was written while Adam was out temping sporadically and living with Pauline and her mom in a one bedroom apartment in Clinton , formerly known as Hell 's Kitchen , in Manhattan .
7/24/00 - Saturday night we played a really cool show that Mark Enoch set up for us in Brookhaven , Long Island .
It was sponsored by the town of Brookhaven and their youth board .
We performed under the awning of a snack stand right on the beach .
There was a pretty big draw that night too , mostly for 48 in the Basement and the Backup Plan who both rocked the place with their melodic hardcore stylings .
There were a couple of scary moments .
The first was when we found out we had n't been scheduled to play and a lady named Marguerite from the Youth Board yelled at the guys in 48 in the Basement for not setting the show up right .
Later in the evening , she made out a $ 10 check for a copy of " Hit the Rock . "
The second scary moment was when I broke 2 strings on my new bass in the middle of " Voices in my head telling me to do bad things . "
Fortunately , Jeff ( bass player of the Backup Plan ) was on the case .
I finished the set with his Fender Jazz bass .
Thanks Jeff !
DBA plans to take the time from now until August 16 to record some songs and prepare for the big rock n' roll tour .
Up at bat for the recording will be material for a split with the Grand Prixx and 4 cover songs for a tour - only DBA cover ep .
We may hammer out a couple of more time allowing .
The " Night of the Living Rock n Roll Creation " cd ep will hopefully be available before tour on Teenage Dollhouse records .
7/16/00 - On Friday , July 14 , we played a short set at a VFW hall in Norwood , NJ .
Due to an oversized bill , and the night having to end at 11 pm instead of 2 am due to pressure from the cops , the Shy Guys , The Grand Prixx , The Kung Fu Monkeys , and DBA had to cut setlists to 3 songs per band .
The bands responded well to the pressure and all delivered energetic performances .
Especially impressive were the Kung Fu Monkeys as a two piece .
Special thanks to James for the swell idea that the final 4 bands share the remaining hour and do 3 songs each .
Thanks to Lisa for being the merch girl .
A special thanks to all those who drove far and waited hours to see us play 4 songs .
6/11/00 - Last Friday DBA played one of the best shows we 've ever had .
It was at Maxwell 's in Hoboken , NJ with the Groovie Ghoulies and the Ergs .
Wow .
The sound was amazing , the crowd was pumped , and the Ghoulies were kick - ass and really nice .
A DJ from WFMU was at the show and since then DBA has apparently been getting some regular airplay over there .
Our next confirmed show is on Wednesday , August 16 at CBGB 's with Ruth 's Hat , the Proteens and the Peabody's .
It 's a little pre-Mutant Pop fest , MP fest !
5/26/00 - I 'd like to thank everyone who came to me and Enoch 's birthday bash at the Souse House on Friday , April 28th .
A VERY SPECIAL THANKS to those who contributed towards the new Musicman Stingray bass guitar for me .
I feel very lucky to have such great friends and to be in a band with such a great bunch of people !
Thanks also to the other bands that rocked that night : Attention Deficit , The Ergs , MC Chris and his All Star Digital Orchestra , Drive - On , and the Kung Fu Monkeys .
For the KFM , it was their last NY area appearance for a while with their drummer Mike Falloon .
We wish him and his wife the best of luck in their new home in North Carolina !
Adam taped the sets onto the 8 - track and sent a DAT to Tim this week .
Tim will be releasing the tape of the DBA set as a live short - run cd , sometime in the coming months .
It sounds really great .
There was a lot of love in the room that night , we were n't drunk and the new bass sounds awesome .
Thanks to everyone who came to the Nightingale 's show on May 20th !
The sound was n't so hot , and there was n't much space , but all the bands rocked out :
The Henry the 8th's , The Grandprixx , Tuuli and the Kowalskis were all great that night .
It was the first time we 'd headlined a show at a NY venue .
Thanks to everyone for staying up late and participating in the rock !
Our next show is at Maxwell 's opening for Buck and the Groovie Ghoulies on Friday , June 2nd .
Need I say more ?
Adam also sent a cd-r of material for our next project : a four song 7 " / 6 song c.d. e.p. for the Louisville label " Teenage Dollhouse " run by our good friend Stan Doll .
It will be called " Night of the Living Rock n Roll Creation . "
It features the song of the same name plus a mix of new and old material .
We still have more writing to do for the Kickball release .
Three more songs to go and then we 're going to start from scratch to record them .
4/25/00 - Spring is in the air !
Yee -haw !
I destroyed the old refrigerator in the backyard , and Adam planted grass over the weekend .
That means the entire backyard is primed for Souse House Summer parties !
We 've got one coming up Friday , April 28th to celebrate the birthdays of myself ( DB Dan - Tuesday , May 2 ; I 'll be 24 ) and our webmaster , Mark Enoch who turned 21 on April 17 .
I already got my first gift : my girlfriend Lisa gave me a " Built by Wendy " guitar strap for the bass .
It 's gold and has pictures of Hank Williams .
VERY COOL !
DBA is making progress on new material .
We 've got 6 more songs to conquer on the computer and then another 6 to finish writing .
Adam has been very diligently working on new material in his room and I can't wait to hear what he 's going to bring to the table .
One song , " Children Should n't Play with Dead Things " is out the door and is going to be on a horror compilation featuring the likes of Darlington , the Hungtingtons , Attention Deficit , The Connie Dungs ... all the double oh pop-punk all stars .
Oh hey , watch out for the new DBA411 in your mailboxes soon !
Our editor , MC Chris , is on the case !
3/22/00 - Thanks to all those peoples coming out for the St. Patty 's Day rock n roll party at the Souse House .
I think we might be having another shindig on Saturday , May 6 .
Mike Yannich , or Dirt Bike Mike is quite the man on drums .
His sober , solidness was nice counterpoint to our drunken zaniness during the second set .
He 's also a super swell guy , so say hello to him when you see him at a show .
I forget if I 've updated here since our March 9th show at the Continental , but I think it 's information worth repeating : the show ROCKED .
I was exhausted by the end of the Huntingtons set , but the rock kept going with Darlington ( and much of the crowd cavorting onstage ) and then the Heartdrops .
That was Mike 's first DBA show and he was totally great !
We 're getting ready to start recording some new material this weekend , just as the Proms are at Pontiac 's studio to record them .
Hopefully , Eddie Prom will be around enough to turn out a couple of ditties for a Proms / DBA split .
All that remains to be done is write a song or 2 and record them .
NO PROBLEM !
3/2/2000 -
The new print copy of the DBA 411 should be out the door and in your hands sometime next week .
There 's some pretty funny stuff in there .
There 's also a little something about the day after St. Patty 's Day party we 're throwing on March 18th .
Bands scheduled to play include : The Shyguys , Dirt Bike Annie , International Waters , Attention Deficit ( tentative ) , Punch Buggy Blue ... you know , I can't remember all the bands , but I think there are about 8 bands going on .
DBA is going to kick off the night at 8 pm , so if you want to see us play , get there early !
Thanks to all the kids that came out for the show in Hatboro , PA .
Wormbath was so good , I now wear their button on my leather jacket .
I do n't think DBA was punk enough for the Hatboro crowd , though there were a couple kids who seemed to enjoy it .
Namely Enoch and Mike from Wormbath .
We played Barnard College on Feb. 25th .
The room was pretty bad , and I was n't in the best form , but I think people were entertained regardless .
My mom met my new girlfriend , Lisa .
They got along just fine .
The highlight for me was singing " In my Dreams " with the Hissyfits .
Up next for shows : March 9 at the Continental .
THIS SHOW IS GOING TO KICK BUTT , so go if you can .
We go on at 8 pm sharp .
There may be something in April at Barnard , and something in May at Arlene 's grocery .
We 'll see how it all goes .
1/31/00 - How about that ?
Month one of the year 2000 already down !
For those of you who came to the " Prom " , thanks !
Everyone seemed to have a really great time .
The new rythm section was pounding !
A round of applause to Mr. Buzby for a successful first gig .
Next up , Hatboro PA , Feb. 12 .
After that , Barnard College Friday , Feb. 25 .
Details to that show forthcoming .
Adam recorded a cover of " Sweet Child of Mine . "
This is the first full band song to be recorded on the new system .
That means drums !
Bass !
Vocals !
Guitars !
Wow !
It sounds great !
Interested in recording at " Saddletramp Studio 2000 ? " Email Adam and he 'll try and work out something .
His rates are reasonable and the work is quality .
1/18/99 - Thanks to everyone who came to our Millennium shindig !
As I was keen to point out in my drunkeness several times , NO ONE died !
In fact , the party ended up being pretty mellow .
Special thanks to John Buzby for letting us use his car to get the kegs , to myself for returning the kegs , to The Flatliners and The Proteens for ROCKING very hard and to Hallie Bullet for the kiss at midnight !
There is talk about doing another party on St. Patty 's day which falls on Friday , March 17 this year .
We will either do that , or try to set up an NYC club show for our good friends the Lynnwoods and Leftout from Louisville , KY .
If you missed these guys at our record release party this summer , YOU MUST CHECK THEM OUT !
DBA is getting geared up for some cool shows in the spring , an ep which we 're aiming to release in late spring , and a tentative split 7 " followed by a tentative summer tour with fellow Mutant Poppers , THE CONNIE DUNGS !
12/22/99 -
We are going to be burying a time capsule at the millennium party .
If you would like to bring 1 small item to include in it please do so .
12/9/99 - First off : there have been bands interested in being on the bill of the Millennium extravaganza .
No one ( outside of DBA and the Bravo Project ) is confirmed until they show up and play .
At any rate , unconfirmed acts are : The Proteens , The Flatliners , and Punch Buggy Blue .
All fine young men and true .
In other news : on the weekend of Dec 4th Adam and myself got together and soundproofed the basement at the Souse House .
Well , " sound reduced " more like .
It reminds me of a Moroccan tent , but Punk Rock .
Those who will be coming to the Millennium shindig will be relieved to learn that they need not be concerned with bumping their heads on pipes as the ceiling is now covered in eggcrate .
11/30/99 -
Though it was more than a month and a half ago , Dirt Bike Annie would like to take this opportunity for everyone who made the Columbus Mutant Pop Fest a reality .
Speaking for myself , it was the most amazing experience performing I 've ever had .
I think we all felt part of something special and important on that night .
Special thanks go out to Eddie , Ruths Hat , the Hissyfits ( Especially for giving me a ride to and from the show , and being all around swell ladies ) , The Proms , The Connie Dungs , Nate Schmoe , and Timbo .
In other news , Dirt Bike Annie and Deano have parted ways .
It was an amicable breakup and we sincerely wish him all the best .
So , we are on the search for a drummer .
If you 're interested , PLEASE CONTACT US !
Also , Dirt Bike Annie will be hosting a Millennium party at the Souse House .
DBA and the Bravo Project are the only confirmed acts for the night .
Contact enoch@dirtbikeannie.com for directions .
If you are in a band and would be interested in playing , let us know ASAP !
9/17/99 - Adam and I scored a new place in Jersey City , NJ .
We will be performing there for sure on the Millennium in the basement .
Also appearing will be MC Chris & the Lee Majors ( featuring members of DBA ) .

We 're also trying to get some other bands to perform .
Like the Kung Fu Monkeys .
The apartment is totally awesome !
Check the Shows Section as a couple of dates have been added .
8/30/99 -
The bad news is that our 1999 " Last Tour of the Millenium " has come to an end .
The good news is that the shows , the bands , the people we met the drunken debauchery filled nights were amazing .
We are already looking forward to doing something next summer .
Who knows what can happen in a year .
Anyhow , we 're getting ready for our " Return to New York " show at CBGB 's on Wednesday , September 8 at 8 pm .
Also we are working very closely with Eddie from the proms to make sure we get together the Mutant Pop " ROctober " show in Columbus , OH .
If we get the line - up we 're looking for , it should be a show of shows .
We 'll keep y'all posted right here .
8/9/99 - Please check the Upcoming Shows section of the webpage for recent changes that have been made to the tour itinerary .
We 're getting very excited .
Woo - hoo !
Thanks to those of you who came out for our little 4 song video taping at Funkadelic , in NYC .
It was a good time and the footage looks pretty darned OK if you ask me !

7/15/99 -
In the face of great adversity , i.e. Coney Island High closing , the DBA record release party was a grand success !
We are forever in debt to Countdown studios for letting us book the show there .
Our next show is going to be on Sat. July 24 in Wayne , NJ .
The details are still a little muddy , but I 'll be sure to keep y'all posted .
The dates for the tour are starting to come together .
Those dates will be posted in the Upcoming Shows section forthcoming .
Anyone who wants to see me act , can check out the production of Julius Caeser at the American Theater of Actors at 234 W. 54th st .
It is outside , runs Wednesdays - Saturdays until July 31 , and costs $ 10 .
I have the most famous line of the play - " Beware the Ides of March ! "
Very exciting !
6/11/99 -
We got our allotted copies of Hit the Rock today .
All 200 .
Make sure and order your copy before they run out !
Or wait until Tim gets back from his cross-country trip .
Yesterday the guestbook hit 9000 .

It 'll be no time at all before we hit 10,000 !
The first few dates for the tour are starting to shape up .

Thanks .
Date : 09:02:46 , June 02 - from Adam Hello .

Saturday , July 10th will be the DBA Hit The ROCK CD RELEASE PARTY !! at Coney island High ( with many special guests ! ) also , contrary to what the village voice says , we are NOT playing Coney Island High on Saturday , April 22nd .
I guess there was some kind of mis-print .

about the band in this News page , once I get around to actually updating it .
Like , " Jeanie 's married " and " Dan has n't had a date in over 5 months ... "
The site has surpassed 8,000 hits .
More of those people should be signing our fabulous guest thing .
The CD is now in Tim Chandler 's hands and is now available for pre-ordering .
We are just about as excited as children the night before Christmas for it to finally come out .
It 's 14 songs , has a 20 page booklet and is called Hit the Rock !
We recorded on 24 tracks , to 2 inch tape at " Loho Studio " in Soho , NYC by Victor Luke .
Joe loves it so much , he plays it at work all day .
If that 's not a stamp of approval , I do n't know what is !
We played a really fun show a few weeks ago at Penn State College w/ a great band called The Proteens .
They will be releasing a 7 " on Mutant Pop this summer that 's destined to become a classic .
The song " Drunk in the Morning " is sure to become a hit !

11/16/98 - Jeanie got married on Nov. 7 , 1998 .
She 's keeping her name .
Jean Lee .
Her husband is Joe Orlowski .
He 's a good man .
Maybe not " the best man " , but that would be a weird thing to do .
HA HA !
Adam moved to Hoboken .
We 're practically neighbors .
CD in effect people .
The material is shaping up very well .
It 's just a matter of REHEARSING IT !
We 'll get it together : Fear Not .
We are now at over 3,000 hits on the ol ' web - a - roo .
Expect a Dirt Bike Annie comeback live show sometime in the next couple of months .
9/30/98 - Adam bought a car so he does n't have enough money to go to Europe .
It 's a ' 64 Chevy Corvair .
Crazy .
So we 're working on the new c.d. ( tentatively titled Hit the Rock ) .
As a matter of fact Adam , Dino , and I are rehearsing today so Adam and I can show Dino the new stuff ... which is pretty much the whole album .
We may also be playing a house warming party at my new apartment in FABULOUS JERSEY CITY NEW JERSEY .
If you live in the area just email me for the info on how to get to the place .
It 's absurdly easy to get to .
The party is this Saturday , so I 'm positive no one will read this before then .
Still , there 's always that chance ...
The guestbook got erased .
I deleted it by accident .
I 'll see what I can do about getting it running again .
I 'm rather upset about the whole thing .
We 've almost reached 3000 hits for the webpage .
RA RA RA !
8/24/98- The date has been set for Jeanie and Joe- Nov. 7 . Somewhere in Philly .
Adam , MC Chris and I will be Jeanie 's best men .
She 's also going to have a maid of honor .
Went to Philly .
Chilled at Adam 's house .
It was nice .
I added a text only version of the page to the main menu .
Those of you w/ unix accounts or slow computers will appreciate this .
Though the pics page is pretty pointless w/o images .
Things are pretty slow around here .
We 're all getting ready to move out of our current apartment . :(
To those who knew 88 Christopher St in it 's heyday , it will be greatly missed .
I guess some people have recieved their DBA membership stuff .
Feel free to email us your snailmail address , download an image of yourself and we will make you a DBA member .
8/11/98- JEANIE'S GETTING MARRIED TO JOE !!!
They have n't set a date .
Email us if you want to know more ...
Needless to say I 'm going to have to edit her bio .
I finally got all the pictures from the July 22 Coney Island High show up .
Make sure to check it out at DBA Pics .
The new side project Dirt Bike Sandy will most likely feature the future husband and wife on guitar and bass , and myself on drums .
Ah ... must I always be the third wheel ?
8/3/98 - Greetings all !
I 've updated the DBA Pics so make sure to check em out They were taken at the July 22 Coney Island High show .
Also we had to drop the show with Got Milf ? in Jersey as we are trying to save our energies for rehearsing material for the cd .
We 're working hard to bring you the best rock music we can .
Also there may be a chance that two of the horn players from King Chango , the NYC latin- ska band , may contribute some of their musical mastery on the cd .
I 'll keep you up to date as best I can .
7/27/98-
Wow it has been too long people !
The biggest news first : after we complete the cd for Mutant Pop Adam will be going to Europe for a while .
I sorta think of it like a solo project .
We all wish him the best of luck .
In the meantime DB Jeanie and I will continue in the spirit with a side project called " Dirt Bike Sandy " watch out for us in the coming months .
Thanks to everyone who came to the shows at Wayne NJ and Coney Island High respectively .
The shows rocked .
There may be a gig somewhere in NJ on either August 15 or the 16 with Got Milf ? , The Nobodys , The Connie Dungs and a few others .
I 'll do my best to keep you posted via this frickin ' news page .
It did n't work out with that other drummer so Dino 's going to be doing our cd with Mutant Pop .
Watch out for it probably sometime in late 98 ' or early 99 ' .
5/6/98 - I added a new guestbook .
Feel free to sign it !
Thanks to those who came and saw me act in The Millenium Lounge it was great fun .
Hopefully we 'll be putting it up again soon somewhere in the city .
DBA auditioned it 's first drummer after Dino .
His name is Joe .
Very talented .
He 's played in the NYC hardcore scene since the late 80's .
We 're going to play with him again soon and hopefully it will all work out .
We 'll keep you posted on that .
Jeanie , Adam and I were working on the new ep at the rehearsal space last night when the 8 - track decided to crap out on us .
We 've got options , but it will probably delay the release of the ep .
It 's tentatively titled the " Are You Ready For the Summer " ep and features , Jeanie 's Song , Johnie Heartbreak , a revamped Marcia Brady 's Trying to Kill Me , and of course our cover of the Meatball 's theme , Are You Ready For the Summer .
Stay tuned !
I turned 22 years old on May 2 . Happy Birthday to me !
I 'm graduating from NYU on the 14th ... it 's all too much !
Feel free to send graduation gifts to our PO Box address .
4/14/98- A very important update :
The gigs on the April 21 and May 2 have both been canceled .
4/8/98 -
Well , I think I 've finished just about everything here for the initial setup .
If you see any problems or have suggestions to improve the page , let me know !
4/7/98 - Hi everyone !
This is Dirt Bike Danny .
The reason I started this page was for my computer class .
Hopefully I will get an A !
I was going to put all the original 411's on here originally , but there is n't enough space in my account .
This also accounts for the minimal amount of sound files .
Consider the rumor confirmed .
Deano is leaving the band .
The tour was tough on the guy .
We appreciate all that he 's done for us in the past year .
It is unlikely that we 'll find someone quite as talented as he is .
He is still going to play gigs with us , but only in the city .
He will also most likely be recording on the cd for us .
Adam and Jeanie are in overtime writing new material .
What they 've got so far is pretty hot .
We 've got two gigs coming up : April 21 at The Bitter End .
It 's free for NYU Students !
Part of graduation festivities .
May 2 around 10:30 at CBGB 's with our good friends the Kung Fu Monkeys .
DBA always seems to play gigs on my birthday .
Make sure to bring a cool gift !
Also come see me act in a play !
It 's called the Millenium Lounge and is being performed April 26 - May 3 .
Call 228-6000 ext. 363 for reservations and address .
Army Denies Access To Its Public Library Of Documents Posted by Pile ( 10379 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
The Army has shut down public access to the largest online collection of its doctrinal publications , a move criticized by open - government advocates as unnecessary secrecy by a runaway bureaucracy .
Army officials moved the Reimer Digital Library ( http://atiam.train.army.mil) behind a password - protected firewall on Feb. 6 , restricting access to an electronic trove that is popular with researchers for its wealth of field and technical manuals and documents on military operations , education , training and technology .
All are unclassified , and most already are approved for public release .
" Almost everything connected to the Army is reflected in some way in the Reimer collection , " said Steven Aftergood , director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the nonprofit Federation of American Scientists .
" It provides the public with an unparalleled window into Army policy .
It provides unclassified resources on military planning and doctrine . "
Aftergood , a daily user of the library until he was shut out by the new firewall two weeks ago , said the collection offers specialized military manuscripts that do not appear on the shelves of local libraries .
These include documents on the Army 's use of unmanned aircraft ; tactics and techniques for the use of nonlethal weapons ; a field manual for non-engineers on the fundamentals of flight ; and a manual on working dogs in the military .
" All of this stuff had been specifically approved for public release , " Aftergood said .
" I think it 's a case of bureaucracy run amok .
And it 's a familiar impulse to secrecy that needs to be challenged at every turn . "
For years , open - government advocates have complained about the Bush administration 's penchant for confidentiality , from the White House 's long - standing refusal to release lists of presidential visitors to the secrecy surrounding the administration 's warrantless wiretapping program and Vice President Cheney 's energy policy task force .
In 2006 , the National Archives acknowledged that the CIA and other agencies had withdrawn thousands of records from the public shelves over several years and inappropriately reclassified many of them .
Early in 2002 , then - Attorney General John D. Ashcroft issued a memo urging federal agencies to use whatever legal means necessary to reject Freedom of Information Act requests for public documents .
Seen this one yet ?

Creating a successful portfolio is easier than you think .
Focus on simplicity , ease of use , hitting your objectives , professionally managing the project , and you ’ll end up with a successful portfolio .
In this article we ’ll review 5 pitfalls that commonly plague portfolio design .
Then we ’ll cover Portfolio
Tips that if carefully considered and well executed will deliver quality results for your portfolio .
You might be interested in the following related posts :
There are some common mistakes designers make in their portfolios .
Let ’s review these common pitfalls first to make sure you do n’t fall into one of these traps .
Pitfall # 1 : Obfuscation
Clarity and focus should permeate your portfolio .
With language do n’t use twenty words when seven will do .
Push your best content to the front .
When possible place your important content above the fold .
Avoid meandering in your language or paths in your website .
Keep your portfolio to the minimum of levels deep , while still accomplishing your goals .
Over at Copyblogger there is an article that covers a simple list of writing tips from the man known for cutting out the fluff from writing in the early twentieth century .
See the article Ernest Hemingway ’s Top 5 Tips for Writing Well .
Hemingway championed using short sentences , strong forceful language , and clarity .
All principles that make for effective writing on the Web .
The Portfolio of Evan Eckard is an example of a website that promotes the work from the first page and Gets to it quickly .
In the article Creating The Perfect Portfolio author Collis Ta’eed offers portfolio advice from the perspective of a potential employer .
One of his section titled Get to it on the reasons to limit the number of portfolio pieces you have and make finding your best portfolio pieces easy .
A potential employer needs to review many potential applicants quickly .
You are more likely to make the cut if your best work is promoted prominently .
The Portfolio of Evan Eckard is an example of a website that promotes the work from the first page and Gets to it quickly .
Pitfall # 2 : Information Cramming
There is an issue of wanting to say too much in too little space when creating your portfolio .
There is a balance that needs to be achieved with how many pages deep you have users clicking for more information and how much information you try to fit on a page .
This is an issue to be aware of when constructing your portfolio .
The tighter you pack your portfolio the more likely it will appear cluttered .
If you do need to put a large amount of information on a page see the post Grid and Column Designs over at Web Designer ’s wall .
It will give you some great ideas on how you can use the grid to your advantage when presenting a vast amount of information .
The article will give you some great ideas on how you can use the grid to your advantage when presenting a vast amount of information .
Pitfall # 3 : Overdoing It
You ’re less likely to go wrong if you keep things simple and organized .
You can apply this mindset to all areas of your portfolio .
Less is more .
The more you try to do in your portfolio the more chances there are for things to go wrong .
If you ’re trying to showcase eighteen services you offer you ’ll have less success than promoting a few prominently .
If you show too many types of work or try to show too much work of any type than you ’ll likely to drown the user .
They wo n’t find your prominent pieces that show how great your work is .
Pitfall # 4 : Uncommon Navigation
Designers have an urge to stand out as unique .
The last place to follow this urge is in your site ’s navigation .
It ’s a matter of numbers .
If a large number of people coming to see your portfolio will have difficulty navigating through it , your portfolio will fail to meet its goals .
On the blog Astheria in the post My Last Portfolio Sucked , Yours Might Too the author points out some excellent examples of navigation choices to avoid .
In this article Kyle Meyer reviews 200 portfolios and points out the problems with using them .
Navigation problems made up over 32 percent of the issues encountered .
This article presents some excellent examples of navigation choices to avoid .
Pitfall # 5 : Visual Clutter
Consider the purpose of any decorative element you bring to your portfolio .
If they fit your goals and compliment your work that ’s great .
Otherwise remove them .
White space helps to give a professional feel to your portfolio .
The more visual elements you try to push into an area the more difficult it will be to maintain a feeling of professionalism .
In the interview Where Visual Design Meets Usability - An Interview with Luke Wroblewski , Part II both page hierarchy and visual clutter are addressed .
In the article he summarizes some of Edward Tufte ’s teachings on avoiding superfluous data .
12 Principles of Effective Portfolio Design
Below you ’ll find 12 suggestions which you can use to improve your portfolio or get it right first time when designing from scratch .
Please keep in mind that some of these suggestions require patience , time and quite a lot of planning .
However , it ’s worth it .
And the examples provided below show that one can achieve outstanding results with just following these 12 simple rules .
1. Define your Criteria and Strategies for Success
As with any project it will help you to clarify your goals before you begin .
Once you know your goals then it will effect every decision you make about creating your portfolio .
Below are some common portfolio goals .
Also , be aware that often portfolios try to accomplish more than one goal .
Or , consider creating more than one portfolio that serves a different purpose .
The Hire Me Portfolio focuses on getting you a job .
If you are actively searching for a job then the current goal of your portfolio is to get hired .
In this type of portfolio you can target the work you show to the type of company you want to work for .

Or tie your work together with a blog on your portfolio site .
The Networking Portfolio focuses on building relationships .
There are many networks that have excellent portfolio building tools .
They have some advantages to placing your portfolio on their website .
Chiefly among them is to leverage the site space for networking .
2. Consider Using Multiple Portfolios
There are multiple reasons to have more than one portfolio .
You may have more than one skill set that you would like to promote separately .
You may want to create a portfolio that is targeted to landing a specific job and send it to a marketing director at a company .
They ’ll appreciate that .
It saves them time and shows you really want the job .
Even if it ’s a one - page portfolio .
Even if you are filling the portfolio with the same work you will still benefit by having multiple portfolios within different groups online .
Take the case of Nik Ainley , a UK - based designer and illustrator .
He has multiple portfolios that all serve complimentary goals .
He chose to participate in multiple portfolio - based communities to build his reputation and network with other designers .
He had a Portfolio on Behance .
He ’s involved in numerous groups there and has a large Inner Circle .
And it prominently displays that he is available for Freelancing , Long - Term Contract , Full - Time Hire , or Consulting work .
Nick has a very popular Portfolio on DeviantArt .
He ’s been a member there since 2004 .
He has over 80 Portfolio pieces and over 1,000 comments on his work there .
He has a lot of fans that have his works marked as favorites .
He is less active though he had a Gallery on CPLUV .
His Portfolio on Depthcore is really good .
This site features artists that have to be invited to contribute .
So , the quality of work on this site is really high .
Overall Nik Ainley shows how you can benefit from having multiple portfolios online even when the work you are showcasing is similar in each portfolio .
That is because you are taping into a different community with each portfolio you create .
You ’re meeting people , exposing them to your work , and making new connections by placing your portfolio within different communities .
Some portfolio communities to look at :
3. Target Your Market
The more you target your design to a specific market the more it will speak to the visitor within that market .
If you are looking to land corporate clients in a conservative industry than present them with work that is clean , marketable , and looks successful .
Do n’t showcase edgy , grungy , or arty work unless that ’s the market you ’re going after .
In the article The Secret to Getting a Lot of Web Design Work the author has a section “ Design the portfolio you think your clients want to see ” .
This is the point .
Make your portfolio focused on your target market .
If you ’re trying to get clients then design keeping these clients in mind .
Consider this example : a web designer that specializes in designer Law Firm websites has a different target market than a company that builds Rock Band websites .
The language , graphics , and approach such portfolios take will differ greatly .
If a web designer has numerous successful Law Firm websites in their portfolio it will make it easier for a potential law firm client to choose them over another designer or design agency .
A designer is more likely to stand out by targeting a specific market .
Their success rate at landing jobs in a specific niche and being perceived as an expert in that area will increase .
Take a look at the Dan Gilroy Design Portfolio for an example of a website that successfully targets a specific market .
Having a target market in mind is essential to choosing your portfolio pieces and your approach to designing your website .
4. Make Usability a Top Priority
Navigation is a top consideration as a user being able to view your portfolio is of paramount importance .
See the point about Uncommon Navigation above .
Some other considerations are using web standards .
This is especially true if you ’re looking for a job as a web designer today .
Read this article Five steps to a better design portfolio by Jefferey Veen .
In it he discusses some issues around best practices in your portfolio in relation to how you will be perceived by a potential employer .
Also , do n’t discount the search bots .
Work toward better Search Engine Optimization .
The blog at SEOBook is a rich resource on this topic .
Good SEO will improve the ability for potential clients to find you through the major search engines .
5. Utilize the Right Technology
If there are technologies inherent in your job description then it may make sense to build your portfolio with that technology .
Sure Flash is cool , but is it right for your website .
Probably not if you ’re a logo designer .
Though if you ’re trying to land a job as a Flash Designer at a top notch Interactive Design Agency like Story Worldwide than its the right choice .
The New Media Designer Portfolio of Mathew V. Robinson presents an easy to use navigation .
Essential to the success of a Flash site , it ’s fast loading .
His portfolio is highly usable and looks great .
Consider maintainability when deciding on technologies .
Simplifying your portfolio as much as possible will ease the time you ’ll have to spend on upgrading or making changes to the website .
You should consider how easy it is to add and remove portfolio pieces .
The easier it is the more likely it is you ’ll update your portfolio on a regular basis .
Jamie Gregory has an simple , elegant , and effective one page portfolio .
He would have no trouble adding or swapping out pieces from this portfolio .
Consider enhancement when looking at technology .
Often a wise choice is to add a little Javascript or other technologies rather than rely on them .
It can help you to achieve your goals without overly complicating your portfolio design .
When visiting Marius Roosendaal ’s Portfolio take a moment to explore how clean the source code is .
This is done while providing elegant Javascript - based solutions .
Choose between creating a static site or utilizing a CMS ( Content Management System ) .
One page portfolios are really easy to update and a good way to quickly show your best work .
You ’ll also have no issues with navigation , as there is only one page .
Though there is little flexibility there and you ’re not leveraging some additional features that content management systems have for promoting your work , like having a blog .
6. Plan Your Portfolio Project
One of the key ingredients to creating a successful portfolio is to approach it like you would a client project .
Manage this project as professionally as you would any other web project you take on .
Set aside the time needed to achieve the goals you ’ve outlined for the portfolio .
Make sure you set up deadlines so that you have key targets to hit .
7. Narrow the Scope and Type of Work Promoted
Your portfolio should be limited to the best work you will promote within the scope of your goals .
If you are taking on website redesigns then your portfolio should consist only of that , not logo designs or print work that you ’ve done .
If its not the work you ’re targeting than do n’t include it .
You will be more successful .
Jesse Bennett - Chamberlain redesigned his website 31 three back in May of 2007 .
Before doing so he used to have print and logo designs in his portfolio .
In the redesign he clarified his target market by focusing on assisting developers with design .
His current portfolio only presents website and interface designs he has created because that is the type of work he is looking for .
This portfolio is very successful on many points and has been referenced in many articles throughout the blogosphere .
That does n’t mean he does n’t do logo or identity design .
He does do that , but he ’s recognized that logo design is not why people come to him .
They come to him for website designs for new or existing sites and logo design may be a part of the package .
Certainly some designers or firms will have mixed bag portfolios .
The more types of work you do successfully the greater challenge you ’ll have in promoting that work .
When possible keep the work on display to a minimum .
Displaying 10 of your best pieces of work is often better than displaying 50 good pieces .
Contact information should be easy to find and in the case of contact forms they should be easy to use .
Prominently place this kind of information .
The Hicksdesign Portfolio has contact information displayed well on every page .
It helps to build confidence with your target market to clarify your role in the projects you present in your portfolio .
If you designed the website , but someone else coded it , then state that .
If you did everything then confidently declare that as well .
The Portfolio of Cameron Moll employs this strategy on each portfolio piece .
Providing case studies gives a deeper view into your process .
Once a potential employer or client has narrowed down their list they may come back and start to take more time with your portfolio .
Case studies will show how competent and thorough your process is .
David Airey does a good job of providing easy to find case studies on his portfolio pieces .
Client testimonials are effective for persuading those that visit your site that you will deliver on your promises .
It increases the level of professionalism when tastefully incorporating testimonial into your portfolio .
David Airey has an article titled The Importance of Client Testimonials that has useful information on this subject .
9. Present Your Work Within the Confines of Your Goals
Your work needs to stand out foremost in your portfolio .
If your portfolio site design overpowers the work on display then you ’re not likely to meet your site goals .
Consider carefully every visual element you add to the design .
When unsure shoot for simplicity .
10 . Infuse Your Personality Into Your Design
Nick La has a portfolio design that shows his design style and interests .
The unique background illustration stands out .
It does n’t interfere with the usability of the site , but it gives it a beautiful wrapper .
For some this would be too much and interfere with the work being presented .
Though the work presented in his portfolio works fine .
He sets the portfolio pieces against a solid white background in a strong column - based design .
The work presented fits with the style of the sites background illustration .
Pulling off this kind of personal infusion into the design of your site is difficult to achieve .
Doing this well makes your portfolio not only memorable but remarkable !
Nick La achieved tremendous success with his portfolio for N.design Studio .
Being remarkable in the design of your portfolio often means bringing to fruition the personal design taste unique to you that has been cultivated over the years .
Seth Goden has some excellent points about being remarkable in his post How to be remarkable .
Here is a quote from the post “ Remarkability lies in the edges .
The biggest , fastest , slowest , richest , easiest , most difficult . ”
This is a good point , but there is a huge risk involved in that pursuing the remarkable edge you ride right off the cliff .
Carefully consider how you will blend your remarkable personal elements into your portfolio without sacrificing usability and without misaligning the balance between the prominence of your portfolio and the design of the site itself .
11 . Promote and Leverage Your Work
There are many techniques for promoting your portfolio .
Consider joining professional online communities and networking with other community members .
We ’ve already looked at some communities that you can place a portfolio on .
Place a thread in a design forum about your portfolio .
Submit your design to gallery websites .
Almost any technique that can be used to promote a website can be used to promote your portfolio .
Add a blog to your website .
The more traffic you can pull to your website the more exposure your portfolio will receive .
Dan Cederholm was an early adopter of this technique and achieved fame with his blog Simplebits .
His portfolio resides successfully on the same site .
Leveraging your work involves linking to it when you send emails .
Include a link to your portfolio site in your Facebook profile or any other community you belong to .
Infuse your portfolio site within your communications and your online identity .
12 . Develop Your Long - Term Portfolio Goals
It always helps to have a view toward the future .
Your portfolio needs are likely to change many times as you develop different projects over the course of your career .
Though even looking at the whole of 2008 and not only at the next week can make a big difference in the choices you make when creating your portfolio .
Putting it all together : a successful portfolio finds that perfect blend of your personality , prominence of work , simplicity , and ease of use that makes your portfolio stand out from the crowd and achieve your goals .
In this modern age of cynical detachment , where many people have difficulty expressing an opinion that is n't couched in layers of irony and " meh , " there 's something refreshing about protesters .
These people actually care about something , so firmly and fervently that they 're willing to get up and do something about it , even if that something is only marching around and trying to work up a rhyme for " globalization . "
Yeah they smell , and they 're usually shamelessly ugly , but there 's just something so earnest about these people that we can't help but respect .
Except for the stupid ones .
It turns out there 's a lot of those .
Here are the 25 stupidest .

I estimate that Three Strikes reduced participation in criminal activity by 20 percent for second - strike eligible offenders and a 28 percent decline for third - strike eligible offenders .
However , I find two unintended consequences of the law .
First , because Three Strikes flattened the penalty gradient with respect to severity , criminals were more likely to commit more violent crimes .
Among third - strike eligible offenders , the probability of committing violent crimes increased by 9 percentage points .
Second , because California 's law was more harsh than the laws of other nearby states , Three Strikes had a " beggar - thy - neighbor " effect increasing the migration of criminals with second and third - strike eligibility to commit crimes in neighboring states .
( Budget Travel ) --
As the Sky Train departs Beijing West Railway Station at 9:30 p.m. , there is n't an inch of unclaimed real estate in the train 's 16 carriages .
Suitcases spill into the aisles , doubling as chairs for passengers without seats .
The new Sky Train as it crosses the Lhasa River in Tibet
Boxes of scallion - flavored biscuits and cardboard bowls of instant noodles cover the faux - wood tables in each compartment .
Farmers with weather - beaten faces keep watch over bulging bags of produce in the overhead racks , while young men smoke cigarettes and play cards as they squat in the tight spaces between carriages .
It 's the night before China 's October National Day , and close to 1,000 passengers are on the high - speed train bound for a place that was unreachable by rail until recently : Lhasa , Tibet .
In the past seven years , the Chinese government has laid 710 miles of track across western China and the Tibetan plateau , creating the highest elevated railway ever built .
At its tallest point , the Tanggula Pass near the China - Tibet border , the Sky Train climbs to 16,640 feet .
The Chinese have been obsessed with building a railroad to Tibet for decades -- Chairman Mao first tried to link the two countries by rail in the 1950s , but the technology was n't advanced enough to lay train tracks on Tibet 's year - round permafrost .
By the time the Sky Train finally made its inaugural , 48 - hour trip from Beijing to Lhasa in July , China had spent $ 4.5 billion on rails that can withstand subzero temperatures and cabins that have the capability to pump in additional oxygen at high altitudes .
If you go ... The Sky Train leaves Beijing daily at 9:30 p.m. Tickets are sold at the Beijing West Railway Station ( 011-86/10-95-105-105 ) .
One - way prices range from $ 173 for a soft - sleeper ticket to $ 53 in the seating - only cabins .
Booking months in advance is recommended .
The lowest level of accommodations is simply an uncushioned seat .
The most luxurious option , soft - sleeper class , has flat - screen TVs and four soft bunk beds ( with down comforters ) in each cabin .
I 'm in hard - sleeper class , which is considerably less private -- the compartments do n't have doors .
Three wooden bunks are stacked on both sides of the cabin , so the person at the top has to sleep nose - to - ceiling .
The space reminds me of a Beijing restaurant -- drinking , smoking and card playing go on all night .
The life of the party , a young Chinese soldier in the bunk above me , shouts jokes long after the battery in my iPod dies .
The next morning , passengers stroll through the aisles in pajamas , making their way to the dining car .
Breakfast consists of salty vegetables , porridge and eggs for $ 3 .
Everyone slurps their porridge noisily , watching as cornfields appear and disappear .
Chinese muzak blares over the speakers , including one song that ends with a voice cooing , " Happy birthday to you . "
By midday , the train zips past the ancient city of Xi'an .
A group of men in the dining car raise their glasses and toast with shouts of " Ganbei ! "
In my cabin , passengers crack sunflower seeds to pass the time , their shells spilling onto the carpet .
Eventually , I make my way back to the dining car .
" My parents forbade me from taking this trip , " says a Chinese college student sipping soup across from me .
" But I did n't care , because I had to see Tibet . "
When the Sky Train reaches Golmud at dawn , I feel dizzy .
The atmosphere on the Tibetan plateau has about 50 percent less oxygen than at sea level , and people pop altitude - sickness pills until the extra oxygen kicks in .
As the train follows the shores of Qinghai Lake , craggy peaks surface across the vast frozen tundra .
Herds of yak , their tails pointing straight out , graze in tall grasses studded with boulders .
There are few people , a notable exception being a man who smiles at me as he relieves himself beside the tracks .
An hour before the train pulls into Lhasa , the crew passes through the cabin one last time , their souvenir carts stocked with carved combs and painted chopsticks .
A Tibetan monk across the aisle from me pauses from his prayers to peer out the window as the lights of Lhasa finally come into focus .

Fossils of a new primate species called Teilhardina magnoliana were discovered in Mississippi .
The mouse - size primate would have lived in trees along the coastlines about 55.8 million years ago , the researcher says .
Leaping , furry mini-monkeys that were as small as mice crossed the Bering land bridge long before humans , representing North America 's oldest known primates .
This new claim is based on the fossils of at least three individuals of this previously unknown species of extinct primate uncovered at a site near Meridian , Miss. , scientists announced today .
The researcher estimates the primate fossils date to about 55.8 million years ago .
If the age of the fossils is accurate , the new finding could indicate that early primates migrated across the land bridge that once connected Siberia with Alaska long before Homo sapiens that arrived some 12,000 to 14,000 years ago .
The teeny primate crossover from Asia happened during the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum when global temperatures rose at a rate and magnitude similar to today 's global warming .
" The primate itself appears new to science , and is thus a welcome addition to what is still a small ' Red Hot ' fauna in Mississippi , " said Philip Gingerich of the Museum of Paleontology at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , who was n't involved in the recent discovery .
" The site has the potential to be important , but the importance depends to some extent on whether it is really the age the author claims or not . "
Called Teilhardina magnoliana , the mini monkey - like creature weighed just an ounce ( 28 grams ) and would have leapt across treetops to snatch up insects and fruits .
" They were acrobatic little creatures , " said K. Christopher Beard of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh , who details his finding in the March 4 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Monkey map
Closely related species of Teilhardina have been found at sites in China , Belgium , France and Wyoming .
The fossil evidence from the international sites indicates Teilhardina inhabited North America , Europe and Asia at roughly the same time .
Researchers have puzzled over the sequence of colonization , or how these tiny primates spread over much of the globe at a time when global climate and sea levels were changing rapidly .
Before the fossils were found in Mississippi , scientists thought Teilhardina migrated from Asia to Western Europe before moving on to North America .
To date the Mississippi fossils , Beard took advantage of the idea that sea level remains constant across the globe at any given time .
By matching up erosion features caused by a falling sea level over long distances , Beard estimated the Mississippi fossils are older than Teilhardina fossils from Belgium and France .
That suggests the primates moved from Asia to North America and then to Western Europe .
The standard for dating fossils , however , relies on carbon isotopes , Gingerich said .
The study " inexplicably contains none of the now - standard evidence of carbon isotope values that define both the Paleocene - Eocene boundary and the carbon isotope excursion , " Gingerich said .
" Without this , it is really not possible to know how old the new primate from the ' Red Hot ' site is or what it means for mammalian biogeography . "
Beach bums
The coastlines of North America afforded certain advantages to the small primates .
For instance , during the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum , the coastlines became hot and wet , while the Rocky Mountain region became hot and dry .
The dry conditions would not have supported the lush trees and their yummy fruits required for Teilhardina and other closely related primates .
Beard found that Teilhardina magnoliana from Mississippi is both older and more primitive than another Teilhardina species previously found in Wyoming 's Bighorn Basin .
Since the fossil record at Bighorn is remarkably complete , Beard is confident that fossils older than those unearthed in Mississippi would have been found by now if they existed .
That means the earliest North American primates were restricted to coastal regions for thousands of years before they were able to colonize the Rocky Mountain region .
Later , precipitation would have increased to make Wyoming and other Rocky Mountain regions hospitable to the little primates .
Chill out
Though Teilhardina once occupied parts of the United States for tens of thousands of years , none of its distant relatives , such as monkeys , currently live here .
That 's because most primates are adapted to live only in wet , humid tropical or subtropical regions .
When Earth began cooling at the end of the Eocene about 35 million years ago , Teilhardina vanished from North America and Europe , Beard said .
Modern humans obviously are adapted to live in a variety of climates today , but at that time , warmer regions were critical layover spots for our primate ancestors .
Lucky for us , Beard says , some of these ancestors in the late Eocene had set up camp in warmer climes .
" You and I would n't be here talking about it if it were n't for the fact that primates by this time were able to colonize Central Africa and Southeast Asia , " Beard told LiveScience .
" As far as we know , those were the only two places that primates were able to survive this dramatic cooling event 35 million years ago . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Upcoming Treasury Department proposals to make the Federal Reserve the chief regulator of U.S. financial markets and give it sweeping new powers won praise on Saturday from the central bank and the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The U.S. Federal Reserve Building is pictured in Washington , March 18 , 2008 .

Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is expected to unveil a blueprint on Monday for fixing gaps in the U.S. financial market regulatory structure that have been exposed by the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis .
Lax regulation has been widely blamed for permitting a flood of inadequately documented loans to be made during the boom years of a U.S. housing market that has since soured and now threatens to drag the economy into a deep recession .
“ The Treasury ’s report presents a timely and thoughtful analysis and is an important first step in the complex task of modernizing our financial and regulatory architecture .
We look forward to working with the Congress and others to help develop a policy framework that will enhance financial and economic stability , ” a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said .
An executive summary of the Treasury proposals says a “ market stability regulator ” is needed and the Fed best fits that role , suggesting the central bank could use its control over interest rates as well as its ability to provide market liquidity to fulfill its functions .
STEP BACK AND MODERNIZE
When the current regulatory structure was put into place 75 years ago , “ our capital markets were in New York and very few people were invested and the number of products was limited , ” said David Hirschmann , president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness .
The financial world has changed dramatically since then , and over the years there has been a tendency to respond to market crises by adding new layers of regulation , he said .
“ It ’s become clear , I think to all , that the solution at this point is not to simply layer on more layers of regulation on a creaky outdated system , but really to step back and modernize the entire structure , ” Hirschmann said .
Among its recommendations , Treasury suggests merging the Securities and Exchange Commission , the U.S. markets watchdog , with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that oversees the activities of the futures market .
The subprime mortgage crisis provides “ further evidence , if more were needed , that financial services regulation in the United States needs to be better integrated among fewer agencies , with clearer lines of responsibility , ” SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said in a statement .
“ Just as systemic risk cannot be neatly parceled along outdated regulatory lines , the overarching objective of investor protection ca n’t be fully achieved if it fails to encompass derivatives , insurance , and new instruments that straddle today ’s regulatory divides , ” Cox said .
THE SAME FALLBACK
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama called the plans inadequate .
“ There are some good things about consolidating the multiple regulatory agencies , ” but now that the Fed has opened its discount window to investment banks it should hold them to the same reserve requirements as commercial banks , he said at a campaign stop in Johnston , Pennsylvania .
“ If I ’m a commercial bank right now I ’m still not clear why it is that investment banks are still able to do things I can’t do , are n’t subject to the same capital requirements and liquidity requirements that I am and yet they ’ve got the same fallback with the Fed , ” Obama said .
CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton warned it could be disastrous to hastily consolidate the CFTC and the SEC into one agency because of the different approaches they take to regulatory oversight .
The CFTC has “ an entirely different regulatory approach and the data confirms that it works , ” he said .
“ The SEC has a very proscriptive old - style approach to government .
Putting those two in the same room does n’t solve any problems .
In fact , I think it would create a calamity ” unless Congress takes its time and does a thorough overhaul of statutes authorizing the two agencies , Chilton said .

FIRE and flood are two of humanity 's worst nightmares .
People have , therefore , always sought to control them .
Forest fires are snuffed out quickly .
The flow of rivers is regulated by weirs and dams .
At least , that is how it used to be .
But foresters have learned that forests need fires to clear out the brush and even to get seeds to germinate .
And a similar revelation is now dawning on hydrologists .
Rivers — and the ecosystems they support — need floods .
That is why a man-made torrent has been surging down the Grand Canyon .
By Thursday March 6th it was running at full throttle , which was expected to be sustained for 60 hours .
Floods once raged through the canyon every year .
Snow from as far away as Wyoming would melt and swell the Colorado river to a flow that averaged around 1,500 cubic metres ( 50,000 cubic feet ) a second .
Every eight years or so , that figure rose to almost 3,500 cubic metres .
These floods infused the river with sediment , carved its beaches and built its sandbars .
However , in the four decades since the building of the Glen Canyon dam , just upstream of the Grand Canyon , the only sediment that it has collected has come from tiny , undammed tributaries .
Even that has not been much use as those tributaries are not powerful enough to distribute the sediment in an ecologically valuable way .
This lack of flooding has harmed local wildlife .
The humpback chub , for example , thrived in the rust - red waters of the Colorado .
Recently , though , its population has crashed .
At first sight , it looked as if the reason was that the chub were being eaten by trout introduced for sport fishing in the mid-20th century .
But trout and chub co-existed until the Glen Canyon dam was built , so something else is going on .
Steve Gloss , of the United States ' Geological Survey ( USGS ) , reckons that the chub 's decline is the result of their losing their most valuable natural defence , the Colorado 's rusty sediment .
The chub were well adapted to the poor visibility created by the thick , red water which gave the river its name , and depended on it to hide from predators .
Without the cloudy water the chub became vulnerable .
AP
Whoosh
And the chub are not alone .
In the years since the Glen Canyon dam was built , several species have vanished altogether .
These include the Colorado pike - minnow , the razorback sucker and the roundtail chub .
Meanwhile , aliens including fathead minnows , channel catfish and common carp , which would have been hard put to survive in the savage waters of the undammed canyon , have moved in .
So flooding is the obvious answer .
Unfortunately , it is easier said than done .
Floods were sent down the Grand Canyon in 1996 and 2004 and the results were mixed .
In 1996 the flood was allowed to go on too long .
To start with , all seemed well .
The floodwaters built up sandbanks and infused the river with sediment .
Eventually , however , the continued flow washed most of the sediment out of the canyon .
This problem was avoided in 2004 , but unfortunately , on that occasion , the volume of sand available behind the dam was too low to rebuild the sandbanks .
This time , the USGS is convinced that things will be better .
The amount of sediment available is three times greater than it was in 2004 .
So if a flood is going to do some good , this is the time to unleash one .
Even so , it may turn out to be an empty gesture .
At less than 1,200 cubic metres a second , this flood is smaller than even an average spring flood , let alone one of the mightier deluges of the past .
Those glorious inundations moved massive quantities of sediment through the Grand Canyon , wiping the slate dirty , and making a muddy mess of silt and muck that would make modern river rafters cringe .
The OLED displays look really good , and are bright and colorful , just like we'd hoped .
Key changes were instant ( or almost ) in Windows mode , but had a slight delay in Mac mode , where some key bindings were also little out of whack .
These are known issues , though , and are being worked on .
The keyboard itself is friggin massive , and very sturdy - feeling .
The thing is a tank .
Replacing keys is pretty easy , but larger keys are more difficult to pull off .
You 're really only intended to replace the standard - sized keys , so far as we can tell .
Typing on it , well , sucks .
We kind of hate to say it , but this thing more than likely wo n't replace what ever keyboard you 're writing your novel on -- it 's better off used as an absurdly configurable swiss army knife for tasks like gaming , Photoshop , or just about any other productivity app that does n't require a lot of typing .
Okay , why does typing on the Optimus suck , you ask ?
Well , although the keyboard uses mechanical switches and a lot of high quality components ( evident when we pulled off some keys ) , and there is some clicky tactility to keypresses , as a whole it just requires way too much force to depress keys .
And the larger the key , the more force is required , so enter is easier than space , but harder than tab .
Let 's put it this way , we sit around and type all day long and this thing wore us out in about 30 seconds to a minute .
Carpal sufferers , beware .
The Configurator is everything we hoped it'd be and more .
The ability to paint directly onto the keyboard maps with the image editor of your choice is most excellent .
Mapping keyboards to applications and conditions is ridiculously easy .
Not everything was working properly though , since we were testing early beta software .
It 's the damnedest thing : years after seeing the renders we 're actually finally writing this post on our very own Optimus Maximus .
We 've had ours for a few weeks for testing , but we were n't able to do a whole lot with it until we got some later firmware updates .
Here 's the preliminary report :
We 'll have some video in a bit .
We so can't wait for people to start getting their keyboards so we can benefit from their wacky layouts .
In order to combat the rising number of mobile phones smuggled into prisons , the UK Government is considering installing the Boss II scanner chair in every jail in England and Wales .
The Boss makes every inmate its bitch thanks to three sensitive sensors that can detect internally hidden metal items as small as a pin or a sim card .
Two Boss chairs are already being used in local prisons and have helped detect 21 mobile phones since April .

At first it may seem like a lot of trouble ( and pain ) to go through just to make a very foul - smelling phone call now and then , but it appears that the inmates can use the phones to make drug deals or intimidate witnesses on the outside .
All I know is that I would hate to be the guy at the prison who had to " retrieve " those phones .

The Milky Road
Credit & Copyright : Larry Landolfi Explanation : Inspired during a visit to Fort Davis , Texas , home of McDonald Observatory and dark night skies , photographer Larry Landolfi created this tantalizing fantasy view .
The composited image suggests the Milky Way is a heavenly extension of a deserted country road .
Of course , the name for our galaxy , the Milky Way ( in Latin , Via Lactea ) , does refer to its appearance as a milky band or path in the sky .
In fact , the word galaxy itself derives from the Greek for milk .
Visible on moonless nights from dark sky areas , though not so colorful as in this image , the glowing celestial band is due to the collective light of myriad stars along the plane of our galaxy , too faint to be distinguished individually .
The diffuse starlight is cut by dark swaths of obscuring galactic dust clouds .
At the beginning of the 17th century , Galileo turned his telescope on the Milky Way and announced it to be composed of innumerable stars .
Southern provinces are the source of most Afghan poppy production
Dr Marvin Weinbaum
The report says that the poppy cultivation helps Taleban insurgents obtain money and weapons .
The drug trade hinders progress towards economic stability and democracy , the report adds .
Afghanistan grows nearly all of the world 's opium poppy crop in an illegal trade worth billions of dollars .
" Eliminating narcotics cultivation and trafficking in Afghanistan will require a long - term national and international commitment , " said the State Department .
" The Afghan government must take decisive action against poppy cultivation soon to turn back the drug threat before its further growth and consolidation make it even more difficult to defeat . "
The report says production of the poppy was up more than a third on 2006 and good weather helped increase the yield of land already under cultivation .
In a report published at the beginning of February , the UN estimated that the amount of opium poppy cultivated in the volatile southern provinces would increase this year .
But the UN 's assessment also predicted the overall harvest would be " similar to or lower than " last year 's record - breaking level .
Poppy - free provinces
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) based its findings on interviews in almost 500 villages .
Afghanistan says it is making progress on curbing poppy cultivation by persuading farmers not to plant and through destroying poppy fields .
Acting counter - narcotics minister General Khodaidad , in an interview with Reuters news agency , said he was optimistic .
" We are doing better than last year and will have more poppy - free provinces this year , " he said .
The growth in Afghanistan 's opium crop began in earnest after the overthrow of the Taleban by US - led and Afghan forces in 2001 .
The New York Times announced today that beginning Monday , January 7 , Russian President Vladimir Putin will write a weekly column for its op - ed page .
“ We are thrilled to add Vladimir Putin 's distinctive voice to our op - ed page , ” said Andrew Rosenthal , editorial page editor .
“ He is a captivating leader and keen observer of the 21st - century political landscape .
His work will undoubtedly be provocative in this election year .
Plus , he threatened to have me poisoned if I did n't hire him . ”
Mr. Putin is currently the leader of Russia , a country sliding back into Soviet - era dictatorship .
The Russian president , formerly a member of the KGB and later the head of FSB ( a successor agency to the KGB ) , once contributed a weekly column to his high school newspaper The State .
Mr. Putin is also an origami enthusiast , a fan of the CW hit Gossip Girl ( " What can I say ?
I 'm hooked . " ) and believed to be behind the assassinations of at least 20 journalists since his presidency began in 2000 .
Critics say The Times ' decision underscores the paper 's increasing willingness to showcase views of those who are less concerned with the constraining nature of reality and truth .
But Rosenthal scoffed at such assertions .
“ I 'm not sure if I understand this weird fear of opposing views , " said Rosenthal .
" We have views on our op - ed page that are as thuggish or more so than Vladimir's . "
He added , " The idea that The New York Times is giving voice to a guy who is a serious , respected and brutal leader — and somehow that ’s a bad thing .
How intolerant is that ?
The whole point of the op - ed page is to air a variety of opinions . "
In further defending the hire , Rosenthal explained , " Look , Hitler and Stalin are dead .
Pol Pot , too .
Osama bin Laden tends toward the run-on sentence .
Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir has trouble meeting deadlines .
Musharraf told us he has too much on his plate right now to commit .
Charles Manson 's parole board has repeatedly declined our requests for Chuck to pen a column for us while serving out his life sentence .
Dick Cheney can't write a sentence without dropping an F - bomb .
And , well , let 's just say all options were off the table concerning President Bush . "
Following The Times ' decision to publish the NSA illegal wiretapping story in December 2005 , Mr. Putin reportedly asked President Bush why he did n't just " quietly silence the responsible editors of such an irredeemable , second - rate paper of record . "
In an interview with Politico.com yesterday , Putin said he was flattered to watch " the heads of liberal bloggers explode " over news of his hiring at The Times , but added , " I prefer to watch them explode literally , as in my own country . "
Please let me know if there are any new glitches .
There are a bunch of changes , many of them fixing bugs reported here .
The most dramatic change is probably the ability to use x.y and x!y as abbreviations for ( x y ) and ( x 'y ) respectively .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Initial indications show support for John McCain is increasing following his win in the Florida presidential primary and the subsequent withdrawal of Rudy Giuliani , who endorsed McCain .
Gallup Poll Daily tracking data from Jan. 28-30 shows McCain with a 15 - percentage point lead over Mitt Romney .
McCain is the top choice of 37 % of Republican voters nationwide , compared with 22 % for second - place Mitt Romney .
In Wednesday 's release , the gap between McCain and Romney was 11 points ( 32 % and 21 % , respectively ) .
Mike Huckabee is holding steady in third place at 17 % in the current numbers .
Giuliani was included in the Jan. 28 and 29 interviewing , but removed from the ballot last night .
The one - night interviews from Jan. 30 -- with Giuliani out of the race -- show a substantial increase in McCain 's support , suggesting his lead will likely expand in the coming days .
Wednesday night 's interviewing also was the first conducted following McCain 's win Tuesday in Florida .
The latest Democratic numbers show Hillary Clinton with a 43 % to 39 % advantage over Barack Obama among Democratic voters nationwide .
That four - point lead is the narrowest since early January , and it is a continuation of gains by Obama .
The impact of John Edwards ' exit from the Democratic race is less clear .
Wednesday night 's numbers ( the first with Edwards excluded from the ballot ) show no clear indication that either candidate is benefiting disproportionately .
Clinton and Obama will debate in California tonight , which could affect Democrats ' support for the two candidates going into the weekend before Super Tuesday 's primaries and caucuses .
-- Jeff Jones
Methodology : Gallup is interviewing 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The results reported here are based on combined data from Jan. 28 - 30 , 2008 , including interviews with 1,020 Republican and Republican - leaning voters and 1,286 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters .
For results based on these samples , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
It seems like this is the summer of multicore panic .
I ca n’t open a technical magazine without some pundit declaring that our current programming paradigms are useless when running on new multicore CPU architectures .
Venerable analyst John Dvorak , who generally actually understands what he is writing about , coughed up this mess ( with minor excisions for brevity ) :
Nobody wants to face the fact that Linux , Mac OS X , Microsoft Windows XP , and Vista are based on OS designs that are as old as the hills …
Meanwhile , none of these operating systems has the power to make multicore chips work as advertised .
In the end , these chips are little more than novelties .
Intel actually has the gall to claim that its extra cores can save power by automatically shutting down when they ’re not in use .
This just means they ’ll be shut down most of the time .
If the software could take advantage of these extra cores , there would n’t be any need to shut them down … .
Why ca n’t operating systems simply dedicate extra cores to housekeeping chores and cool background tasks ?
It ’s simple enough to work .
Here are a few choice uses for core dedication .
There are six of them , since we may see a six - core chip on the road ahead .
According to this piece originally published in in Wired , things are even more dire than that :
The problem is that many software applications were n’t written for chips with multiple cores , and the hardware is advancing so fast that the software runs the risk of being left behind .
“ You can imagine a scenario where people stop buying laptops and PCs because we can’t figure this out , ” said David Patterson , a computer - architecture expert and computer science professor at the University of California , Berkeley .
People are going to stop buying computers ?
Panic indeed !
Faulty Intelligence
This chorus of impending disaster reminds me of the build - up to Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) .
We ’re hearing that there is a huge threat out there , and if we do n’t do something quick , life is going to get real bad .
Companies like Intel and Microsoft are investing in new compiler technology , other people are suggesting we need to completely change our programming paradigms .
DDJ has set Herb Sutter loose with a concurrency column .
Are the End of Days upon us ?
But perhaps predictably , just like with OIF , the hard evidence just is n’t there .
My new dual core system seems to run quite a bit faster than the machine it replaced .
A similar quad core system runs even faster .
Although John Dvorak seems to think those extra cores are doing nothing but enriching the electric utilities , something good must be happening .
If there is trouble headed this way , it does n’t seem to be here yet .
Is it as close as some think ?
The First Dose of Reality
First let ’s look at the short - term predictions of doom .
Dvorak says
Meanwhile , none of these operating systems has the power to make multicore chips work as advertised .
In fact , John is off base here .
Linux , OS/X , and Windows have all had good support for Symmetrical Multiprocessing ( SMP ) for some time , and the new multicore chips are designed to work in this environment .
Each core looks like a tightly - coupled CPU , and all of these modern operating systems are adept at using them .
Just as an example , using the spiffy Sysinternals Process Explorer , I see that my Windows XP system has 48 processes with 446 threads .
Windows O/S is happily farming those 446 threads out to both cores on my system as time becomes available .
If I had four cores , we could still keep all of them busy .
If I had eight cores , my threads would still be distributed among all of them .
Modern programs tend to be moderately multithreaded , with individual threads dedicated to the GUI , to user I /O , to socket I/O , and often to computation .
Multicore CPUs take advantage of this quite well .
And we do n’t need any new technology to make sure multi- threaded programs are well - behaved - these techniques are pretty well understood , and in use in most software you use today .
Modern languages like Java support threads and various concurrency issues right out of the box .
C++ requires non-standard libraries , but all modern C++ environments worth their salt deal with multithreading in a fairly sane way .
What Multicore Does Right
In fact , going from one core to two or four is not only not a disaster , it does a great good job of addressing one big problem with many programs : the CPU - bound thread .
Good examples of threads of this variety include :
Unzipping a 100 MB file
Performing some complex operation on a 10 Megapixel photo
The rendering thread in a 3D game engine
Spreadsheet recalcuation
In the single - core days , a program that was executing a task like this would really knock a system to its knees .
The O/S is generally smart enough to make sure that the CPU - bound task does n’t get all the processor time , but the inordinate load does make it really hard for things like the UI to keep up .
You ’ve seen it - you have an hourglass cursor , the screen is redrawing at a . 1 fps rate , and you ca n’t pull up a system menu to save your life .
On a multicore system , the situation gets a lot better .
The task doing heavy computation might be tying up one core , but the O/S can continue running UI and other tasks on other cores , and this really helps with overall responsiveness .
At the same time , the computationally intensive thread is getting fewer context switches , and hopefully getting its job done faster .
The Worst Case Future of Multicore
So two cores are better than one - nobody should be arguing that point , except possibly John Dvorak .
Let ’s suppose that Moore ’s Law continues to apply to transistor size , and that Intel and AMD do nothing with that extra space but lay down new cores .
If that ’s the case , we should see a core quadrupling every three or four years .
In this future view , by 2010 we should have the first eight - core systems .
In 2014 , we ’re up to 32 cores .
By 2017 , we ’ve reached an incredible 128 core CPU on a desktop machine .
So what are things going to be like in 2010 with my eight - core system ?
First of all , it seems only natural that I ’m going to have more processes with more threads running .
Furthermore , with the eye - candy arms race between the three competing operating systems in full swing , you can bet there are going to be more threads that need massive amounts of CPU time .
I ’ll have more monitor real - estate , more pixels , and will probably have more media access .
All of these things are going to tie up those eight cores just fine , using today ’s programming paradigms with little or no change .
It ’s a little harder to see this system scaling well to 32 cores , and at 128 cores it definitely starts to fall apart .
We just are n’t going to have enough active threads on a system - many of those cores will be in Dvorak ’s hypothetical idle state .
So this may be when we start needing a new paradigm .
Of course , it ’s pretty hard to predict the real path of both hardware and software architectures ten years out .
Things like the conversion to a worldwide networked infrastructure , the universal adoption of GUI desktops , a fairly quick changeover to true multitasking operating systems were all changes that seem obvious in retrospect but were n’t so obvious a few years ahead of time .
Likewise , we speculate that silicon fabrication technologies will progress at a steady rate , but the overall architecture of desktop PCs are influenced by many unpredictable factors .
And remember one thing about Moore ’s law : “ past performance is no indication of future returns . ”
Just because it has held up extraordinarily well for virtually the lifetime of IC fabrication , it was an educated guess to begin with , not a Hari Seldon - like map of future technology .
So making big changes to our software development systems based on a 10 - year horizon is pretty risky .
It 's Worse Than That
Assuming we have 128 - core machines in years , the doomsayers feel that we need a new , massively parallel approach to software .
As much work as possible needs to be spread out among multiple CPUs .
Further , our current techniques for communicating between threads are judged to be impractical .
We ’re told that we need lock - free transaction systems that allow these highly distributed algorithms to communicate freely and efficiently .
Okay , if we concede that , then we have a problem .
Let me take you bake in time to my tender undergraduate days in the late 1970s at the University of Virginia School of Engineering .
In a class on computer architectures , we were having a long discussion about parallel algorithms , which back then were being used on the current generation of supercomputers , such as the Cray - 1 .
I speculated to my young and optimistic professor , Alfred Weaver , that perhaps the human mind just was n’t cut out for designing parallel algorithms - maybe we ’re just built linear .
Dr. Weaver was n’t dogmatic about this , but speculated that we did n’t really have much experience with that frame of mind , so it was too early to rule it out .
He also pointed out that even if we did n’t have the ability to parallelize linear algorithms , it may well be that advanced compilers could do the job for us .
Thirty years later , I ’d say programmers are n’t thinking in terms of parallelism any more than they were back then .
We have separate threads of execution , but they might as well be separate tasks - not parallel distributions of one algorithm .
And of course , thirty years ago computer generated parallelism was just one of many technologies that was just around the corner .
Another was artificial intelligence .
And of course , continuous natural speech recognition .
Ah , we were dreamers back then .
Well , artificial intelligence is still just around the corner , and some people think it may be one of those problems that we might have to concede we are n’t going to solve .
Could generation of code for a massively multicore environment be just as fanciful ?
Microsoft says in recent EE
Times article that we ’re at least ten years out from having proven compilers and computer architecture to be massively parallel .
( This article gives a nice detailed roadmap of what people think we really need to do in order to take advantage of the multicore future .
It ’s not pretty . )
If Microsoft says something is ten years out , we know that it is either :
Never going to happen
Will take at least ten years
Will be done by a competitor next year
I ’m inclined to believe something between the first two options .
This is just a really hard problem , and if it takes ten years to get the tools ready , it ’s going to be thirty years before the application base is converted .
I mean , are you ready to start writing all your programs in a functional programming language ?
Probably not .
I just learned to spell Haskell .
What , Me Worry ?
So far I ’ve said that we ’re okay for the near term , but the far term is going to be gloomy if we have huge numbers of cores .
But now I ’m going to tell you that we should n’t be worried about the far term either .
Yes , everything is going to be okay .
First and most important , Intel and AMD do n’t operate in a vacuum .
They are producing dual - and quad - core machines today because they give nice performance gains .
Intel knows darned well that if they produced a 128 - core machine today ( which they could probably do , for a price ) they wouldn ’ t sell any , because we ca n’t take advantage of that technology .
So Intel , AMD , Microsoft , and the other big players will be engaging in an interesting dance .
Some steps will be development of new hardware , but other steps will be investments intended to pay off with new compilers , languages , and paradigms designed to work with that new hardware .
And if those investments do n’t work , and the software does n’t come through , will the world come to an end ?
No .
Instead of jumping from 16 to 32 cores , Intel will accept smaller performance gains by cranking up clock speeds , boosting the instruction set , making bigger caches , or whatever it takes .
Conclusion
Our industry press thrives on a good crisis .
The switch to multicore processors has presented the brain trust with the opportunity to drum up a convincing one , and they have n’t let us down .
Just try to take it with a grain of salt .
The crises we ’ve had in the past have mostly been resolved with boring , step - wise evolution , and this one will be no different .
Maybe 15 or 20 years from now we ’ll be writing code in some new transaction based language that spreads a program effortlessly across hundreds of cores .
Or , more likely , we ’ll still be writing code in C++ , Java , and .
Net , and we ’ll have clever tools that accomplish the same result .
Either way , the beat will go one .

A 2001 car accident that left Steven Hailey badly injured was the beginning of his continuing medical and financial calamity .
While Hailey was still recovering in his Cypress home and with medical bills topping $ 450,000 , Blue Shield of California suddenly canceled his coverage .
That forced the former self - employed machinist to wait so long for surgery to repair an injured urethra , he says in a lawsuit against Blue Shield , that his bladder stopped working .
Since then , he has depended on an implanted catheter that drains his urine into a bag strapped to his body .
Now , Hailey says , he and his wife , Cindy , ca n’t afford the care he needs because Blue Shield began garnisheeing her wages to recoup more than $ 104,000 it had paid for Steven ’s medical care before canceling him .
The outcome of the Haileys ’ case against Blue Shield could change the way insurers do business in California and influence reform efforts by state regulators and lawmakers .
As the first case of its kind to reach an appellate court in California , it will test the legality of retroactive health policy cancellations , a controversial industrywide practice that has driven canceled consumers into debt and forced them to forgo needed medical treatment .
Blue Shield contends it was within its rights to cancel the Haileys because they failed to disclose Steven ’s true weight and full medical history when the couple applied for coverage nearly seven years ago .
Blue Shield says it would not have covered Steven in the first place had it known that his weight was 285 pounds , not the 240 listed on the application , or that he had been treated for headaches , hypertension and other conditions .
The Haileys say that Cindy made an honest mistake when she filled out the application and that state law bans the rescission of health coverage without evidence that the policyholder intentionally misrepresented his or her medical history .
Blue Shield disagrees , saying the law allows it to cancel policies for any misrepresentation , even inadvertent ones .
Whatever the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana decides could affect hundreds of suits challenging such cancellations as illegal and unfair .
Such retroactive rescissions have come under scrutiny in recent months because of the hardships they create for patients .
A Los Angeles Times article detailed the turmoil of a Murrieta family whose daughter had an aggressive cancer - like tumor , a Riverside couple who sold their home to pay off medical debts and a Van Nuys small - business owner who was maxing out credit cards to get therapy for his disabled infant twins .
State regulators recently levied a $ 1 - million fine against Blue Cross of California , the state ’s biggest health insurer , over retroactive cancellations .
Regulators say they are investigating other carriers , including Blue Shield .
But regulatory actions have failed to stop the cancellations , and none of the lawsuits has resolved the dispute over whether such actions violate the law .
The Orange County court is poised to do that .
Noting the “ broad public interest ” in the test case , the appellate court invited consumer advocates , regulators and industry representatives to weigh in , an unusual move suggesting that the panel sees more at stake than just the case at hand .
The court asked for briefs on the law and public policy “ against improper health policy cancellations and post - claims underwriting . ”
“ They want to know : How big is this problem ? ” said Amy Bach , executive director of United Policyholders , a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco , which plans to submit a brief .
“ Clearly , the court is smelling something bigger . ”
Blue Shield is one of the state ’s largest sellers of individual policies , the type of coverage at issue .
Unlike with employment - based group coverage , which is issued to all group members regardless of health , carriers in California and some other states are allowed to reject applicants for individual policies based on their medical histories .
Blue Shield says it was conducting a routine and legal claims review when it discovered that the couple ’s application had purportedly shaved 45 pounds off Steven ’s weight and failed to disclose his health history .
The health plan says it immediately mailed the couple a letter rescinding coverage .
But the letter did n’t reach the Haileys before a vendor showed up at their Cypress home and repossessed Steven ’s wheelchair and adjustable hospital bed .
The Haileys , both now 45 , declined to discuss the case on a lawyer ’s advice .
But in court documents , they accuse Blue Shield of launching a secret investigation while Steven was hospitalized to search for an excuse to dump them and avoid paying his bills .
The Haileys say they never tried to conceal anything .
In a sworn deposition , Cindy testified that she was confused by the application and mistakenly thought it was seeking only her medical history .
Consumer advocates say the forms routinely trip up people such as Cindy because they use a single set of medical history questions for all family members .
“ I ’ve seen that happen repeatedly , ” said William Shernoff , a Claremont lawyer who represents policyholders but not the Haileys .
The error is so common , Shernoff said , that he is trying to persuade insurers to use separate medical questionnaires for each member of a family seeking coverage .
The Haileys do n’t fit the profile of people who insurers typically say have an incentive to lie about preexisting conditions to obtain coverage .
They could have gotten guaranteed group coverage through Cindy ’s employer .
They said they turned to Blue Shield because a physician Cindy wanted to continue seeing was not in her employer ’s health plan .
The physician was in Blue Shield ’s network , so , in November 2000 , she filled out the application , listing only her treatment for a digestive condition .
Blue Shield issued coverage in December .
Steven was injured in March 2001 .
The carrier rescinded coverage in June .
Blue Shield says its application ’s request for information on all applicants was clear .
The carrier also says the law allows insurers to take applications at face value .
Anything else would be unworkable , said John LeBlanc , a lawyer for Blue Shield .
“ If the company were required to investigate every response on an application , despite what the applicant says ... the burden would be placed on the insurance company to investigate everything , ” he said .
Cindy Ehnes , director of the California Department of Managed Health Care , which regulates health plans , recently sided with consumers , saying a 1993 state law clearly bars insurers from rescinding policies unless they can prove a policyholder engaged in “ willful misrepresentation ” on an application .
Ehnes ’ office plans to file a friend - of - the - court brief at the Haileys ’ request and is drafting regulations aimed at curbing cancellations .
Her proposal is expected to require carriers , among other things , to develop clear and simple applications and to limit how much medical history they ask applicants to accurately remember .
Ruling without trial in the Haileys ’ lawsuit against Blue Shield , Orange County Superior Court Judge Corey Cramin upheld the cancellation in 2005 and ordered the couple to repay the carrier $ 104,192 -- the amount the carrier says it spent on Steven ’s care before dropping him .
Before the accident , Steven owned and operated a small plant that made hydraulic presses for the ceramics industry .
The disruption in coverage forced him to wait several months longer than his physician desired for the operation to repair his urethra , the Haileys say .
Often in pain and unable to work , Steven and his wife moved to Broken Arrow , Okla . , to be closer to relatives who help care for him .
Blue Shield obtained an order from an Oklahoma judge to garnishee Cindy ’s wages from her job as a staffing manager for a temporary employment agency .
Blue Shield ’s cut -- $ 680 a month -- reduced her monthly take - home pay to $ 1,714 and , the Haileys say , made it impossible to pay for all the medical care and therapy that Steven needs .
They “ are barely hanging on , ” Michael Nutter , one of their lawyers , wrote , urging the Orange County appellate court to stop the garnishment .
Blue Shield argued that if the couple was so hard up , they could file for bankruptcy .
The appellate court sided with the Haileys in December , issuing a temporary halt to the garnishment .

Over a 25 year period , Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky made just seven feature films and three student shorts , yet his cinematic work stands out as one of the most significant contributions to moving image history .
In films such as Solaris , Mirror and Andrei Rublev , Tarkovsky dealt thematically with the notion of memory , childhood and dreams and became a master of the long , unedited shot and distinct formalistic approach to filmmaking .
Many studies of his work have also observed the links between his films and the visual arts .
Black Dog Publishing is behind a new , comprehensive volume dedicated to his life ’s work and we have an exclusive extract to present here on the CR blog .
The following essay , by Mikhail Romadin ( the art director on Solaris ) , looks at the relationship between Tarkovsky ’s films and painting .
Impeachment is in the Constitution
for a reason !
Impeach for PEACE & Security !
The Bush Regime of fear factor tactics
seem to be ramping up the rhetoric to AirStrike Iran !
There are many signals indicating this could be coming soon - IMPEACHMENT hearings will put a STOP to this evil empire .

Printing money does not recessions reverse .
Can the President print enough paper money to make us all Trillionaires ?
It ’s possible — at least on paper .
Then we could all run around like a bunch of Lottery Winners — or Congressmen .
When government prints more money it devalues the rest of the paper in circulation .
More paper money means the money in your pocket is worth less and less .
More electronic money means the money in your electronic bank account is worth less and less .
This is not a mystery .
All fiat currencies eventually go up in smoke because too many people get the idea that they can be one of the insiders riding on the backs of the unwashed masses .
Self - preservation and self - development are common aspirations among all people .
And if everyone enjoyed the unrestricted use of his faculties and the free disposition of the fruits of his labor , social progress would be ceaseless , uninterrupted , and unfailing .
But there is also another tendency that is common among people .
When they can , they wish to live and prosper at the expense of others .
This is no rash accusation .
Nor does it come from a gloomy and uncharitable spirit .
The annals of history bear witness to the truth of it : the incessant wars , mass migrations , religious persecutions , universal slavery , dishonesty in commerce , and monopolies .
This fatal desire has its origin in the very nature of man — in that primitive , universal , and insuppressible instinct that impels him to satisfy his desires with the least possible pain .
— Frédéric Bastiat
It remains to be seen whether George W. Bush is a cynical insider or completely unaware of the fundamentals of economics .
Since his behavior patterns appear narcissistic I would tend to think he sees himself as a powerful insider .
So I would give just a slight edge to narcissism over incompetence .
It is a tough call .
He seems possessed of both .
I can almost hear him saying , " How can the government run out of money when we can always print more — or enter new balances into our computer systems ? "
Is n’t that what he wants you to believe ?
When the big giveaway day comes he will probably appear on the Telescreen and try to make us all feel as though he is taking it out of his own pocket .
Perhaps he will suggest we buy some cake with our windfall .
The dollar does n’t fall all by itself — it has to be pushed .
Increasing the money supply is a de facto tax against all the other money in the world that is held in FRNs [ Federal Reserve Notes — Commonly but Erroneously called Dollars ] .
Paper Money is unconstitutional for the United States according to Madison ’s Notes on the Constitutional Convention and numerous other authorities .
A Constitutionally - minded president would be right behind Representative Ron Paul advocating for the Abolition of The Federal Reserve Banking System and the return to Lawful Money of Gold and Silver .
He might also ask the Congress to replace the IRS with something that might be dubbed : " External Revenue Service . "
The so - called dollar is sliding fast since it is losing its grip as the reserve currency for world oil markets .
Gold and Silver " backing " of the currency is only a vague memory .
The foreign policy of " Take our paper for your oil or we will bomb you back into the Stone Age , " is losing its charm .
The world is wising up to monetary science and some of them seem to be getting a bit weary of being shaken down .
Mises is leaving his mark .
What a tremendous opportunity this represents for all of us !
Now is the time to Reinstate the lawful monetary and foreign policy principles of the Founders and Framers that are being promoted by only one presidential candidate : The Honorable United States Representative Ron Paul of Texas .
I am so thankful that the smirks of John McCain cannot distract Dr. Paul for one instant .
He just keeps talking Liberty , Law and Constitution .
Go Ron Paul !
How can we help speed up the renewal process ?
What actions can best effect a restoration of American prestige and credibility on the world stage ?
If those we have elected are not obeying the law and the Constitution they must be removed and replaced — and the sooner the better .
This goes for every government servant from top to bottom .
Would having Impeachment proceedings on the docket curb the abuses or hubris of the current Administration ?
There is but one way to find out : Start the Impeachment Proceedings .
Google the term " Impeach " to see what ’s already in the Ether .
People all over the Web are contemplating the absolute necessity of Impeachment .
This includes our allies and our enemies as well as those nations who are wisely unaligned .
The Congress can probably Impeach based on indigestion if it so chooses .
They have the uncontrollable Constitutional authority .
The Smokescreen involving 400 or so " historians and scholars " who claimed Clinton could Not be Impeached over the Monica Lewinski Affair were engaging in sophomoric sophistry and proving their own lack of professionalism and ethics .
Perhaps those same historians and scholars would advocate a Constitutional Amendment protecting illicit sex in the Oval Office ?
How could the Framers have been so shortsighted — so unscholarly ?
Could Monica have been a Red Herring ?
Is there a test for that ?
Are there better reasons to Impeach and Remove ?
Clinton got plenty of people killed under suspicious circumstances — and especially at times when he was under political pressure at home .
Only days after several cruise missile barrages the Arab Street was calling them the " Monica Missiles . "
The Clinton Impeachment should have been based on answering for the unlawful deaths of our service personnel and innocent civilians — and it may have risen to the level of Felony Murder .
He should have been in the witness stand saying , " That depends on what the definition of u2018 Murder ’ is . "
Then Bubba could have perjured himself real good !
The important thing is to Impeach early and often — and for all the best Constitutional reasons .
Our Impeachment skills are rusty because we have n’t exercised them as we should .
Getting service personnel killed and maimed under false pretenses is serious business .
Could it be a High Crime ?
It is certainly No Misdemeanor .
It is curious to me that these reasons did not seem to disgust us more than the Commander in Chief having his way with Monica in the Oval Office .
Someone apparently knew what would titillate the National Enquirer readership just long enough .
Let ’s consider the Constitutional Clauses on Impeachment :
The House of Representatives shall … have the sole Power of Impeachment .
— Article I , Section 2 , Clause 5
The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments .
When sitting for that Purpose , they shall be on Oath or Affirmation .
When the President of the United States is tried , the Chief Justice shall preside : And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present .
— Article I Section 3 , Clause 6
The Chief Justice presides but does not decide .
The Senate decides by not less than the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present .
Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office , and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of Honor , Trust or Profit under the United States : but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment , Trial , Judgment and Punishment , according to Law . — Article I , Section 3 , Clause 7 .
The Presidential Pardoning power cannot trump the Impeachment powers of the Congress :
The President shall … have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States , except in Cases of Impeachment .
— Article II , Section 2 , Clause 1
The President , Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States , shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors .
— Article II , Section 4 , Clause 1
Members of the House and Senate cannot be removed by Impeachment and Conviction — because the Legislature , being answerable to the People and the States , is lawfully Above the Executive and Judicial Branches in these matters — and We The People are Above them all .
There is No Jury for Impeachment — which also affirms the absolute nature of the Congressional prerogative :
The Trial of all Crimes , except in Cases of Impeachment , shall be by Jury .
— Article III , Section 2 , Clause 3
So , the House and the Senate together hold an uncontrollable monopoly on Impeachment powers under the Constitution .
This means , that , if they use these powers unjustly , our ultimate recourse would be to vote them out — but only after the fact .
There are no provisions for punishing the Congress for bad Impeachments — just as there are no provisions for punishing Juries for their verdicts when they rule according to their consciences and in the teeth of the law .
The Jury has a Negative on bad laws — and the Congress has a Negative on defective Presidents , Judges , and other Civil Officers of the United States .
Now if Washington DC were not under a Dark Cloud of Collusion this would mean the House and Senate would quickly rein in a Warmonger President or a pack of Constitution - Hating Supreme Court Justices .
It would be unthinkable for the Congress to abrogate its authority to Declare War .
In fact , the Congress cannot lawfully delegate any of its authorities to another Branch .
If the House will not oil and tune its Impeachment Machine and the Senate will not stand at the ready to Convict and Remove , we are stuck with a clogged toilet that will not flush .
Criminals in all three branches of government will continue to have their way with our liberties .
This main check on power has not been in working order for most of our history as a nation , e.g. Abraham Lincoln was a bloody tyrant who should have been Impeached and Removed long before he was assassinated .
Neither can we afford to ignore the complementary problem of Congressional Recidivism .
Once elected the main goal becomes getting reelected .
We have wandered a long way from the original vision of citizen / statesmen who would serve for a brief period with only modest compensation and then return to the ruling class : We The People .
This is still an Enforcement problem — and it is Never a good idea to make more laws when you ca n’t enforce the primary law that would have solved or prevented the problem .
Enforcement problems occur when the People have lost their knowledge of political affairs and their political will .
Jefferson was frustrated by this problem during the early days of the Republic :
Having found from experience that impeachment is an impracticable thing , a mere scarecrow , [ the Judiciary ] consider themselves secure for life .
— Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Ritchie , 1820 .
ME 15:297
I do not charge the judges with wilful and ill - intentioned error ; but honest error must be arrested where its toleration leads to public ruin .
As for the safety of society , we commit honest maniacs to Bedlam ; so judges should be withdrawn from their bench whose erroneous biases are leading us to dissolution .
It may , indeed , injure them in fame or in fortune ; but it saves the republic , which is the first and supreme law .
— Thomas Jefferson : Autobiography , 1821 .
ME 1:122
In his 1828 Elementary Catechism on the Constitution of the United States , Arthur J. Stansbury discussed the Stimulus Package for Presidential Scofflaws :
Q69 : May ever the President of the United States be thus impeached and punished ?
A69 : Yes .
In this free and happy country no man is so great as to be above the law .
The laws are supreme ; to them all persons , from the President of the United States to the poorest and the meanest beggar , must alike submit .
This is our glory .
Let every youthful American exult that he has no master but the law ; let him mark the man who would change this happy state of things as an enemy of his country ; and above all let him remember that as soon as he himself breaks the law , he becomes himself that enemy .
Whoever violates the law helps to weaken its force , and , as far as he disobeys , does what in him lies to destroy it ; but he who honors and obeys the law strengthens the law , and thereby helps to preserve the freedom and happiness of his country .
In some governments it is held that “ the king can do no wrong ; ” here we know no king but the law , no monarch but the constitution ; we hold that every man may do wrong ; the higher he is in office , the more reason there is that he be obliged to answer for his conduct ; and a great officer , if treacherous , is a great criminal , so that he ought to be made to suffer a great and exemplary punishment .
While we may disagree with Stansbury based on finer points of jurisdiction , which is to say , the Laws of the United States are ultimately Under We The People [ we have no king whatsoever ] and Over our Government Servants who take an Oath to submit to such provisions as apply to their limited , delegated authorities , we can agree with him that the President of the United States should be an Exemplar of Obedience to the Letter of the Law and the Constitution , and , that , if he violates either , he becomes an Exemplary Criminal who should suffer extreme consequences and ignominy .
If ever there were a Man Without A Country , it should be any president who violates his Oath of office and commits premeditated Felonies in the name of the People of the United States by using our armed services personnel as pawns to be spent like a Fiat Stimulus Package .
Tragically , most Americans are so ignorant of law and politics , not to mention economics , that they may never know they are the object of such unadulterated condescension .
It may not be so much that they despise their Birthright .
They just need to know more about their inheritance so they may be able to reclaim and hold on to it .
They can and will be educated .
Take heart !
The majority has never ruled for long .
Those of us who support Ron Paul because he supports Liberty and the Rule of Law will continue to learn and teach — increasing the potential that more and more Americans will be qualified to choose the appropriate Stimulus Package for those who would waste and destroy our lives , our property , and our liberty .
I have little doubt that most of you reading this column are awake and alert to the present dangers .
But we all need to be encouraged and reenergized .
So I will once again quote Sam Adams , Father of the American Revolution :
It does not take a majority to prevail , but rather an irate , tireless minority , keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men .
If you think Ron Paul cannot make a difference ; if you think puny little you and me cannot make a difference , please take a little time and read about Sam Adams , the man for whom friends had to purchase a decent suit so he could attend the Continental Congress .
If Sam would not despair we certainly have no such right .
He was the tenth child of his parents — and one of only two to live past the age of three .
His parents were Pro-Life and Sam was Pro-Liberty .
He was later to be called " The Grand Incendiary . "
Apparently those brushfires got out of hand .
Please note :
It has recently been determined by certain eminent scholars and historians that Samuel Adams never had a Broadband Internet connection .
The Best of Bill Huff
by hilzoy
From the NYT ( h/t CharleyCarp ) :
But in 2003 , Mr. Hekmati was arrested by American forces in southern Afghanistan when , senior Afghan officials here contend , he was falsely accused by his enemies of being a Taliban commander himself .
For the next five years he was held at the American military base in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , where he died of cancer on Dec. 30 . (...)
Several high - ranking officials in President Hamid Karzai ’s government say Mr. Hekmati ’s detention at Guantánamo was a gross mistake .
They were mentioned by Mr. Hekmati in his hearings and could have vouched for him .
Records from the hearings show that only a cursory effort was made to reach them .
Two of those officials were men Mr. Hekmati had helped escape from the Taliban ’s top security prison in Kandahar in 1999 : Ismail Khan , now the minister of energy ; and Hajji Zaher , a general in the Border Guards .
Both men said they appealed to American officials about Mr. Hekmati ’s case , but to no effect .
“ What he did was very important for all Afghan people who were against the Taliban , ” Hajji Zaher said of Mr. Hekmati ’s role in organizing his prison break .
“ He was not a man to take to Guantánamo . ” (...)
The 1999 escape was a deep humiliation for the Taliban government , which blocked roads and searched houses across the country for days afterward and offered $ 1 million for the capture of the escapees .
Two of Mr. Hekmati ’s relatives were badly tortured by the Taliban after the prison break as the Taliban looked for information .
Two of the men Mr. Hekmati freed , Mr. Khan and Hajji Zaher , returned to the battlefield to lead forces against the Taliban .
They both received significant American support in 2001 and worked with Special Forces units .
A third man who escaped with them was another commander of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance , Gen. Mohammed Qasim .
According to Mr. Hekmati ’s account in his hearing in September 2005 , he organized the escape because he opposed the Taliban ’s “ ruthlessness and injustice . ” (...)
The men escaped to Iran , where Mr. Khan provided Mr. Hekmati and his family with a house and financial support in return for his daring .
Mr. Hekmati said he returned to Afghanistan only in 2002 , after the Taliban were toppled and Mr. Karzai ’s interim government was installed .
Within a year , he was arrested . "
The Catastrophic Military Occupation of Iraq is Rarely Described Accurately in the U.S. Media
Dahr Jamail ’s MidEast Dispatches are essential reading for anyone who wants to understand what is happening in Iraq .
( You can sign up on the site to receive his reports via email . )
Dahr has spent a total of 8 months in occupied Iraq as one of only a few independent US journalists in the country .
In the MidEast , Dahr has also has reported from Syria , Lebanon and Jordan .
Jamail writes for the Inter Press Service , Asia Times and many other outlets .
Dahr Jamail ’s current book , Beyond the Green Zone : Dispatches from an Unembedded Journalist in Occupied Iraq , can be purchased on - line or in book stores .
Kevin Zeese : Compare you experiences in Iraq with how the media generally described the events .
Do you think most people , Americans in particular , are getting an accurate picture of what has occurred in Iraq ?
Is occurring in Iraq ?
Dahr Jamal : From the invasion until now , with few exceptions the so - called mainstream media in the West has portrayed a drastically different picture of what Iraq is really like under U.S. military rule .
We regularly see stories from the military point of view , and rarely , if ever , how catastrophic the occupation has made life for the average Iraqi .
Thus , most people are in no way getting an accurate picture of what has occurred , or what is occurring today .
For example , how many mainstream outlets cite the only scientific survey which has been done to tally the number of Iraqis killed ?
Known as the Lancet report , and conducted by scientists from John ’s Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health in conjunction with Iraqi doctors from al - Mustanceriya University in Baghdad , it found that 655,000 Iraqis had died as the direct result of the U.S. - led invasion and occupation .
Over 90 percent of the people they tracked had death certificates provided by family members to the researchers .
Yet the mainstream media does not cite this survey , which was authenticated by British Government .
Why not ?
This is but one example of countless examples .
KZ : You were in Fallujah , describe how long , when and under what circumstances .
I understand you were there right after the four Blackwater operatives were killed in Fallujah ?
I ’ve heard commentators describe the U.S. role in Fallujah in heroic terms , like something out of a World War II movie .
How do you see the role of the U.S. military in Fallujah ?
DJ : I went into Fallujah several times ; first - before the siege to see that the military had an ongoing policy of collectively punishing the cities residents by cutting water and electricity everytime they were attacked .
Then during April I went as the siege was in progress .
After the siege ended I returned several times in May to chronicle what happened .
Later , during the November siege , I covered it by interviewing doctors and refugees from the city .
What the U.S. military did in that city , under orders from the White House , likens it to a modern Guernica .
Most of the city was destroyed during the second attack - 70 % of it was destroyed .
Restricted and illegal weapons like cluster bombs and white phosphorous were used by the military .
Marine snipers were shooting anything that moved in the city .
Horrible war crimes took place there .
Yet , again , the corporate media portrayed it as a heroic action to free the people of the city from fighters , yet it was mostly the people from the city themselves fighting to defend their homes , and their city , from the military .
Of all I saw in Iraq , Fallujah stands as the worst action the U.S. military took , aside from the initial invasion of the country .
KZ : Were women , children and the elderly being killed ?
Was it accidental ?
Intentional ?
The U.S. military talks about precision bombs , what kinds of weapons was the U.S. using ?
DJ : From what I saw in April , at a small clinic inside Fallujah , it was mostly women , children and elderly being shot by marine snipers .
Everyone I saw coming to the clinic , people from different parts of the city coming at different times , were all telling the same story .
That snipers were shooting everything that moved since they were being kept out of the city by the resistance .
It definately appeared to be intentional , and soldiers later verified this .
Later , during the November siege , military leaders declared the entire city a “ free fire zone , ” meaning they gave soldiers license to shoot anything they wanted .
As far as “ precision ” bombings - there is no such thing .
Just the blast radius alone for many of the munitions means that by definition there will be damage to nearby locations , which usually means civilian homes .
This has been true since the initial invasion .
KZ : During the last presidential campaign I was with Ralph Nader when he was being interviewed on an international television show and a woman called from Fallujah , this was after the first battle when Bush pulled back from attacking the city , and the woman expressed pride that they had pushed back the U.S. military .
At the same time I recall Senator Kerry , who was running for president , mocking George Bush for backing down on Fallujah .
His comments gave Bush the green light for the second attack on the city where many more died .
Now , I see the top Democratic presidential candidates saying they cannot promise to get out of Iraq by 2013 and all keep a military action against Iran on the table .
All this is occurring when the vast majority of Americans want the U.S. out of Iraq and do not want a war with Iran .
What do you make of the political situation in the U.S. and the electoral choices that peace voters have ?
DJ : The silver lining of this dark cloud we are now living under in our country is that the true colors of the mainstream candidates in both the Democratic and Republican parties have the same mindset about U.S. policy in the Middle East .
I urge people to read the National Security Strategy , along with the Quadrennial Defense Review Report .
These give a pretty clear picture of U.S. policy in the Middle East - which is essentially to control the natural resources and the shipping lanes .
Until those are addressed in open debates with politicians , whatever their party , we cannot expect to see any policy change regarding Iraq , Iran , and the Middle East .
Our political system has been corrupted , and most of the representatives , aside from a handful , are embedded within that system .
It is a systemic problem , thus , requires solutions which address the system .
This means that voting for one candidate or the other is n’t going to address the real problem .
KZ : What would be the key false impressions that Americans have about Iraq and how would you correct them ?
DJ : That the occupation has an end date , that if the U.S. leaves things will worsen in Iraq , and that by staying they are preventing the civil war from widening .
The occupation , as per the current U.S. strategy supported by all of the mainstream politicians on either side of the isle , has no end date .
Period .
Drawing down the number of troops , if - when it happens , has nothing to do with moving towards a total withdrawal until the policy is changed .
The bogus idea that if the U.S. leaves things will worsen is both inherently racist and ignorant .
Iraq is where western civilization began , and the Iraqi people are more than capable of sorting out the problems within their country .
In addition , the majority of those current problems were caused by and continued to be propagated by the foreign occupation forces .
When the occupation ends , thus begins the first step towards solving all of the problems within Iraq .
The rhetoric that the U.S. is preventing a worsening of the civil war by staying is also erroneous .
Via arming Sunnis and politically supporting Shias , along with facilitating the death squads , the U.S. presence in Iraq only exacerbates the sectarian tensions they helped to foster in the first place .
Again , total U.S. withdrawal will be the first step towards reconciliation and peace .
KZ : What advice would you give the U.S. peace movement and Americans opposed to the Iraq occupation at this difficult time ?*
DJ : I feel the two single greatest things people can do to help end the occupation are to support Iraq Veterans Against the War , and to continue to organize locally .
IVAW is the spearhead , I feel , of any movement that will be effective in ending the occupation , and organizing locally for local , national , and international issues is paramount for building the infrastructure necessary to radically change the collapsing system we find ourselves in today .
( If you want to get involved in local organizing contact the author at SU.gnisiRycarcomeDnull@eseeZK . )
KZ : I understand you have participated in deep ecology workshops with Joanna Macy who is a long - term activist and is now involved in what she calls “ The Great Turning ” from the industrial growth society to a life - sustaining civilization .
Do you see connections between the Iraq occupation and issues like climate change and the ecological crisis ?
DJ : They are inseparable .
The runaway train that is this Late Stage Capitalism , of infinite growth at the cost of human rights and our ecology , brings us the latest symptom , which is Iraq .
The U.S. military is one of the largest polluters on the planet - thus the direct link of the ambitions for U.S. global empire , using the military to enforce this , runaway corporatism and all the destruction to the ecology that that growth entails , and thus , our global climate change crisis .
Books abound , television shows focus on it , and it is the question that every woman asks herself , â€ œWhat do men really want ?â€ 
Studies and surveys have led to the top two answers to this question , " Sex and Respect " .
Yes , itâ€™s true .
Men want plenty of sex and they seek the respect of their partners .
This is in contrast to women who primarily desire love and affection .
When it comes right down to it , men get a bad rap .
They are often depicted as sex crazed party animals that have no level or desire of commitment , and this simply isnâ€™t the truth .
There are many men who seek out a monogamous relationship and are just waiting for the perfect woman to enter the picture .
Does this mean that the " perfect " woman is a human Barbie Doll ?
According to current studies – no .
Studies have shown that men are more interested in a woman that is committed to them , respects them , and validates their worth more than a meaningless tryst with a perfect " ten " .
Of course men are attracted to a woman by her physical appearance and that is a main component to the relationship , but as any man in a relationship can tell you , looks wear thin after time and when it comes down to it , personality can make or break a relationship .
Men want to be treated with respect and to know that they are appreciated and valued by their partners .
Many women are also surprised to discover that men need love .
Often , acts of love , verbal affirmations , and the like are typically reserved for the female and often neglected when it comes to the man .
Typically , he is the strong , dominant , tough one in the relationship , so women often neglect to tell or show him how much she loves him .
However , many men have stated that this is a strong need that they have .
Men need love just as much as women do .
They need to hear it , they need to see it demonstrated in actions , and they need to feel it .
Now , obviously this is where menâ€™s number one need comes in â€ “ sex .
There is no getting around it .
The number one way to show a man that his partner loves him is through sex .
It is often ironic that women can go without sex much longer than a man , and never realize that he is suffering and feeling unloved .
It is a wise woman who realizes that her man equates sex with love and understands that when she withholds sex , she is essentially telling him that she no longer loves , respects , or validates him .
It is also easy to understand why men stray when they begin to feel that this area of their relationship is lacking .
It isnâ€™t necessarily that they feel they need a prettier woman , one with a better body , or more money .
They are looking for love , because from the manâ€™s point of view , without sex the love is gone .
When a woman withholds sex from her partner , she is essentially entering into territory where the future of her entire relationship is being threatened .
If you truly love , respect , and validate your partner , communicate honestly with him .
Never use sex as a weapon against him .
Openly discuss issues as soon as they arise and give your man the respect he deserves , respect him enough to work things out without using sex to punish him .
By keeping open communication with your partner , and discussing issues as soon as they arise , you can be sure that you will be giving your man what he really wants .
George McGovern , who made an ill - fated run for President in 1972 , has a very interesting Op - Ed piece in today ’s Wall Street Journal :
Since leaving office I ’ve written about public policy from a new perspective : outside looking in .
I ’ve come to realize that protecting freedom of choice in our everyday lives is essential to maintaining a healthy civil society .
Why do we think we are helping adult consumers by taking away their options ?
We do n’t take away cars because we do n’t like some people speeding .
We allow state lotteries despite knowing some people are betting their grocery money .
Everyone is exposed to economic risks of some kind .
But we do n’t operate mindlessly in trying to smooth out every theoretical wrinkle in life .
The nature of freedom of choice is that some people will misuse their responsibility and hurt themselves in the process .
We should do our best to educate them , but without diminishing choice for everyone else .
In the piece , McGovern talks about everything from payday lending :
Anguished at the fact that payday lending is n’t perfect , some people would outlaw the service entirely , or cap fees at such low levels that no lender will provide the service .
Anyone who ’s familiar with the law of unintended consequences should be able to guess what happens next .
Researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York went one step further and laid the data out : Payday lending bans simply push low - income borrowers into less pleasant options , including increased rates of bankruptcy .
Net result :
After a lending ban , the consumer has the same amount of debt but fewer ways to manage it .
To health care :
Health - care paternalism creates another problem that ’s rarely mentioned :
Many people can’t afford the gold - plated health plans that are the only options available in their states .
Buying health insurance on the Internet and across state lines , where less expensive plans may be available , is prohibited by many state insurance commissions .
Despite being able to buy car or home insurance with a mouse click , some state governments require their approved plans for purchase or none at all .
It ’s as if states dictated that you had to buy a Mercedes or no car at all .
In other words , competition works .
I ’ll honestly admit that I never thought I ’d see the day when George McGovern , who ran a very left - wing statist campaign in 1972 ( although big issue in the race was the Vietnam War ) would be more of an economic conservative than the current sitting Republican President , the Republican nominee for President , and many high - ranking Congressional Republicans .
James Joyner suggests that it ’s not just the fact that McGovern has changed , but that the goalposts of American politics have been moved and I think he ’s pretty much right in that regard .
First of all , it ’s important to remember that for as left - wing as McGovern may have been back in the day , he was n’t all that different on economic issues from the guy he was running against :
As President , Nixon imposed wage and price controls , indexed Social Security for inflation , and created Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) .
The number of pages added to the Federal Register each year doubled under Nixon .
He eradicated the last remnants of the gold standard , created the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , promoted the Legacy of parks program and implemented the Philadelphia Plan , the first significant federal affirmative action program ,
And Republicans today are more like Richard Nixon when it comes to domestic policy than they are to either Ronald Reagan or Barry Goldwater .
Yes , George McGovern has changed , but he ’s not the only one .
Hmm .
No headers ( < h1 > , < h2 > , etc. ) allowed in here .

01 Semantics
Ruby has mixins ; Smalltalk does not .
Mixins help much in design .
Ruby permits adding methods to individual objects ; in Smalltalk , all methods reside in classes .
In Ruby , it is practical and somewhat useful to add methods dynamically ; in Smalltalk , the practice is generally to treat the methods and classes as static .
Ruby offers powerful macros in class definitions ; Smalltalk offers no macros at all .
01 Syntax
02 Literals and Constructors and Destructors
03 Array Constructor
Ruby offers a very convenient syntax for constructing an array from expressions for its elements .
I think all modern Smalltalk implementations also support this , although it is relatively new in the history of the language .
If a Smalltalker reading this knows of a Smalltalk implementation in commercial or wide use that does n't support the syntax " {foo. bar. bletch} " ( note that there are spaces after the periods here ; these are sentence - end periods , not namespace - qualification periods ) for constructing an array , equivalent to " ( OrderedCollection new add : foo ; add : bar ; add : bletch ) asArray " , please add a comment to that effect .
In array construction in Ruby , you can say something like " [ foo , * bar ] " to mean the array whose first element is given by the expression foo and the rest of whose elements are given by the array given by the expression bar .
In straightforward Ruby not using the " * " , this is " [ foo ] + bar " (+ is overloaded for concatenation in Ruby 's library ) .
In Smalltalk , it would be " ( Array with : foo ) , bar " , where the comma operator is used for concatenation in Smalltalk 's library .
Interestingly , the " * " syntax can also be used for destruction .
You can say , for example
[ foo , * bar ] = bletch
where " = " is the assignment notation ( discussed below ) and bletch is an array of at least one element .
Then foo will be set to the first element , and bar will be set to the rest .
This example emulates Joy's " snoc " operator ( cons spelled backward ) .
See also , multiple assignment , below .
Smalltalk has nothing like the conveniences offered by Ruby 's prefix " * " notations .
Ruby also lets you use the prefix " * " in argument lists to construct argument lists and in parameter lists to deconstruct argument lists .
Perhaps as a Smalltalk advocate in regard to keyword arguments vs. positional arguments , however , I might not think this usage brings much to the party as an advantage of Ruby over Smalltalk .
It does , in the Ruby context , bring something to the party , just as the equivalent construct in parameter lists in Lisp ( " &REST " ) makes Lisp much more flexible .
Who is to say whether positional parameters should be basic and keyword : value pairs should be packed up in a dictionary and passed as one of the positional arguments , or conversely , whether keyword parameters and arguments should be basic and if you want to pass a list you pack up the list as an array and pass it as one of the keyword arguments ?
Smalltalk takes one attitude and Ruby the other .
Personally , I 'm in favor of keywords .
03 Dictionary Constructor
Ruby offers a very convenient syntax for constructing a dictionary ( a dictionary is called a Dictionary in Smalltalk and ( unfortunately ) a Hash in Ruby ; I 'll use the term dictionary as the generic term ) .
The constructor is short to write , and keys and values can come from any expressions .
Example , " {: foo => : bar , : bletch => 3} " , which in Smalltalk would be " Dictionary new at : # foo put : # bar ; at : # bletch put : 3 ; yourself " .
Note how much shorter " {: foo => : bar , : bletch => 3} " is than " Dictionary new at : # foo put : # bar ; at : # bletch put : 3 ; yourself " .
This leads to significant economy of writing , if you are passing around many constructed dictionaries , which in Web development , for example , tends to be done quite a bit .
I 'll preempt whoever is going to point out that much of the dictionary construction in Ruby is being done to overcome the lack of the keyword message call ( discussed below ) , by saying that dictionaries have other uses than immediate use in a message call .
Sometimes you would like to pack up the message and treat it as a whole .
Oz / Mozart recognizes this as Ruby does ( although details differ ) .
03 String Constructor
Ruby offers a convenient syntax for constructing a string .
Parts of the construct can be literal , and parts can invoke expressions for string values to be interpolated into the string under construction .
Example : Ruby :
" Hello , #{name} ! "
Smalltalk :
' Hello , ' , name , '!'
At first glance , the reader might not see much economy in the Ruby syntax over the example I gave in Smalltalk ; however , if you are writing many constructions of strings from alternating literal and variable parts , the Ruby syntax becomes pretty convenient .
I think it is less error - prone than a long sequence of concatenations given explicitly , with many literals interspersed .
Moreover , experienced Smalltalkers know that abuse of the comma operator can lead to significant inefficiencies , where abuse consists of building up a long string ( e. g. , a report ) via many concatenations .
The Smalltalk library implements the comma operator inefficiently by copying over the string every time .
Consequently , we get in the habit of writing an example like this this way :
WriteStream new
nextPutAll : ' Hello , ';
nextPutAll : name ;
nextPutAll : '!';
contents
( the semicolon is used in Smalltalk for the cascade syntax ; it means send multiple messages to the same receiver ) .
If Ruby 's concatenation ( uttered as " + " ) is ever found to be inefficient like Smalltalk's , I 'm sure that what the language culture would lead to is making it work as efficiently as though implemented by Smalltalk 's WriteStream , not to inventing a new class equivalent to that class in Smalltalk .
The general attitude difference seems to prevail , that in Ruby it 's more , write what you mean , and leave efficiency to the language ( or library ) implementation .
03 Regular Expression Literal
Ruby offers a very convenient syntax for expressing patterns over strings , i. e. , regular expressions .
It looks just like in the Unix " ed " line editor , with the pattern between slashes .
Smalltalk has nothing of the kind , in its syntax .
03 Alternative Syntaxes for Literals
Ruby has several other literal syntaxes for convenience , that Smalltalk does not .
02 Assignment operator
Smalltalk 's assignment operator is " := " , which looks unambiguously like assignment and not equality , which I consider very appropriate for an imperative language .
The Ruby designer ( who nevertheless I thank profusely ( if he 's reading this ) for the good features of the language , which I think occur together in no other , so the combination of them makes for a helpful innovation , and for providing the first interpreter ) erroneously chose to follow Fortran and its kin in using naked " = " for assignment .
On the other hand , Ruby offers multiple assignment .
You can swap two variables by saying " a , b = b , a " .
In this vein , see also the prefix " * " notations I mention above .
Smalltalk does not have multiple assignment .
Ruby offers convenient translations of assignment syntax into message calls .
Smalltalk : " foo at : x put : y " .
Ruby : " foo[ x ] = y " .
You write what you mean , not how it is implemented .
Smalltalk : " aircraft altitude : 3600 " ; Ruby : " aircraft.altitude = 3600 " .
In each of these examples , Ruby translates the assignment into a call that can be fielded via the normal method dispatch mechanism .
02 Message - call syntax
03 Keyword Messages
Smalltalk has keyword syntax for putting arguments ( and parameters ) in the middle of a selector ; Ruby lacks this feature .
I think this is one of the best contributions of Smalltalk to the history of programming languages .
Keywords make a program much easier to read , I think , because they tell the reader the meaning and intent and significance of the parameters and arguments , in the sense of their participation in the design behind the program .
In Smalltalk , the keywords contribute to the selector , so they participate in the message dispatch .
This supports the writing of distinct methods for handling different cases of what data are available to construct or calculate some desired result .
Ruby somewhat makes up for the lack of keyword message syntax with the dictionary constructor syntax .
In fact , in the context of a message call , Ruby makes the syntax for specifying keyword - argument pairs even easier , almost comparable to Smalltalk 's keywords .
Let 's look at an example .
Consider , in Smalltalk :
viewer cueMenuRoleNamed : aName forPage : aPage and Layout : aLayout
In Ruby , we could write :
viewer.cue_menu_role :role_name => a_name , : page => a_page , : layout => a_layout
In this Ruby example , the programmer was able to omit the braces that would otherwise have to enclose ( and form part of ) the dictionary constructor because the dictionary is the last argument and the syntax allows that omission in that circumstance , as a notational convenience .
Note how closely the Ruby example parallels the Smalltalk .
But there is an important difference in the semantics here .
In the Ruby example , the selector is only " cue_menu_role " .
If the " cue_menu_role " functionality is to operate with different combinations of given data in addition to the selection exemplified ( role name , page , and layout ) , the method or methods that implement " cue_menu_role " will have to examine the argument list and distinguish the cases .
In the Smalltalk example on the other hand , the selector is " cueMenuRoleNamed : forPage : andLayout : " .
The selector embodies the selection of available input data , so the method that implements it only has to deal with that case .
In favor of the Ruby approach , on the other hand , is the fact that in Smalltalk , the order of the keywords matters , but in Ruby it does not .
Usually in the English that the programmer is trying to get the reader to think of as the interpretation of the operation , the order does n't matter , so for example , it 's a nuisance to have to implement both if True : ifFalse : and if False : ifTrue : .
However , I suppose there are counterexamples in the underlying English .
Sometimes , order matters in English .
So , in looking at keywordism as a whole as addressed in the two languages , I see some strength in Smalltalk in that the keywords are part of the selector , and that the use of keywords with message arguments right at the point where you want to trigger the dispatch is syntactically simple and easy .
I see as weaknesses in Smalltalk that the order matters , and that it is not so easy to package up the collection of keyword - argument pairs as a message that can be treated as a whole .
03 Syntax Between Receiver and Selector , and Treatment of Juxtaposition in the Syntax
In Ruby , you say " foo.bar " ; in Smalltalk , it 's " foo bar " .
The notation for a unary message call is cleaner in Smalltalk than it is in Ruby , because simple juxtaposition , I 'd say , requires less mental effort to read , than the notation using the dot .
Of course I do n't have any cog-sci data about mental effort ; I 'm just saying that it feels cleaner to me .
The syntax makes better use of juxtaposition in Smalltalk .
In Ruby , juxtaposition has been used to separate selector from arguments .
For example , " foo. bar bletch , baz " would mean what " foo. bar ( bletch , baz ) " means in Ruby .
This is arguably not a terribly wasteful use of juxtaposition in Ruby 's syntax .
It makes for a clean , " command " look , especially in cases where the receiver is implicitly " self " ( discussed below ) .
" load ' foo.rb ' " , for example , looks cleaner than " load ( ' foo.rb ' ) " .
But the direction of development of Ruby seems to be away from a consistent use of juxtaposition in this way .
If you write , for example , " foo ( bar ) " , the complier might warn you that you ought to remove the space to anticipate the language 's future .
So , in summary about the dot and juxtaposition , I say that although the use of juxtaposition in a command like " load ' foo.rb ' " is quite nice , Smalltalk rather than Ruby has made the better choice about where to harness simple juxtaposition in the syntax , in that Smalltalk grabs this for its basic message - call syntaxes , to separate receiver from selector .
03 Implicit Self
In Ruby ( as in the language Self , the pioneer in this regard , and from which the language Self gets its name ) , you can usually abbreviate message calls on " self " by omitting the mention of " self " .
For example , for " self.foo " you can write simply " foo " .
But in Smalltalk , you cannot abbreviate " self foo " by writing simply " foo " .
This makes a major economy in writing and reading Ruby code .
03 Strange Syntax for Blocks
In Smalltalk , there is easy syntax for constructing a closure and passing it as an ordinary argument and picking up that argument with an ordinary parameter and then for invoking the closure and / or passing it on .
Ruby , semantically , has the same capabilities for constructing , passing , and using closures .
However , Ruby uses oddball syntax for these things , for no benefit that I can discern .
There is a specially distinguished argument position available in a call , specifically for passing a closure .
If you are going to construct a closure in that position , the syntax is simple .
But the closure in its simplest syntax is not an expression .
It only goes in that special position in the syntax , or has to have a word put in front of it , " lambda " , to be turned into an expression that could be put in an ordinary argument position or any other expression context ( e. g. , right side of assignment ) .
If a method is expecting to receive a block as an argument , the designer has to choose between having it take the block as an ordinary argument or as the special block argument ( either can be chosen , in the monomorphic case ) .
And if the method needs to take two blocks , at least one of them has to be passed as an ordinary argument , so the decision has to be made whether to pass one as the special argument and if so , which one .
Conversion in both directions is available in all contexts where it makes sense , between the special argument or parameter and an ordinary expression .
I think this exceptionalism in Ruby 's syntax imposes significant extra conceptual load to understanding the syntax .
Smalltalk 's treatment of blocks is plenty economical , whether they are being passed as arguments right at the point of construction or not .
I guess I can see why this exceptionalism arose ; it avoids having the closing parenthesis of the argument list coming right after the end of a block , which I can see would look ugly .
But , so much twisting and turning and squirming for a tiny increment of beauty .
03 The Cascade
Smalltalk has the cascade syntax , which Ruby lacks .
Perhaps this lack is not as costly to Ruby programmers as it would be to Smalltalk programmers if the cascade syntax were dropped from Smalltalk , because in cases where the receiver is self , a cascade would buy nothing in Ruby because you can leave out the receiver in those cases anyway .
03 Special Characters Permitted in Selectors ( speaking here of selectors other than " + " , " * " , and the like )
Ruby permits " ! " in selectors , which is useful to warn code readers that a functional style is not being used .
Smalltalk allows only alphanumerics in its unary selectors and in the keywords of its keyword selectors ( not counting the colon , which has a specific role in the syntax even though the jargon of discussion of Smalltalk usually speaks of the " keyword " as including the colon ) .
Ruby also permits " ? " , but below , I argue that this does n't help because I prefer Smalltalk 's convention for choosing selectors indicating Boolean results .
02 Control Constructs
Smalltalk 's syntax includes no control constructs except the " ^ " ( early return ) .
Any kind of " if " , " while " , etc. , are made by message calls using blocks .
At least , syntactically they appear that way .
As the Self designers point out , in reality you can't override if True : ifFalse : unless the Smalltalk compiler resorts to the sophistication characteristic of the Self compiler .
If you could , many programs would run too slowly because they are laced with much conditional code .
But anyway , syntax - wise , the control constructs do n't have their own syntax in Smalltalk , other than the " ^ " .
Ruby on the other hand , includes syntax for a number of common control constructs even though blocks ( closures ) are almost as convenient to express in Ruby as they are in Smalltalk ( but not quite ; sometimes you have to throw in an extra word to make the block an expression ) .
When I was a religious Smalltalker , I might have laughed at languages with control constructs and praised Smalltalk for its syntactic simplicity in using pure object orientation to express the control constructs .
But I can also see a Rubyist 's point that these control structures are in common use in all imperative programming , so why not have the syntax make it straightforward for a programmer to just write what she means ?
It does n't cost much .
02 Returned Value
Mentioning " ^ " above reminds me , that in Smalltalk , if you do n't explicitly write " ^ " with an expression ( which means , return the value of the expression as the result of the call ) , a Smalltalk method returns " self " ( I mean , what " self " means in the languages , not the string " self " ) .
In Ruby ( as in Lisp ) , the last expression in the method gives the value returned ( absent an early return ) .
This supports a functional mindset ; I have written any number of methods that consist of just one expression .
Also , it says that if you are not doing an early return , which is in fact a control construct that violates Dijkstra 's structured programming , and that should stand out as a warning to readers , you do n't have to write " return " .
I 'm not saying I 'm against early return ; it can be very convenient and can contribute greatly to brevity .
I 'm saying , early return should stand out .
In Ruby you can make it stand out by uttering " return " only in the case of early return .
In Smalltalk , you have to write " ^ " something or you 'll get " ^ self " .
For any Smalltalker who argues in favor of the programming style that says a method ( or rather the whole suite of methods implementing the same selector ) should be either designed to return a value or to have a side effect but generally not both , I agree ; sometimes I prefer that style .
And Smalltalk 's default supports that style .
But in Ruby , you can , with ease and clarity and economy , stanch any accidental return of a value some other programmer might seize on , by just ending your method with " true " , having it return the Boolean true to indicate success in achieving the desired side effect .
I think Smalltalk 's support of returning self by default is more costly than beneficial , because I think the two considerations in the paragraph just above outweigh the advantage of support for ask - or - tell - but - not - both - at - once style via the default .
On edit : A comment below by user " renox " refers to a lesson from E , that there can be significant hazard of accidentally returning an object you do n't want to .
I accord that argument much weight , and I question the opinion I gave in my initial version of this section , strongly in favor of having the last expression be the returned value by default .
Anyway , that is one of the differences between Ruby and Smalltalk , and it affects the flavor of the way they read , I find .
01 Declarations
Smalltalk requires declaration of all local variables and instance variables .
In Ruby , you introduce both simply by usage ; Ruby does not require declarations for them .
This makes a major economy in writing in Ruby .
01 Scope
Ruby absolutely makes the wrong choice by denying the programmers any way , just in the syntax in a block of code as you could observe without looking outside the block , to specify a local variable scoped just to that block .
You can write , for example , " foo " as the name of your variable , and you can limit its use to the block , and you can hope it will be scoped locally to the block .
And indeed it will , if no one writes an assignment to " foo " above the block .
In Smalltalk , you can easily declare a variable local to the block ( although one or more older Smalltalk implementations would scope the variable wrongly at runtime ; I hope all modern Smalltalk implementations have cleared this up ) .
01 Practices and the libraries
02 Choice of Selectors
As reflected in the libraries used widely in the respective languages , Smalltalkers make better choices of message selectors than Rubyists make .
For example , I like " isNil " better than " nil ? " , and " asString " better than " to_s " ( which means , " to_string " ; I 'm nitpicking here about the " to " vs. " as " rather than about the abbreviation of " string " as " s " ) .
All the question - mark selectors can be expressed in a more English - like way by using the conventions Smalltalkers have coalesced around , using " is " , " includes " , or other verbs .
" as " selectors express a more functional attitude , and " to " selectors express a more imperative attitude .
02 Array Stores
Smalltalkers choose on the basis of efficiency , whether to store a sequence of values in an OrderedCollection ( for the non-Smalltalkers among the readers , note that in Smalltalk , " OrderedCollection " denotes a particular implementation , not a type -- not every ordered collection is an OrderedCollection ) or an Array .
Rubyists just use the Array type ( it 's a class , but it might as well be a type ) .
If they need to add to the end of it , they just do .
Smalltalkers use SortedCollection if they want their data sorted , and the class makes sure to keep the instance sorted through its history of mutations ( by and large ) ; rubyists just tell the array to sort itself when they want it sorted .
So , in practices around arrays , the Ruby world looks simpler .
Programmers face fewer choices , and fewer concepts to learn .
You just write what you mean .
01 Private Methods
Ruby enforces declared privacy of methods at runtime .
Smalltalk implementations I used do not attempt this .
If I recall correctly , Dolphin does .
As a Smalltalker , I treated the software - engineering declaration that a method is private , simply with discipline , not looking for enforcement support from the language itself .
Ruby backs away from enforcing method privacy when the call is indirect via " send " , and taking advantage of this is the only way to do certain useful metaprogramming .
I wish the relevant methods were public .
Bottom line , maybe others will argue strongly for or against privacy enforcement ; I guess it 's not a big deal to me .
01 Development Environment
Every Smalltalk implementation except the Gnu one offers a development environment where your data can be present along with your software to be modified .
You can set up conditions very quickly and try out code , and examine it in any intermediate state of execution , and modify the code at any point , and so on , as pointed out elsewhere .
No Ruby implementation so far offers this .
Ruby practices depend on the file system as the repository for the software ; Smalltalkers use the image .
Either practice may fall back on a different repository for the real code repository for version control and sharing with other programmrs ( Subversion , or Envy , or whatever ) , but I 'm talking about the development environment here .
Smalltalkers look at their code through the class browser .
The source code seems to live in the environment along with the values of variables , etc .
The practice with Ruby is to organize the code in a file system .
I think Smalltalk has it all over Ruby in this regard .
It 's great to see the source code of any method instantly , and browse the senders or implementers of a given selector .
01 What the language environments could easily learn from each other
I submit that Ruby could learn the class browser and browse senders and browse implementors and the whole image with the data and software being present at the same time , the easy debugging and incremental tracing and trying code on the fly and changing it on the fly , all that , from Smalltalk .
And that Smalltalk could learn to put some macros in the class definitions .
Just keep the source code for the class definition ( excluding the methods ) , as one snippet of text ( or maybe more that one , if you have a module system where different modules could contribute to the definition of " open " classes ) , keep that snippet of source code along with the class ( or in modules if you go there ) , make it visible in the browsers , and every time it is touched , execute it again .
Some practices would have to be added to both languages so for the generated consequences of running the macro calls in the class definition would not survive when you edit the definition .
Yes , there are issues with how that affects existing instances of the classes , but the languages could solve that more or less the way Smalltalk handles schema evolution today .
All the metaprogramming that Ruby supports that make those macros work well , plus the modules and mixins , and the adding methods to objects dynamically , I think that those could be added to Smalltalk without disrupting what Smalltalk already is and does .
None of these changes would require touching a parser or a compiler in either language environment , nor the virtual machine that runs either language .
Such changes fit with the basic class ( or " behavior " ) model shared by the two languages .
I suspect I could sit in a Smalltalk image right now and look at how Class and Metaclass and ClassDescription are subclassed off Behavior , go back to basic Behavior , subclass it differently and implement Ruby 's modules , mixins , and the attachment of methods to objects , basically the same way Ruby does it .
The languages as implemented have no fundamental difference in their virtual machines .
Under the hood , Ruby puts all methods in behaviors just as Smalltalk does .
She simply gives any object that has custom methods , a special " virtual " behavior ( class ) , which inherits from the object 's nominal class .
Just as easy to do in Smalltalk .
01 Paid Work
I am glad to see Ruby on the scene , because as a very Smalltalk - like language semantically , with even some advances over Smalltalk both in semantics and syntax , and as a language that judging by the count of ads on Monster and the like , is catching on somewhat in the corporate world as Smalltalk itself dies out , seems as though it might be the rescue vehicle for Smalltalk - like languages as a professional tool .
A fine development to tide me over until the whole programming world switches to declarative programming ( or dies out due to the end of oil , but that 's another subject ) .

Ruby has Rails and Smalltalk has Seaside .

Rita
Bell is a sex surrogate , which means men pay her to have sex with them as a way of resolving their sexual problems .
Though she does n’t have actual intercourse with every client , there is usually some form of sexual contact , since the men come to her with specific difficulties , like erectile dysfunction , premature ejaculation , or its opposite , “ retarded ejaculation . ”
There are several differences between her work and prostitution :
She talks to her clients at length about their dysfunctions , and she looks less like Julia Roberts than like a zaftig hippie aunt .
But she advertises in the same publications prostitutes do , and her married clients never tell their wives .
In a city where image is everything , it seems the difference between a prostitute and a sex surrogate is the difference between pornography and erotica : lighting .
Rita grew up in a liberal , sex - positive family and went to a Seven Sisters school in the seventies , where “ people were very free about sexuality , ” she tells me as we sit in her cozy prewar living room .
After graduating , she worked in the film industry , and in 1986 , she saw a documentary about a sex surrogate in California and became intrigued .
Later , she began seeing a female psychologist who knew a surrogate who was looking for help .
Rita began training with the surrogate and taking on some of her clients for a percentage of the fee .
“ I liked the intimacy , ” she recalls , “ the feeling of really being helpful in a very profound way .
Sex was fun .
Sometimes it was fun .
I realized later that the people she was referring were the ones she did n’t like working with very much . ”
But the money was good — so good that she was able to open her own practice .
Fifteen years later , she ’s still at it .
Though she asked that I not reveal her rate , it ’s comparable to a therapist ’s .
In a typical first session , she talks with the client in the living room a bit before retiring to the bedroom .
“ I ’ll ask about his relationships , the attitudes toward sex when he was a child , his first sexual experience , whether he ’s on antidepressants . ”
After 45 minutes of talking , the client pays her , whereupon she sends him to the bathroom to undress and clean with deodorant and mouthwash while she readies the bedroom , lighting candles and putting on Enya - like music .
He comes in and lies on the bed with his eyes closed while she says things like
You ’re on a beach , feeling the sun on your face , and you ’re butter … melting .
“ Then I go into the bathroom and undress , ” she says .
“ And there are more sensate focus exercises .
I use long pieces of silk and my fingertips .
I ’m just touching the body , not the genitals .
I ’m careful not to let things get too intense during the first session .
The last part of the session is determined by what the problem is .
Usually , there ’s a release with my hand . ”
What happens in future sessions depends on the client .
There ’s usually some talking — she asks whether he ’s had sex since the session and whether he ’s been doing his Kegels .
Then they ’ll get hands - on .
“ In the second session we ’ll take a bubble bath .
In the third , we ’ll give each other massages , and the fourth there ’s a foot massage .
There is no sex just for the sake of having sex .
It ’s about solving the problem .
Someone who ’s 48 and never had intercourse is different from someone with premature ejaculation . ”
I ask her if she ever has orgasms during her sessions , and after a pause more pregnant than Catherine Zeta - Jones , she says , “ Occasionally . ”
“ How do they react ? ”
“ Most men really like it .
It makes them feel competent . ”
Many of her clients come to her because they have fetishes they feel uncomfortable revealing to their partners — they can only come when being tickled , say , or while sucking on a toe .
For these men she does something called “ bridging , ” incorporating the fetish into sex play in smaller and smaller doses in order to wean them off it .
About 15 percent of her clients are Orthodox Jewish men , who , she says , tend to be premature ejaculators .
“ It ’s about the guilt .
It ’s ‘ I ’m going to have sex , but I ’m going to fuck it up for myself . ’ ”
She ’s seen film directors , writers , and athletes , even a major general .
One client walked in the door and she recognized him as the father of a guy she had dated .
They had met once , but he did n’t remember her .
“ I was sitting there thinking , What am I going to do ?
Do I tell him I dated his son ?
I figured I should take it one step at a time and see if he came back .
He never did . ”
This is relatively common .
Some men come to her just out of curiosity .
Others , she says , “ expect Christie Brinkley to open the door , and I ’m clearly not Christie Brinkley . ”
Rita has a boyfriend , whom she ’s been with for ten years .
He lives with her , and they sleep in the same bed in which she sees clients .
Though he ’s accepting of what she does , “ he ’d prefer I did something else .
But he certainly understands the need for it , because there are so few people who do it really well . ”
She ’s up - front about her relationship status , but some clients fall in love with her anyway .
“ One guy stopped coming because it was headed in that direction .
He was married . ”
As for clients who have the opposite problem — guilt — she tries to assuage their fears .
“ I ’ll say , ‘ This is n’t betraying your wife ; it ’s enhancing what you have with her .
If you went to a female urologist and she had to handle your penis and it felt good , that ’s not cheating . ’ ”
“ But a female urologist would n’t give you a hand release , ” I point out .
“ There are some differences , ” she concedes , “ but the underlying motivation is the same : to make things better physically or sexually in your life . ”
Rita ’s caginess about what she does seems to stem from a fear of being stigmatized as a sex worker .
To liken herself to a doctor is to align herself with the medical Establishment and thereby distance herself from the thousands of women in this city who trade sex for money .
“ Surrogacy is much more cerebral than prostitution , ” she says .
“ I have to figure out what the underlying issues are , and put the pieces together very quickly .
These people do n’t want to sit and talk .
They want to get busy in the bedroom .
If you take everything from psychotherapy and condense it and go into the bedroom , there ’s another world there .
If you are good at this and you are successful — which are not necessarily related — you have to be pretty smart . ”
By Bob Fertik , Democrats.com
… At the moment , the Washington establishment — and Democratic “ leaders ” — believe the slightest hint of constitutional conflict would terrify financial markets and trigger a depression .
So if “ bipartisan unity ” is the issue - above - all - other - issues , why does n’t the Washington establishment demand that Bush show some bipartisanship by respecting lawful ( and entirely justified ) congressional subpoenas ?
American business leaders arrogantly tell foreign leaders that economic growth is impossible without the “ rule of law . ”
Well , without the basic legal tool of subpoenas , there is no rule of law — in the third world or in the United States .
Just imagine what Bush would say if Vladimir Putin defied subpoenas from his parliament .
By refusing to hold Bush in contempt , Congress is allowing Bush to be more of a dictator than Putin .
Personally , I believe the single most important thing Congress could do to prevent a depression and restore the pillars of our legal - economic system is to get to the source of all White House legal obstruction — by starting impeachment hearings for Dick Cheney as advocated by Rep. Robert Wexler .
Why ?
First , consider the alternatives .
Financial markets around the world think a $ 150 billion economic stimulus is utterly useless in the context of the massive collapse of the U.S. mortgage industry and the banks that tried to milk it .
That ’s precisely why global markets plunged 5 percent to 10 percent on Monday .
Why did the mortage industry collapse ?
Simple : Bush ’s government stopped regulating it and let the banks create a gigantic bubble by offering reckless and even criminal mortgages to people who could not afford them .
Who in the White House waged war against all forms of economic regulation ?
Dick Cheney , of course .
And speaking of war , another major reason for our profound economic problems is Iraq .
After predicting a cost - free war , Bush ’s disastrous occupation has already forced him to borrow $ 500 billion from China and the Arab oil monarchies , driving down the dollar and discouraging foreign investment .
Who demanded the war in Iraq ?
Dick Cheney , of course .

Marriage can be wonderful , but only if you are entirely aware of your individual , unique circumstances .
Angel and I have been married for a full year now , and honestly , the transition to married life has been remarkably smooth .
I do not believe our initial success with marriage is based on luck either .
We took it slow and completed the following 7 steps in an effort to ensure a successful new beginning with each other .
I would recommend these 7 steps to every couple considering the commitment of marriage .
Live Together for a Full Year First –
There is no realistic way you could possibly know everything about someone until you live with them .
The step of combining your living space will have a dramatic impact on both of your daily routines .
This is something you do not want to put off until after the wedding .
You both need to uncover all the little surprises first , figure out if it works , and make an educated decision on your future living arrangements .
Put All the Financial Cards on the Table – Financial trouble is one of the leading causes for divorce .
In order to build a successful bridge between your finances both of you need to be aware of depth and distance between your financial standings .
Put all the cards on the table , denote any discrepancies , and chart out a blueprint that makes sense to both of you .
Become Friends with Her Close Friends – Initially this one may seem unnecessary or even a bit strange , but mutual friendships are a vital key to the long term success of intimate relationships .
Her friends are a big part of who she is , just as your friends are a big part of who you are .
It is foolish to assume that close friendships with third parties will have no impact on your relationship .
If you two are as compatible as you think you are , it makes sense that you should be able to get along with her closest friends .
The flipside should hold true as well .
It may be a red flag if this is not the case .
Agree on the Details Related to Children – The idea of having children may seem distant right now , but time flies .
Some people are very passionate and firm when it comes to their outlook on raising children .
Do you want to have children ?
When ?
About how many ?
Are there any other expectations or assumptions in relation to raising them ?
These are some of the questions that need to be answered at both ends .
It ’s impossible to work out every detail now , but there should be some obvious overlap in your views on having children .
Be Honest with Both Her and Yourself – Relationships are built on a foundation of honesty and trust .
No relationship , and therefore no marriage , can survive without both parties involved being honest about how they feel .
Do n’t just be honest with her , be honest with yourself too .
If something is bothering you now , your distaste for it will only inflate as time evolves .
Make sure you head into marriage with a clean slate of honesty as it relates to both your feelings and your feelings for her .
Make sure she does the same .
This should be an open discussion .
Discuss Personal and Career Goals – Everyone has a different set of goals pertaining to their personal life and career .
Some of these goals may have been written in long before you two met each other , long before marriage was under consideration .
Neither one of you should have to give up your unachieved goals , but there needs to be a mutual awareness of what these goals are , how well they mesh , and how they impact your future together as a married couple .
Think About the Possibilities of Change – Change is an inevitable element of life .
Life changes with success , it changes with failure , and it changes with time .
Nothing in the future will ever be exactly the same as it is right now .
Marriage is a commitment that must be flexible in coping with the influences of change .
There needs to be proactive discussions now about the possibilities for change and a reciprocated consciousness of the uncharted waters that lie ahead .
Successfully completing these steps should reveal any hidden inconsistencies in your relationship that might draw a negative affect on your marriage .
It should also clear your minds of any confusing marriage myths that may have concerned either of you .
The US has not acknowledged detaining Khaled al - Maqtari
Khaled al - Maqtari told Amnesty International he was held in isolation for more than 28 months without charge or access to any legal representation .
He said he first became a US " ghost detainee " at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq after being arrested there in 2004 .
The US has not acknowledged detaining Mr Maqtari .
CIA spokesman George Little told the BBC : " Apart from transfers to Guantanamo , the CIA does not , as a rule , comment publicly on allegations of who may - or who may not - have been in its custody .
" The agency has run its terrorist detention and interrogation programme in accord with US law . "
US President George W Bush did acknowledge the existence of black sites in 2006 .
He said the prisons were a vital tool in the US " war on terror " and insisted that the CIA had treated detainees humanely and had not used torture .
In July 2007 , Mr Bush issued an executive order which banned " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " of terrorist suspects by the CIA , but not its operation of secret facilities .
The agency has since declined to say whether it still uses them .
' Ghost detainee '
In his first interview since being released by the Yemeni authorities in May last year , Mr Maqtari described the torture and ill - treatment he said he had suffered at the hands of the US military and CIA while in secret custody .
He describes being subjected to international crimes such as enforced disappearance and torture , yet these allegations have never been investigated

Q&A : CIA jails allegations Europe CIA jails ' confirmed '
He said he was initially arrested in Iraq in January 2004 , when the US military raided a suspected arms market in Falluja .
He is believed to have then been handed to US Military Intelligence on suspicion of being a foreign insurgent .
He said he was then transferred to Abu Ghraib , where he alleged he was subjected to a regime of beatings , sleep deprivation , suspension upside - down in painful positions , intimidation by dogs and induced hypothermia .
After nine days of interrogation at Abu Ghraib , Mr Maqtari said he was flown to a secret CIA detention facility in Afghanistan and held there for three months .
Amnesty says it has obtained flight records which show that a plane operated by an alleged CIA front company flew from Baghdad to Kabul nine days after his arrest .
Mr Maqtari sketched how he was allegedly tortured in Abu Ghraib
Mr Maqtari said that while in Afghanistan he was subjected to further torture and ill - treatment , including prolonged solitary confinement , the use of stress positions , sleep deprivation , exposure to extremes of hot and cold , sensory deprivation and disruption with bright lighting and loud music or sound effects .
" It was not really music but noise to scare you , like from one of those scary movies , " he told Amnesty .
" I was scared , there were no dogs but there was noise there .
Whenever you try to sleep , they bang on the door loudly and violently . "
During the lapses in the music and sound effects , he was able to speak to other detainees and deduced that there were about 20 others being held in the cell around him , including Majid Khan , one of the " high value " detainees transferred to Guantanamo Bay in September 2006 , according to Amnesty .
' Absence of accountability '
Mr Maqtari said that in late April 2004 he and a number of other detainees were transferred to another CIA black site , possibly in eastern Europe and held there in isolation for a further 28 months .
A report found EU states knew of secret CIA flights over their territory
The Council of Europe has found evidence that the CIA ran secret jails in Poland and Romania between 2003 and 2005 to interrogate suspects .
Throughout his detention , Mr Maqtari did not have access to lawyers , relatives , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) or any person other than his interrogators and the other US personnel involved , Amnesty said .
Mr Maqtari was eventually handed over by the CIA in the summer of 2006 to the Yemeni authorities , who continued to hold him without charges until May 2007 , the rights group said .
" Khaled al - Maqtari 's account sheds more light on the US 's unlawful conduct in the ' war on terror ' , " said Anne FitzGerald , a senior adviser at Amnesty .
" He describes being subjected to international crimes such as enforced disappearance and torture , yet these allegations have never been investigated , " she added .
" The secrecy surrounding the programme goes hand - in - hand with a complete absence of accountability , " the Amnesty International adviser said .
The US state department said it had no comment to give on Mr Maqtari 's case .
I like doing math with my son Nicholas , who is about to enter the 7th grade .
Yesterday , he asked me the question in the title of this post , and it stumped me .
I know there are some applications in physics for imaginary and complex numbers , but they are too advanced for a 7th grader ( or , I must admit , for a 49 year old applied macroeconomist ) .
Off the top of my head , I could not think of any applications within basic economics or to everyday life .
Can some commenter help me out ?
Waves could swamp the Giant's Causeway , the Trust is warning
A new Trust report says sea level rises of up to a metre this century will affect some of Northern Ireland 's most important tourist and wildlife areas .
Areas such as Strangford Lough could also be badly affected , says the Trust .
The Giant's Causeway is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Northern Ireland , and is a World Heritage Site .
The National Trust report warned access to the site would become more difficult , with problems as early as 2020 .
It also warned that rising sea levels in Strangford Lough could hit wildlife such as Brent geese and that the Murlough National Nature Reserve could see coastal erosion and flooding .
GIANT'S CAUSEWAY
Made up of 40,000 interlocking basalt columns Causeway is result of ancient volcanic eruption Located on the north - east coast of Northern Ireland The ' discovery ' of Causeway announced in a paper to the Royal Society in 1693
Brent geese come each winter to graze the eel grass on Strangford 's mud flats but the population could be seriously threatened by climate change .
It could be affected by a 25 cm rise in sea levels by 2050 , the Trust is warning .
The report , Shifting Shores : Living with a Changing Coastline , predicted sea level rises of between 85 and 100 cm by 2100 .
Hilary McGrady , National Trust director for Northern Ireland , said it was essential for more detailed coastal data .
" Our planning system , and in particular development plans and planning policy statements , must take predicted coastal change into account , " she said .
EPILOGUE TO A LIFETIME OF MUSIC
Learning to let go is a difficult thing , and actually letting go can be even harder .
There is only so much tension that can build up in someone before an unhealthy type of self - destruction , that lethal kind of implosion from within that crushes the spirit and breaks a person , happens : I prefer it not to come to that and have opted for an overwhelming catharsis instead .
I want to release a great deal of what has been built up , to cleanse myself of past trauma , and to be able to walk on into the future with brighter , more open eyes -- and a smile reflecting the happiness inside .
For over two decades of my life , I had aspired to be a successful composer of music , primarily electronic and TECHNOlogical in nature , hence my favorite term " techno music " .
With that mechanical sensibility has always come a human responsibility , however , and it carried me far until all that ended for me in May of 2004 when I was struck down by hyperacusis and my ears no longer worked as they could or should or would .
That career was left behind like a city in flames , with me taking on a new existence in the online world of Second Life as " Torley Torgeson " , and subsequently , as my daughter " Torley Jr. " from a future timeline .
( To be continued ...)
But every so often , I was tempted to see if the figurative fires had actually incinerated everything permanently or if there was anything , anything left at all .
I have many dreams .
Yesterday , a particularly meaningful one struck me , and led me to travel back to this city in my neuroscape , braving the distance along the way and the harsh climes that were no longer welcoming .
The air was acrid , the skies a sullen gray .
When I faced my fears and came back to the towering treasure of sonic wonders I had once lived in , I discovered that much to my surprise , even with the pain ringing through the sides of my head , that not all had been lost : hardly !
Now , while I cannot continue to produce music in the present , what I have done -- past work , established history -- still stands and is recorded on many gigabytes of digital storage .
Memories recorded in cold 1s and 0s , yet played back with the warmest of tones and evoking positive emotions .
It was several weeks ago that I decided to shut down my synthesizers and pull the plugs , nullify the juice that had powered them for several years continuously .
They were n't being used , and I was sad .
It was n't that I 'd given up hope -- much to the contrary , in fact -- I simply wanted to stop looking back so I could keep looking forward .
To new hopes and dreams .
But as I alluded to , the past has a funny way of coming back to get ya , and thoughts have occurred to me that what I once saw as a curse became a blessing in the due course of time 's passage , much of which I have blogged about and am still compiling as lives -- both my First and Second -- go on ...
So yesterday , I started blowing off the pixeldust and digging through the data , and came up with no less than 230 FULL tracks that I had mixed and mastered before my ears went bad , provided for you in the ever - popular MP3 format for your luxurious convenience .
Download and play .
Simple .
That 's almost 16 hours of Torley - techno music for you to enjoy ... and then some .
( And not even close to my total historical output -- heck , if I could find where I left some of my old cassette tapes containing prepubescent recordings ! -- but I digress , and all of these are finished works from initial idea by brainstorm to the end of the applicable process . )
Some of them you may have heard before ( bits ' n ' pieces ) , but the overwhelming majority you have n't , as they 've been unreleased until now .
Realized from a timeframe of my late teens to shortly before my 23rd birthday , the music is high - quality , sometimes lo-fi , but always representative of my personal creative expression and unique eccentricities .
Please allow me to embellish and elaborate to help guide you in , style - wise .
My music is about catchy tunes .
Melodies you can hum and / or whistle with rhythms that 'll get your head nodding , your feet tapping along .
I 've long embraced diversity , and in this " final selection " , you 'll find : orchestral breakbeat epics , fragile ambient soundscapes , improvised piano solos , 4 - to - the - floor peaktime pounders , progressive house builders , minimal techy starkness , angular tributes to 8 - bit video games , crunk hip - hop instrumentals , futuristic - yet - retro techno - pop , quasi - Asian syncopations , lush beatless convolutions ( with watermelons ! ) , arpeggiated trance anthems , neo-tribal fusion grooves , straightfoward rockers -- yeahhh guitar solos ! , jazzy acid workouts , love songs , songs about babies being born , songs dedicated to my dead Dad , songs about nothing in particular but feature intricate drum machine programming layered with virtuosic keyboard performances that you 'll get a kick out of , and more .
And more .
And more !
I could keep sprouting off labels , but while these words describe the music , they are n't the music .
So please , if you will ... with over two hundred pieces of the puzzle , if a name catches your fancy , evokes your imagination , go for it !
And travel from there .
Give it a chance to grow , to take hold , and see what my music means to you .
I wish you well in your explorations , and now that I can't hold back , I open up and give this gift to you .
In hopes that it will make your days happier , your nights dancier , and your life a little brighter ( if I may be so bold ) .
After all , what good is music if it is n't heard ?
A few more words : feel free to demix , remix , rearrange , and revision my audio-visions .
Enjoy passing them on to your family and friends across the Internet , since sharing is caring !
Creative Commons licensing info is provided , and a whole lotta thanx to the Internet Archive peeps for helping me to store this collection .
If you have any questions , commentary , or other things which rippleshock guided you to to say , you 're free to get in touch .
I 'm here .
Even if I could n't hear anymore , I 'm grateful that you can .
That being said , thank you graciously for listening . :)
I 'm moving on to my new life now . . . =o )

Taped by Torley Wong Type sound Year 2005
Posted by Sir Cucumber at on Friday , February 29 , 2008
Street smarts and years of experience have taught me there are only two types of heroes in this world : those that are fighting to rescue their girlfriends , and those that are gay .
Because ladies , if he 's not willing to repeatedly jump - kick his way through hordes of thugs , karate masters , and at least 12 men twice his size to save you from captivity , then he 's just not worth it and you should stop getting your stupid ass in trouble , skank .
Last week went out to the do - gooders .
This week is for the musclebound misogynists we all know and love .
March 25 , 2008  -- Video footage of Sen. Hillary Clinton 's 1996 trip to Bosnia offers a contradictory description to the dramatic account the Democratic presidential candidate delivered in a recent speech .
At an event last week in Washington , Clinton said she and her crew landed in an " evasive maneuver under sniper fire . "
She described her trip to Tuzla as if it were a scene from " Saving Private Ryan . "
" There was supposed to be some sort of greeting ceremony , but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles , " she said .
Questions surrounding whether or not Clinton embellished a 1996 trip to Bosnia are particularly embarrassing for her because she has campaigned so hard on her " experience , " arguing that she is ready to answer the 3 a.m. crisis call at the White House .
Video footage from the trip reveals no visible threat and a brief greeting ceremony on the tarmac .
A little Bosnian schoolgirl read them a poem .
The first lady paused for pictures .
She and daughter Chelsea even climbed up on a guard tower .
John Pomfret , a Washington
Post reporter who was there to capture the moment , said , " The whole Tuzla sector was under the control of the Americans .
We were driving around in soft - skin cars .
No reporters I know of were wearing flak jackets at the time .
So it was pretty much a peaceful area . "
Peaceful enough , at least , for a performance by Sheryl Crow and comedian Sinbad who also accompanied the first lady on the trip .
At a time when party rival Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama is vacationing with his family in the Virgin Islands , Clinton had hoped the focus would be on what had been billed as a major policy speech on the economy .
Instead , her campaign found itself on the defensive .
On Good Morning America Tuesday , Democratic strategist and Clinton supporter James Carville said " it happens " with regards to Clinton 's misstatement .
" She 's been in public life for a long time .
She 's been subjected to some rather vicious attacks .
Some of them have taken a toll .
I think during this gain , she 's shown herself to be a woman of remarkable strength and remarkable courage , " Carville said .
Continuing he said , " I 'm quite proud of her , and I think she 'll continue down this road . "
Her daughter was asked about Tuzla in Indiana and backed up Clinton 's recollection .
" I support what she said , " Chelsea Clinton said .
" Yes , I was there as well and so honored I was there and had the opportunity to travel with her . "
Clinton was asked about it too -- by the editorial boards of the two Philadelphia newspapers Tuesday .
Clinton revised her Bosnia story , admitting there was a " misstatement " in her account describing running with her head down to get into the vehicles .
Today , she said that she " had to meet this 8 - year - old girl , " so , " I took her stuff and left . "
When Clinton was challenged by a reporter that this revised account calls into question her foreign policy credentials , Clinton said , " No , I went to 80 countries , you know .
I gave contemporaneous accounts , I wrote about a lot of this in my book .
You know , I think that , a minor blip , you know , if I said something that , you know , I say a lot of things -- millions of words a day -- so , if I misspoke , that was just a misstatement . "
In her autobiography " Living History , " Clinton describes a near - perpendicular landing to evade possible ground fire but talks about the greeting ceremony on the tarmac in Tuzla with local schoolchildren though says it was cut short " due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip . "
During the event on the tarmac , Clinton writes : " One 8 - year - old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled ' Peace . '
Chelsea and I presented the school supplies we had brought . …
We were then hustled off to the fortified American base at Tuzla , where over 2,000 American , Russian , Canadian , British , and Polish soldiers were encamped in a large tent city . "
In pictures of the event , Clinton and Chelsea do n't seem to be wearing flak jackets or helmets .
Clinton points out that she wrote about the Tuzla trip in her book -- without the extra details .
It raises the question : Was she embellishing her resume ?
Or does she just not remember ?
Within the UK , young people in England were ranked lowest
Ipsos Mori asked 4,170 with internet access about such things as language learning and international affairs .
Those in Nigeria had the highest ranking , while the UK was last after the US and Czech Republic .
Among the questions asked was whether children saw themselves as a citizen of the world or of their own country .
The study coincides with a government drive to raise awareness .
An international education week has been organised by England 's Department for Children , Schools and Families ( DCSF ) .
Interviews were conducted online in the USA , UK , Germany , Czech Republic , Spain , Brazil , China and India .
They were face - to - face in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria , but still among those with net access .
Links
According to the British Council , UK children were the least likely to try to understand current events .
More than twice as many Brazilian ( 69 % ) and German children ( 61 % ) said they would , compared with 28 % of the UK sample and 30 % of the American .
Asked whether they saw themselves as citizens of the world or their own country , most saw themselves as global citizens - except in the UK , USA and the Czech Republic .
Young people in Brazil were among the most likely to agree with the statement " it is a good idea for schools in my country to have links or partnerships with schools in other countries " but the least likely to be in schools that had such links .
Overall results were scored on an index from seven down to zero :
Nigeria 5.15 India 4.86 Brazil 4.53 Saudi Arabia 3.74 Spain 3.29 Germany 3.24 China 2.97 Czech Republic 2.51 USA 2.22 UK 2.19
" For the UK to compete in a global economy , it is vital that we encourage our young people to have an interest in and engagement with the world around them . "
One of my hobbies on here is an attempt to dissect the Bush administration and see what I can find to define it in larger terms .
How does he differ from his predecessors ?
Aside from policy , what will be remembered about the 2001 - 2009 years ?
There are a lot of threads , bits and pieces to try and put together into a bigger theory .
Cronyism , dishonesty , condescension towards anyone outside of his circle , etc .
First , a bit of a look back .
Prior to George Washington ’s tenure as president , it was suggested that he might be king of America .
Washington himself rejected the idea , largely due to his desire to live a peaceful life at Mount Vernon .
There ’s more to the story though , and it goes back to why the United States Constitution was written with its checks and balances , its layered and intricate ways to prevent any one branch from running roughshod over another .
One thing the founding fathers understood was that while any one president may be a truly magnanimous and selfless man , dedicated solely to the welfare of his nation , they certainly all wo n’t be .
Ours is a country that is only as good as those who lead it , and a greedy and corrupt president , given a long enough leash , will have little qualms with exploiting his power for personal gain .
A quote from the 1997 movie Men in Black springs to mind : “ A person is smart .
People are dumb , panicky dangerous animals and you know it . ”
While some presidents , perhaps many or even most , wo n’t take advantage of legal permissions and an expanded executive branch , it ’d be just naive to think it ca n’t happen .
That ’s where the divide happens between Mr Bush and the others .
A video over on Crooks and Liars has Weekly Standard editor and noted idiot Bill Kristol wondering aloud why Democrats wo n’t give Bush the “ benefit of the doubt ” over the spy bill nonsense .
In that moment , we see all that we need to know about the president ’s attitude , his supporters ’ attitudes , and why they ’re a danger .
More history .
Recall the fuss that popped up when people found out that in 1996 , president Clinton had tried to expand his wiretapping authority and the Republicans fought to shut it down .
Orrin Hatch and others commented on their concerns about giving Clinton extra surveillance powers .
A decade later and suddenly the argument has turned around .
A flip - flop ?
Not exactly .
Often times when speaking , Bush likes to speak by referring to himself as his office rather than with “ me ” or “ I ” .
He says things like “ The president needs to be able to … ” or “ The president must have the ability to … ” and so on .
When he says it , though , he does n’t mean “ the president ” , at least not in the abstract .
He means “ me ” .
Bush ’s attitude , and that of his more vocal supporters , is that of “ hey come on , I ’m not gonna do anything wrong ” as though they were high school students asking to be allowed out of the building to head to McDonald ’s for lunch .
They are n’t looking at the wider implications , only themselves .
The life of George Bush Jr can best be explained as one where he gets to do whatever he wants and when it does n’t go well , he gets bailed out only to trundle off to his next adventure while everyone else worries about the details .
He ’s the “ I wanna ” president , thinking only of himself .
It ’s true that most on the left would n’t trust George W Bush with our pets over the weekend while we head out of town , but that ’s not the point .
Even were it true that Bush had given us no reason not to trust him , that he was an honest man who we believed would do exactly what he said and would not take advantage of our trust , could we give such expansion of powers ?
Of course not .
Just like those high school students , even if it ’s true that they ’re just going to get a Big Mac and come back before 5th period , if we change the law to allow them to run around without oversight it would be downright idiotic to believe that everyone is going to act so honestly .
The question that must always , always be asked when the prospect of making a permanent expansion of powers comes up is “ do I want every president to have this capability ? ”
Maybe you think Bush should be able to round up prisoners and spy on people with absolutely no oversight or checks , but would you trust a Hillary Clinton or , down the road , an even further left liberal a la Kucinich ?
The reverse is true for the lefties , maybe we would n’t mind Clinton or Obama to have them , but what about McCain ?
That ’s just not how Bush and the others look at things .
They view things through the narrow scope of Bush Himself .
They are n’t looking at things through the scope of 2008 , 2012 , or 2060 .
When they talk about “ the president ” needing to be able to spy on whoever he wants , whenever he wants , they just mean “ President Bush ” .
These are the people who would have insisted that George Washington become king , and had Washington himself had Bush ’s attitude , realizing that he certainly would have been a good king , he might have taken the post .
Imagine how different the United States would be today had things panned out that way .
So we ’ve found the Bush legacy .
A selfish lack of regard for the fate of the nation itself and presidential responsibility beyond his own two terms .
He wants to do what he wants , when he wants , and insists that because he ’s a good guy he should be allowed to do it .
Neither he nor his cheerleaders seem to give any thought about what happens after his presidency .
Maybe they think they ’ll just attempt a similar gambit , and rather than having actual set - in - stone laws and limitations we ’ll just mold the office to whomever ’s occupying it .
Washington , Jefferson , et al set up the country to provide safeguards against corruption .
The Constitution splits up power to make sure good presidents can do good and bad presidents can’t mess things up too badly .
Bush , on the other hand , wants us to turn a blind eye to such things , ignore laws and limitations just for him .
Do n’t worry , he ’ll be responsible about it .
Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez Reuters CARACAS , Venezuela ( AP )  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez accused the United States of promoting violence in Tibet , saying Washington aims to weaken China and sabotage the Olympics in Beijing .
" The ( U.S. ) imperialists want to divide China .
And they 're causing problems there in Tibet , " Chavez said in a speech Monday night .
" They 're trying to sabotage the Olympics in Beijing , and behind that is the hand of imperialism . "
" We ask the world to support China to neutralize this plan , " he added .
The deadly riots in Lhasa this month have been the largest and most sustained in almost 20 years , and China has blamed followers of the Dalai Lama for the uprising .
Chavez has built close ties with China and said in an earlier speech Monday that U.S. " imperialism is on the offensive " there .
" You see the images of the violence in Tibet .
Who is that against ?
Against China , " Chavez said .
" It 's the ( U.S. ) empire that wants to weaken China , because China is rising up . "
Chavez , who survived a failed coup in 2002 , has often accused the U.S. of trying to topple his own government — something U.S. officials deny .
He also accused Washington on Monday of trying to " weaken Russia " by supporting independence for Kosovo despite opposition by Serbia and Russia .
He called Kosovo 's new leader , Prime Minister Hashim Thaci , a " terrorist " put in power by the U.S. — even though he was elected by Kosovo 's parliament — and noted that the former rebel leader 's nom de guerre was " The Snake . "

Bihar : Police seize 4 kg of uranium
Anand Mohan Sahay in Patna | February 19 , 2008 12:49 IST
The Bihar police have seized four kg of low - grade uranium in the Supaul district near Nepal border and arrested six persons in this connection , sources said on Tuesday .
The seized uranium is estimated to value crores of rupees in international market .
Police sources in the Supaul district superintendent of police confirmed that four kg of low - grade uranium seized at a bus stop near Nepal border .
" The police with the active help of SSB jawans deployed on the Indo - Nepal border seized four kg uranium from suspected smugglers , " the police said .
The police arrested six persons , including a school teacher , and an SSB jawan posted in Assam .
A senior police official told rediff.com over telephone that the police suspect that seized uranium were being smuggled from Meghalaya and arrested persons were planning to send it to Nepal .
MEXICO CITY  Mexican lawmakers on Tuesday stripped a controversial provision from their plan to overhaul the country ’s judiciary that would have given police officers , who are widely mistrusted here , the ability to enter homes without obtaining warrants beforehand .
Warrantless searches would have been allowed only in emergencies and in cases of hot pursuit of criminal suspects .
But human rights groups had strongly opposed the measure , fearing that a police force notorious for corruption would abuse the authority .
One newspaper labeled the plan the “ Gestapo law . ”
The last - minute change , approved overwhelmingly by the House of Deputies , delays passage of a revamping of the country ’s judicial system that is meant to speed up trials that now stretch on for years and to better equip the country in its battle against narcotics traffickers .
“ In this country , no one is satisfied with our justice system , ” said César Camacho Quiroz , a legislator representing the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party , who opposed the expanded police powers .
How does a business go from an idea in your head to a functioning venture that runs smoothly and turns a profit ?
It helps to get your ideas on paper , and this is where a business plan comes in .
A business plan is essential for materializing your business and getting on the road to success .
I ’ll admit , I ’m a bit intimidated by the thought of sitting down to write a 10 - page document about my business dreams .
Do n’t even get me started on the thought of crunching numbers and making projections about profitability .
For most right - brained creative types , the thought of writing a business plan , complete with all that financial analysis , is daunting .
But it does n’t have to be .
Depending on your business needs , you can make your business plan as formal or informal as you want .
If you are applying for loans or looking for investors , you ’ll want to spend a little more time fleshing out your plan and follow more formal guidelines .
Thankfully , most design businesses are fairly inexpensive and easy to start .
So more than likely , your business plan will be an internal planning document that no one sees but you .
You do n’t want to spend so much time on your planning that it takes away from actually doing , so do n’t sweat writing your plan .
Just do it , a little bit at a time if that helps .
Now , if only I could listen to my own advice !
One of the first things you can do to start the process is become familiar with what a business plan looks like .
Ask colleagues if they ’d be willing to share their plans with you ( minus the financial details if they want ) .
Or , you can find many sample business plans online at places like the Center for Business Planning and the SBA ’s Business Planning Section .
I ’ve found it pretty difficult to find sample business plans for green businesses , much less green graphic design businesses , so just look for something as similar as possible and read through a few plans to get an idea of how they are structured .
Think of your business plan as a living document , one that you can refer back to frequently to gauge your success and make decisions .
Reviewing it quarterly and revising it annually should be scheduled business activities .
Seeing a business plan as a work in progress and something useful for your business makes it a lot less intimidating to write .
So , what should your business plan include ?
It depends on what you ’re using it for , but most business plans include a summary of the business and a mission statement , information on how the business is structured , a description of the market niche — this is a good place to discuss being a green business — and competition , a marketing plan , and a financial plan .
The entire plan will need to incorporate specific , measurable goals for various aspects of the business .
That way when you review it , you can assess whether or not you are meeting those goals .
I started the process of planning a business by buying a business notebook .
It is divided into sections so I can keep my thoughts organized : one for general brainstorming ( like thinking of a business name and mission statement ) , one for financial details , one for research notes , one for marketing ideas , and one for drafts of my business plan .
Having one place to collect your research , notes , and plans helps to get everything organized so it functions as a guide for writing the business plan .
As I prepare to write my plan , I have come across several great resources specific to the creative field .
AIGA ’s Design and Resources section has numerous articles on running a design firm , including this very useful Creative Business article on business planning .
The Zen of Business Plans is another great article on the topic .
How you write your plan has a lot to do with its purpose and the reasons behind writing it , so the first step is to figure out why you ’re writing one .
If you ’re like me , it may help to think of writing your business plan as another design project , so that you look forward to working on it .
Of course , you will want to use your design skills when organizing your plan , just do n’t go overboard with the visuals while neglecting the content .
Make sure that as you plan your business , you consider sustainability at every step of the way .
Green business is a growing market niche , and being green will help you stand out from competitors in your industry , so be sure to emphasize this in your plan .
How will you assess your environmental impact and determine if you ’re as sustainable as possible ?
In what ways can you measure success not just for your business , but for the planet ?
How will being green affect your accounting , your profit margin , and your marketing ?
These are all things for the ecopreneur to consider when putting together a business plan .
A lot of freelancers or sole proprietors in the creative field that I ’ve talked to do n’t even have a business plan .
But even if you ’re already operating , a business plan is a good idea .
You ’ll have more information on your finances and operations available than a brand - new business would , so plans for existing businesses differ from those of new start - ups .
For a new venture , your plan will involve more guesswork and goal - setting than hard facts and numbers .
And that ’s fine .
Cater your plan to whatever stage of your business you are in .
It is ultimately a tool for you anyway , so it can take whatever form you need it to take .
The important thing is that you have one , because that cliche , “ the business that fails to plan , plans to fail , ” tends to be true .
Writing a business plan is a great exercise in organizing your thoughts , cementing your goals , and giving you a reference point to assess your business success .
Now , it ’s probably time I started writing my business plan instead of writing this article .
Please feel free to comment and share your business plan tips , ideas , and even frustrations .
I ’ll need all the motivation I can get to get this thing on paper !

The Wall Street Journal ( subscription required ) just broke the story that Yahoo ’s board plans to reject Microsoft $ 44.6 billion offer , citing our favorite source : “ a person familiar with the situation . ”
Apparently , $ 31 per share “ massively undervalues ” Yahoo , according to the same source .
The logic is that the offer does n’t take into account risks
Yahoo would go through ( that is , if regulators overturned the deal ) by entering into an agreement with Microsoft .
Accordingly , Yahoo ’s board will send a letter to Microsoft on Monday explaining the situation .
This article comes just hours after another WSJ article quotes several investment bankers who basically say that “ investors have lost confidence in Yahoo management ’s ability to reverse the company ’s fortunes on its own . ”
Nevertheless , here ’s Yahoo ’s reasoning for rejecting the offer :

Kfir soldiers are at it again ?
Three IDF soldiers belonging to the Haruv battalion of the Kfir Brigade were detained Wednesday by Military Police investigators on suspicion of beating up two Palestinian boys and placing a heater against the face of one of them , Ynet has learned .
Kfir forces have been implicated in incidents involving problematic conduct twice in recent months .
In one case , troops abducted a Palestinian taxi driver without authorization , while recently troops belonging to the brigade were videotaped exposing their rear ends to Palestinians and international activists in the West Bank .
Questionable Conduct Hebron : IDF soldiers expose themselves to Palestinians Ali Waked ( Video ) Peace activist films Israeli soldiers exposing rear ends to Palestinian shepherds .

Soldiers sentenced to 21 days in prison following tape 's release Hebron : IDF soldiers expose themselves to Palestinians
The investigation into the affair was launched after a female soldier who serves in the battalion turned to the battalion commander and told him that three soldiers beat up two Palestinian boys aged 16.5 a short time after they were detained on suspicion of burning tires .
According to the female soldier , the two Palestinian detainees were beat up while they were handcuffed and after their eyes were covered .
The soldier , who witnessed some of the abuse , said that the troops kicked the Palestinians , hit them using hand restraints , and swore at them .
The evidence submitted to the court includes a testimony that charges the soldiers with placing a heater against the face of one of the boys .
Military Police investigators questioned the two Palestinian boys and another female soldier who was present at the scene of the incident , the battalion 's West Bank base .
The investigators discovered that the troops under investigation instructed the female soldier not to say anything about what she saw .
' Acts taint IDF 's image '
Two of the three soldiers have already admitted to the charges , while a third one is denying the allegations .
His attorney said that the Palestinian teens were treated properly and that a heater was placed near one of their sleeping bags because of the cold weather .
The attorney objected to the soldier 's arrest and said that he was troubled by the attitude shown to combat soldiers .
However , the prosecutor in the case made it clear that the soldiers will be indicted next week on suspicion of abuse under grave circumstances .
The president of the military court in Jaffa , Colonel Avi Levy , said that the three soldiers " behaved inhumanely " towards the detainees .
Moreover , Levy said that the suspicions are strongly backed by evidence , and that the violence constituted a case of " physically hurting vulnerable people after their eyes were covered and their hands were handcuffed . "
" The actions are characterized by cruelty and violence , " the judge says .
" We are dealing with acts that seriously taint the IDF , its image , and the country 's image , and which contradict the fundamental values of any army , and even more so the Israel Defense Forces . "
For a while , most folks felt secure knowing they were over the 620 - 640 FICO mark with their credit score .
This number of course being the rough borderline for subprime credit .
And up until now , that was pretty much all you needed .
However , as the housing bubble bursts open , it gets everything wet .
We ’ve been watching the effects creep closer and closer into other markets , and now it ’s pushing the minimum requirements up even higher for non-subprime buyers .
According to Pioneer Press :
If you think you ’re exempt from the current credit crunch because you have a decent credit score , think again .
Things are tightening up for folks looking for a mortgage or to refinance , even those not in the subprime category .
Lenders now expect borrowers to have solid proof of their income , more money down and higher credit scores than in the past .
For example , consumers with a FICO score in the 640 range that once qualified for 100 percent financing and a decent interest rate will see that rate go up a quarter of a percent or so , said Mark Teteris , CEO of Lakeland Mortgage , a residential mortgage lender in Bloomington .
Such borrowers should also expect to scrape together a down payment of at least 5 percent , he said .
The changes for new borrowers stem from a tightening in standards by government - sponsored entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and by other investors that buy pools of mortgages .
During the mortgage boom of the past several years , some pools of loans that were rated “ investment - grade ” turned out to be loaded with high - risk borrowers .
When these borrowers began to default on their mortgages , investors who bought the loan pools as mortgage - backed securities got burned and banks and GSEs holding the mortgages were hit by steep credit losses .
Now investors and GSEs are raising their standards in hopes of lowering their risk in the future .
This is no temporary blip , bankers and other lenders say .
“ I ’d say this is going to be long term , ” said Jim Miley , president of residential real estate for Bremer Financial Corp. in St. Paul .
Miley said he has seen a definite upward migration in desired FICO scores .
“ I think we will continue to tighten until the investors are satisfied that the mortgage pools are basically ‘ what you see is what you get . ’ ”
The changes and stricter standards do n’t mean that borrowers are locked out of the housing market altogether .
“ Today you can go out and get a very rock - solid purchase price on a home and a very good mortgage , ” Miley said .
“ You are going to be processed in a more prudent manner and you should be expecting to have a down payment . ”
While a year ago , a plethora of 100 percent financing products existed , such options could be nearing extinction .
Bremer and Lakeland both have pulled back on such offers , Miley and Teteris said .
But what if you do n’t have 5 percent to put down ?
…
Still , some borrowers may be out of luck .
Mary Wetterlin , general manager of the first mortgage division at TopLine Federal Credit Union in Maple Grove said she ’s met with several customers hoping to refinance before the interest rates on their adjustable rate mortgages go up this fall .
She ’s having to say no more frequently than she would like .
For some homeowners , the value of their house has gone down as the inventory of unsold houses in their area has risen .
Others do n’t have enough equity to refinance , because they ’ve already refinanced or borrowed some of the equity they had in their home to pay for improvements , discretionary items or debts .
Try as she might , Wetterlin just ca n’t make refinancings work for borrowers like these .
TopLine sells its loans to Fannie Mae , and “ The Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs of the world are not so willing to take that debt , ” Wetterlin said .
“ Maybe a few years ago they would have been willing to do that … but that has gone away . ”
…
“ We just ca n’t help people , even if we wanted to , ” Wetterlin said .
“ I feel like I am sounding like Ebenezer Scrooge . …
On the one hand I do n’t want to see these neighborhoods blow up and end up ( with ) rows of foreclosed homes . …
But it ’s a struggle . ”

Most of us are familiar with the cliché about tradeoffs : fast , cheap , or good , choose any two .
When it comes to holograms — two - dimensional media that can be used to create a three - dimensional image — there has been a well - defined series of tradeoffs among fast rewritability , image quality , image persistence , and image size .
A paper that will appear in today 's issue of Nature describes the production of a polymer that makes huge strides on all of these problems .
As a result , rewritable holograms have become faster and better ( although there was no mention of cost ) .
Image : Savas Tay , University of Arizona
The new material is comprised of photorefractive polymers .
These chemicals have photoelectric properties that make them well - suited to storing the optical interference patterns used to produce holograms .
When a photorefractive polymer is exposed to a pattern of bright and dark areas , electrons are released from the areas exposed to high - intensity light and migrate to areas that are darker .
Once in place , the electron - rich areas diffract light differently from the electron - poor ones , allowing the original interference pattern to be reproduced when the material is exposed to light .
This process is normally slow , and the electrons will gradually return to their starting points , erasing the image .
The paper indicates that previous work with photorefractive polymers had used materials where the image only lasted about as long as it took to record it .
The new material makes a 10,000 - fold improvement on that figure : data written in half a second can persist for up to three hours , provided an electric field ( 4 kiloVolts ) is applied to the holographic device .
These devices are also reasonably large ( 100 square centimeters in this case ) and durable , having survived several months of repeated tests .
The researchers used a number of tricks to get this improved performance .
The first was the use of a carefully chosen co-polymer that both helps evenly distribute the photorefractive material and serves as an electron donor , which speeds up the process of creating areas with different charges .
They further sped the process by what they termed " voltage kick - off . "
This simply involves exposing the material to more than double the storage voltage ( 9 kV in this case ) during the writing process , which helps push the electrons to new locations .
The paper describes using the new device for two different types of holograms .
One is simply the storage of a three dimensional image produced by traditional holographic methods .
The second , holographic stereography , reveals the technique 's full potential .
In this case , stacks of two - dimensional image data , such as those produced by MRIs , CAT scans , and topographical data , can be encoded into the photorefractive material in such a way that the human visual system can interpret the resulting hologram as a full , three dimensional reconstruction .
The authors suggest that there are clear medical and military uses for these displays as things currently stand .
If the material is as robust as it appears to be , refinements in its manufacturing and properties may eventually produce the first mass - market holographic display .

So , why were oil inventories down less than expected ?
Because refinery utilization continues to languish .
You can see that in the utilization numbers , and you can see it in the fact that gasoline had an unexpected draw .
Imports were also up from the previous week , surprising given the situation in Mexico .
The other big surprise ?
Gasoline demand is still almost 1 % above last year ’s level .
( Do n’t overlook the role of ethanol there .
As ethanol is added to the fuel supply , volume demand will go up even if miles driven do n’t .
I have documented that here ) .
However , we are still close enough that it wo n’t take much volatility to push oil over $ 100 .
A single negative geopolitical event should do it .
But in the absence of a brand new geopolitical or weather - related event , I will be very surprised if we do n’t pull back a bit from $ 100 in the next couple of days .
About 10 seconds after the report was released , I scanned down and found what I was looking for : U.S. commercial crude oil inventories ( excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ) fell by 0.8 million barrels compared to the previous week .
I turned to the guy sitting next to me , as we had been talking about this today , and I said “ $ 100 oil may have to wait for another day .
The inventory draw was half what was expected . ”
We could still pop $ 100 today , but this inventory report does n’t favor that .
A higher expected draw was already factored in , so I do n’t think this supports a quick move up from the current price level .
But I would n't put $ 1,000 on it .
( those linking directly to this point , scroll up for the beginning of the post , please )
Here were the highlights :
U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 14.9 million barrels per day during the week ending November 2 , down 43,000 barrels per day from the previous week 's average .
Refineries operated at 86.2 percent of their operable capacity last week .
Gasoline production fell compared to the previous week , averaging nearly 8.9 million barrels per day .
Distillate fuel production rose last week , averaging nearly 4.2 million barrels per day .
U.S. crude oil imports averaged nearly 9.7 million barrels per day last week , up 275,000 barrels per day from the previous week .
Over the last four weeks , crude oil imports have averaged 9.6 million barrels per day , or 461,000 barrels per day less than averaged over the same four - week period last year .
Total motor gasoline imports ( including both finished gasoline and gasoline blending components ) last week averaged 1,131,000 barrels per day .
Distillate fuel imports averaged 270,000 barrels per day last week .
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories ( excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ) fell by 0.8 million barrels compared to the previous week .
At 311.9 million barrels , U.S. crude oil inventories are in the upper half of the average range for this time of year .
Total motor gasoline inventories decreased by 0.8 million barrels last week , and are at the lower end of the average range .
Both finished gasoline inventories and gasoline blending components fell last week .
Distillate fuel inventories increased by 0.1 million barrels , and are at the upper limit of the average range for this time of year .
Propane / propylene inventories decreased 0.4 million barrels last week .
Total commercial petroleum inventories decreased by 0.9 million barrels last week , but are in the upper half of the average range for this time of year .
Total products supplied over the last four - week period has averaged nearly 20.7 million barrels per day , down by 0.4 percent compared to the similar period last year .
Over the last four weeks , motor gasoline demand has averaged 9.3 million barrels per day , or 0.8 percent above the same period last year .
Distillate fuel demand has averaged 4.2 million barrels per day over the last four weeks , down
2.4 percent compared to the same period last year .
Jet fuel demand is down 1.2 percent over the last four weeks compared to the same four - week period last year .
$ 100 Edition ? - to be updated following the release of the report
It seems that every bit of news lately favors higher oil prices .
In the wake of a perfect storm of weather - related and geopolitical events , Tapis went through the $ 100 mark overnight , and WTI is knocking at the door .
In case you have been asleep for a week , the Fed cut interest rates , Mexico ’s oil - rich Tabasco region is underwater , and oil companies are evacuating platforms in some parts of the North Sea ahead of a fierce storm predicted to generate 35 - foot waves .
The wind is howling in Aberdeen already , and did so throughout the night .
( One of my engineers is stuck offshore and may have to ride out the storm , forecast for Thursday . )
Predictions are for a 1.6 million barrel draw for crude oil stocks this week .
That expectation is factored into the price , so if we see less than that , crude could quickly give up some ground to profit - taking .
However , the predictions for a draw may be too conservative , in which case WTI should quickly pop over $ 100 .
Gasoline inventories are forecast to rise by 200,000 barrels , and distillate inventories are expected to fall by 500,000 barrels .
Consider that the draws of the past 3 weeks have been much larger than predicted .
I think the primary reason for that is a variable that analysts have n’t factored in :
Some refiners are drawing down stocks and trying to wait out these prices .
Consider it from their perspective , and it makes perfect sense .
You have filled your tanks with oil at $ 80 .
You believe that we are in a speculative bubble .
Therefore , you will risk drawing down inventories somewhat , and hoping that prices correct soon .
If you fill your tanks at $ 100 , and the price corrects back to $ 85 , you are going to sell gasoline at a loss for a while .
The risk in that strategy is obvious .
But I do have direct knowledge that some are employing such a strategy .
So , there is that factor to consider with respect to the crude draw down .
But the situation in Mexico , a large provider of U.S. imports , may cause the draw to be much steeper .
This event has gotten very little attention in the media , but Mexican President Felipe Calderon said that the oil industry there has been devastated , and exports have ground to a halt .
If it is as bad as it sounds , we should see a much larger draw than anticipated .
The final factor that may contribute to a larger than anticipated draw is the one that analysts have factored in : Refineries will be coming out of turnarounds .
However , utilization rates have been lower than expected , primarily due to low margins .
As I have mentioned before , if margins are poor , you are n’t exactly scrambling to process as many barrels as you can .
So the utilization patterns of the past couple of years may not be a good guide for this year ’s utilization pattern .
Utilization should come up , which would lead to downward pressure on inventories , but it 's not a sure thing .
My prediction ?
While I have made it through 85 % of the year , I think I will lose my $ 1,000 bet within 24 hours .
However , I do n’t expect oil to stay there for very long .
I think it will return to $ 100 - probably to stay - in 2008 , but I believe it has gotten ahead of itself at the moment .
There were two scenarios that I foresaw as potentially causing me to lose the bet .
One , Saudi production could continue to decline , and I would surely lose it .
That did not happen .
In fact , indications are that Saudi is increasing production , although just how much spare capacity they have is debatable .
Two , a series of unfortunate events , which I identified as " a bad hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico , combined with terrorist attacks or pipeline problems ( or any number of things ) " could cause me to lose it .
Well , we have had saber - rattling and finally sanctions with Iran , storms in Mexico , storms in the North Sea , a collapsing dollar , and growing demand combined with flat production .
I think that qualifies as a series of unfortunate events .
If that happens , I will have a post dedicated to the bet , including a bit of information about my mystery betting partner .
The Flashbulb , aka Benn Jordan , became so outraged when he discovered that iTunes was effectively pirating his music , that he uploaded copies of his latest album to BitTorrent .
Torrent Freak caught up with Benn to learn more about the decision to stop distributors and ' coked - up label reps ' from getting all the cash .
An established , but outraged musician has decided to shun conventional distribution methods by following other recent initiatives ( such as Radiohead ’s ‘ In Rainbows ’ promotion ) by making his latest album available for free download .
It ’s available on BitTorrent on sites like The Pirate Bay , with so - called ‘ OiNK replacement ’ site , What.cd , providing the album on ‘ free leech ’ to encourage more downloads .
TorrentFreak caught up with Benn Jordan who told us he ’s not just disillusioned , he ’s ‘ outraged ’ that iTunes is selling his work without permission and seemingly keeping all the money .
TF : Please tell us a little bit about yourself and your musical journey .
Benn : I ’m Benn and I ’m 29 years old .
I started playing classical guitar when I was about 5 , and since then , all I ’ve wanted to do with my life was make music .
Now 20 - some odd years later , I feel lucky to tell you that I make music for a living .
I ’ve been releasing albums for about 14 years on various indy labels , and in the last 5 years I ’ve also been composing for television , film , and ads .
Music has allowed me to travel the world , meet thousands of wonderful people , and express myself through my work .
It seems impossible to me that I ’m on this planet for any other reason than writing music .
My label , on the other hand , does n’t have a complex or radical plan .
Our goal is to simply compensate our artists as much as possible , and that includes utilizing the “ digital revolution ” to our advantage , instead of punishing our artists by punishing their fans .
TF : Tell us a little about your dealings with labels and ‘ the industry ’ and why you became disillusioned .
Benn : Luckily , my record contracts were always negotiated well .
Once things started moving with small labels I was approached by some larger ones , but there was always some seedy stipulation that prevented me from ever signing .
Still , with a 50/50 contract , I ’d be selling 2,000 albums and would get $ 250 for it somehow .
Many people that i’d meet at my shows would say that they bought my music on iTunes , yet I ’ve never signed any sort of agreement allowing iTunes to host my music , and I ’ve certainly never seen a dime of money for my albums hosted there .
So I started investigating the numbers from the label , which led me to some shocking revelations about how little the artist and label was getting in comparison to the retailers .
When I got around to asking about iTunes , the owner of Sublight Records pleaded with me to “ leave it be ” .
Everyone else made an extraordinary effort to ignore my calls and emails .
When I finally got a hold of the digital distributor ( I must note that “ digital distributor ” is the most pathetic job title I ’ve ever heard ) , I was told that once the files are in the iTunes system , it literally could n’t be removed or taken down for a year .
So , either Apple has created a self - aware doomsday machine that cannot be stopped or reasoned with , or everyone involved is just enjoying the gravy train of ripping off artists like myself and using Apple ’s backbone of attorneys as an intimidation factor .
Even after having a lawyer working for me on this matter , this is the one and only response we ’ve EVER been able to get from Apple :
Dear Benn ,
I understand that you are writing to the iTunes Store because you are upset about finding your own album “ The Flashlight ” and some of your other album as well on the iTunes Store , and that you feel that you are owned
royalties for this music that his being purchased .
I am sorry that you have to found this upsetting .
My name is Wendy , and I would be happy to link you to right people to talk to about this issue
So , who ’s the pirate I should go after ?
A kid who downloads my album because it is n’t available in non-DRM format and costs $ 30 on Amazon ?
Or a huge multi-billion dollar corporation that has been selling thousands of dollars worth of my music and not even acknowledging it ?
I ’m not disillusioned , I ’m outraged , and anyone who ever spent a dime on buying music through these distribution methods should be outraged too .
Here we are pleading with people to not steal music , and then we hand them dog shit when they go out of their way to buy it .
TF : You were a member of OiNK .
Could you tell us a bit about your time there and how you used the site ?
Benn : OiNK was an amazing network .
As an avid - collector of ultra-rare old jazz records , I ’ll tell you right now that it was the most complete and diverse library of music the world has ever seen .
I filled some requests by uploading some of my rarer albums there .
Eventually I started being harassed by someone on the network who was sending screen grabs of my seed lists to record labels .
Upon complaining , a moderator simply removed my ability to communicate with anyone on the network or post comments on torrents .
I can understand the paranoia and strictness .
I guess I just sort of laughed it off and stopped using it .
When Oink went down , the only thing that surprised me was that the servers were n’t hidden in some weird country .
TF : Could you tell us more about the support you ’re getting from one of the so - called ‘ OiNK replacement ’ sites , ‘ What.cd ’ ?
Benn :
It was really a fresh breath of air for What.cd to promote the idea of artists having involvement with their own torrents .
Not only does it benefit the artist to no end , but I ca n’t imagine that any court in the world would be able to pin someone on copyright infringement for a torrent the copyright holder created .
TF : Aside from uploading your own albums , at times you took an anti-piracy stance at OiNK , why the big change of heart ?
Benn : I do n’t think my stance has changed all that much .
It ’d be a great PR move to say that I ’m pro-piracy , but I ’d be lying .
I keep seeing these internet news stories saying things like “ The Flashbulb Promotes Piracy ” .
It is totally out of control .
How could I be promoting piracy if I ’m uploading my own material with a “ buy it if you like it ” message in the torrent ?
What I ’m promoting is the artist ’s freedom to choose what can and ca n’t be done with his / her music , and more importantly , the listener ’s freedom to do what he / she wants with their own computer , MP3 player , or internet connection .
After a journey through miles and miles of bullshit in this industry , you learn one thing :
If you want something done right , you ’ve got to do it yourself .
Whether you ’re downloading my music to check it out , to accompany the CD , or even pirating it … I want you to have a version / rip of it that I ’ve listened to and approved of .
TF : You say you ’re not pro-piracy yet you downloaded stuff from OiNK and also What.cd .
One position seems to conflict the other .
How do you explain this ?
Benn :
In my case I think that visible list of downloads strengthens my point .
Most of those downloads are actually albums I already own ( much easier to download than to record an entire vinyl album ) , albums I previewed but did n’t like , or albums I simply cannot find available in a suitable DRM - free format ( including CD ) .
Some of the software , like the TomTom DVD on my list , is actually impossible to technically “ pirate ” because you ca n’t buy a US TomTom GPS unit without the software .
The thing is , when a tracker gets busted , the companies count these towards their losses .
So , my new album currently has 6381 downloads at the time of this interview on what .cd alone .
Using that deceitful equation , my losses are over $ 100,000 .
If I wanted to , I could subtract those losses from my profit and completely get out of paying any income taxes .
It makes sense from an evil , corporate , criminal - minded standpoint , right ?
Beyond that , iTunes and other services simply are not acceptable to me .
No company will have any control over a product that I legally own after I buy it , period .
Oink was the biggest music library in the world .
People did n’t use it because they were criminals , people used it because it was literally better than any service you could pay for .
It was the stubborn behavior of the record labels , artists , and government that would n’t allow that music library to have a cash register at the front door .
The thing RIAA is scared of is that their billion dollar backbone can no longer shelter people from exploring music themselves .
Their business plan had evolved into telling the world what they will want to listen to and buy , and now they ’ll have to actually compete with talented artists again .
As the people regain control of the market , music will be judged by it ’s content again and will be subjected to it ’s own Darwinism .
It is a very interesting time for the music industry … and since my entire life is devoted to making music , bring it on .
I hope that this situation with my new record proves to other labels and artists that giving people exactly what they want is the smartest way to conduct any business .
TF : How do you feel about people being heavily punished for sharing music ?
Benn :
Obviously , the last thing I would want is anyone to be fined or imprisoned for listening to my music .
Another feature of uploading my own torrent is that it creates a little legal nesting area on a network otherwise deemed illegal by most governments and RIAA .
When someone else uploads a torrent of my music , it is without my approval …on the other end of things , and more importantly , when someone raids an admin ’s apartment … no police officer is asking me if I want to press charges .
TF : What happens when people donate ?
Benn :
If you decide that you like the album , you ’ll have the option of donating directly to the artist .
If you decide that you ’d like a CD , you ’ll be able to order it directly from my label .
I ’ve even hired my mother to run our shipping department since she ’s the most obsessive - compulsive - perfectionist office worker that I ’ve ever laid eyes on .
Finally , every detail of my album ’s content , release , and business is done exactly the way I want it to be done .
I hope other artists realize how liberating and profitable it is compared to the distribution system we ’ve all become so accustomed to .
TF : Radiohead did really quite well after they offered ‘ In Rainbows ’ online for free .
You ’re a few days into this experiment – how is it going for you ?
Benn :
My donations have a way to go before they match the numbers from CD pre-orders , but I ’m still crossing my fingers .
In a week or so I plan to release a detailed statistical report .
For some reason I really like making pie charts .
TF : I ’ve listened to the album – Soundtrack To A Vacant Life – and I really enjoyed it .
Could you tell us some more about it ?
Benn :
It was 2 years in the making , and is conceptually me attempting to write the soundtrack to my own life .
Of course this means that it is much more cinematic than electronic , and the songs all connect chronologically .
Those who have heard my previous albums can expect this one to be a lot more melodic , tame , and instrumental .
Suggested listening is with a decent pair of headphones from start to finish .
TF : I have some , I ’ll try that later .
Thanks for your time .

In putting together my new book , So Wrong for So Long , on Iraq and the media , I revisited the good , the bad , and the ugly in war coverage from the run-up to the invasion through the five years of controversy that followed .
Even though I monitored the coverage closely all along , I was continually surprised to come across once - prominent names , quotes , and incidents that had faded to obscurity .
Here is a list of 18 of those nearly forgotten episodes , in roughly chronological order .
1 ) The day before the invasion , Bill O’Reilly said , “ If the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it ’s clean , he has nothing , I will apologize to the nation ; I will not trust the Bush administration again , all right ? ”
2 ) Phil Donahue lost his show at MSNBC , he later claimed , because he did not wave the flag enough .
A leaked NBC memo confirmed Donahue ’s suspicion , noting that the host “ presents a difficult public face for NBC in a time of war … .
At the same time our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity . ”
3 ) After the fall of Baghdad , MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews declared , “ We ’re all neocons now . ”
4 ) The same day , Joe Scarborough , also on MSNBC , said , “ I ’m waiting to hear the words ‘ I was wrong ’ from some of the world ’s most elite journalists , politicians , and Hollywood types . ”
5 ) The New York Times ‘ Thomas Friedman wrote , “ As far as I am concerned , we do not need to find any weapons of mass destruction to justify this war … .
Mr. Bush does n’t owe the world any explanation for missing chemical weapons . ”
6 ) President Bush ’s comedy routine during the Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner in Washington , D.C. , on March 24 , 2004 , included a bit about the still - missing WMD .
While a slide show of the president scouring the White House was projected on the wall behind him , he joked , “ Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere … Nope , no weapons over there … Maybe under here ? ”
Most of the crowd roared , and there was little criticism in the media in following days .
Mother Jones ‘ David Corn , then Washington editor of The Nation , was one of the few attendees to criticize the routine .
Corn wondered if they would have laughed if Ronald Reagan had , following the truck bombing of our Marine barracks in Beirut , which killed 241 , said at a similar dinner , “ Guess we forgot to put in a stoplight . ”
7 ) Who was the first mainstream editor / columnist to call for a U.S. pullout ?
It was the unlikely Allen H. Neuharth , founder of USA Today , who is certainly not known for expressing anti-war or liberal views .
His May 2004 column drew wide reader protest but “ the old fighting infantryman ” ( as the former soldier billed himself ) stuck to his guns and penned a few more columns in that vein in the years that followed .
8 ) When the New York Times carried its now - famous editors ’ note on May 26 , 2004 , admitting some errors in its WMD coverage , it appeared on page A10 and Judith Miller ’s name was nowhere to be found .
The note is often described today as an “ apology , ” but it was no such thing .
On the day it ran , Executive Editor Bill Keller , not exactly chastened , called criticism of the Times ‘ coverage “ overwrought ” and said that the main reason it even published the note was because the controversy had become a “ distraction . ”
9 ) Likewise , it ’s often said that the Washington Post also issued an apology .
But the criticism of its prewar coverage came not in an editors ’ statement but in an article by the paper ’s media critic , Howard Kurtz .
Post editors offered several defenses for the coverage and top editor Len Downie argued that it did n’t make much difference anyway , because tougher coverage would not have stopped the war .
10 ) Stephen Colbert ’s routine at the White House Correspondents ’
Association dinner in April 2006 is remembered for the in - his - face mockery of President Bush — but he also spanked the press , perhaps one reason his mainstream reviews were mixed at best .
Addressing the correspondents directly , Colbert said , “ Let ’s review the rules .
The president makes decisions ; he ’s the decider .
The press secretary announces those decisions , and you people of the press type those decisions down .
Make , announce , type .
Put them through a spell - check and go home .
Get to know your family again .
Make love to your wife .
Write that novel you got kicking around in your head .
You know , the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration .
You know — fiction . ”
11 ) In one of the purest “ my bads ” of the war , Fox News ’ John Gibson ripped Neil Young after the rocker released his protest album Living With War .
Gibson demanded that Young go see the new United 93 movie and even offered to buy his ticket .
Young , it was soon pointed out , had actually written one of the first 9/11 songs —
” Let ’s Roll , ” about , you guessed it , Flight 93 .
12 ) Surprise : David Brooks , Thomas Friedman , and Oliver North all came out against the “ surge ” last January after it was announced by President Bush .
George
Will wrote a column titled , “ Surge , or Power Failure ? ”
And , after the botched hanging of Saddam , Charles Krauthammer declared , “ We should not be surging American troops in defense of such a government . ”
13 ) When Valerie Plame finally testified before Congress in March 2007 , much of the media coverage focused on her appearance .
Mary Ann Akers wrote a piece for the Washington Post titled “ Hearing Room Chic , ” noting that Plame wore “ a fetching jacket and pants ” and should be played by Katie Holmes in the movie version of her story because they both favor Armani .
14 ) On March 27 , 2007 , John McCain , referring to the supposed calm settling on Baghdad , said , “ General Petraeus goes out there almost every day in an unarmed Humvee . ”
This turned out to be pure bunk , but McCain quickly visited Iraq to try to prove his overall point .
There , the Arizona senator went from the ridiculous to the maligned , touring a Baghdad market and claiming all was safe — while troops surrounded him and helicopters twirled overhead .
Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind . ) likened the scene to “ a normal outdoor market in Indiana in the summertime . ”
15 ) In April 2007 , CBS ’ Bob Simon admitted to Bill Moyers that his network should have dug deeper into the false claims on WMD .
“ I think we all felt from the beginning that to deal with a subject as explosive as this , we should keep it , in a way , almost light — if that does n’t seem ridiculous , ” he said .
16 ) Contrary to popular belief , the New York Times , which had editorialized against the invasion , did not call for a change in course or the beginning of a withdrawal from Iraq until July 8 , 2007 .
17 ) On Meet the Press in July 2007 , David Brooks declared that 10,000 Iraqis a month would perish if the United States pulled out .
Bob Woodward , also on the show , challenged him on this , asking for his source .
Brooks admitted , “ I just picked that 10,000 out of the air . ”
18 ) Also in July 2007 , an old clip of a C - SPAN interview with Vice President Cheney from 1994 surfaced , in which he defended the decision not to depose Saddam Hussein during Gulf War I : “ Once you got to Iraq and took it over … then what are you going to put in its place ?
… It ’s a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq . ”
He explained , “ And the question for the president … was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth ?
Our judgment was , not very many , and I think we got it right . ”
In case anyone is confused , the logo to the left is not endorsed or supported by Wal - Mart , the mega retailer often criticized for its stores ’ negative impact on communities , the pay and benefits provided to its workers and its promotion of products made in overseas sweatshops where workers toil in inhumane conditions for nominal pay .
A Georgia man who came up with the logo as part of his protest campaign against the retailer got sued by the billion - dollar corporation for his efforts .
But today , in a resounding win for the First Amendment ( and for Public Citizen , which defended the man ) , a federal judge told Wal - Mart that nobody in their right mind would buy their trademark infringement claims .
Political and social parody , like the type Charles Smith of Conyers , Ga. uses at his www.walocaust.com and www.walqaeda.com sites , is a cherished tradition that goes back to the founding of this country .
If Wal - Mart had won , think of the impact the ruling might have had on blogs , artists , photographers and writers who use parody to criticize companies .
Here ’s what Paul Alan Levy , the Public Citizen attorney who argued the case , had to say about the ruling :
“ This ruling shows that even the biggest company in America is subject to parody , and that trademark rights must yield to the right of free speech .
This is a resounding victory for First Amendment rights and sends a clear message to big corporations that would try to use their deep pockets to intimidate and silence their critics . ”
You can read the decision and other documents related to the case at the Public Citizen site .
The magic of template tags
Over the last couple days I ’ve spent some time discussing the word “ magic ” and exploring just what it really means , with an emphasis on the fact that a lot of “ magic ” in programming — though initially counterintuitive and not at all what you ’d expect to have happen ( and it ’s precisely this reason which usualy makes “ magic ” a bad idea ) — boils down to applications of fairly simple principles .
As a real - world demonstration of that , yesterday we saw how to build a Python module object dynamically and make it work with import even though it did n’t exist anywhere on the file system .
When I mentioned Django ’s “ magic - removal ” effort the other day , I mentioned that it did n’t quite purge all of the “ magic ” from Django :
there ’s still a minor amount of magic in how custom template tags work , but it ’s not nearly so bad and most people never even notice it ( until they have a tag library which raises an ImportError and start wondering why Django thinks the tags should be living in django .
templatetags , but that ’s a story for another day ) .
Today is another day and we now have a little better understanding of just what “ magic ” can mean , so let ’s take a look at the last little bit of real magic left in Django .
The magic
If you ’ve ever tried to load a tag or filter library that did n’t exist , or was n’t inside in application in your INSTALLED_APPS setting , or which had an error inside it which raised an ImportError , you ’ve probably seen an error message like this :
TemplateSyntaxError : ' no_library_here ' is not a valid tag library : Could not load template library from django.templatetags.no_library_here
Which leads naturally to the question of why Django is looking in django .
templatetags to find the tag library : should n’t it be looking inside the installed applications , hunting for templatetags modules there ?
The trick
Unlike yesterday ’s exercise , there ’s no hacking of sys.modules going on here , and no magical generation of runtime module objects ; when Django successfully loads a template tag library , it ’s pulling it from the actual location on your file system where you put it .
And , unlike the magic django . models namespace that models were placed into in Django 0.90 and 0.91 , django .
templatetags does actually exist ; a quick look at the code shows the technique being used here ( the following is , at the moment , the full content of django / templatetags / __init__.py :
from django.conf import settings for a in settings .
INSTALLED_APPS : try : __path__ .
extend ( __import__ ( a + '. templatetags ' , {} , {} , [ '' ] ) .
__path__ ) except ImportError : pass
This works because Python modules ( or “ packages ” if you prefer that terminology , though it ’s a bit loaded ) let you assign to a specially - named variable — __path__ — which should be a list of modules .
Each module listed in __path__ will , no matter where it ’s actually located on your filesystem , be treated from then on as if it also exists as a sub-module of the module whose __path__ list it appears in .
So what this code is doing is simply looping through the INSTALLED_APPS setting and , for each application listed , trying to import a templatetags module from that application and add that module ’s __path__ ( meaning the list of custom tag libraries inside it ) to the __path__ of django .
templatetags .
If the attempted import raises an ImportError ( which usually indicates there ’s no templatetags module in a given application ) , Django simply skips that one and moves on to the next .
The end result of this is that any custom tag libraries defined inside templatetags modules in your installed applications will — in addition to their normal locations — be importable from paths under django .
templatetags .
Practical magic
In a lot of cases , apparently “ magical ” things really do n’t serve any useful purpose and so can — and should — be removed in favor of more natural techniques .
In this case , though , the “ magical ” extension of django .
templatetags serves a very useful purpose : looping over INSTALLED_APPS and importing and initializing all the available tag libraries can be an expensive and time - consuming process .
Doing it every time a template used the { % load %} tag would bring the performance of Django ’s template system to a screeching halt , so we need to have some way of making it faster .
In this case , on option would be to maintain a cache of known tag libraries — maybe the same sort of thing Python does with sys.modules to keep track of which modules have already been imported and initialized — and that would n’t be such a bad idea .
But extending the __path__ of django .
templatetags works just as well , and makes for extremely compact loading code : you can simply take the name of the tag library the { % load %} tag asked for , concatenate it onto the string “ django.templatetags ” and try to import the result .
The __path__ method , then , gives the needed performance boost , and also has a useful side effect : since the list of all importable tag libraries lives in django.templatetags .__path__ , it ’s easy to loop through that list to find out what libraries are available ( this is how the tag and filter documentation in the admin interface works , for example : it ’s a simple for loop over django.templatetags.__path__ .
Also , this “ magic ” does n’t get in the way of normal Python imports : the module stays right where it was originally defined , and you can — if you need access to code within it — simply import it exactly as you ’d expect , without having to go through the django .
templatetags namespace .
Where it does cause problems
This does sometimes cause confusion , because there are cases where the unexpected “ Could not load template library from django .
templatetags ” message can be a red herring that leads people down the wrong path when looking for an error .
The most common case is trying to load a tag library from an application that ’s not listed in INSTALLED_APPS , but there ’s also a subtler issue .
Since Django loops through INSTALLED_APPS trying to import templatetags modules , and treats ImportError as meaning that there is no templatetags module in a particular application , a tag library which — through bad coding or misconfiguration — exists but happens to raise an ImportError will be silently ignored .
This is n’t really a “ bug ” in Django , because the problem of handling situations like this — where , for example , you ’re trying to import something to see if it exists , and an ImportError from another source gets in the way — is a long - standing issue for Python best practices .
Best practices for Django template tags
You generally wo n’t run into this problem unless you get into one of a few very specific situations , but it is useful to know that raising an ImportError from a custom tag library will cause it to “ disappear ” ; this is often a bad thing , because custom tags are supposed to fail silently whenever possible ( one design decision in the Django template system is that , in production , the types of template errors which can bring the site down should be kept to a minimum ) .
One easy way to accomplish this is demonstrated in the markdown filter in django .
contrib .
markup which , obviously , requires the Python Markdown module in order to function .
This module is n’t in the Python standard library and is n’t bundled with Django , so there ’s a very real chance that the markdown module will need to be separately installed before this filter can work properly .
To detect and deal with a missing Markdown module , the markdown filter does the following :
try : import markdown except ImportError : if settings .
DEBUG : raise template .
TemplateSyntaxError , " Error in { % markdown %} filter : The Python markdown library is n't installed . " return force_unicode ( value )
This does several useful things :
It makes sure the Markdown import happens inside the filter , rather than at the module level , which means an errant ImportError wo n’t make the whole library “ disappear ” .
It wraps the import in a try / except block .
In case of an ImportError from import Markdown , it suppresses the error in production , and falls back to a default of simply returning the input .
When in development — i.e. , when the DEBUG setting is True — it raises TemplateSyntaxError with a descriptive error message describing how to fix the problem .
The remainder of the code in the markdown filter can then safely assume that the Markdown module is available , and can act accordingly .
In general , combining one or more of these techniques will make your custom tag and filter libraries more robust and more useful in a variety of error situations , not just those where an ImportError can obscure a different underlying problem .
And that ’s a wrap
I think I ’m all talked out now on the subject of “ magic ” ; hopefully at this point you ’ve got a little better understanding of when and why things which appear to be magical can actually work on nothing more than very simple techniques , how it can be misleading sometimes to refer to things as “ magic ” when they might not be , and have a better understanding of how some specific instances of “ magic ” in Django ( including all the ones we ’ve removed ) have been implemented .
The CDC 6000 Pascal Compiler
Besides being interesting historically , the CDC 6000 compiler was also used as the basis for several other compilers on other machines .
When a Pascal implementor needed a compiler , he / she could use either the P4 source as a basis , or the CDC 6000 compiler , or write it from scratch .
The reason you might prefer to use the machine specific CDC 6000 compiler as a starting point is that ( unlike the P4 compiler ) it was a full implementation of Pascal , without any features left off .
It also was a full optimizing compiler .
The CDC compiler and the P4 compiler were developed from the same source at one time .
The first version here of the CDC 6000 compiler , the 1972 " unrevised " compiler , was unique , but the " revised " compilers branched off the Pascal - P compiler .
This is detailed in " Pascal : The language and its implementation " [ D. W. Barron ] ( which was available on Amazon for $ 1 at the time of this writing ) .
The first CDC 6000 compiler was used to develop Pascal - P , a processor independent Pascal porting " kit " , and then the CDC 6000 compiler was created as its first official " port " .
Thus , you will find that the Pascal - P2 compiler and the 1974 CDC 6000 compiler are fairly similar .
Unfortunately , although the CDC 6000 compiler is an example of the Pascal - P compiler with the full language implemented , it is basically dead for any purpose except as an example , because the CDC 6000 machine is also dead , as far as a working computer currently available .
Fortunately , there is now a complete and machine independent compiler , Pascal - P5 , and works on current machines .
The versions of the CDC 6000 compiler presented here are :
1972 Unrevised Pascal -
The first version of Pascal , with differences from what is commonly known as " Pascal " .
1974 Revised Pascal -
This is the earliest version of the revised Pascal compiler , just after being ported from the Pascal - P compiler .
1976 Revised Pascal -
The revised compiler , using the most widely known version of the language .
1984 ISO 7185 Pascal -
The language brought up to the ISO 7185 standard .
The CDC 6000 Series machines
This page goes over the architecture and history of the CDC 6000 series machines .
The following listing was provided by John Reagan , of Hewlett - Packard ( he was in the division of Digital Equipment Corporation that was purchased by HP ) .
Main compiler code in Pascal
The 1972 Compiler was the last version of the original , unrevised Pascal language before Pascal reached the form most folks know as Standard Pascal .
It is different in many ways , for example , there was no program header , write / ln and read / ln were considered CDC extentions to the language , dynamic pointers were introduced by a " class " statement , and other differences .
The language of the compiler is described in the 1970 document :
Pascal User Manual ( 1970 )
The method used to create the first Pascal compiler , described by U. Ammann , was to write the compiler in a subset of unrevised Pascal itself , then hand - translate the code to SCALLOP , a CDC specific language .
The compiler was then " bootstrapped " , or compiled using the Pascal source code and the SCALLOP based compiler , to get a working compiler that was written in Pascal itself .
Then , the compiler was extended to accept the full unrevised Pascal language .
Programmers living in the age where " programming " means to write a little bit of code , then compile and try it out , then add some more code and repeat , might be confused by the previous description .
However , in the world of batch operating systems , it was not unusual to write major programs entirely on paper first , then get a card deck punched and run afterwords .
The way you debugged such a thing was to test it out , find the problems with the run , then edit the original to fix any problems .
Often this was done by penciling corrections to double spaced copy , then changing only the affected punch cards to fix the problems .
You might ask what occurs when problems require major sections to be rewritten .
The short answer is you do n't do that .
The batch process provides heavy penalties for not getting it 99 % correct the first time through , and when your time , paper , and pencil is much cheaper than computer time , you do what you have to do .
The result is often code that is substantially correct and reliable before it is even entered into the computer .
I myself used the paper entry method to code a Basic compiler for the Z80 processor in 1978 , because of a lack of adequate assembler for the machine I was coding on .
Each routine was written on a page , and kept in a book of such routines , then converted to machine language by hand , and written in hex at the left of the source code .
Although each routine typically required a rewrite to be correct , the final code ran on the machine with only a dozen or so corrections .
The following listings were scanned from listings provided by Mr. Bob Felts .
They were taken from his web site , and he scanned them to .
PDF .
Main compiler code in Pascal
Runtime library code in Compass , the CDC 6000 assembly language
These files are extremely large files because they are whole scans of the greenbar copies .
I have found they generate errors when I try to view them from the web page directly , apparently it times out .
If you have this problem , try saving the file to your computer , then opening it with a .pdf reader .
The compiler listing is dated 1974 .
The scans were taken from a greenbar listing direct from a CDC 6000 series computer .
Mr. Felts managed to scan the full wide greenbar listing , a real feat !
The 1974 compiler was the first of the revised compilers .
That is , it was rewritten in the " revised Pascal " language that was the Pascal language we recognize today .
The " Pascal - P implementation notes " imply that the compiler was Pascal - P ported specifically to the CDC 6000 series computer , and indeed the 1974 CDC Pascal compiler appears to match P2 better than any of the other compilers .
As the CDC compiler was modified , it resembled Pascal - P less and less , which is natural .
The following listings were scanned from listings provided by Mr. John Dykstra .
Main compiler code in Pascal
Runtime library code in Pascal
Runtime library code in Compass , the CDC 6000 assembly language
An error translation routine
The compiler listing is dated 1976 .
The scans were taken from a greenbar listing direct from a CDC 6000 series computer , and bear some unique features to such a listing .
The name and line number appears at the right of the listing .
Because the listings were wider than a 8 1 / 2 inch sheet of paper , the limit of my scanner , the line numbers to the right have one or more digits cut off .
The listings have a 6 digit page number stamped on them at the upper left , which was done by me with an incrementing stamp .
This was done so that I would have a positive indication of the page number while performing the automatic feed scan .
The most unfortunate side effect of cutting down the listings was that the runtime library in Compass have the machine addresses and codes at the left of the listing cut off .
This was unfortunately necessary , since the full assembly listing was far to wide to scan .
However , none of the source code was lost , and the listing could be reproduced by assembling it on a CDC 6000 simulator .
If you have been following the history sections elsewhere on this site , you 'll know that this compiler comes from the revised Pascal that forms the basis of the " Pascal User Manual and Report " , second edition .
The compiler source is not written in standard Pascal , nor would it have been even if the compiler had been written at the time of the standard .
It uses several of the CDC 6000 specific extentions , and it has the generation of CDC 6000 machine instructions imbedded in it .
It is a one piece compiler , it takes in Pascal on one end , and issues CDC 6000 object code out of the other .
In " Pascal - P implementation notes " [ K.V.Nori , U. Ammann , K Jensen , H. H. Nageli , and Ch. Jacobi ] the authors strongly imply that this compiler was derived from the Pascal - P implementation , and many sections of the code are strongly similar to P2 .
This imples that the 1976 Pascal compiler was derived from either P2 Pascal compiler or from the ( presently unobtainable ) P1 Pascal compiler that both the 1976 Pascal compiler and the P2 Pascal compiler have as a common root .
This means that the CDC 6000 compiler series is not dead , but lives on as a functional compiler in the Pascal - P series compilers .
U. Ammann described the creation of the revised compiler in " The Zurich Implementation " , and unfortunately unobtainable document .
The 1970 compiler ( above ) was rewritten completely to arrive at the revised Pascal compiler .
This was done both because the new Pascal language was different , and also because the experience of writing the old compiler had suggested better code structure for the new compiler .
The new compiler was written in unrevised , or 1970 Pascal code .
This resulted in a compiler that compiled using the old compiler , but accepted the revised language Pascal .
Then , the compiler code itself was hand translated to the new language , and translated by the new compiler that was compiled by the old compiler .
This resulted in the new compiler running on itself , and thus a full bootstrap .
Of course , at this point you might well wonder what " hand translation " of the first version of the source on the new compiler from unrevised to revised Pascal might mean , which U. Ammann does not go into .
Basically , it is just what you do if the unrevised and revised languages are not quite compatible .
Otherwise , if the unrevised compiler was a subset of the revised language , you could just recompile it without changes .
This is not nearly as much of a project as translation to SCALLOP , and used in the first compiler .
It just means changing to accommodate the differences in the languages , which were stubstantially similar .
The CDC compiler continued to evolve past 1976 .
Most of the changes in what is contained here as the 1984 compiler were made at the University of Minnesota by Dave Bianchi and Jim Miner ( who appears as a reviser of the forth edition " Pascal User manual and Report " ) .
The material contained is marked copyright , but the University of Minnesota has graciously granted permission for it to appear on this web site .
You will find the agreement for its use here :
University of Minnesota copyright use agreement
The U of M group extended the implementation in a few ways , for example it contains the " otherwise " statement on case statements .
Otherwise , it appears to be a straightforward implementation of the original Zurich compiler , and it continued to be run on the CDC 6000 series computers .
The U of M implementation is important for several reasons :
It contains the last known code revision of the CDC compiler .
It is well documented .
It is exists in machine readable and runnable form .
It obeys , with compiler options , the ISO 7185 Pascal Standard .
I intend to get some snapshots of the CDC implementation running and place them here , time permitting .
The source files of the compiler appear :
Modification history - History of changes to the source .

Note that the listings were created by a " card listing program " ( as in punched cards ) , and have type and sequencing information at the right hand side .
This information can be easily removed by clipping everything from collumn 75 on .
It was retained here for historical purposes .

They are expected to be flown to Cyprus later .
Obama , McCain trade blows over Iraq RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday February 27 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Republican presidential hopeful John McCain mocked Democrat Barack Obama on Wednesday for saying he would take action as president " if al - Qaida is forming a base in Iraq , " but Obama 's campaign answered back right away .
" When you examine that statement , it 's pretty remarkable , " McCain told a crowd in Tyler , Texas .
" I have some news .
Al - Qaida is in Iraq .
It 's called `al - Qaida in Iraq , ' " McCain said , drawing laughter at Obama 's expense .
Obama quickly answered back , telling a rally at Ohio State University in Columbus , " I do know that al - Qaida is in Iraq . "
" So I have some news for John McCain , " he added , saying there was no al - Qaida presence in Iraq until President Bush invaded the country .
Noting that McCain likes to tell audiences that he'd follow Osama bin Laden to the " gates of hell " to catch him , Obama taunted : " All he ( McCain ) has done is to follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq . "
McCain said he had not watched the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night but was told of Obama 's response when asked if as president he would reserve the right to send U.S. troops back into Iraq to quell an insurrection or civil war .
Obama did not say whether he 'd send troops but responded : " As commander in chief , I will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for American interests .
And if al - Qaida is forming a base in Iraq , then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad . "
Throughout the primary season , McCain has repeatedly attacked Obama and Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton for saying they would withdraw troops from Iraq .
" And my friends , if we left , they ( al - Qaida ) would n't be establishing a base , " McCain said Wednesday .
" They 'd be taking a country , and I 'm not going to allow that to happen , my friends .
I will not surrender .
I will not surrender to al - Qaida . "
He said that withdrawing troops would be " waving the white flag . "
In the debate , Clinton did not answer the question about re-invasion of Iraq on grounds it contained " lots of different hypothetical assessments . "
For years , McCain has urged sending more troops into Iraq , even before President Bush adopted such a strategy about a year ago .
" I knew enough from talking to the men and women who are serving that this new strategy was what we needed , and I 'm telling you , it is succeeding , " McCain said .
" So what needs to happen , we need to continue this strategy .
It should be General Petraeus ' recommendation , not that of a politician running for higher office , as to when and how we withdraw . "
He was referring to Gen. David Petraeus , the top American commander in Iraq .
As he began a swing through President Bush 's home state , which holds a presidential primary election on Tuesday , McCain made sure to play up a line he always uses : " I also think it might be nice for President Bush to get a little credit that there 's not been another attack on the United States of America , " he said to applause .
The following is a press release issued by the Obama campaign in response to McCain 's comments : FACT CHECK  Obama :
There was no such thing as al Qaeda in Iraq until Bush and McCain led us to war there " So I heard that Senator McCain said this morning that he had some news for me al Qaeda is in Iraq .
Well first of all , I know that , and that 's why I 've said we should continue to strike al Qaeda targets .
But I 've got some news for him .
There was no such thing as al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain took us into a war that should 've never been authorized and never been waged .
They took our eye off the people who were responsible for 9/11 , and that would be al Qaeda in Afghanistan , that is stronger now than at any time since 2001 .
So John McCain may like to say that he wants to follow Osama bin Laden to the Gates of Hell , but so far all he 's done is follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq that has cost us thousands of lives and billions of dollars and that I intend to bring to end so we can actually start going after al Qaeda in Afghanistan and in the hills of Pakistan , like we should have been doing in the first place .
That 's the news , John McCain , " said Barack Obama .
FACT : Barack Obama has always said he would maintain the capability to strike al Qaeda in Iraq after a withdrawal of U.S. combat brigades .
Obama in his August 1 , 2007 speech , " The War We Need to Win " " That is why my plan would maintain sufficient forces in the region to target al Qaeda within Iraq .
But we must recognize that al Qaeda is not the primary source of violence in Iraq , and has little support .
On the contrary , al Qaeda 's appeal within Iraq is enhanced by our troop presence .
Ending the war will help isolate al Qaeda and give Iraqis the incentive and opportunity to take them out .
It will also allow us to direct badly needed resources to Afghanistan . " link Obama in his September 12 , 2007 speech , " Turning the Page in Iraq " " We will need to retain some forces in Iraq and the region .
We 'll continue to strike at al Qaeda in Iraq . " link FACT : Barack Obama was referring to a specific hypothetical scenario outlined by Tim Russert in the Democratic debate RUSSERT : I want to ask both of you this question , then .
If this scenario plays out and the Americans get out in totality , and Al Qaida resurges and Iraq goes to hell , do you hold the right in your mind as American president to reinvade , to go back into Iraq to stabilize it ?
OBAMA : .
Now , I always reserve the right for the president -- as commander in chief , I will always reserve the right to make sure that we are looking out for American interests .
And if al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq , then we will have to act in a way that secures the American homeland and our interests abroad .
So that is true , I think , not just in Iraq , but that 's true in other places .
That 's part of my argument with respect to Pakistan .
FACT : Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks , and al Qaeda was not using Iraq as a base of operations before the Iraq War .
The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda had no " collaborative operational relationship with Iraq .
Nor have we seen evidence indicating that Iraq cooperated with al Qaeda in developing or carrying out any attacks against the United States . "
Furthermore , the Commission found that the evidence does not support the claim made by Administration officials that Mohammed Atta met with Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague .
link A 2003 CIA report found that there were , " simple declarative accusations of Iraq - al Qa'ida complicity with no substantiating detail or other information that might help us corroborate them . " link A report issued by the State Department in October 2001 listed 45 countries " where al Qaeda or affiliated groups have operated " including Afghanistan , Germany , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and the United States .
Iraq was not on the list .
pdf link FACT : George Bush has failed to bring Osama bin Ladin , Ayman al - Zawahiri , and the core of al Qaeda 's leadership to justice since 9/11 .
Bush Failed to Capture Bin Laden :
It has been widely reported that Osama bin Laden escaped across the border into Pakistan in 2002 , when President Bush failed to commit sufficient ground forces to Afghanistan .
The Washington Post ( link ) reported in April 2002 : " The Bush administration has concluded that Osama bin Laden was present during the battle for Tora Bora late last year and that failure to commit U.S. ground troops to hunt him was its gravest error in the war against al Qaeda , according to civilian and military officials with first - hand knowledge . "
FACT : The Bush - McCain war diverted resources from the fight against al Qaeda Substantial military , intelligence , and diplomatic resources were shifted from Afghanistan and the hunt for bin Laden to the disastrous war in Iraq .
These resources shortchanged our efforts to bring to justice the people responsible for 9/11 , and have left the American people less safe .
As the New York Times reported last summer ( link ) " Throughout late 2002 and early 2003 , Mr. Grenier said in an interview , " the best experienced , most qualified people who we had been using in Afghanistan shifted over to Iraq , " including the agency 's most skilled counterterrorism specialists and Middle East and paramilitary operatives .
" If we were not in Iraq , we would have double or triple the number of Predators across Afghanistan , looking for Taliban and peering into the tribal areas .
We 'd have the ' black ' Special Forces you most need to conduct precision operations .
We 'd have more C.I.A .
We 're simply in a world of limited resources , and those resources are in Iraq , " the former official added .
" Anyone who tells you differently is blowing smoke . "
FACT : High - level al Qaeda terrorist groups are currently threatening the American homeland from a sanctuary in northwest Pakistan .
The NIE in July 2007 ( pdf link ) warned of a reconstituted al - Qaeda leadership in Pakistan : " Al - Qa'ida is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the Homeland , as its central leadership continues to plan high - impact plots , while pushing others in extremist Sunni communities to mimic its efforts and to supplement its capabilities .
We assess the group has protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability , including : a safehaven in the Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) , operational lieutenants , and its top leadership .
Although we have discovered only a handful of individuals in the United States with ties to al - Qa'ida senior leadership since 9/11 , we judge that al - Qa'ida will intensify its efforts to put operatives here .

David Levy 's new book explores humans ' emotional and sexual relationships with machines .
Publisher : Harper I do n't plan to marry again , but if for some reason I must , I might consider tying that knot with a robot .
As Dave Barry says , I am not making this up .
Artificial - intelligence expert David Levy 's new book , Love +
Sex With Robots : The Evolution of Human - Robot Relationships , makes a compelling case for the development of real human - robot partnerships – by 2050 .
I 'll be 80 by then , but who cares ?
With the help of aphrodisiac pharmaceuticals , I 'll be as randy and functional as ever , with a wealth of experience I absolutely plan to gain between now and then .
Here are 10 reasons I 'd consider a robo-marriage :
Robots are more than sex machines .
Levy gives an example of a robot that can predict human movement well enough to dance without stepping on its partner 's feet .
Fancy footwork might even be the top reason women will choose robotic partners :
Sex is easy to find , but dancing ?
Good luck finding a man who is both a ) available and b ) willing to try .
2 . Artificial intelligence is still intelligence .
While a robot partner would never be my equal in a relationship – it can't be , as long as I control the on - off switch – it could still challenge me intellectually .
According to Levy , romantic robot AI will include emotional and social intelligence as well as analytical smarts .
And if AI advances so much that robots develop self - will ?
The whole " could a human love a robot ? " question becomes moot , as the robot is now officially a person .
Either that or the roles will reverse , and the robots will use us as sex slaves .
3 . Robots are sensitive and responsive .
A robot partner can measure my respiration , heart rate , skin temperature and more using its biofeedback sensors .
It knows exactly when I 'm turned on , when I 'm withdrawing , when I 'm approaching climax ; it knows my body better than I do .
I do n't have to make any effort to communicate my needs or to figure out my partner 's – what a relief to set that burden down !
A robot also knows when to leave me alone , so I do n't have to risk hurting its feelings by declining its advances .
In fact , in this relationship , the robot does all the work , learning by trial and error , taking all the risks and adapting to my moods and whims .
Sounds like a match made in heaven ... or by Honda .
4 . A robot will only create drama if I want it to .
The only emotional drama I 'll get into with my robot partner is what I 've programmed into it .
No jealousy , no hormones , no overtired crankiness , no insecurity , no ' tude .
This might bore folks who thrive on crisis , so I imagine robots will come with a Drama setting that ranges from 0 ( yogic bliss ) to 10 ( living hell ) .
My machine will be set to , hmmm , let 's see ... 0 . I 'll get my drama from novels and holovids , thankyouverymuch .
5 . Robots have off switches .
I 'm a solitary extrovert , which has been an issue in past relationships when I needed – and took – more alone time than my partner liked .
With a robot , I wo n't have to worry about whether I 'm neglecting the relationship when I need to camp out in my cave for a week or two .
If the robot 's artificial emotional intelligence includes a tendency to feel lonely or abandoned , I can simply switch it off until I return .
Bonus :
If your spouse is a robot , your in - laws also have off switches .
6 . Accessories .
Heh .
7 . Robots are available for sexual adventure without elaborate discussions , permissions or restrictions .
My robot partner is not going to have flashes of jealousy or performance anxiety when brought out to play with one or more human lovers .
It can top , bottom or switch ; serve cocktails ; and clean up spills .
It wo n't tire or cramp just when things are reaching their peak , nor will its feelings be hurt if no one ends up touching it .
8 . The safest sex on the planet .
A robot lover means no sexually transmitted infections , no unwanted pregnancy , no doubts that the partner you think you know is just the online persona of some teenager in Botswana .
And , if constructed of high - quality , latex - free , antibacterial , hypoallergenic materials , the robot will cause limited disruption to a woman 's delicate pH balance .
9 . A robot can be a personal trainer for sex .
Whatever we 're doing now to explore our sexuality online prepares us for what we 'll discover with futuristic mechanical lovers .
I think my wedding gift to myself would be the complete Kama Sutra package .
10 . A robot is forever – at least until the warranty runs out .
What the human - robot marriage lacks in challenge , growth and balance , it makes up for with steadfast , unchanging devotion .
At least on the robot 's side .
If you changed , you could just reprogram or upgrade your robot partner to like the new you .
In Love + Sex With Robots ,
Levy explains how human - robot love can become a reality .
I believe him , but I also know you can't have a true partnership without risk .
Having an unshakable , programmable partner would undoubtedly delete the human drama from the relationship .
Or would it ?
I can easily see a person sobbing in a robot's arms , wondering why the marriage feels so ... empty .
A robot spouse could be perfect .
Too perfect .

Introduction
Materialized views are certainly possible in PostgreSQL .
Because of PostgreSQL 's powerful PL / pgSQL language , and the functional trigger system , materialized views are somewhat easy to implement .
I will examine several methods of implementing materialized views in PostgreSQL .
Snapshot materialized views are the simplest to implement .
They are only updated when refreshed .

Very Lazy materialized views are functionally equivalent to Snapshot materialized views , except that the changes are recorded incrementally and applied when the table is refreshed .
Caveats and Assumptions
I assume you are not new to PostgreSQL .
I assume that you have a fairly solid understanding of how a database works , and in particular , the PostgreSQL database .
I also assume you are comfortable with PL / pgSQL , PostgreSQL 's SQL syntax , and tools to access and modify the database .
All the information you need is in the PostgreSQL documentation .
Note that unless otherwise noted , all of the commands are executed in the database as a root user .
If you know what you are doing , you do n't have to do this as a root user .
If you do n't know what a root user is , or how to create one , then read the previous paragraph .
Snapshot Materialized Views
Snapshot materialized views are very easy to implement .
They will serve as a foundation for all other materialized views I discuss in this article .
I use a system where the materialized view is based off of a view .
I assume that the view definition will never change .
All bets are off if it does .
Of course , I do expect that the data in the view will change as data in the database is modified .
CREATE TABLE matviews ( mv_name NAME NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , v_name NAME NOT NULL , last_refresh TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE ) ;
matviews Table
I create a table called matviews to store the information about a materialized view .
mv_name
The name of the materialized view represented by this row .
v_name
The name of the view that the materialized view is based on .
last_refresh
The time of the last refresh of the materialized view .
create_matview Function
Here is a function written in PL / pgSQL to insert a row into the matviews table and to create the materialized view .
Pass in the name of the materialized view , and the name of the view that it is based on .
Note that you have to create the view first , of course .
This function will see if a materialized view with that name is already created .
If so , it raises an exception .
Otherwise , it creates a new table from the view , and inserts a row into the matviews table .
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_matview ( NAME , NAME ) RETURNS VOID SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE plpgsql AS ' DECLARE matview ALIAS FOR $ 1 ; view_name ALIAS FOR $ 2 ; entry matviews % ROWTYPE ; BEGIN SELECT * INTO entry FROM matviews WHERE mv_name = matview ; IF FOUND THEN RAISE EXCEPTION '' Materialized view '' ' ' % ' ' '' already exists .'' , matview ; END IF ; EXECUTE ''REVOKE ALL ON '' || view_name || '' FROM PUBLIC ''; EXECUTE ''GRANT SELECT ON '' || view_name || '' TO PUBLIC ''; EXECUTE ''CREATE TABLE '' || matview || '' AS SELECT * FROM '' || view_name ; EXECUTE ''REVOKE ALL ON '' || matview || '' FROM PUBLIC ''; EXECUTE ''GRANT SELECT ON '' || matview || '' TO PUBLIC ''; INSERT INTO matviews ( mv_name , v_name , last_refresh ) VALUES ( matview , view_name , CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ) ; RETURN ; END ';
drop_matview Function
If there is a function to create , there must be a function to destroy .
drop_matview only drops the materialized view and removes the entry from matviews .
It will leave the view alone .
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION drop_matview ( NAME ) RETURNS VOID SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE plpgsql AS ' DECLARE matview ALIAS FOR $ 1 ; entry matviews % ROWTYPE ; BEGIN SELECT * INTO entry FROM matviews WHERE mv_name = matview ; IF NOT FOUND THEN RAISE EXCEPTION '' Materialized view % does not exist .'' , matview ; END IF ; EXECUTE '' DROP TABLE '' || matview ; DELETE FROM matviews WHERE mv_name=matview ; RETURN ; END ';
refresh_matview Function
Finally , you need a way to refresh the materialized views so that the data does not become completely stale .
This function only needs the name of the matview .
It uses a brute - force algorithm that will delete all the rows and reinsert them from the view .
Note that you may want to drop the indexes on you materialized view before executing this , and recreate them when it finished .
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_matview ( name ) RETURNS VOID SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE plpgsql AS ' DECLARE matview ALIAS FOR $ 1 ; entry matviews % ROWTYPE ; BEGIN SELECT * INTO entry FROM matviews WHERE mv_name = matview ; IF NOT FOUND THEN RAISE EXCEPTION '' Materialized view % does not exist .'' , matview ; END IF ; EXECUTE ''DELETE FROM '' || matview ; EXECUTE ''INSERT INTO '' || matview || '' SELECT * FROM '' || entry.v_view ; UPDATE matviews SET last_refresh=CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE mv_name=matview ; RETURN ; END ';
Example of a Snapshot Materialized View
Let 's pretend you are running a database that has the following tables and views :
CREATE TABLE player ( pname VARCHAR ( 255 ) PRIMARY KEY ) ; CREATE TABLE game_score ( pname VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , score INTEGER NOT NULL ) ; CREATE VIEW player_total_score_v AS SELECT pname , sum ( score ) AS total_score FROM game_score GROUP BY pname ;
Since a lot of players play games each day , and running the view is kind of expensive , you decide you want to implement a materialized view on player_total_score_v .
This is done with the following command .
SELECT create_matview ('player_total_score_mv' , ' player_total_score_v' ) ; CREATE INDEX pname_idx ON player_total_score_mv(pname ) ;
Every night ( or every hour , depending on how eager the players are to see their score ) , you can refresh the materialized view with the following command .
DROP INDEX pname_idx ON player_total_score_mv ; SELECT refresh_matview ('player_total_score_mv' ) ; CREATE INDEX pname_idx ON player_total_score_mv(pname ) ;
Since many players are always playing , many rows in the table will be changed .
Also , players do n't need their scores updated whenever they finish a game .
But the players are constantly querying for their scores , with the understanding that the scores are updated every night .
This is a good approach that will improve performance tremendously .
Eager Materialized View
An eager materialized view will be updated whenever the view changes .
This is done with a system of triggers on all of the underlying tables .
Dependencies on mutable functions ( like now ( ) ) will cause the materialized view to become corrupt , but that can be corrected with minor refreshes , that only refresh affected rows .
Underlying Tables
First , let 's step back and consider what actually makes up the data in a materialized view , or where the data in the view is coming from .
Obviously , information in the materialized view will come from any tables mentioned in the view definition .
If the view definition relies on other views , then we 'll have to consider all the tables that compose that view as well .
Relation Between Materialized Views and Underlying Tables
Now we need to consider how the data in the underlying table relates to or affects the data in the materialized view .
The simplest case is a one - to - one relation .
The view is merely selecting all or some of the columns from a table .
Mutiple rows in the view do not depend on the same row in the underlying table .
In the example below , if the username of a single user changes , then only one row in the user_v will change .
CREATE VIEW user_v AS SELECT username , password AS '******' , uid FROM users ;
A more complicated case is many - to - one .
Many rows in the view depend on a single row in an underlying relation .
This is most common when you are joining two tables .
In the example below , if the groupname changes , many rows in the user_group_v may change .
CREATE VIEW user_group_v AS SELECT username , groupname FROM groups , users WHERE users.group = groups.group ;
Another complicated case is one - to - many .
One row in the view is derived from multiple rows in the underlying table .
This is most common with aggregates .
In this example , the total_score is derived from many rows in game_score .
CREATE VIEW player_total_score_v AS SELECT pname , sum ( score ) AS total_score FROM game_score ;
There is also some rare cases where many rows in the view will be affected by many rows in the underlying tables .
We need to keep in mind all the cases as we design the functions and triggers below .
If one row changes in the underlying table , many rows in the materialized view may be affected .
mv_refresh_row Function
We first need to design an mv_refresh_row function .
I do n't know how to make a generic function that will work for all materialized views , so we have to hand - craft one for each materialized view we create .
It is n't hard to do .
This simple algorithm will get you through this process .
Identify the primary key of the materialized view .
If there is n't one , you must redefine the view so as to create one .
The function will accept the primary key as an argument .
In the function , first delete the row with that primary key from the materialized view .
Next , select the row with that primary key from the view and insert it into the materialized view .
We 'll see an example below .
mv_refresh Function
If the view relies on some mutable functions , then you will have to run a refresh function that will only refresh those rows that are affected .
Most commonly , this occurs when there is some sort of time - dependence .
A lot of thought needs to go into the mv_refresh function .
There may be a way to write a generic one for all views , but for now , you 'll have to hand - craft your own .
I do n't even have a generic algorithm to pass along .
I think this is largely dependent on the mutable and how the mutable behaves .
Table Triggers
You will have to create triggers for every action on every underlying table .
I write three triggers for each table , one each for INSERT , UPDATE , and DELETE .
I feel it is more efficient than writing one function that handles all three cases .
The basic algorithm for the trigger functions follows .
I 'll show you a concrete example below of these functions .
Identify the primary key value(s ) for the materialized view of the affected rows .
If there is a many - to - one or many - to - many , many rows in the materialized view will be affected .
For DELETE and INSERT , merely call the mv_refresh_row function for each primary key value .
For UPDATE , identify whether the update is going to change which row(s ) in the materialized view this row will affect .
If so , then you 'll have to refresh rows for both the old and new values .
Otherwise , only the old or new values will do .
Apply the triggers so that they are called after the operation is performed .
Examples
These examples are long and contrived ; I am using them merely to demonstrate how it all works .
Do n't bother trying to make sense of the tables .
I could n't come up with any real world examples that would show all three instances .
CREATE TABLE a ( a_id INT PRIMARY KEY , v INT ) ; CREATE TABLE b ( b_id INT PRIMARY KEY , a_id INT REFERENCES a , v INT , expires TIMESTAMP ) ; CREATE TABLE c ( c_id INT PRIMARY KEY , b_id INT REFERENCES b , v INT ) ; CREATE VIEW b_v AS SELECT b.b_id AS b_id , a.v AS a_v , b.v AS b_v , sum ( c.v ) AS sum_c_v FROM a JOIN b USING ( a_id ) JOIN c USING ( b_id ) WHERE ( b.expires IS NULL OR b.expires >= now ( ) ) GROUP BY b.b_id , a.v , b.v ; SELECT create_matview ( ' b_mv ' , ' b_v ' ) ;
Notice that one row in a may contribute to multiple rows in b_v .
Only one row in b contribute to one row in b_v
Also , many rows in c contribute to a single row in b_v .
The primary key of b_v is b_id .
Also , the view has a dependence on the mutable function now ( ) .
The mv_refresh_row function is defined as follows .
CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_refresh_row(b_mv.b_id%TYPE ) RETURNS VOID SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '
AS ' BEGIN DELETE FROM b_mv WHERE b_id = $ 1 ; INSERT INTO b_mv SELECT * FROM b_v WHERE b_id = $ 1 ; RETURN ; END ';
The mv_refresh function is defined as follows .
If it were n't for the dependence on now ( ) , this would be unnecessary .
We store the last time this was refreshed in the matviews table .
CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_refresh ( ) RETURNS VOID SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql ' AS ' BEGIN PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row( b_id ) FROM b , matviews WHERE matviews .mv_name = '' b_mv ' '
AND b.expires >= matviews.last_refresh AND b.expires < now ( ) ; UPDATE matviews SET last_refresh = now ( ) WHERE mv_name = '' b_mv ' ' ; RETURN ; END ';
The trigger function definitions are long and tedious , but this is where all the magic is .
-- a triggers CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_a_ut ( ) RETURNS TRIGGER SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '
AS ' BEGIN IF OLD.
a_id = NEW.a_id THEN PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(b.b_id )
FROM b WHERE b.a_id = NEW.a_id ; ELSE PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(b.b_id )
FROM b WHERE b.a_id = OLD.a_id ; PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(b.b_id )
FROM b WHERE b.a_id = NEW.a_id ; END IF ; RETURN NULL ; END '; CREATE TRIGGER b_mv_ut AFTER UPDATE ON a FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE b_mv_a_ut ( ) ; CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_a_dt ( ) RETURNS TRIGGER SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '
AS ' BEGIN PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(b.b_id ) FROM b WHERE b.a_id = OLD.a_id ; RETURN NULL ; END '; CREATE TRIGGER b_mv_dt AFTER DELETE ON a FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE b_mv_a_dt ( ) ; CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_a_it( ) RETURNS TRIGGER SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '
AS ' BEGIN PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(b.b_id ) FROM b WHERE b.a_id = NEW.a_id ; RETURN NULL ; END '; CREATE TRIGGER b_mv_it AFTER INSERT ON a FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE b_mv_a_it( ) ; -- b triggers CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_b_ut( ) RETURNS TRIGGER SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '

AS ' BEGIN PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(NEW.b_id ) ; RETURN NULL ; END '; CREATE TRIGGER b_mv_it AFTER INSERT ON b FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE b_mv_b_it( ) ; -- c triggers CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_c_ut( ) RETURNS TRIGGER SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '
AS ' BEGIN IF OLD .
b_id = NEW .b_id THEN PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(NEW.b_id ) ; ELSE PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(OLD.b_id ) ; PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(NEW.b_id ) ; END IF ; RETURN NULL ; END '; CREATE TRIGGER b_mv_ut AFTER UPDATE ON c FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE b_mv_c_ut ( ) ; CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_c_dt( ) RETURNS TRIGGER SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql ' AS ' BEGIN PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(OLD.b_id ) ; RETURN NULL ; END '; CREATE TRIGGER b_mv_dt AFTER DELETE ON c FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE b_mv_c_dt ( ) ; CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_c_it( ) RETURNS TRIGGER SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '
AS ' BEGIN PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row(NEW.b_id ) ; RETURN NULL ; END '; CREATE TRIGGER b_mv_it AFTER INSERT ON c FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE b_mv_c_it( ) ;
Lazy Materialized Views
The lazy materialized view would record which rows in the materialized views need to be updated , and update them when the transaction is committed .
This useful if many change will affect the same rows , and will also allow those changes to be made much more quickly .
Currently , I know of no way to put a hook in when the transaction is committed .
Pending that development , this materialized view scheme cannot be implemented .
Very Lazy Materialized Views
Very lazy materialized views would record which rows in the materialized view need to be updated , but wo n't update until directed to .
This would be useful if you are committing multiple transactions that affect the materialized views , but do n't want to actually update the materialized view until later .
Does this sound familiar ?
It should , because it is functionally equivalent to the snapshot materialized view I described earlier .
CREATE TABLE matview_changes ( mv_oid OID PRIMARY KEY , pkey INTEGER NOT NULL ) ;
Recording the Changes in matview_changes
Replacing the mv_refresh_row function with one that merely records the change to be made at a later time is pretty easy .
First , we need a table to store our changes -- one that could store any change to any materialized view ( assuming the primary key is a single column of integers ) .
matview_queue_refresh_row ( )
Function
Next , we need to create a generic matview_queue_refresh_row ( ) function that inserts the primary key into matview_changes if it is not already present .
CREATE FUNCTION matview_queue_refresh_row( NAME , INTEGER ) RETURNS VOID SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '
AS ' DECLARE mv OID ; test INTEGER ; BEGIN SELECT INTO mv oid FROM matviews WHERE mv_name = $ 1 ; SELECT INTO test pkey FROM matview_changes WHERE matview_changes.mv_oid = mv AND matview_changes.pkey = $ 2 ; IF NOT FOUND THEN INSERT INTO matview_changes ( mv_oid , pkey ) VALUES ( mv , $ 2 ) ; END IF ; RETURN NULL ; END ';
Modify the Eager Materialized View System
The very lazy materialized view works mostly like the eager materialized view system , with a few modification .
Apply the following changes on top of the eager materialized view setup above .
Modify the triggers you defined for eager materialized views above so that it calls matview_queue_refresh_row ( ) rather than mv_refresh_row ( ) .
Modify ( or create , if it does n't exist yet ) mv_refresh ( ) so that it first applies the mutable - function dependencies first , and then performs the actual changes in bulk with mv_refresh_row ( ) , deleting all the changes from the matview_changes table .
Refresh Strategies
Now that refreshing the materialized view wo n't be so expensive , we can look at some alternative refresh strategies that are out of the question for snapshot materialized views .
We can implement a rule on select such that the materialized view is refreshed whenever data is selected from it .
We can improve performance by implementing a rule that will only refresh the materialized view if 1 second , 10 seconds , 1 minute , or 1 hour has passed since the last refresh and the data is being selected .
We can forget about the rules altogether and have the materialized view get refreshed at a preset time interval - 10 second , 1 minute , 10 minutes , etc .
Example
Borrowing from our eager example , we are now going to implement the triggers and mv_refresh ( ) function so that it uses the very lazy updating technique .
It also implements a rule that will refresh the materialized view if 10 seconds have passed since the last refresh .
-- b_mv_refresh ( ) CREATE OR REPLCE FUNCTION b_mv_refresh ( ) RETURNS VOID SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '
AS ' DECLARE mv OID ; BEGIN SELECT INTO mv oid FROM matviews WHERE mv_name = '' b_mv ' ' ; PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row( b_id ) FROM b , matviews WHERE matviews.oid = mv AND b.expires >= matviews.last_refresh AND b.expires < now ( ) ; PERFORM b_mv_refresh_row( pkey ) FROM matview_changes WHERE mv_oid = mv ; UPDATE matviews SET last_refresh = now ( ) WHERE mv_name = '' b_mv ' ' ; END '; -- a triggers CREATE FUNCTION b_mv_a_ut ( ) RETURNS TRIGGER SECURITY DEFINER LANGUAGE ' plpgsql '

Switching Between Techniques
With the right support functions , and a column to track the type of materialized view , it should be possible to switch between the various techniques .
Right now , I do n't have a way to do this because generating the triggers , the mv_refresh_row function , and the mv_refresh function is not generic .
However , should I discover a way to make them generic , then it should be possible to track what type of technique the materialized view is using in the matviews table .
Then , I would write a generic function to apply the necessary changes to switch between techniques .
Comparison of Techniques
Let 's review the various techniques and their benefits and disadvantages .
Snapshot Materialized Views
The snapshots are really easy to implement .
However , they take a lot of work to regenerate the data .
This is good if it is going to take a lot of work anyway , but bad if there are only a few small changes to make at each update .
The refresh function must be called regularly .
The data will be out - of - sync with the view as soon as the data starts to change .
This may be good or bad , depending on what you want .
Eager Materialized Views
The eager updated materialized views are always updated - even in a transaction .
This comes at a cost - changes that affect the materialized view are going to be more expensive .
This is fine if you do n't change the data much , but can lead to problems when you do bulk imports or modifications .
The data may fall out of sync if there is a dependence on mutable functions .
A regular specialized refresh function can be called to remedy the data .
However , discovering the correct algorithm for this function can be difficult .
Lazy Materialized Views
Lazy materialized views offer a balance between the eager and snapshot types .
Changes to the data are not instantly propagated , allowing multiple changes to the same records to be applied in one shot rather than mutliple shots .
However , the data is not consistent during a transaction , and so it must be carefully handled .
Like eager materialized views , the data may fall out of sync if there is a dependence on a mutable function .
A similar solution must be implemented .
The only drawback to lazy materialized views is that I do n't know how to implement them yet , as I can't put a hook in before the transaction is committed .
Very Lazy Materialized Views
Very lazy materialized views are like snapshots , except the updates can be lighter - weight .
This is good if there are few updates to the data .
Like snapshots , the data will begin to be out of sync as soon as the data changes , but the refresh function is much faster and uses less resources .
General Suggestions
Know When to Use a Materialized View
It does n't take a genius to realize that materialized views are not simple .
If you can find a way to improve your database performance with partitions or indexes , by all means , do so .
However , certain situations are best served with materialized views .
These situations are obvious in that there are relatively few data modifications compared to the queries being performed , and the queries are very complicated and heavy - weight .
It also goes without saying that the different kinds of materialized views are useful in different situations .
Avoid Mutable Function Dependence
Avoid mutable functions if you can .
Sometimes , like the example above with the expires column , the solution is obvious .
Othertimes , it is not .
If possible , summarize the mutable function in a column in the table .
For instance , we could 've added a column called expired , set it to a boolean , and ran a query to update that column with respect to the expires column nightly .
Then we could create the view and thus the materialized view with a dependence on the expired column , and ignore the expires column .
This would 've made the materialized view simpler and always synchronized with the data .
Keep it Organized
Due to the sheer volume of SQL code required to write a materialized view that is either eagerly updated or very lazily updated ( nearly 1,000 in one instance I have implemented ) , it is important to combine all the functions together into a script that is executed in one transaction .
I also like to have a partner script to back out all the changes .
This way , when I create the materialized view quickly , and I can quickly back out if things go bad .
It also helps me to keep track of all the changes in one neat bundle .
Future Directions
I would like to begin work on generic functions to implement the mv_refresh_row ( ) functions , as well as the triggers and trigger functions .
I think I will need to begin writing code in C for this to work properly .
If the generic functions become available , I would like to drop the snapshot method and instead replace the mv_refresh ( ) function with one that will determine if it makes more sense to delete all the rows and reselect them , or apply the changes incrementally .
I would also like to investigate how to put a hook into the transaction process .
Having that ability would add a powerful materialized view to the existing arsenal .

Word that the Chinese cabinet has moved to freeze prices on gas and oil and crack down on profiteering , hoarding and other activities fuelling inflation bodes ill .
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao put his name on the announcement which comes on the eve of Chinese New Year ’s in early February when millions will leave their jobs in the urban areas and travel to ancestral homes for celebrations , always with the Chinese dominated by food .
But food prices have been rising starkly – pushing up the cost of living index nearly 7 percent in November .
[ December is not in at this writing ] .
That ’s continuing a 10 - year - record month on month highs starting in August last summer .
And although official spin put the whole blame on food , the fact is consumers goods have been rising across the board .
For example , when the pinch between rising higher oil imports and domestic gasoline and diesel prices dried up the pumps , the government permitted a 10 percent rise in November .
And that simply confirmed the black market prices that already were abroad .
Inflation is a bigger bugaboo in China than perhaps in any other country .
The long history of China is replete with dynasties that collapsed under the weight of runaway prices .
[ It was n’t by accident , as they say , that paper money was invented in China . ]
And , in fact , one can make a case that the clinking of silver and gold on the tables in Shanghai in the late 1940s had as much to do with the victory of the Communists over the Kuomintang Nationalists as the Reds ’ valor on the battlefield .
Whole divisions of the Nationalist forces , often in the hands of warlords , went over to the Communist side before it was installed in 1949 for “ economic ” reasons .

The last time the Chinese Communists let inflation get out of control preceded the Tiananmen massacre in 1987 when students – and workers as well – demonstrating in the heart of the capital were mowed down .
Inflation as well as calls for democratic rights played a role in the protests of the dissidents .
The crisis brought down high officials of the Communist Party , played hob with the military commands since the Beijing garrison could not or would not move on the demonstrators .
And that crisis still hangs over the regime as it has had no success in its official campaign to blot it out and dares not try to spin an explanation beyond those offered at the time of treason and treachery by the protesters .
The immediate cause of the current round of inflation is said officially to be vast amounts of pigs missing from the market in a massive cull to wipe out an outbreak of blue ear disease , the resultant shortage of pork , an all important staple in the Chinese diet .
[ Some international veterinarian scientists are still not sure that is what struck the Chinese swine , and , hopefully , not another virus that could be passed on to humans with infected meat often reaching the market . ]
But shortages have also developed in grains – and the government has slapped new restrictions on their export .
And there are even pressures on wages in the sweatshops of southern China .
But behind this more superficial explanation is the basic problem of the overall economic strategy .
In a sense , the Chinese Communists are victims of their own success .
The export drive – based in part on an undervalued currency and other subsidies – has brought in vast amounts of foreign exchange .
The 2007 trade surplus with the U.S. may finally turn out to $ 300 billion alone .
And foreign exchange reserves may have climbed to $ 1.6 trillion dollars by the end of 2007 , not only the world ’s largest , but the fastest growing .
While all this represents China becoming the workshop of the world [ the assembler , really , since almost two - thirds of the exports are produced by the multinationals drawing in components from Taiwan , Japan , South Korea and elsewhere in Asia and China ’s cheap labor ] , it also means that the Chinese central bank is flooding the country with matching local currency paid out to the exporters .
Luckily for the regime , so far , most of the Chinese who are making money are saving it .
An unheard percent of China ’s gross national product may be going into its banks – even though by international standards they are near bankruptcy because of their bad loans and flamboyant corruption .
Some say as much as 42 percent although like all Chinese figures , there may be some creative accounting here .
But in any case , Chinese savers , with fantastic prices for real estate and no social welfare net of any kind , have n’t had much of a choice even though the inflation may have been eroding their savings ’ value with low returns .
Although the government has been talking a big line about trimming the rate of growth and “ cooling ” the economy , that may be easier said than done .
The mechanism for fiscal control is to put it mildly primitive and largely inoperative .
That ’s why six raises in the interest rate by the central bank during 2007 seem to have had little if any effect – except , perhaps , to reassure the bank savers by giving them a little more return .
[ When for a brief moment , Wen decided to let Chinese Mainlanders invest in the Hong Kong “ foreign ” stock market , there was a run on banks in neighboring Shenzhen , windows were clamped down so fast it caught a few fingers . ] .
But more important , at the 17th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party last October , President Hu Jintao promised to quadruple the gross national product by 2020 simultaneously with promises a few days later to rein in the growth .
With economic development the only thing the regime has to offer since it abandoned Maoism for “ socialism with Chinese characteristics ” , the regime has to talk and promise rapid growth for the hundreds of millions of Chinese who are still waiting for its benefits .
And despite talk about “ democracy ” –
Hu mentioned it more than 60 times in his long , boring doggerel to the Congress – repression is stronger than ever if more unpredictable along with growing outbursts of popular protest over confiscation of property and other inequities of a regime which really has no legal system .
[ Even giving vent to complaints on the internet is being repressed with growing technologies supplied , shamelessly , by such companies as Google and Microsoft . ]
You would never know it from the Western mass media nor from the China boosters among the multinationals , but recent studies have deflated the whole China boom .
A World Bank paper using different methodology – comparing China through purchasing power of its currency for its people compared to other countries rather than the concept of gross national product that simply totes up everything .
It has trimmed the size of the whole economy .
It has , in effect , reduced the estimate by 40 percent , putting off those straight - line projections that have China outdistancing the Japanese and the U.S. and the EU in a few years .
Even less attention has been attracted to new analyses of how the Chinese calculate their cost of living and inflation .
It is not just a question of bad arithmetic and false entries – as everyone knows replete in all the official Chinese statistics – but in the whole methodology .
There is considerable evidence now that instead of the stable price structure which had been said to be one of the parts of the Chinese miracle , inflation has been zipping along all the time , but has just become dramatized now because of the dramatic increase in food prices .
There is also now the question of whether that a big , fat middle class – some said as much as 300 million – as a product of the modernization is really there .
If the size of the economy and the inflation figures are now redefined , it could well be that the unlimited Chinese market for imports from the West – the Marco Polo Syndrome – is really a mirage .
In any case , Beijing is pursuing every tactic it can to block imports except for the European luxuries for the super rich .
Another aspect of the problem is that though the Forbidden City headquarters of the Party is issuing sheaves of orders , new regulations , and new laws , and new reams of propaganda these days , the local cadre are pretty much going their own way .
That old saw that the Emperor ’s Write Ends at the Village Gate is again becoming the reality in China .
Party hacks at the middle and lower level are finding ways to avoid disciplining themselves or those below them .
Corruption has become not only a way of life but the lifeblood of the regime , whether it is forcing the banks to make “ political ” loans based on little or no vetting or grabbing the property of villagers for new factory or “ luxury ” housing expansion or casting safety standards to the winds and polluting local water and air resources to make unlivable in some instances ..
It is highly unlikely they could or would enforce new commands to halt the black marketing and price gouging which is the inevitable result of inflation in any economy and a regime that tries to fight it by beating back the waves .
The problem at hand , inflation , then is going to be the tiger that Hu - Wen have to ride in the next few months before the Olympic Games in the late summer .
The games have taken on a mystical quality for all sectors of the Chinese – those who hope for sports victories , of course , but also the growing body of young nationalists [ perhaps some in the military as well ] who see the event as final recognition that China is now a world power , and those who hope , somehow , some of the fundamental problems of the regime will be overcome in the aura of the games and their international audience .
There may be a terrible hangover awaiting the Chinese – and the rest of the world – in the morning after the last gold medal has been awarded .
And that could be continuing and unabated inflation ripping up Chinese society once again .

Thanks for visiting !
I just finished reading Barbara Ehrenreich 's Nickel and Dimed : On ( Not ) Getting By in America for the third time .
In this book , the author chronicles three one - month stints working as one of the American poor .
Her goal is to demonstrate that it 's difficult to succeed as a waitress , or a maid , or a Wal - Mart employee .
This is a book that I wanted to like — I sympathize with the author 's motives — but what could have been an interesting project ( and an interesting book ) is instead a bizarre Marxist screed about class warfare .
Ehrenreich enters her experiment with the end in mind — failure — and she seems to do everything she can to make this end come to fruition .
Nickel and Dimed could have been so much more .
I wanted to hear about the people Ehrenreich worked with , wanted to hear their backgrounds and stories and dreams , but very little of that comes through in the book .
Instead , we learn about all the little ways in which Ehrenreich sabotages any chance at success .
Scratch Beginnings
Though Nickel and Dimed has its fans , I 'm not the only one who thinks Ehrenreich 's approach was flawed .
A young man named Adam Shepard recently published a book called Scratch Beginnings : Me , $ 25 , and the Search for the American Dream that chronicles his own time spent living and working the low - wage lifestyle .
Shepard — who is the first to admit that he has advantages that many of the working poor do not — started from scratch in Charleston , South Carolina , with $ 25 and the clothes on his back .
He lived in a homeless shelter while looking for work .
His goal was to start with nothing and , within a year , work hard enough to save $ 2500 , buy a car , and to live in a furnished apartment .
It was n't easy , but Shepard succeeded .
In ten months , he had his car , he had his furnished apartment , and he had n't just saved $ 2500 — he 'd saved twice that .
Was he lucky ?
Did he get good breaks because he 's a young white male ?
Probably .
But I think much of his success also came from setting goals and working toward them .
In this two - minute video , Shepard describes his aims :
Last Friday , two Get Rich Slowly readers sent me a Christian Science Monitor story about Adam Shepard .
Intrigued , I contacted him , and he agreed to be interviewed by e-mail .
An Interview With Adam Shepard
J.D .
Tell us about your day - to - day life .
How did you live ?
How did you pay for what you had ?
What financial sacrifices were you forced to make ?
Adam
That was the greatest challenge for me .
I was getting paid peanuts , but I want to keep as many of those peanuts in my pocket as possible .
In the [ homeless shelter ] , it was easy , because I did n't have rent or a hefty food bill ( breakfast and dinner were provided at the shelter ) .
Once I moved out of the shelter , though , was when I really had to buckle down .
Sacrifice was the name of the game — delaying gratification — and I recognized that early on .
I had immediately eliminated wants versus needs .
Immediately .
Cable ?
That 's $ 50 a month and it's not that difficult to find some good shows on network television .
Cell phone ?
$ 100 a month back in my pocket .
If I had a business to run , I would need one , but as a mere laborer , it was easy to go without .
Clothes were bought at the Goodwill , and all of my household products were generic brands .
Food was my kryptonite , and I had to pay special attention there .
I used to love going out to eat , and when I eat , I eat like a horse .
Could n't do it , though .
Chicken and Rice - A - Roni dinners were substituted for trips out to simple bars and grills ( $ 20 a pop at a minimum ) .
To be honest with you , though , it was more fun to concoct various meals than it was to go out .
I bought a book on cheap , easy meals from the Thrift Store and it was like a Bible of sorts for me while I was in Charleston .
It was also fun for me to seek out free entertainment ( Charleston had a great weekly city guide ) .
Once I met a few people , that became easier .
Cards , basketball , renting movies .
How can I have fun and still keep this money in my pocket ?
Transportation was also an issue for me .
I rode the bus for four months until I felt I was in a position financially to buy my own ride .
I had my eyes on a 2006 Caddy , but I settled for an ' 88 GMC Sierra pickup truck ( $ 1000 cash , no car payments ) with a torn interior , no radio , and no AC ( brutal in the southeastern summer ! ) .
The driver 's side window did n't roll up all the way and the passenger side window did n't roll down .
In every sense of the metaphor , it was the opposite of a chick magnet .
But it got me from point A to point B , and that 's all I needed .
Even now , though , in my current life where I have a little bit more financial freedom , I 'm still always looking to save money .
Why do I need to go to the “ real movie theatre ” when I can go to the “ dolla - fitty ” and watch movies that might be a month or two old ?
Why Eddie Bauer , when Marshall 's essentially has the same clothes ?
Why Dr. Pepper when there 's Dr. Thunder ?
And on and on .
Even with money to spare , I 'm looking for ways to put that money to work for me rather than spending it on items that I do n't truly need for right now .
I know that one day I 'll be financially free enough to own the car I want , the house I want , the clothes I want .
That day is not today , but the idea of delaying gratification keeps me going .
J.D .
Is it really that easy ?
You were able to do this because you had a goal .
What was the situation like for those people you worked and lived with ?
Did they have goals ?
Did they save ?
Adam
Of course it 's easy for me to say it was easy .
I had a goal .
I was out to prove a point .
I had the mentality and I knew what I had to do to get the results I wanted .
But what surprised me most , and what makes my story so fascinating , is that so many people around me were doing the same thing .
It was most prevalent in the shelter ( where some people had spent a lifetime learning from their mistakes ) , but it was just as prevalent outside of the shelter with guys like Derrick Hale , who emerges as the hero of my experience in Charleston .
Derrick was a guy I was working with at the moving company .
He had come from rural Kingstree , SC , and he truly knew what poverty was like having grown up in a world of bologna and pickle sandwiches and maybe the lights will turn on , maybe not .
And there he was in Charleston , saving his money just like I was .
Actually , that 's cocky of me to say , since I was learning so many lessons from him .
Derrick was unique in that not only did he have a goal , but he had a vision for achieving that goal .
There 's a monumental difference , and I really learned that throughout the course of my time in Charleston .
Everybody knows what they want ( nice house , car , vacation money , etc. ) and many people know what can get in the way of achieving those goals ( see poor spending habits above ) .
But !
Some people really struggle with the discipline of their vision .
Derrick wanted a house , and near the end of my time in Charleston , he moved into a brand new 3 - bedroom , two - story house , with a patio and a fenced in yard for his daughter and dog to play .
He was 25 and he worked as a mover , but he knew how to handle his money .
So , is it realistic to set goals and save your money and make worthy investments ?
Of course it is !
Are people doing it ?
Of course they are , just as there are people that are squandering their money to bad habits .
J.D .
In other interviews , you say that you were n't “ particularly impressed ” by Barbara Ehrenreich 's Nickel and Dimed , and that your project is a response to that book .
Can you elaborate ?
What were you responding to ?
Adam
Well , first of all , I 'll say that Ehrenreich is a very talented journalist .
From the point of view that she writes well , Ehrenreich is okay with me .
But the thing about Nickel and Dimed that is so depressing is Ehrenreich 's attitude .
Forget politics and economics for a moment .
She had an agenda , and she wrote along those lines .
She had a point to prove and she proved it .
( Of course , the same can be said for my side of the story , although I 'd like to think I went down to Charleston with a little bit more of an open mind . )
She wrote about how tough and depressing poverty is .
Really ?
Tough and depressing ?
Of course it is !
I wanted to believe that there were people living in these tumultuous circumstances who were n't living the life of cyclical misery that Ehrenreich was writing about .
So I sought a discovery of my own with this project .
The economics side of Ehrenreich 's story did n't make sense to me from the beginning and she never proved her point .
To me , anyway .
She lived in a hotel , ate out , did n't look for ways to really save money .
In the end , I discovered that both Ehrenreich and I have valid points .
But there is a stark difference in her attitude .
She postured to fail , and she did .
I postured to succeed , and I did .
J.D .
Like Ehrenreich , you had a difficult time finding a job .
Describe this experience .
What made it difficult ?
How did you finally find work ?
What advice do you have for somebody who might be looking for work , but struggling to find it ?
Adam
That was the biggest surprise of my journey .
There I was , “ Adam Shepard , the King of the American Dream , ” out to live this incredible project , and after two weeks I did n't have a job .
I was complaining about my woes in the workforce one night with a couple of the guys at the shelter .
One of them , Phil Coleman , and I had a pretty colorful exchange where he essentially told me that I needed to be a whole heckuva lot more assertive .
“ You think managers are going to call here , eager to hire a homeless dude ? ”
So , he gave me the secret .
To paraphrase , he told me to go to these managers and tell them who you are , that you are the greatest worker on the planet and that it would be a mistake not to hire you .
If they take you on , great .
If not , move on down the line .
By day 's end , you 're gonna have a job .
So I did .
The next day , I went to see Curtis at Fast Company , a moving company where I 'd already applied .
“ Curt ! ” I said .
“ I 'm Adam Shepard , and I 'm the greatest mover on the planet .
It would be a mistake for you not to hire me . ”
He looked at me across the table and smiled , knowing I was lying like hell to him .
But he liked my attitude — especially after I offered to work a day for free — so he hired me on the spot .
Again , it 's interesting that I needed a boost from a comrade at the homeless shelter .
I would have gotten a job eventually , but Phil Coleman gave me a hand up .
Everybody has their own unique situation in the workforce ( skills , education … or not ) , but all I can say is that one day I 'm going to woo a manager at a Fortune 500 company just like I did to Curtis at the moving company .
Phil Coleman 's advice carries over to every walk of life .
J.D .
What advice can you offer others for whom low - wage jobs are a reality of life , who do n't have the luxury of returning to a middle - class lifestyle once the experiment is over ?
Adam
Quite frankly , it is a marathon and not a sprint .
That 's why I love the concept of this blog .
Get Rich Slowly .
Everyone has their own unique circumstances .
Maybe you are young and healthy like me and you can fight out quick .
Maybe you are a single mother of two and you need more time .
Maybe you are an older gentleman and you 're confined to a wheelchair .
Everybody faces adversity , and everybody has their own story to write in the end .
It 's important to question : Am I making the most of my situation ?
Am I on track ?
Am I prepared to be disciplined for 2 , 3 , 5 , 10 years ?
This is n't to say that we need to be robots — there 's a lot to be said about how happy we were down in Charleston as penny - pinchers — but we need to maintain that focus .
And also , are we imparting our knowledge — and mistakes — on others … our friends , our family , our children ?
That 's how we really begin to break the cycle of the persistence of the same lifestyle .
And whatever you do , do n't lose sight of that prize that you 're shooting for .
J.D .
Poverty is a political football .
What do you think can be done to help the working poor improve their situation .
Adam
There 's a lot to be said about the current welfare state .
Is the government doing enough to help our working poor ?
I say there are many good programs .
The programs I used really helped me get back on my feet .
Can there be more ?
Sure — more educational programs on financial literacy and parenting , for example .
More affordable housing and fair access to a college education for everyone would be great .
It 's not enough , though .
It never has been , never will be .
What can we do in the meantime , though ?
The power has to be with the people .
The government can't help us if we are n't helping ourselves .
Cliché ?
Fair enough , but why are some people listening and others are n't ?
I do n't really know the answer to that question .
But I do know that it is ever - so - important that we draw inspiration from others , those that are making it .
Millions have lived the American Dream — from every culture , gender , size , etc. — just as millions have wasted the opportunities placed in front of them .
My story is pretty cool , yeah , but I was fortunate to draw inspiration from the guys I met along the way : Phil Coleman , BG , Omar Walten , Derrick Hale .
If my neighbor makes it out , then maybe I can make it out too !
Especially if that neighbor goes back after he 's made it to spit out a few words of advice , to offer that bit of inspiration .
Our greatest heroes are those around us .
I truly believe that , and that is why I want to get this story out as much as possible .
If just one person gains inspiration and changes his or her life because of my book , then it 's a success .
And , based on the emails I 've received , it already is .
J.D .
Anything else you 'd like the readers of Get Rich Slowly to know ?
Adam
Do n't buy my book .
Check it out from the library , borrow it from a friend , read it over a cup of coffee at Barnes and Noble .
But do n't buy it .
Save your $ 13.95 plus shipping .
Invest it .
Buy a share of stock or a bucket and some water and go wash windows .
Although it 's inspirational and enlightening ( and damn entertaining ! ) , you do n't need Scratch Beginnings to know what you have to do to make things happen in your life .
Final Thoughts
I am not some neo -con crusader who believes that the poor deserve what they get .
Far from it .
I 'm a middle - of - the - road kind of guy , who actually leans left on issues of poverty .
But I also believe that success starts inside each of us , regardless of our circumstances .
Generally , what we choose to do and how we react to our world plays a far greater role in what we 're able to accomplish than anything else .
I like Shepard 's example , and believe it can be an inspiration to others .
Meanwhile , Barbara Ehrenreich hates hope .
It does n't surprise me she failed .
After re-reading Nickel and Dimed and interviewing Shepard , I feel more strongly than ever that basic financial literacy is one of the most important skills we can teach people to help them improve their quality of life .
Poverty is a complex issue — there are no easy answers .
Nations have been wrestling with the problem for centuries .
But one small piece of the puzzle is teaching people the basics of personal finance .

You might also be interested to read a couple of past Get Rich Slowly articles : “ Personal finance on film : The Farmer 's Wife ” and “ Breaking the shackles : How to escape from minimum wage ” .
I am deeply grateful to Shepard for taking the time to answer my questions .
His responses went far beyond what I was expecting .
I look forward to reading his book .
After receiving access to the iPhone and iPod touch through Apple 's SDK , Sun Microsystems says it will release a version of Java for the two Apple devices .
The decision was made just a day after Apple announced its SDK plans and after an investigation which suggested that a Java virtual machine environment would be feasible , according to Sun 's Java marketing VP , Eric Klein .
Initially , the software will be a variant of Java Micro Edition , a mobile version of the software most often used for cellphone games as well as some specialized business apps , such as CRM ( customer relations management ) or ERP ( enterprise resource planning ) tools .
However , the Sun official also said that the software would hopefully be optimized for the iPhone and allow access to features specific to Apple 's mobile platform .
" We 're going to work to make sure that the [ virtual machine ] offers the Java applications as much access to the native functionality of the iPhone as possible , " Klein said .
The executive also said his company would n't rule out more advanced developments .
JavaFX , a second mobile version of Java built partly to substitute for Flash and other web animations , was possible .
Over time , the company could also write a version of Java Standard Edition if its initial experience proves worthwhile .
Congressman : ' We do n't have the military capability to play chicken with Iran ' Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday October 26 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Harsh US sanctions announced yesterday against Iran could help to lay the groundwork for an armed conflict that America 's military simply is n't prepared for , Rep. Jim Moran ( D - VA ) told MSNBC host Tucker Carlson .
Asked by Carlson why Democrats had issues with the sanctions , Moran said there was a " sense of deja vu . "
" We have a little history with this administration , " said the congressman .
" They require things that they know are not going to be received well by the Iranian administration , and it comes to a stalemate -- a game of chicken if you will -- and that 's what we 're concerned about . "
And if an armed conflict did occur , Moran was skeptical that the US forces , already heavily committed in Afghanistan and Iraq , could be effective .
" Iran is a big country -- 70 million people , " he said .
" We do n't have the military capability to play chicken with Iran . "
Moran went on to explain his view that the sanctions may be just the first step in a plan intentionally designed to increase the likelihood of a conflict : " They 're doing things that they know are just going to taunt the Iranian administration and create a bolder stance on their part , " said Moran .
" You know , we do n't do this to the Burmese military or the North Korean military ... we do n't label any of these awful military regimes to be terrorists .
Later in the segment , Moran said he was was n't sure diplomacy was a real priority for the Bush administration .
" I question that that 's the result they 're trying to achieve , because they 're not sitting down and talking with Iran under any conditions , " he said .
" Iran has to agree to all of the conditions before they will talk to them .
That 's the problem , that 's what we did with Iraq . "
Pressed by Carlson to explain what an " adult " plan was to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon , Moran recommended a nuanced diplomatic strategy .
" See if there is a a way to allow them to have nuclear power to power their civilian activities , but not to get into the area of nuclear weaponry , " he said .
" I still think that 's possible , but how would we know when we 're doing everything to isolate , to marginalize them , to create this confrontation ... which is what some of the neocons who pushed us into Iraq would really like to see . "

It is impossible to claim that God does n't exist .
Only to opine it .

No .
It 's impossible ( for now ) to prove that gods do n't exist .
It 's perfectly possible to claim it .
But then , since no - one 's shown any evidence that gods do exist , it 's a very safe assumption to believe that they do n't .

What do you mean " for now " ?
Nothing can be finally proven .
All proof has the status of a very safe assumption , and nothing more than that .
Arguments about the existence of God always contain a certain amount of trash consisting of " there 's no proof He does n't exist " and " there 's no proof He does " .
All those parts of the argument are a waste of space , whichever side they come from .

How do you know that nothing can be finally proven ?
That 's a statement that you 'll need to prove .
Who knows what people will know in the future ?
I would n't dismiss the possibility that , in the distant future , everything that can be know will be known .
It seems a little bit presumptuous to dictate what people will know for sure millennia from now .

When medical marijuana vending machines appeared at a handful of Los Angeles - area dispensaries a couple of weeks ago , the press attention they received was enormous -- so enormous that it was heard deep in the bowels of the UN anti-drug bureaucracy in Vienna .
Roused from its dogmatic slumber by the clamor , the UN's International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) issued a statement last Friday saying the machines violate international drug treaties and should be shut down .
medical marijuana vending machine on CBS News
" The International Narcotics Control Board is deeply concerned about reports that computerized vending machines to dispense cannabis ( marijuana ) have been put into operation in Los Angeles , " said INCB head Philip Emafo in the statement .
" We know that the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law of the United States and we trust the authorities will stop such activities , which contravene the international drug control treaties , " he added .
The federal government may not recognize medical marijuana , but it is legal under state law .
So far , there is no indication that providing it via vending machines violates the state 's medical marijuana laws , much less international treaties which only prohibit non-medical use .
And so far , the DEA has not acted against them .
The machines have appeared in three Los Angeles dispensaries , and supporters say they are convenient for patients , secure , and could provide medical marijuana at lower prices .
Qualified patients who wish to use the vending machines must provide documentation and fingerprints to the dispensary , which then issues them a card to insert in the machine .
While the INCB reiterated that marijuana is illegal under federal law , it also seemed to suggest that if marijuana was going to be used , its use should be controlled by a federal agency .
" The control measures applied in California for the cultivation , production and use of cannabis do not meet the control standards set in the 1961 Convention to prevent diversion of narcotic drugs for illicit use , " the INCB said .
" Such standards require , inter alia , the control of cultivation and production of cannabis by a national cannabis agency , and detailed record keeping and reporting on the activities with cannabis , including reporting to INCB . "
The INCB also took pains to note that it " welcomes sound scientific research on the therapeutic usefulness of cannabis , " although it claimed that " so far , the results of research regarding the potential therapeutic usefulness have been limited . "
But in the same breath , it then complained that Canada and the Netherlands have authorized medical marijuana " without reporting conclusive research results to the WHO " and that " cannabis is used for medical purposes in some jurisdictions of the United States without having definitive proof of its efficacy . "
Whether the INCB's " concerns " will spur action from either federal or state authorities remains to be seen .
But with each new dispensary , each new delivery service , each entrepreneurial innovation like the vending machines , the medical marijuana industry is becoming ever more deeply entrenched in the social fabric of the Golden State .
It may be too late for anybody to stop it -- even the UN .

The 8.9in screen has a resolution of 1366 x 768 , and judging by the pics the machine offers a two USB ports , Gigabit Ethernet and what looks like a four - pin Firewire port .
There 's an ExpressCard slot too and a webcam above the display .
It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth .
It weighs from 1.13kg .
The 2133 is down as running a choice of Linux or Windows Vista .
Alas , the story does n't provide any indication of what 's under the hood , but the next generation of Intel 's Ultra Mobile Plaform , codenamed ' Menlow ' , seems the most likely candidate .
And there 's the now obligatory solid - state disk option for those with the cash , and a regular hard drive for those without .

A British man has been killed in the Italian Alps after he ploughed into a safety net while sliding down a mountainside - on a mattress .
David Monk , 46 , was with three friends when the accident happened in the early hours of Saturday morning after the group had been out for the evening .
Mr Monk , a father of two from Ware , Hertfordshire , suffered severe injuries to his head and chest after he ploughed into the safety net while another two friends were also badly hurt .
Scroll down for more ...
Police said the incident happened at the resort of Sauze d'Oulx near Turin and the men were discovered by passing patrol on a motorski .
A spokesman said that the men had been using a foam crash barrier used as protection on a ski lift support , as a makeshift sledge .
The Italian media reported that he and three friends went sliding down a ski slope on " rubber mattresses " .
Mr Monk 's widow Anne , 43 , told how her husband 's death had left her and sons Connor , 15 , and 12 - year - old Barney distraught .
She said : " We 're completely devastated .
I really can't handle this .
He was a loving husband and father .
He was such a kind man who loved his family very much .
" It was just a tragic accident .
David was just out having a good time . "
This morning Alan McGregor , 46 , who was with Mr Monk , when the accident happened described the tragedy after he was released from hospital .
Speaking from his hotel in Sauze D'Oulx Mr McGregor , a surveyor , from Ware , Herts .
said : " It was just a freak accident .
There was nothing anyone could do .
" David hit his head on a corner post and he was gone virtually instantly .
The police and us tried to do what we could but he died there .
" We saw this group of lads playing with a mat that had been taken off from the fence and we just joined in with them .
" David got on the mat as well and it picked up speed very quickly ten seconds later he hit his head and he was gone .
" I can't believe it - there are kids sledging there today where it happened it 's just a freak accident .
" He hit the post where the mat had been removed and that was it .
It 's terrible for his wife and two young kids .
" We tried to help him but the impact was too strong .
He went into the gap where the padding was and hit his head .
" We had been out and we just joined some lads who were sliding down on the mat it just built up speed really quickly .
" We are all skiers and we had only been here for two days - we got here early Friday morning and were due to leave on Tuesday .
" My wife is looking after David 's wife and everyone is rallying around them .
He was a brillant guy and I had known him a long time . "
Today fellow Briton Richard Watkins , 41 , from Hatfield , was still in hospital being treated for head injuries suffered in the accident .
Medics tried to revive Mr Monk using cardiac massage but were unable to save his life and he was declared dead at the scene .
The third friend was said to be unhurt .
Superintendent Mauro Soraglia said : " The men were near the bottom of the slopes after spending the night drinking .
" They grabbed some foam barriers from the end of the runs and walked up the piste to use them as a sledge .
" They gathered speed and hit the fence that they had taken the crash parriers away from . "
Mr Monk 's neighbour Patrick Light said his death was " a tragedy " .
His thoughts were with Mr Monk 's wife , Anne , and their two teenage sons , Barney and Connor .
" He was a friendly sort of chap when you spoke to him .
I think we 're all very shocked by what 's happened .
" I feel particularly for Anne , as she 's got to bring up the kids . "
The family live in a four - bedroom detached house in a quiet cul - de- sac and were said to be well - liked in the community .
Neighbour Margaret Humphreys said : " They are both very nice people .
It 's a tremendous shock .
It 's dreadful for the family . "
Mr Monk and two other men were using the mats to slide down the mountain when the accident happened , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) said .
Italian police are treating the death as an accident .
Sauze d'Oulx is one of the five villages which make up the Via Lattea - or Milky Way - ski area close to the French border in northern Italy .
Hugely popular with British skiers , the resort is known for its party atmosphere .
It offers 140 ski slopes , on a surface of 400 Km and 92 lifts from 1350 to 2800 metres .

It is quite remarkable that a coterie of neocon intellectuals and influence peddlers can exhibit bizarre personal behavior , prove utterly incompetent in high appointive office , manufacture entirely false evidence to propel us into a disastrous war , and yet still have people willing to listen to them .
An outraged American public ought to be shouting " Enough !
You ’ve helped get a lot of people killed and wasted vast sums of money !
You ’ve trashed America ’s reputation .
We do n’t give a damn what you have to say . "
Case in point : James Woolsey , who just last November at Purdue was trying to sell us another war , saying , “ If you do n’t think Iran is interested in nuclear weapons I ’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn I ’d be happy to offer you .
Of course it ’s a nuclear weapons program . ”
Change " Iran " to " Iraq " and you ’ll find Woolsey used the same turn of phrase to market the Iraq fiasco .
Woolsey has a remarkable record , even for a neocon ; he has gone from searching for flying saucers at the CIA to claiming anybody who did n’t believe in a Saddam / al - Qaeda connection was " illiterate . "
Now he ’s trying to provoke " World War IV " with half the Muslim world .
Woolsey claims that in the 1960s he and his wife Sue actually saw a UFO .
Now back in the ’60s there were plenty of reasons folks might have seen strange things , but let ’s give the Woolseys the benefit of the doubt .
In any event , when President Clinton appointed Woolsey to head the CIA in 1993 , the new director of Central Intelligence immediately tasked senior officers with combing the files to ferret out secret information about flying saucers and extraterrestrials .
Not satisfied with the explanation that the CIA had no secret UFO files , Woolsey commissioned a report , CIA ’s Role in the Study of UFOs , 1947 - 1990 , which was released in 1996 , the year after his resignation .
When Woolsey departed the CIA after a scant two years on the job , his excuse was that he had n’t been able to establish a personal relationship with President Clinton .
Far more likely , however , is that Woolsey quit because he was unable to win the respect of his subordinates , who found his fixation with UFOs highly amusing .
Within the CIA Woolsey had come to be regarded as a kook .
Adding to Woolsey ’s discomfort was congressional criticism for his handling of the Aldrich Ames spy scandal .
Ames was a longtime CIA employee who had been tipping off the Soviets for years about the presence of CIA - run moles within their intelligence services .
When Ames was finally unmasked , Woolsey ’s response was simply to reprimand several officers , most of whom had already retired , and to blame the entire disaster on " systemic failure " within the agency .
Woolsey ’s time at the CIA was not entirely wasted .
Although a corporate lawyer by training , he seems to have learned a certain amount of trade craft , especially disinformation skills , which he would later employ to help fabricate the case for removing Saddam Hussein from power .
By the late 1990s Woolsey had jumped on the " get Saddam " bandwagon .
He was a signatory , along with fellow neocons Elliott Abrams , John Bolton , Richard Perle , and Paul Wolfowitz , of the Project for the New American Century ’s letter to Bill Clinton that called for " the removal of Saddam Hussein ’s regime from power " using " a full complement of diplomatic , political , and military efforts . "
Sept. 11 gave Woolsey and his associates their opportunity , and they began working diligently to shift the government ’s emphasis from destroying al - Qaeda to invading Iraq .
Shortly after the 9/11 attacks , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sent Woolsey to the UK to find a link between Saddam and al - Qaeda .
Woolsey came back with a story alleging that Mohammed Atta had met a senior Iraqi intelligence official in Prague shortly before Sept. 11 .
Never mind that only the most slender evidence supported the tale and that the FBI soon determined that Atta had been in Virginia Beach on the day in question ; the story was told and retold , especially by Vice President Cheney , and believed by a significant segment of the American public .
Woolsey ’s intemperate speech and captious manner between 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq reveal him to be a fanatic bent on war at any cost .
Shortly after 9/11 , Ted Koppel interviewed a James Woolsey very keen to make the case for war against Iraq .
When Koppel observed that " Nobody right now is suggesting that Iraq had anything to do with [ 9/11 ] .
In fact , quite the contrary , " Woolsey replied , " I do n’t think it matters .
I do n’t think it matters . "
And Woolsey could n’t restrain himself when attacking the French and Germans for refusing to hew to the neocon line on Iraqi WMDs : " If you believed him [ Saddam ] when he said , oh , that biological weapons program , well , we destroyed all that if Mr. Chirac or Mr. Schroeder believes that , I ’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn I ’d be delighted to sell them . "
Woolsey subsequently provided a wonderfully detailed but entirely fictional description of Saddam ’s nonexistent bioweapons : " In addition to hiding many tons of growth media for biological agents and pursuing its work on smallpox and anthrax , Iraq is the only nation in the world to have weaponized aflatoxin , whose primary purpose is to cause liver cancer in children . "
In 1998 Woolsey and his law firm , Shea & Gardner , were instrumental in obtaining $ 100 million from Congress to fund the Iraqi National Congress , a group of refugees , opportunists , and political hangers - on dedicated to regime change in Iraq .
The INC was led by master fraudster Ahmed Chalabi , who , before he became a favorite of Congress and the vice president ’s office , had been convicted in absentia of embezzling $ 230 million from Petra Bank in Jordan .
Chalabi ’s objective was not only to use Uncle Sam to remove Saddam from power but also to get himself appointed in Saddam ’s place .
To build the case for war , Chalabi provided a steady stream of Iraqi defectors with fake stories about Iraqi WMDs and Saddam ’s al - Qaeda connections .
Favored members of the media were also made privy to the defectors ’ tall tales .
In February 2002 Woolsey personally arranged to have Mohammad Harith , an INC - supplied defector , introduced to the Department of Defense and the Defense Intelligence Agency .
Harith claimed falsely that the Iraqi regime had bioweapons labs disguised as yogurt and milk trucks .
Ultimately Harith ’s story made it into the Bush administration ’s case for invasion , even though the CIA had labeled Harith a fabricator .
Woolsey also met with another Chalabi - sponsored defector , who famously but falsely claimed that an Iraqi training facility at Salman Pak was being used to instruct Iraqis and foreign jihadists in aircraft hijacking .
Not satisfied with the overthrow of the Iraqi regime , Woolsey has argued vehemently that Syria , Iran , the Palestinian Authority , Saudi Arabia , and even the U.S. - allied military dictatorship in Egypt all represent major threats to the United States .
In the wake of the U.S. ’ initial apparent success in Iraq , Woolsey remained a strong advocate of remaking the Middle East by force and even gave the name " World War IV " ( World War III having been the Cold War ) to the endeavor .
Woolsey contends that Western - style democracy ought to be substituted for most of the governments in the region , whether they be socialist dictatorships , military governments , traditional monarchies , or Islamic regimes .
Regrettably , Woolsey ’s knowledge of the Middle East is quite limited and his analysis flawed .
He does not understand that most Middle Eastern societies value Islamic tradition and Sharia law far higher than what they see as foreign notions of liberal democracy .
The Iraqi experience with democracy since 2003 has done nothing to alter that view .
As part of his argument for radical and violent change , Woolsey asserts that the hostility of many Arab and Muslim societies to the West and Western ideas is rooted in the nature of their autocratic , Islam - influenced governments .
But in making this assertion he conveniently overlooks the long history of unwanted and destructive Western interference in the Middle East , a few of the more egregious examples being the Sykes - Picot Agreement , the establishment of Israel and the marginalization of the Palestinians , the installation of the shah in Iran against the wishes of the Iranian people , and the invasion of Iraq .
In view of the disaster the U.S. has created in Iraq , both for ourselves and for the Iraqis , one would like to think that Woolsey has rethought his views about violent change .
But no : in the summer of 2006 , while Israel was bombing Lebanon with U.S. - supplied munitions once again , another activity unlikely to engender love for the U.S. in the Arab world , Woolsey advocated that the U.S. widen the war by bombing targets in Syria .
Woolsey apparently thinks Syria is ripe for regime change , and he consistently denounces its government as a " fascist " dictatorship , although Syria ’s agglomeration of disparate ethnic and religious groups 
Druze , Alawite , Sunni , Shia , Armenian , Chaldean , and Eastern Orthodox  hardly fits the German or Italy model of a nation united by culture and blood anxious to invade surrounding states .
And before Woolsey continues his propaganda war against Syria , he needs to explain why a million and a half Iraqis prefer to live as refugees in Syria under a " fascist " dictator rather than in the liberal democracy his advocacy has helped create in Iraq .
James
Woolsey did get one thing right : " As we move toward a new Middle East we will make a lot of people very nervous . "
But the folks who are the most nervous today are not in the Middle East ; they ’re elected and appointed GOP officeholders who are going to find themselves unemployed this time next year .
Look out , Ninjas .
Martial arts expert Ron Balicki is prepared to choke you with what appears to be an oversized Girl Scout sash .
When I saw this rather fascinating video for the first time , it raised a big question :
Is this weapon , a combat sarong , more trouble than it ’s worth ?
From my angle , it seems like he uses traditional martial arts moves to own his opponent and then finishes them off with a fancy sarong trick .
Unless it can cause considerably more damage than a good punch , I would not buy one .
Then again , if he was wearing one of those things and tried to sell me cookies , I would definitely buy them !
Maybe I ’m missing something .
Is the sarong a worthwhile weapon ?

Civilization , in fact , grows more and more maudlin and hysterical ; especially under democracy it tends to degenerate into a mere combat of crazes ; the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed ( and hence clamorous to be led to safety ) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins , most of them imaginary .

Here ’s
Texas , where she won by only three :
And … here ’s Ohio , where she won by 10 :
I.e. race was worth 12 points to her overall and eight to Obama , for a net to Her Majesty of + 4 .
Fair comparison , though ?
His “ racist ” supporters may be motivated by the possibility of a black president being able to improve race relations ; doubtless he has his prejudiced fans too , starting with the kindly old pastor pal of his , but surely some percentage is voting less because they ’re pro-black or anti-white than pro-postracial .
It ’s harder to make that same case for Hillary .
Add in the fact that the exit polls were bound to have lowballed the number of people for whom race mattered , as some simply wo n’t cop to it , and you ’ve got some tasty nuance .
As a control group , here ’s the race question in two previous primaries .
First is Massachusetts , where she won a contest that could have gone either way ; for a state that ’s supposedly so notoriously racist , her numbers here are lower than in Texas and Ohio .
And second is Missouri , where Obama won by a single point — a margin that ’s almost accounted for by the net here .
Funny how we did n’t hear much about that on Super Tuesday .
Exit question via Karl :
How come Hillary ’s whopping margins on the gender question do n’t qualify as a “ reverse sexist ” vote ?
Are her supporters “ pro-postgender ” ?
( CNN ) --
For two weeks we have watched nearly every political hack from Michigan and Florida hit the airwaves to tell us that voters in those states deserve to have their votes counted , and new elections should be called for and paid by­ the Democratic National Committee .
Roland S. Martin says Florida and Michigan blew their shot in the delegate process by moving up their primaries .
One word they all keep tossing around is disenfranchisement .
Because of this nation 's sordid history on the issue of denying African - Americans the right to vote , those calling for a revote know the true power of the word , and just uttering it sort of backs the opposition up .
But folks , I 'm sorry .
Knowing full well how the two political hacks --­ also called governors of Michigan and Florida -- deliberately chose to ignore the Democratic Party rules and try to leapfrog the other states , I just do n't have any compassion for them .
Just listening to Jennifer Granholm of Michigan and Charlie Crist of Florida whine and complain on national TV is just too much .
They keep blaming Howard Dean , chairman of the DNC , for this debacle .
But he 's not to blame .
They could have vetoed the bill , or told their state legislatures to stop the grandstanding and get on with the people 's business .
But they chose otherwise .
Yes , I do feel sorry for the voters in those two states because their votes should have mattered .
It would have been great had they counted .
But it was the elected officials in both states who chose to go down this terrible path .
Had they just remained where they were , their delegates may have made the difference in this close presidential race between Sens.
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .
Now it 's March , and less than a dozen states remain , and Michigan and Florida are demanding that the DNC , superdelegates , even the campaigns , do something to allow them to vote again .
And by the way , come up with a way to foot the $ 20 million to $ 30 million it will cost for a full - fledged election .
If it were my call , I would tell them , " See ya in four years . "
Sure , that 's pretty harsh , but 48 other states followed the rules .
There is no doubt some of those states thought this would be over by Super Tuesday on February 5 and wanted their state to have a say in who the nominee would be , but they chose to be patient and wait their turn .
Michigan and Florida did n't .
Senators and members of Congress from multiple states were clamoring to get in on the action .
But with the DNC 's threat looming large , they got with the program .
Michigan and Florida did n't .
So we are all supposed to feel sorry for Sens.
Carl Levin of Michigan and Bill Nelson of Florida because they want this issue addressed by the DNC , but were they pleading with their governors to not sign the law changing the dates ?
Nope .
The compassion just is n't there for the arrogant folks from Michigan and Florida .
If this is all about seating delegates , fine .
Split their numbers down the middle and give half to Clinton and the other half to Obama .
There .
We just saved $ 30 million .
But the DNC should protect the integrity of its rules process .
If it acquiesces , how many states will pull the same trick in four years ?
The precedent would have been set , and anyone else could make the same argument :
Please , please , give us another chance , even though we brought this on ourselves .
No .
Enough .
Let 's end this madness and tell Florida and Michigan that they had their shot .
They blew it .
It 's time to move on and let the people who know how to play by the rules get on with this process .
They made their bed .
Now sleep in it .
And the people in Michigan and Florida should throw out the bums who stiffed them .
Somebody must pay for the sins of these two states , and they should look to the politicians who keep running their mouths on TV demanding a revote .

Sometimes , it 's the simplest technologies that have the greatest potential impact on people 's lives .
Take the Vestergaard Frandsen Group 's mobile personal filtration system , otherwise known as LifeStraw .
It is a powder - blue plastic tube — much thicker than an ordinary straw — containing filters that make water teeming with typhoid- , cholera - and diarrhea - causing microorganisms drinkable .
The filters , made up of a halogenated resin , kill nearly 100 percent of bacteria and nearly 99 percent of the viruses that pass through LifeStraw .
A University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill evaluation tested the device 's performance in water containing Escherichia coli B and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria and the MS2 coliphage virus as well as iodine and silver .
The results indicated that LifeStraw filtered out all contaminants to levels where they do n't pose a health risk to someone drinking the water .
But the device does not filter heavy metals such as iron or fluoride nor does it remove parasites like cryptosporidium or giardia , although the Switzerland - based company 's CEO , Mikkel Vestergaard Frandsen , says there is a version of LifeStraw available to relief groups in Bangladesh and India that can filter arsenic .
At less than 10 inches ( 25 centimeters ) long , the device can filter up to 185 gallons ( 700 liters ) of water , estimated to be about a year 's supply for one person .
The device is no longer usable when its filters become too clogged to pass water through , typically after a year of hard use .
The success of the personal filtration system led Vestergaard Frandsen to introduce earlier this month its LifeStraw Family device , an instant microbiological purifier that provides about 2.6 gallons ( 10 liters ) of safe drinking water in an hour and about 4,000 gallons ( 15,000 liters ) over its life span for a family of six .
LifeStraw Family is designed to sieve dirt , parasites , bacteria and viruses , and will be available starting in May .
The next step is promoting LifeStraw technology so that nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) and aid groups will buy and distribute them .
This is no small task , given that the need for clean water is not promoted as heavily as AIDS prevention or literacy training in some developing countries , Frandsen says , adding , " No one is stepping forward to be the rock star of diarrhea [ eradication ] . "
But LifeStraw was recognized by Saatchi & Saatchi's public relations arm as the top " world - changing idea " in a recent competition of technologies impacting medicine , education and aid work .
Vestergaard Frandsen Group received $ 50,000 from Saatchi , plus another $ 50,000 worth of the PR firm 's marketing services .
Saatchi , which is owned by France 's Publicis Groupe , SA , chose LifeStraw over a field of competitors that included a reusable controller to improve the distribution of IV fluids , a collapsible wheel that can be folded down for easier storage when not in use on bicycles or wheelchairs , an energy - efficient laptop designed for children in developing countries , a 3 - D display that uses special optics and software to project a hologramlike image of patient anatomy for cancer treatment , an inkjet printing system for fabricating tissue scaffolds on which cells can be grown , a visual prosthesis for bypassing a diseased or damaged eye and sending signals directly to the brain , books with embedded sound tracks to help educate illiterate adults on health issues , a phone that provides telecommunications coverage to poor rural populations in developing countries , and a brain - computer interface designed to help paralyzed people communicate via neural signals .

According to my calculations : around 2.7 m registered users .
I obtained this number by finding random Digg users and extracting their user id .
The user id is in a hidden HTML form input field on each Digg user 's page .
The Digg user page also gives their date of registration .
Using this I was able to plot every month from December 2004 ( when Kevin Rose registered ) up to this month .
Here 's a picture :
Of course , the user id might be being generated in some other way , but I suspect that it's an auto_increment field in their database .
To validate my data I checked the Digg blog and in March 2007 Kevin Rose wrote that Digg had 1 million users .
This ties directly with my data , and hence I think I 'm correct .
If this data is correct then looking at the last 6 months Digg is growing at a rate of around 110,000 users per month .
Now that does n't say how many are active , but it 's interesting data nonetheless .
Observations : 1 . The inflection point at June 2006 corresponds to the launch of Digg v3 which marks the point that Digg stopped being just about technology and added categories like World and Business and Entertainment .
2. Kevin Rose was on the cover of Business Week in August 2006.3 .
Another calibration point is this post listing the number of Digg users as around 700,000 in December 2006 .
That also matches my data .4 .
There 's a big jump of users in December 2006 when Digg added multimedia features like videos .
5 .
The May 2007 jump corresponds to the AACS key " controversy " .
6 .
Yet more confirmation that these figures are correct .
TechCrunch reports that Digg had 200,000 users in March 2006.7 . " Kurt " pointed out that the Digg API gives a user count of 2,211,964 .
That 's interesting because it gives us a way to estimate the number of spammer / abuser accounts banned by Digg : about 500k or around 19 % or registered users .

State plans Bay Area pesticide spraying Plan is to get rid of the brown apple moth that could destroy agriculture in region
The state agriculture department plans to use airplanes at night this summer to spray a farm pesticide over urban San Francisco , Marin County and the East Bay , intending to eradicate a potentially destructive moth .
The little - known proposal to wipe out the light brown apple moth , which if it became established could destroy the region 's agricultural industry , has developed increasing opposition among some residents who fear for their health .
Hundreds of people whose homes and yards were sprayed in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties from September to December have filed reports that said the pesticide seems to have caused coughing , wheezing , muscle aches and headaches , among other symptoms .
One Monterey family reported that a child had a first - time asthma attack .
State officials say the amount of pesticide applied should n't pose severe health risks , but they 've also refused to rule out that the spray can affect humans , particularly sensitive people such as children and the elderly .
Spraying of the pesticide , called Checkmate , is expected to begin in the Bay Area in August and could continue for five years over San Francisco , Daly City , Colma , Oakland , Piedmont , Emeryville , El Cerrito , El Sobrante , Tiburon and Belvedere .
Other chemicals could also be used .
Before its use in Santa Cruz and Monterey last year , the pesticide , a hormone that throws off the scents of mating moths , had been used aerially only over farms and never over populated areas .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture obtained an " emergency exemption from registration " from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that allows the agency to use the pesticide in aerial sprays over California cities .
Because of that exemption , the spraying program is n't subject to state approval , according to representatives of the state Department of Pesticide Regulation .
There is no widespread infestation of the light brown apple moth , but U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say they are trying to head off a potential disaster .
The federal agency has given the California Department of Food and Agriculture $ 74.5 million to conduct the spraying program , which officials say is warranted because an international survey of pests ranks the moth high as a threat , and moths have been found in the state , primarily in the Bay Area .
The little moth was first trapped in Alameda County in March .
The state agricultural agency followed up and found moths in 11 counties , said Larry Hawkins , a USDA spokesman .
The moth 's larvae stunts seedlings , pits leaves and can damage fruit trees , citrus and grapes .
Its potential spread to almost every plant around , including native trees , threatens crops worth up to $ 640 million a year , he said .
The pesticide over time reduces the moth population by interfering with its ability to reproduce and does n't require the use of a more toxic insecticide , Hawkins said .
Steve Lyle , a spokesman for the state agricultural department , said new trapping data for 2008 could change the aerial spray program set for Marin , San Francisco and the East Bay .
" But right now , based on what we know , it will go ahead , " he said .
In response to complaints from residents from Santa Cruz and Monterey counties , several state agencies - the Department of Pesticide Regulation , the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and the Public Health Department - issued a statement that acknowledged that eye , skin or respiratory irritations reported by residents could have been caused by high applications but not by low ones .
" The toxicological information on the Checkmate product indicates that exposure to high levels of the applied material would be consistent with many of the reported symptoms , " the statement read .
The pesticide levels used in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties were extremely low , the agencies said , making it unlikely that anyone was exposed to a high dose .
However , the statement cautioned that " not all health effects can be predicted and because the general population includes susceptible ( people ) , such as children , the elderly and those with chronic diseases , we cannot provide a definitive cause for their symptoms . "
The USDA 's Hawkins said the EPA has generally not been concerned over the toxicity of Checkmate .
For example , he said , the agency never set a maximum limit for the pesticide in food or required farm workers to stay out of fields that had just been sprayed .
" It 's not a material the EPA would have any concern about , " Hawkins said .
Many residents in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties are joining an umbrella group , California Alliance to Stop the Spray , or CASS , to fight the continuing spraying program , which is expected to resume June 1 .
More than 600 people from the two counties have reported symptoms , including asthma attacks , bronchial irritation , lung congestion and soreness , difficulty breathing , coughing and eye and throat irritation .
Dr. Randy Baker , a family practitioner in Soquel , said he treated about a dozen patients with a range of symptoms when the area was being sprayed .
Although he said there was no way to ascertain a cause - and - effect relationship , he had a number of concerns about the pesticide , including the fact that it was not tested for use over urban areas .
" There is tremendous individual variation in the ability of people to process and detoxify environmental chemicals .
For example , there could be a prescription medicine that 100 people take with minimal adverse effect but another person could take it and suffer extreme side effects and even death , " Baker said .
Baker was also shocked that the agricultural department started spraying the chemical on an evening when people were out walking in Santa Cruz .
" At 8 p.m. , they started spraying in the most populated areas of Santa Cruz County .
I have patients who did n't know the spray was happening who were out walking on Mission Avenue .
Clearly , the greatest danger is a person being out of doors when the planes are going over .
They 're going to be inhaling the chemicals , " Baker said .
Further complicating the issue is that some residents say they simply do n't trust the government information .
The pheromone is not the only chemical in the spray .
Checkmate also contains at least 10 other ingredients .
The product contains a surfactant , which could have coated the more than 600 birds that turned up injured after the spraying last year as far north as Año Nuevo and south to Del Monte Beach in Monterey , they say .
Government agencies attributed the substance that coated the birds to algal changes .
Elizabeth Quinn , a resident of Santa Cruz , is among those opposed .
On Nov. 9 , starting at midnight , the planes flew 500 - feet above Quinn 's house in Santa Cruz until 5:30 in the morning .
" They came over every 20 to 30 minutes , back and forth , back and forth , " she said .
Quinn did n't suffer any health problems after the sprays , but she is worried about the people who did .
" I have 6 - year - old and 3 - year - old grandsons , " she said , " and I 'm very concerned about their health . "
Also Thursday , about 80 people turned up at a hearing held by Assemblyman Jared Huffman , D - San Rafael , who heads the Assembly 's Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee .
State health and agricultural officials and members of nonprofit groups presented details of the pending program , and most of the public that spoke were concerned about aerial spraying .
Last month , the Albany City Council voted unanimously to oppose the spraying , and the nonprofit Center for Environmental Health started holding meetings , the first in Oakland , to address questions from worried residents .
A series of meetings is scheduled this month to discuss the environmental reports of the moth - eradication program in the Bay Area .
OK , we ’ve talked about why you need a spec , what a spec has in it , and who should write them .
In this fourth and final part of the series I ’ll share some of my advice for writing good specs .
The biggest complaint you ’ll hear from teams that do write specs is that “ nobody reads them . ”
When nobody reads specs , the people who write them tend to get a little bit cynical .
It ’s like the old Dilbert cartoon in which engineers use stacks of 4 - inch thick specs to build extensions to their cubicles .
At your typical big , bureaucratic company , everybody spends months and months writing boring specs .
Once the spec is done , it goes up on the shelf , never to be taken down again , and the product is implemented from scratch without any regard to what the spec said , because nobody read the spec , because it was so dang mind - numbing .
The very process of writing the spec might have been a good exercise , because it forced everyone , at least , to think over the issues .
But the fact that the spec was shelved ( unread and unloved ) when it was completed makes people feel like it was all a bunch of work for naught .
Also , if your spec never gets read , you get a lot of arguments when the finished product is delivered .
Somebody ( management , marketing , or a customer ) says : “ wait a minute !
You promised me that there would be a Clam Steamer !
Where ’s the clam steamer ? ”
And the programmers say , “ no , actually , if you look on the spec on chapter 3 , subchapter 4 , paragraph 2.3.0.1 , you ’ll see it says quite explicitly ‘ no clam steamer . ' ”
But that does n’t satisfy the customer , who is always right , so the grumpy programmers have to go retrofit a clam steamer into the thing ( making them even more cynical about specs ) .
Or a manager says , “ hey , all the wording on this dialog is too verbose , and there should be an advertisement at the top of every dialog box . ”
And the programmers say , in frustration , “ but you approved the spec which precisely listed the layout and contents of every dialog box ! ”
But of course , the manager had n’t actually read the spec , because when he tried , his brain started seeping out through his eye sockets , and anyway , it was interfering with his Tuesday golf game .
So .
Specs are good , but not if nobody reads them .
As a spec-writer , you have to trick people into reading your stuff , and you should also probably make an effort not to cause any already - too - small brains to leak out through eye - sockets .
Tricking people into reading your stuff is usually just a matter of good writing .
But it ’s not fair of me to just say “ be a good writer ” and leave it at that .
Here are four easy rules that you absolutely must follow to make specs that get read .
Rule 1 : Be Funny
Yep , rule number one in tricking people into reading your spec is to make the experience enjoyable .
Do n’t tell me you were n’t born funny , I do n’t buy it .
Everybody has funny ideas all the time , they just self - censor them because they think that it ’s “ unprofessional . ”
Feh .
Sometimes you have to break the rules .
If you read the volumes of garbage I ’ve written on this web site , you ’ll notice that there are a few lame attempts at being funny scattered throughout .
Just four paragraphs ago I was making a gross body - fluid joke and making fun of managers for playing golf .
Even though I ’m not really that funny , I still try pretty hard , and even the act of flailing around trying to be funny is in itself amusing , in a sad - clown sort of way .
When you ’re writing a spec , an easy place to be funny is in the examples .
Every time you need to tell a story about how a feature works , instead of saying :
The user types Ctrl+N to create a new Employee table and starts entering the names of the employees .
write something like :
Miss Piggy , poking at the keyboard with a eyeliner stick because her chubby little fingers are too fat to press individual keys , types Ctrl +N to create a new Boyfriend table and types in the single record “ Kermit . ”
If you read a lot of Dave Barry , you ’ll discover that one of the easiest ways to be funny is to be specific when it ’s not called for .
“ Scrappy pugs ” are funnier than “ dogs . ” “ Miss Piggy ” is funnier than “ the user ” .
Instead of saying “ special interests , ” say “ left - handed avocado farmers . ”
Instead of saying “ People who refuse to clean up after their dogs should be punished , ” say that they should be “ sent to prisons so lonely that the inmates have to pay spiders for sex . ”
Oh , and , by the way , if you think that it ’s unprofessional to be funny , then I ’m sorry , but you just do n’t have a sense of humor .
( Do n’t deny it .
People without senses of humors always deny it .
You ca n’t fool me . )
And if you work in a company where people will respect you less because your specs are breezy , funny , and enjoyable to read , then go find another company to work for , because life is just too damn short to spend your daylight hours in such a stern and miserable place .
Rule 2 : Writing a spec is like writing code for a brain to execute
Here ’s why I think that programmers have trouble writing good specs .
When you write code , your primary audience is the compiler .
Yeah , I know , people have to read code , too , but it ’s generally very hard for them .
For most programmers it ’s hard enough to get the code into a state where the compiler reads it and correctly interprets it ; worrying about making human - readable code is a luxury .
Whether you write :
void print_count ( FILE * a , char * b , int c ) {
fprintf ( a , “ there are %d %s
” , c , b ) ; } main ( ) { int n ; n =
10 ; print_count ( stdout , “ employees ” , n ) /* code
deliberately obfuscated */ }
or
printf ( “ there are 10 employees
” ) ;
you get the same output .
Which is why , if you think about it , you tend to get programmers who write things like :
Assume a function AddressOf ( x ) which is defined as the mapping from a user x , to the RFC - 822 compliant email address of that user , an ANSI string .
Let us assume user A and user B , where A wants to send an email to user B .
So user A initiates a new message using any ( but not all ) of the techniques defined elsewhere , and types AddressOf ( B ) in the To : editbox .
This could also have been speced as :
Miss Piggy wants to go to lunch , so she starts a new email and types Kermit ’s address in the “ To : ” box .
Technical note : the address must be a standard Internet address ( RFC - 822 compliant . )
They both “ mean ” the same thing , theoretically , except that the first example is impossible to understand unless you carefully decode it , and the second example is easy to understand .
Programmers often try to write specs which look like dense academic papers .
They think that a “ correct ” spec needs to be “ technically ” correct and then they are off the hook .
The mistake is that when you write a spec , in addition to being correct , it has to be understandable , which , in programming terms , means that it needs to be written so that the human brain can “ compile ” it .
One of the big differences between computers and human brains is that computers are willing to sit there patiently while you define the terms that you want to use later .
But humans wo n’t understand what you ’re talking about unless you motivate it first .
Humans do n’t want to have to decode something , they just want to read it in order and understand it .
For humans , you have to provide the big picture and then fill in the details .
With computer programs , you start at the top and work your way to the bottom , with full details throughout .
A computer does n’t care if your variable names are meaningful .
A human brain understands things much better if you can paint a vivid picture in their mind by telling a story , even if it ’s just a fragment of a story , because our brains have evolved to understand stories .
If you show a chess board , in the middle of a real game of chess , to an experienced chess player for even a second or two , they will instantly be able to memorize the position of every piece .
But if you move around a couple of pieces in nonsensical ways that could n’t happen in normal play ( for example , put some pawns on the first row , or put both black bishops on black squares ) , it becomes much , much harder for them to memorize the board .
This is different from the way computers think .
A computer program that could memorize a chess board could memorize both possible and impossible layouts with equal ease .
The way the human brain works is not random access ; pathways tend to be strengthened in our brains and some things are just easier to understand than other things because they are more common .
So , when you ’re writing a spec , try to imagine the person you are addressing it to , and try to imagine what you ’re asking them to understand at every step .
Sentence by sentence , ask yourself if the person reading this sentence will understand it at a deep level , in the context of what you ’ve already told them .
If some members of your target audience do n’t know what RFC - 822 is , you either have to define it , or , at the very least , bury the mention of RFC - 822 in a technical note , so that the executive - types who read the spec wo n’t give up and stop reading the first time they see a lot of technical jargon .
Rule 3 : Write as simply as possible
Do n’t use stilted , formal language because you think it ’s unprofessional to write in simple sentences .
Use the simplest language you can .
People use words like “ utilize ” because they think that “ use ” looks unprofessional .
( There ’s that word “ unprofessional ” again .
Any time somebody tells you that you should n’t do something because it ’s “ unprofessional , ” you know that they ’ve run out of real arguments . )
In fact I think that many people think that clear writing means that something is wrong .
Break things down to short sentences .
If you ’re having trouble writing a sentence clearly , break it into two or three shorter sentences .
Avoid walls of text : entire pages with just text .
People get scared and do n’t read them .
When was the last time you noticed a popular magazine or newspaper with entire pages of text ?
Magazines will go so far as to take a quote from the article and print it , in the middle of the page , in a giant font , just to avoid the appearance of a full page of text .
Use numbered or bulleted lists , pictures , charts , tables , and lots of whitespace so that the reading “ looks ” fluffier .
“ Magazines will go so far as to take a quote from the article and print it , in the middle of the page , in a giant font , just to avoid the appearance of a full page of text . ”
Nothing improves a spec more than lots and lots of screenshots .
A picture can be worth a thousand words .
Anyone who writes specs for Windows software should invest in a copy of Visual Basic , and learn to use it at least well enough to create mockups of the screens .
( For the Mac , use REAL Basic ; for Web pages , use Front Page or Dreamweaver ) .
Then capture these screenshots ( Ctrl + PrtSc ) and paste them into your spec .
Rule 4 : Review and reread several times
Um , well , I was originally planning to have a lengthy exegesis of this rule here , but this rule is just too simple and obvious .
Review and reread your spec several times , OK ?
When you find a sentence that is n’t super easy to understand , rewrite it .
I ’ve saved so much time by not explaining Rule 4 that I ’m going to add another rule .
R ule 5 : Templates considered harmful
Avoid the temptation to make a standard template for specs .
At first you might just think that it ’s important that “ every spec look the same . ”
Hint : it ’s not .
What difference does it make ?
Does every book on your bookshelf at home look exactly the same ?
Would you want them to ?
Worse , if you have templates , what tends to happen is that you add a bunch of sections to the template for things that you think are important for every feature .
Example : Big Bill decrees that from here on forward , every Microsquish product shall have an Internet component .
So the spec template now has a section that says “ Internet Component . ”
Whenever somebody writes a spec , no matter how trivial , they have to fill in that section that says “ Internet Component ” , even if they ’re just creating the spec for the Microsquish Keyboard .
( And you wondered why those useless Internet shopping buttons started cropping up like mushrooms on keyboards ) .
As these sections accumulate , the template gets pretty large .
( Here is an example of a very , very bad template for specifications .
Who needs a bibliography in a spec , for heaven ’s sake ?
Or a glossary ? )
The trouble with such a large template is that it scares people away from writing specs because it looks like such a daunting task .
A spec is a document that you want people to read .
In that way , it is no different than an essay in The New Yorker or a college paper .
Have you ever heard of a professor passing out templates for students to write their college papers ?
Have you ever read two good essays that could be fit into a template ?
Just drop the idea .
A Congressional committee scrutinized the outsized pay packages of Stanley O'Neal , Charles Prince and Angelo Mozilo and the chairman of their compensation committees against the backdrop of the mortgage crisis .
Minorities seen as subprime target More Videos
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A trio of high - profile CEOs defended their oversized pay packages to Congress on Friday , even as their companies and shareholders lost billions of dollars as a result of the ongoing mortgage crisis .
Countrywide Financial 's ( CFC , Fortune 500 ) founder and CEO Angelo Mozilo , former Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) Chairman and CEO Stanley O'Neal and ex-Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) chief Charles Prince testified before the House Committee on Government and Oversight Reform , calling reports of their pay " grossly exaggerated " in some instances and pointing out that they lost millions as well .
Their remarks found little sympathy however , as a number of lawmakers chastised the execs for helping to foster the current mortgage crisis at a time when homeowners are at risk of losing their homes and as the country teeters on the brink of recession .
" If you do n't bear personal responsibility , I do n't know who does , " said Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - Md .
All three executives made headlines in the past year for their lofty compensation after their companies lost billions in the U.S. housing market .
Between 2002 and the close of 2006 , the three executives were paid $ 460 million , according to a report issued by the Congressional committee just a day earlier .
Mozilo , who grew Countrywide from its modest beginnings into the nation 's largest mortgage lender , reportedly stood to collect a windfall of $ 115 million after his firm agreed to a yet - to - be completed sale to Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) .
After facing heavy criticism from lawmakers , Mozilo forfeited $ 37.5 million in payments tied to the deal .
In his testimony , Mozilo called reports of his pay package " grossly exaggerated . "
Upon his departure from Citigroup in November , Prince left with approximately $ 68 million , while O'Neal collected about $ 161 million after he stepped down in October .
Defending lofty pay packages
Both men contended that their compensation was in line with pay scales in the broader financial services industry and that reports about their pay packages were " inaccurate . "
Their compensation was tied directly to the performance of the company , via stock and options that the executives have held over time .
Prince , O'Neal and Mozilo argued that their pay was buoyed by impressive profits the companies delivered in the years leading up to the mortgage crisis .
They also said that they have lost millions since as their companies have seen the price of their stock plummet in recent months .
In all three instances , the terms of their pay packages were determined independently by members of their respective board of directors who commonly rely on handsome pay packages to attractive and retain top talent .
But also in focus were the cozy relationships between the directors responsible for determining pay and compensation consultants who get hired by directors to advise on executive pay , which was the centerpiece of an earlier hearing sponsored by the committee in December .
Lawmakers have argued that these consultants are merely getting paid to tell the board and CEO what it wants to hear .
One remedy proposed Thursday by Nell Minow , editor and co-founder of the corporate governance research group The Corporate Library , was to give shareholders greater rights in determining members of the board or creating an indexing system where pay would adjust based on the company 's performance in relation to its peers .
Minow argued that hefty pay packages for CEOs are sensible , but only when they generate such returns for shareholders .
" We want CEOs to be paid hundreds of millions of dollars , " Minow told lawmakers .
" But there is no excuse for people getting so much for doing so little . "
Rep. Henry Waxman D - Calif. , who heads the committee and was one of the CEOs staunchest critics , offered similar sentiment during his opening remarks .
" The obvious question is how can a few execs do so well when their companies are doing so poorly ? " asked Waxman , D - Calif .
Pay in focus
Even though Prince , O'Neal and Mozilo garnered plenty of attention on Capitol Hill Friday , they are not the first , nor will they be the last , top execs to enjoy handsome pay packages .
In December , Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein took home nearly $ 68 million in restricted stock , options and cash , making it the largest bonus ever given to a Wall Street CEO .
Chrysler Chairman and CEO Robert Nardelli made headlines when he was forced out of Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) in January of last year and left with $ 210 million in cash , stock options and retirement benefits .
Excessive compensation and hefty severance packages or " golden parachutes " have been burning issues in recent years .
Many companies have rewarded CEOs handsomely through multi-million dollar salaries , eye - popping bonuses or attractive perks like country club memberships .
Executive pay has drastically outpaced the pay gains experienced by the average American worker , according to an annual study published in August by The Institute for Policy Studies and United for a Fair Economy .
Between 1996 and 2006 , CEO pay rose 45 % , at a time when the average pay for an American worker grew just 7 % .
That same study revealed that CEOs at 386 of the Fortune 500 companies took home $ 10.8 million in total compensation in 2006 , more than 364 times what the average worker earned that same year .
Friday 's hearing marks the second time in nearly three months that legislators have attempted to tackle the issue of executive compensation .
Friday 's hearing was originally scheduled for Feb. 7 , but was postponed twice - once due to scheduling conflicts and again last week following the death of Mozilo 's mother .

While older versions may suffice , they have not been tested yet .
OpenOffice.org 2.1
Java 5.0
RServe 0.4.7
Installing
The current version is a prototype and implements only one tool : RDUMP .
This method is accessed through the actual Calc menu , and allows you to see the R object structure for various method calls .
To use the add - on , you need to install R and Rserve .
Instructions for installing R can be found at http://www.r-project.org/
Once installed , run R and type the following to install Rserve .
Click " enter " at the end of each bullet point :
install.packages ( " Rserve " )
Rserve needs to be running to work , and can be launched with the following commands ...
Note that you only need to do this when you want to use the R Add - on for Calc .
library ( Rserve )
Rserve ( )
Now that you have the prerequisites installed , download the package RAddon.uno.pkg ( linked above ) .
Unzip the file , and let 's call the directory you unzipped it in < RA_DIR >.
Now let < OO_HOME > be your OpenOffice.org installation directory .
Open the command prompt or terminal window and go to < OO_HOME >/ program / and type :
unopkg add < RA_DIR >/RAddon.uno.pkg
If this is not your first time installing the add - in , you need to check if a previous version is also on the system .
If it is , then you will not be able to install the new version .
To do this , go to < OO HOME >/ program and type :
unopkg list
This will show you the list of packages already installed , and you should be able to check if the add - is is there .
Remember to look for " RAddon.uno.pkg " .
You can also skip this step and try to uninstall RAddon .
uno.pkg regardless -- this will not harm your OpenOffice.org installation in any way , even if RAddon .
uno.pkg is abset .
To do this , type :
unopkg remove RAddon.uno.pkg
Finally , some operating systems require that you restart your OpenOffice.org installation ( if you 're not sure , restart your computer ) to be able to see the cell functions that come with this package .
Using
Using the add - on is very simple at this stage .
To see the tool at work , open Calc .
In the menus , go to R Add - on > Rdump ( ) .
A new dialog window will pop up .
Type in an R script -- here are some examples :
rnorm ( 10 )
cor.test( c( 1,2,3,4 ) , c( 1,2,2,3 ) )
Then click " Run " .
A new sheet should appear .
Close the dialog with " Close " and check the new sheet -- you should see various pieces of information on the sheet .
Testing
So far , the software has been tested on the following .
Version 0.1.7
64 - bit Gentoo Linux running JDK 1.5.0.12 ( 64 - bit version ) , OpenOffice 2.2.1 , and R 2.4.1

A hugely experienced pilot , a hi-tech search by hundreds of volunteers over 10,000 square miles that has turned up six plane wreckages ... and still no trace after four months .
Damon Syson reports on a missing millionaire - and how a conspiracy theory is born
We 're 8,000 ft above sea level in a single - engined plane half an hour out of Reno , Nevada .
The pilot turns and says casually , " You 'd better get strapped in .
It 's going to get damn - ass bumpy once we hit the mountains . "
It 's an unfortunate phrase , especially when you consider the mission .
Scroll down for more ...
The six - seater Cessna T210N is already moving around enough to make my stomach lurch .
But Tom Grossman , the amateur pilot taking me on an aerial tour of the Nevada wilderness , insists conditions are exceptionally calm today .
" In the summer , " he says with morbid relish , " a downdraught will slam - dunk you at 2,000 ft a minute .
" Flying near the ground is a dangerous game in these parts . "
Quite .
This is where multimillionaire adventurer Steve Fossett went missing on September 3 last year .
His disappearance led to one of the largest manhunts in US history using the most up - to - date search - and - rescue technology .
Yet no trace of the 63 - year - old has ever been found .
After three months of fading hope , Fossett 's wife Peggy , asked the courts to declare him legally dead .
Like most people in the UK , my immediate reaction was one of incredulity .
Central Nevada is one of the most remote wildernesses in America , but if satellite wizardry means we can photograph a beer can from space , surely we can locate a plane crash ?
Actually , the further we get from the suburban sprawl of Reno , the more I understand the problem the rescue teams faced .
The area they were searching is bigger than Wales .
They did find , however , six previously unaccounted for aircraft , including a wreck dating back to 1965 .
Apart from the bizarre sight of a distant geo - thermal power plant emitting a plume of steam from the side of a mountain , there is no sign of habitation as far as the eye can see .
Just desolate mountains creased with canyons and crevasses .
Our ground speed is 200 mph , and it 's been almost half an hour since we last saw a road .
" If you keep flying in this direction you 'll eventually hit Las Vegas , " says Tom .
" But there 's not much in between ; just sage brush , scorpions , rattlesnakes and coyotes .
The real Wild West . "
There 's no doubting the savagery of the landscape , but if Fossett was to die , everyone assumed it would be in a blaze of glory , not doing something so banal as taking a plane for a spin on a clear day .
It 's the equivalent of Sir Ranulph Fiennes passing out from exhaustion on his way to Tesco .
Fossett , who accompanied Sir Richard Branson on numerous jaunts , ran across Death Valley and swam the English Channel ( in a record - breakingly slow time , 22hrs 15 mins – which merely attests to his dogged endurance ) .
He broke more than 100 records in aviation , sailing and ballooning , and was constantly seeking new challenges .
While studying for an economics degree at Stanford , his friends persuaded him to swim the 1.5 miles to Alcatraz island off San Francisco .
After college , he set about climbing the highest peaks on each continent .
At work , he made a multimillion - dollar fortune as a commodities trader , earning enough to retire in 1990 , when he focused on setting records full - time .
The land - speed record was to be the jewel in his crown .
Borrowing
Tom 's state - of - the - art binoculars , I scan the ground for any sign of glinting metal .
Even though they 're £ 2,500 gyro- stabilised Canons , it 's exhausting work .
After a few miles of seeing nothing but 20ft conifers , my eyes begin to swim .
Tom throws the plane into a steep banking turn and we circle above a ranch owned by hotel magnate Barron Hilton .
It 's made up of a central building , a scattering of guest houses , a small lake , a tennis court and a mile - long runway .
It was from here that Steve Fossett took off that fateful morning , flying one of Hilton 's planes , a blue - and - white Bellanca Citabria Super Decathlon – a super - light , single - engined aerobatic plane used for practising rolls and spins .
Tom then points the Cessna towards the Wassuk Range , a jagged row of mountain peaks , the highest of which , Mount Grant , rises to 11,000ft .
As promised , things start to get bumpy .
This area has a reputation for some of the continent 's worst turbulence – even commercial flights are prone to doing a bucking - bronco act when passing through .
At this year 's Reno Air Show there were three fatal crashes in four days .
Passing over the peak , we 're suddenly greeted with an awesome sight – Walker Lake , a wide , blank expanse of deep blue .
There are no buildings along its shore and no boats on the surface .
Some believe that Fossett 's body lies here .
The engine whines and my stomach jumps .
" Whoa – sorry , " says Tom .
" We just hit a downdraught . "
Off to our right is Hawthorne , Nevada , a US Army depot plonked down in a windswept valley ringed by Tolkien - esque mountains .
Beside the lake there 's a square mile of military storage bunkers – weird man-made mounds connected by railway tracks , which Tom tells me contain " decommissioned bombs , old munitions and who knows what " .
In fact , Hawthorne is America 's biggest ammunition storage depot .
To the northeast of Walker Lake is one of the most extensive clusters of Military Operations Areas ( MOAs ) in the US .
Bearing this in mind , it 's hardly a surprise that conspiracy theories abound among local people .
Perhaps Fossett strayed in and was shot down , or even had a heart attack , lost control and careered into the MOA unwittingly .
Aeronautical charts clearly mark the MOAs , alongside printed warnings that incoming aircraft face the danger of interception , while the Nevada Bureau of Land Management warns of " unusual , often invisible hazards to aircraft such as artillery firing , aerial gunnery , missiles or ground target attacks .
Penetration of restricted areas , " it continues , " may be extremely hazardous for non-authorised aircraft and is legally prohibited . "
Since Fossett disappeared , the bars of Reno have been abuzz : " he must have seen
something he was n't meant to " ; " he 's in Panama – like that English canoe dude " ; " he 's been abducted by aliens " ( this is , after all , not far north of Area 51 , one of the most secretive places in the world and the subject of UFO speculation ) .
Aviation internet forums are also humming : " Maybe he flew into a place in Nevada where he should n't have ? " says one .
Another suggests he strayed into " a secretive military controlled area that 's off limits to civilians or to all but a tiny number of military " .
No one knows of course , but Fossett was healthy and an experienced and sensible flier , and the thorough search of the area – at least that permitted to be searched – found nothing .
The theories will continue .
One thing everyone agrees on , however , is that if Fossett had survived the crash he would have found some way to signal – he would have known how to make a fire with petrol from the plane , using the battery to make a spark .
I ask if we need permission to land at Hawthorne .
" Not really , " Tom says .
" There are airstrips like this all over the country – you can hop from one to the other .
I 'll see if there 's anyone manning the radio .
" Good morning , Hawthorne , how are things looking down there ? "
After a pause , a female voice crackles back through our Bose headsets : " Hi there .
I 'm just out in the back yard feeding my dogs but y'all are
welcome to land . "
Tom eases the Cessna down onto the dusty airstrip , brings it to a standstill and we climb out .
The icy wind hits us immediately .
It 's a beautiful clear day but the temperature up here at 4,375 ft is about minus five .
In the summer , however , it can get so hot in the high desert that it 's almost uninhabitable .
It 's eerily beautiful ; and , of course , deadly .
On an unassuming doorway in a light - industrial park in Sparks , Nevada , a sign reads Marathon Racing .
You 'd never guess it , but behind a small office is a cavernous 60ft garage containing a piece of history in the making – the Fossett LSR ( land - speed racer ) .
It 's a sleek and delicate - looking machine , like Concorde without the wings .
The plan of those working here is to use it to push past the 800 mph barrier and keep going .
" I first met Steve Fossett on the Bonneville Salt Flats in the autumn of 2006 , " says my guide Louise Ann Noeth , author of land - speed racing 's bible , Bonneville Salt Flats , and part of the Fossett team .
" He climbed into a streamliner [ the common name for long , slim , land - speed racing vehicles ] for the first time and I 'll be damned if he did n't get up to 300 mph in two or three runs .
" I was seriously impressed – this guy looked like an accountant , but he managed in two runs what it takes some people years to achieve .
It was exquisite driving . "
Fossett 's experience that day convinced him that he had what it took to go for the record – to drive a jet - powered vehicle across a dry lake bed , eating up a mile every four seconds .
Designing and building a car from scratch is a Herculean task , not to mention prohibitively expensive , but as luck would have it there was one already half there in the shape of Craig Breedlove 's mothballed Spirit Of America .
Breedlove , the land - speed - racing pioneer and five - time record holder , had designed the vehicle with claims he could take it in excess of 800 mph .
But on his first time out , in October 1996 , it flipped onto its side and performed a dramatic 180 - degree turn at 675 mph .
A year later he tried again , reaching 676 mph and again sustaining major damage .
Meanwhile , a British team led by Richard Noble had arrived at Nevada 's Black Rock desert and in October 1997 RAF fighter pilot Andy Green drove the Rolls - Royce jet engine - powered Thrust SSC at 763 mph , becoming the first person to officially break the sound barrier and gaining the land - speed record , which he still holds today .
Breedlove 's car gathered dust in a Californian garage for nearly a decade .
Fossett heard that he was looking to sell and , after months of negotiations , he finally bought it from him and set about putting together a team of technicians , led by rocket scientist Eric Ahlstrom .
The tall and intense Ahlstrom has a touch of the mad scientist about him .
The son of a former senior executive and chief scientist at Boeing , he 's been steeped in aeronautics since he was a child .
Fossett was in daily contact with Ahlstrom via email and phone and visited the workshop every few weeks to see how things were progressing .
His last visit was in August , a fortnight before his final flight .
" There 's a perception of Steve being this rich guy who bought thrills , " says Ahlstrom .
" He was n't like that at all .
" He was the nicest guy – an extremely honest and open individual .
" But the second he stepped into the car or started planning something , there was an intensity about him that 's very rare , and very inspiring . "
On the morning of Tuesday September 4 , 2007 , Eric Ahlstrom received a call from one of Fossett 's aides telling him their boss was missing .
Fossett had taken off the previous morning at 08:45 on what was expected to be a two - hour pleasure flight , planning to return in time to leave for home in his own aircraft at midday .
He was not wearing the Breitling Emergency watch with a built - in transponder that he often wore .
Initially , it was suggested that Fossett was looking for potential sites on which to run the jet car .
" Absolutely not , " says Ahlstrom , shaking his head .
" We had already come up with our test plan – we knew where we were going .
" He did a lot of surveying for dry lake beds earlier in the year but always took very specific mapping equipment with him to mark it on his GPS .
" He did n't take any of that equipment with him that day .
He was just taking the Citabria for a spin . "
Some suggest he might have got into difficulties .
The Citabria is the aircraft equivalent of a dune buggy ; Fossett had never flown one before , but he was still regarded as one of the world 's most talented airmen .
" He was a great pilot because he had good judgment , " says Ahlstrom .
" At test - pilot school you 're given a nickname to describe you .
" His was “ Cucumber ” , as in “ cool as ” .
Nothing ever panicked Steve .
Under stress , he just focused . "
No one who knew Fossett believes he would have taken risks by flying too near the ground .
" He was well aware of the risks and had flown in this region many times , " says Ahlstrom .
" Fossett was a friend of Barron Hilton 's and had been visiting his ranch for nearly a decade .
If I defined him as a pilot , " adds Ahlstrom , " it would be this : extremely conservative . "
Ahlstrom and the team 's crew chief , Leigh Golden , joined the search , flying two sorties and then co-ordinating a public satellite image search from the Marathon Racing office .
They received more than 200 messages each day from concerned well - wishers who were scanning up - to - date Google Earth satellite images of Nevada for signs of Fossett 's plane .
The Air National Guard continued running sorties throughout the night using infrared detection equipment , while the Nevada Civil Air Patrol expanded their total search territory to more than 10,000 square miles .
Every bit of technology available was thrown at the effort , including High Altitude Mapping Missions ( HAMM ) photography .
Flying at approximately 20,000ft over the mountainous terrain , the HAMM aircraft photographed 800 square miles per hour , generating images with a pixel size of six inches ( far more detailed than standard satellite images ) , which the team then analysed .
Volunteers arrived from all over the region , joining a systematic grid search focused on a 600 - square - mile area south of the ranch .
The mountain ridge along Walker Lake that I flew over with Tom Grossman was scoured with a fine tooth comb by 20 aircraft , including helicopters and planes able to fly at less than 30ft above treetop level .
One of the search aircraft was fitted with hyperspectral imaging equipment , capable of recognising disturbed earth and impact sites not visible to the human eye .
And still nothing .
So is it possible they were looking in the wrong place ?
Eric Ahlstrom thinks not .
" This was not a fast aircraft .
" It had a top speed of 160 mph and at high altitude the performance falls off – so it was probably closer to 90mph .
" A ground witness report correlated with a radar track we had .
" That put him south of Hawthorne at about 10.20 am , and a second radar track put him over the pass south of the mountain range next to Walker Lake , coming back towards the ranch at just shy of 11am .
" He 's got to be heading back , right ?
" Or at the very least he 's not going far .
" People say , “ Oh , he had enough fuel to get another 100 miles , ” but you do n't fly that way .
" A conservative pilot is never going to land with less than a quarter of a tank . "
Even after a week with no clues , many believed Fossett would come walking out of the desert with yet another tale of superhuman endurance to tell .
" If anyone 's going to end up walking back up to the ranch and apologising for pranging the Hiltons ' plane , it 's likely to be Steve Fossett , " said Richard Branson .
The idea that Fossett committed suicide has been universally dismissed .
He was excited about the record attempt and , although this fact has never been made public before , Branson had also asked him to be one of the pilots on his inaugural Virgin Galactic space flight .
Locally , some believe he crashed into the 60ft deep Walker Lake .
Ahlstrom is sceptical : " A sheriff 's department boat with sonar and six professional divers was dispatched to check not only Walker Lake but a couple of other lakes in the area .
They came up empty . "
Eric Ahlstrom believes there are only two credible theories .
" The wreckage may have impacted on a slope and rolled into a hole between boulders .
" If there 's enough scrub , someone would have to be literally walking over the ground to find it .
" There are also a lot of exploratory mines out there .
If the wreckage somehow fell down a mineshaft …
It would be extraordinary , but not beyond the realm of possibility . "
The second theory is that Fossett suffered a medical emergency in mid-air , such as a heart attack .
" Perhaps very late into his flight , " says Ahlstrom , " after the last radar ping , something happened to incapacitate him .
" If the aircraft was in trim it could have gone off in a random direction to the exhaustion of its fuel .
" It could have gone 100 miles .
That 's 30,000 square miles of search area – 30,000 square miles of rough uninhabited terrain . "
But it 's all just speculation .
The only thing we know for certain is that Steve Fossett strolled out of Barron Hilton 's ranch one morning last September wearing shorts and a T - shirt , carrying nothing but a bottle of water – and vanished into thin air .
DULUTH , Minnesota – Jurors hearing the nation 's first illegal pirating civil litigation case brought to trial here Tuesday were confronted with more than just mulling whether to hold a single mother of two liable for copyright infringement .
They 're also being confronted with technical jargon that often bogged down the first day 's proceeding , despite U.S. District Court judge Michael Davis ' fast - paced temperament that kept the pace flowing .
Jurors ' understanding , or lack thereof , of the technology behind the alleged misdeed might make the difference in the case 's outcome .
Some of the 12 panelists told the judge during jury selection that they lacked basic computer knowledge .
Some said they had never been on the internet or do n't use it now .
None admitted to using a file - sharing network .
Five said they had a digital music player and two said they copied a compact disc .
Often , the trial would halt while a witness for the Recording Industry Association of America elaborated on a term used in describing how they nabbed " Tereastarr . "
That 's Thomas ' alleged username on Kazaa , the file - sharing network where she is accused of pirating at least 25 songs .
( Username , pirating , Kazaa and file - sharing network all had to be explained . )
What 's more , witnesses and attorneys also were forced to define playlist , P2P protocol , encryption , share folder , burning , ripping , internet protocol address , meta data , hex code and even pirate rip groups – which were described as clandestine organizations poised to upload music before it is even released .
Jurors were also schooled in the definition of the trace route , screen shot , binary folders and even computer forensics .
Some of the definitions were elementary at best .
Doug Jacobson , an Iowa State University computer forensic scientist , described his practice in the most basic term .
" Computer forensics is basically going through and analyzing all the information on the computer . "
David Edgar , Charter Communications ' internet security manager , described " client premise equipment " as being the " next device after the cable modem . "
He said Dynamic Hosting Configuration Protocol " allowed internet service providers ( which had to be explained ) to " auto - configure " IP addresses .
( The jury was left hanging on that one . )
But the icing on the cake goes to Jennifer Pariser , Sony BMG 's anti-piracy chief .
And this one had nothing to do with technology parlance .
She reviewed to the jury the energy and expenses placed toward finding musical talent and financially milking that talent via advertising , radio , t- shirts , posters and tours in a bid to sell CDs and digital downloads ..
" Often a band will tour , which is to say to perform in live venues , " Pariser said .
Testimony continues Wednesday .
The RIAA , the lobbying branch of the recording industry , has filed more than 20,000 lawsuits in the last four years targeting piracy .
No other case has gone to trial .
Usually , they settle .
In some instances the cases are dismissed for various reasons , including lack of evidence or the alleged pirate is deceased .
" You know , that puddle should have its own blog . "

A new developer quits after two weeks .
A three - year veteran leaves the company after receiving a 5 % raise at his annual review .
A project is delivered according to developer estimates but the project manager is fired .
An application is built to approved specifications but the client is unhappy .
What do all of these situations have in common ?
Expectations .
We all have expectations : water will come out of the shower in the morning , the car will start , the gas pedal will make the car accelerate , the office will still be there , etc …
When they are n’t met it can send your life into a tailspin .
It ’s shocking to push the gas pedal and get no response from the car ; have you ever experienced this feeling ?
It feels like reality disconnects for a moment because something you hold as fact becomes false .
This has always worked , why does n’t it work now ?
Daily life involves thousands of expectations ; so much so that we get used to having them constantly met .
This is one reason that building software is so difficult .
Case In Point
I developed a web - based a content management system ( CMS ) back in 2001 .
I talked in great detail with the client about things the application would and would not do .
I wrote a spec , submitted it for approval ( I do n’t think he ever read it ) , and built the CMS .
My boss and co-worker thought it was solid .
I showed it to some developer friends of mine and they were thoroughly impressed with the navigation , the usability , and the HTML editing capabilities ; this was before things like FreeTextBox , and it took some major JavaScript work to get a usable HTML editor from an HTML text area .
When the client saw it he absolutely lost it .
This is one of the few times when I actually had to hold the phone away from my ear because he was yelling so loud , like in a cartoon .
He kept saying it was too complicated .
In fact , at one point I told him to click on a directory to display the pages contained inside , and he asked “ What ’s a directory ? ”
How do you answer a question like that knowing that he needs to understand concepts 10 times more complicated in order to work the application ?
The problem boiled down to this : he expected it to be like Microsoft Word .
He was non-technical and had never used custom web - based software , so his only reference was the Microsoft Office suite .
I had a hard time convincing him that custom software is more like a car built by hand than one that rolls off an assembly line – it ’s expensive , it ’s going to do exactly what you want , but it ’s not going to have all the bells and whistles you ’re used to ( in this case things like real - time spell checking , right - click support , and a few others ) .
His expectations were too high for this type of application , and the bottom line is that I had n’t done a good job of correcting them in advance .
The happy ending is that after the initial learning curve he had a lot of positive things to say about the CMS , and the project was considered a success ( it ’s still in use today , as far as I know ) .
After this experience I came up with some rules about setting expectations :
Rule # 1 : Put them in writing
Memories fade with time and verbal agreements are worth the paper they ’re printed on .
Having something in writing makes it easy to refer back to a year down the line , whether it ’s a software specification or an evaluation of an employee ’s performance .
Although having my specification in writing did n’t ease the initial launch anxiety it allowed us to prove that we had built the applications to an approved design , and ensured that we were paid for our work .
It ’s been said before , but I ’ll say it again : write it down , even if it ’s a quick email to confirm something said in a meeting .
If you get in the habit of following up phone calls and meetings with “ Per our phone conversation … ” emails you will be much more successful in the long run .
Rule # 2 : Insist on feedback
You will often find yourself doing all the talking .
Whether this means you ’re the only one sending emails or creating specs , or the only one speaking during a one on one meeting , open the door for the other person ’s opinion by asking for it .
Someone can listen for hours but never really hear what you ’re trying to communicate .
The application ’s initial failure had a lot to do with the fact that the client never read the spec .
When you submit a spec , include a note that says “ Please include feedback with your signature . ” and mention this verbally , as well .
If you receive the spec without feedback ask some specific questions about a piece of the application such as “ What do you think about how we ’re going to handle the directory structuring ? ” and see what kind of response you receive .
It ’s not about tricking the client , it ’s about being aware and being prepared for their expectations .
Insist , demand , or beg for it … but one way or another get some feedback .
Rule # 3 : Meet face to face
55 % of communication is non-verbal , which means more than half of communication is tone and body language .
Emails and conference calls are great tools , but nothing beats looking someone in the eye .
Not only will you have an easier time getting your message across , but people will tend to remember it longer .
In retrospect , I got this one half right .
I did schedule at least one meeting with the project owner to explain the application in plain English , but he was so busy hat I had about five minutes to explain the application to him and that ’s not enough time to go into the necessary detail to shape expectations .
Since then I ’ve made it a point to put an emphasis on describing an application ’s limitations – what it wo n’t do .
People often spend too much time selling the application during these meetings by saying how great it ’s going to be , but by this point you already have the contract so step into reality and be forthright about its capabilities .
On launch day you ’ll be glad you did .
If you ’re ultimately responsible for the success of the application be sure you meet early on with those who will determine the success of the application .
Rule # 4 : Do n’t build in a vacuum
This one is specific to software development , but do n’t write a specification and then go away for four months to build it .
Call it a cyclical development process , agile , xp , or whatever , but plan to release a piece of the app once a month so users can see how the application looks and get some experience playing around with it .
Even if you ’re using the waterfall model where you spec an application up front and then build , give them something they can experience .
Most users do n’t have much contact with custom software so making this extra effort is a huge step towards easing launch - day anxiety .
Back to the Intro
So how do expectations tie into the four scenarios from the introduction ?
The new developer quit after two weeks because he expected the company was building state of the art products , as he was told during his interview .
After realizing he would be building basic CRUD ( create , read , update , delete ) web forms for years to come he opted to move on .
The three - year veteran who left the company after receiving a 5 % raise had worked hundreds of hours of overtime during the past year , and was the main reason several of the most profitable project succeeded .
He expected a nice bonus or a healthy raise , something more than the standard 5 % .
The project manager who was fired for delivering the project according to developer estimates was n’t able to communicate these estimates to executive management .
Instead , someone else was in charge of setting the expectations and from day one the project was due before it could possibly be delivered .
And the fourth example was the subject of this article .
Setting expectations can be a difficult and time consuming process , but it ’s one area that you want to be part of .
This article is a reminder that you can nail the technical aspect of an application , but missing the human side can just as easily lead to failure .
Mussolini on the Corporate State by Chip Berlet A Google ( tm ) search on January 12 , 2005 turned up some 5,000 hits on the following quote : " Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power . " -- Benito Mussolini
It is generally attrributed to an article written by Mussolini in the 1932 Enciclopedia Italiana with the assistance of Giovanni Gentile , the editor .
The quote , however , does not appear in the Enciclopedia Italiana in the original Italian .
It does not appear in the official English translation of that article : Benito Mussolini , 1935 , " The Doctrine of Fascism , " Firenze : Vallecchi Editore .
And it does not appear in the longer treatment of the subject by Mussolini in : Benito Mussolini , 1935 , " Fascism : Doctrine and Institutions , " Rome : ' Ardita ' Publishers .
Where the quote comes from remains a mystery , and while it is possible Mussolini said it someplace at some time , a number of researchers have been unable to find it after months of research .
( If you have a source for the quote based on an actual original document that you copy and mail us , please let us know , and you will receive a free 3 - year subscription to the Public Eye magazine )
It is unlikely that Mussolini ever made this statement because it contradicts most of the other writing he did on the subject of corporatism and corporations .
When Mussolini wrote about corporatism , he was not writing about modern commercial corporations .
He was writing about a form of vertical syndicalist corporatism based on early guilds .
The article on Wikipedia on Corporatism explains this rather well .
Here are some typical Mussolini quotes from original documents :
The Fascist conception of the State is all - embracing ; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist , much less have value .
Thus understood , Fascism is totalitarian , and the Fascist State - - a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values -- interprets , develops , and potentiates the whole life of a people .
( p. 14 ) Fascism recognises the real needs which gave rise to socialism and trade - unionism , giving them due weight in the guild or corporative system in which diverent interests are coordinated and harmonised in the unity of the State . ( p.15 ) Yet if anyone cares to read over the now crumbling minutes giving an account of the meetings at which the Italian Fasci di Combattimento were founded , he will find not a doctrine but a series of pointers … ( p. 23 ) " It may be objected that this program implies a return to the guilds ( corporazioni ) .
No matter !...
I therefore hope this assembly will accept the economic claims advanced by national syndicalism . " ( p. 24 ) Fascism is definitely and absolutely opposed to the doctrines of liberalism , both in the political and economic sphere .
( p. 32 ) The Fascist State lays claim to rule in the economic field no less than in others ; it makes its action felt throughout the length and breadth of the country by means of its corporate , social , and educational institutions , and all the political , economic , and spiritual forces of the nation , organised in their respective associations , circulate within the State . ( p. 41 ) .

The corporate State considers that private enterprise in the sphere of production is the most effective and usefu [ sic ] [ typo - should be : useful ] instrument in the interest of the nation .
In view of the fact that private organisation of production is a function of national concern , the organiser of the enterprise is responsible to the State for the direction given to production .
State intervention in economic production arises only when private initiative is lacking or insufficient , or when the political interests of the State are involved .
This intervention may take the form of control , assistance or direct management .

Superconductivity
Over 180 K in a
Pb -doped Sn - In - Tm Intergrowth
Superconductors .ORG
herein reports the first observation of superconductivity over 180 Kelvin .
If confirmed , this discovery will advance the world record for high - Tc to 181K .
In October of 2007 , superconductivity near 175K was detected at ambient pressure in an Sn - In - Tm intergrowth .
By doping roughly 28 % of the Sn atomic sites of that molecule with Pb , Tc is increased further to 181K ( 183 K magnetic ) .
The revised chemical formula thus becomes ( Sn 1.0 Pb 0.4 In 0.6 ) Ba 4 Tm 5 Cu 7 O 20 + with a 1245/1212 ( non-stoichiometric ) structure .
As with the 175 K discovery , it was necessary to employ a 1223/1212 host to derive trace amounts of the desired 1245 / 1212 phase ( shown at left ) .
An extra 6 % of one atom of Cu and 6 % of one atom of Tm were added to the 1223/1212 stoichiometric mix .
( The exact mole ratio is at page bottom . )
The composite graph at page top shows the sum of three separate resistance - vs - temperature ( R - T ) plots that were combined in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .
Since the volume fraction of the 181 K phase was less than 1 % of the bulk , spotting the superconductivity signature proved difficult .
By combining three separate tests , the S/N ratio improves by approximately 4 db .
In the test apparatus a regulated 7 volts was applied across the primary of a 4 - point probe .
The resistive transition at Tc was then measured at around 7 millivolts across the secondary .
Pb -doping has previously proven beneficial in other high - Tc copper oxides .
Bi-2223 , Hg - 1223 and Tl - 1223 all responded with an increase in Tc when the insulating layers were doped with Pb. Since Sn and Pb have the same oxidation states ( +2 , +4 ) , Pb substitution was a logical choice for the 175K Sn - copper - oxide , as its use will not alter the hole state of the insulating layers .
Below is a composite plot of three magnetization tests .
The magnetometer uses twin Honeywell SS94A1F
Hall - effect sensors with a tandem sensitivity of 50 mv / gauss .
An unambiguous diamagnetic component appears between 183K and 184K .
Synthesis of the 1223/1212 host was by the solid state reaction method .
Stoichiometric amounts of the below precursors were mixed , pelletized at 70,000 psi and sintered for 36 hours at 830C .
The pellet was then annealed for 10 hours at 500C in flowing O2 .

Last summer Emad Wassef walked out of a Target store in Orange County , California , to find a big space where his 2003 Lincoln Navigator had been .
The 38 - year - old truck driver and former reserve Los Angeles police officer did what anyone would do :
He reported the theft to the cops and called his insurance company .
Two weeks later , the black SUV turned up near the Mexico border , minus its stereo , airbags , DVD player , and door panels .
Wassef assumed he had a straightforward claim for around $ 25,000 .
His insurer , Chicago - based Unitrin Direct , disagreed .
Wassef ’s Navigator , like half of all late - model domestic cars on the road today , is equipped with a transponder antitheft system :
The ignition key is embedded with a tiny computer chip that sends a unique radio signal to the vehicle ’s onboard computer .
Without the signal , the car wo n’t start .
And Wassef still had both of his keys .
The insurance company sent a forensic examiner to check out the disemboweled SUV in an impound lot .
The ignition lock , mounted on the steering column , had been forcibly rotated , probably with a screwdriver .
The locking lug on the steering wheel , which keeps it from being turned when the truck is not in gear , had also been damaged .
But the transponder system was intact .
The car could have been shifted and steered , the investigator concluded , but the engine could n’t have been turned on .
“ Since you reportedly can account for all the vehicle keys , the forensic information suggests that the loss did not occur as reported , ” the company wrote to Wassef , denying his claim .
The barely hidden subtext : Wassef was lying .
“ I got shafted , basically , ” Wassef says .
He ’s not the only one .
US carmakers and auto - mobile insurers are unshakably certain that vehicles protected by “ transponder immobil - izers ” ca n’t be driven without the proper keys – or , at least , that circumventing those transponder systems takes more sweat and money than most auto thieves are willing to expend .
So car companies advertise their security systems as unbreakable , insurers and consumers believe these assertions , and then folks like Wassef find themselves engaged in all - out war when their cars vanish .
The insurance companies have good reason to be suspicious .
They lose $ 14 billion to auto fraud every year in the US ; by some measures , 20 percent of all stolen - car reports are trumped up .
But when it comes to transponders , their faith is misplaced .
Auto antitheft systems are usually secure for only a few years , until thieves crack the system .
“ The carmakers are calling these passive antitheft systems , but they ’re not , ” says Rob Painter , a Milwaukee - based forensic locksmith who has testified in dozens of auto insurance court cases , for both sides .
“ They are just theft deterrents .
Tell me a car ca n’t be stolen and I ’ll show you how to do it . ”
Two years ago , my white 2003 Honda Civic – which my wife and I had affectionately named Honky – disappeared from the street in front of our San Francisco home .
It has a transponder , and all three of our keys were accounted for ( including the spare valet key ) .
Police were polite but not much help ; they speculated that thieves had towed the car away or hoisted it onto a flatbed truck and broken it down for parts .
But Honky materialized two weeks later on a side street near the ocean .
It was out of gas and littered with cigarette butts and pirated Pantera CDs , but otherwise undamaged .
The ignition cylinder was intact , and our keys still worked .
The car was a living , gas - sipping rebuke of modern antitheft technology .
Mystified , I wrote up my experience for Newsweek ’s Web site in early 2004 .
I figured that would be the end of the story , but I got hundreds of emails from people with similar tales .
I ’m still getting them – type “ stolen car ” into Google and my article is in the top 20 .
The most stirring notes were from those who got spurned by their insurance companies .
John Hutton , an architect from Fairfax , Virginia , lost his Acura RSX last fall and was reimbursed only after six months of aggressive wrangling with Geico .
“ The inspector treated me like I was a liar and a criminal , ” Hutton says .
“ It all kept going back to the transponder system and their belief that ‘ You ca n’t steal it !
You ca n’t steal it ! ’ ”
Sally Nguyen ’s Acura TL went AWOL last New Year ’s Eve and was later found gutted and submerged in the Sacramento River .
When an investigator from her insurance company , Esurance , dropped by her house , he left a business card on which he ’d scrawled , “ Regarding your ‘ stolen ’ Acura . ”
Six months later , Esurance denied the claim , citing her car ’s security system .
Esurance would n’t talk to me about her case .
Mohammad Awan lost his 2002 Ford Explorer last year ; his son wrote to tell me that his insurer , Progressive , felt the existence of a transponder system – plus other “ red flags , ” like Awan ’s outstanding debt – amounted to enough evidence to deny the claim .
“ Your vehicle is equipped with an immobilizing trans - ponder system which will not allow it to start without the use of a proper transponder key , ” read the denial - of - claim letter .
Perhaps no story was worse than Wassef ’s as he tried to deal with his stripped Navigator .
Unitrin subjected him to a day - long deposition process called an “ examination under oath . ”
Investigators asked about his collapsing marriage and demanded financial documents and telephone records .
Wassef complied , believing he had nothing to hide .
By June , with no reimbursement in sight , he filed a breach of contract suit .
Meanwhile , he ’s still paying $ 825.39 a month for an undrivable car .
Unitrin did not return multiple calls regarding Wassef ’s case .
Compared to Wassef , I got off easy – a couple hundred dollars for a detail job to eliminate the cigarette smell .
But I found myself wrestling with a high tech quandary :
What really happened to Honky ?
In other words , how do you steal the unstealable car ?
The 1986 Corvette had the first electronic antitheft system , the Pass Key I. General Motors embedded a small pellet in the base of each key blade ; when the key was inserted in the ignition slot , the car ’s computer detected the electrical resistance of the pellet .
There were just 15 assigned values , but Pass Key still revolutionized automobile security .
For the first time , a crucial piece of a vehicle ’s antitheft system existed outside the car .
The high lasted only a few years .
People started complaining about not being able to replace lost keys easily , so GM opened a back door .
Dealers and locksmiths got permission to stock key blanks , and by the early ’90s police were arresting car thieves who had rings of all 15 GM keys .
Of course , no security system is impreg -nable .
Even the toughest wall safe is rated in terms of how long it would take a sufficiently motivated crook to bust it open with tools or a torch .
As thieves gain experience , they can crack the safe faster and faster .
Every security system goes through the same natural history .
When new , it ’s nearly unbeatable .
But then users ask for more convenience and the keepers of the system relax the rules , or smart attackers study the system long enough to breach it .
The system begins to fail , creating an evolutionary pressure that ultimately results in the development of a new model – and the cycle starts all over again .
That ’s what happened a decade ago , when the rise of eastern European black markets sent auto theft rates skyrocketing in Europe .
German insurance companies asked for new security precautions , and in 1995 BMW debuted a sophisticated antitheft system based on radio frequency identification chips .
US and Japanese manufacturers quickly embraced the technology in their high - end models .
Most of these new transponder - immobilizing systems – including the one in my Civic – use a “ fixed ” code .
Insert the key into the ignition and a transceiver in the steering column pings a microchip in the key ’s thick black plastic handle .
The chip radios back an alphanumeric identifier of up to 32 characters , one of billions of possible combinations .
The signal is only strong enough to travel about 7 inches , but when the car ’s computer gets the right code , it activates the other onboard electronics .
More expensive cars , like some Mercedes and Lexus models , use sophisticated “ rolling ” codes , generated anew after each start , passed to the key , and fed back for authorization during the next ignition cycle .
Like the Pass Key , the new RFID technology was extremely effective for a few years .
Thefts of the 1997 Ford Mustang , one of the first US cars with a transponder , dropped 70 percent from 1995 levels .
( The rest were attributed to tow - aways and stolen keys . )
Insurance firms were elated .
“ There was - pretty much a God - given belief that if a car with a transponder was stolen , the owner was sunk , ” says Larry Burzynski , a senior special agent with the National Insurance Crime Bureau .
“ The perception was that the theft had to be owner involvement . ”
Insurers pressed auto - makers to deploy the technology , and even now the most frequently stolen cars in the US were built before the transponder era – like the ’95 Civic and the ’ 89 Camry .
Newer models make the list only when manu - facturers forgo transponders .
TO car thieves , smart keys became little more than the latest challenge .
By 2000 , forensic locksmiths like Painter were demonstrating for juries how crooks were getting past the transponders in Fords :
Pop the hood and pull a certain fuse from the power relay center in the upper left corner .
Zap , you ’re in .
Meanwhile , transponder - equipped cars were being resold to new owners , and keys were disappearing behind couch cushions .
Auto - repair supply and locksmithing companies started selling devices like the Code - Seeker and the T - Code , which allow anyone to create a new set of keys for a fixed - code transponder - equipped car .
The Jet Smart Clone ( catchphrase : “ Clone the uncloneable ! ” ) duplicates any fixed - code RFID chip by reading its code and imprinting it onto the blank chip of a new key with the same mechanical cut .
In the fall of 2005 , Bay Area Mercedes dealerships were targeted by a regional theft ring with a clever , seemingly primitive tactic .
A thief posing as a customer would express interest in a top - of - the line model and go for a test - drive .
Afterward , when the salesperson went for the paperwork , the thief would replace the car ’s keyless starter transponder with an identical - looking mock - up from his own pocket .
Then he ’d leave and return later to nick the car .
That ’s what happened in mid-November at a Bay Area Mercedes lot in Pleasanton .
A $ 78,000 black S430 disappeared overnight ; police traced the car ’s GPS unit to the parking lot of a Fry ’s Electronics , but when they arrived at the store , they found not the missing Pleasanton car but another S430 stolen from a Monterey car lot earlier that year .
They also found its driver , a 25 - year - old San Jose man named Naheed Hamed .
He took off in the car , leading a freeway chase that reached 100 miles per hour and ended when he took an off - ramp too fast and rammed into a tree .
A few days later , police found the Pleasanton S430 near Hamed ’s home and towed it back to the dealership .
Inside the car , mechanics discovered a technological treasure trove : an original Mercedes electronic ignition system and custom Mercedes fuses , all wired with alligator clips to the dashboard and to the fuse box underneath the driver ’s seat .
The car also held a Pelican PDA carrying case and a wireless RFID - signal - sniffing antenna .
Investigators suspect that Hamed spliced in his own ignition system and power source , then used the PDA to upload pirated software to the car ’s computer to disable the transponder and swap the two cars ’ GPS tracking numbers .
Of course , he also believed he could beat the cops in a car chase .
“ Yeah , the guy ’s an idiot , ” says auto security expert Mike Bender , a consultant on the case .
“ But you have to be a brainiac to understand the stuff that this guy had . ”
That kind of technology is too expensive and too complicated for your basic chop - shop crew , but they usually do n’t need it anyway .
For the past few years , Bay Area cops have pursued a ring of thieves that break into Hondas and Acuras with “ jiggle ” keys – keys with the teeth shaved down so they can turn the tumblers inside any car ’s door lock .
After the thieves gain access , they shuffle through the glove compartment and snatch the manual , where dealers – unbeknownst to many car owners – often leave an extra valet key .
Ivan Blackman , the manager of the Vehicle Information and Identification Program for the NICB , says that insiders are gradually getting over their dogmatic belief in the invincibility of transponder systems .
“ Companies are slowly realizing that the cars can be stolen , ” Blackman says .
Maybe he ’s right – though things are n’t changing fast enough for Emad Wassef and Sally Nguyen .
I still did n’t know what happened to Honky .
Maybe someone at the dealership or a valet had cloned my key with a device like a Jet Smart Clone , then showed up later to take the car .
It was also conceivable that someone grabbed the vehicle identification number off the dash , went to the dealership , pretended to be me , and had an extra key produced .
Still , either scenario seemed like it would require an awful lot of footwork for a Pantera - and nicotine - fueled joyride .
Then I heard about another possibility .
Earl Hyser , the superintendant of State Farm Insurance ’s Vehicle Research Facility , told me that some transponder - equipped cars came with a secret “ cheat ” code designed to allow people who lose their keys to drive back to the shop .
I asked the SFPD about it and was referred to Ken Montes , famous in Bay Area street racing circles for a souped - up 1992 Honda Civic he built as part of a tuner team called the Benen Brothers .
The SFPD told me the team called the car Spanky , which instantly made me feel a certain kinship .
I went to see Montes at his custom motor - cycle shop about a half hour south of San Francisco and asked him how someone could have stolen my car .
He just laughed .
“ If I want to take your Civic , I ’ll do it in 10 seconds , ” he said .
Then he confirmed Hyser ’s story .
The mythical Honda override exists :
It ’s a series of presses and pulls of the emergency brake .
Each car , it seems , has a unique override code , which correlates to the VIN .
“ You want to get yours ? ” Montes asked .
Sure , I said .
He called an acquaintance who worked at a Honda dealership .
I listened , awestruck , as Montes fed the guy a barely credible story about a cousin who had dropped his keys down a sewer .
The dealership employee was at home but evidently could access the Honda database online .
I gave Honky ’s VIN to Montes , who passed it along to his friend .
We soon had the prescribed sequence of pulls , which I scribbled down in my notebook .
I walked outside and approached Honky .
The door lock would have been easy – a thief would have used a jiggle key , and a stranded motorist would have had a locksmith cut a fresh one .
I just wrapped the grip of my key in tinfoil to jam the transponder .
The key still fit , but it no longer started the car .
Then I grabbed the emergency brake handle between the front seats and performed the specific series of pumps , interspersed with rotations of the ignition between the On and Start positions .
After my second attempt , Honky ’s hybrid engine awoke with its customary whisper .
I had just jacked my own car .

Linday Lohan went to LA County jail on Thursday to serve time for her seven misdemeanor counts relating to two drunken driving charges .
Because of a plea agreement that she made in August , Lindsay was sentenced to serve one day in jail .
The 21 - year - old Lindsay checked in at the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood , California at 10:30 AM .
Just 84 minutes later , at 11:54 AM , she was released because the overcrowded LA jail system allows early release for non-violent offenders to make room for the hard core offenders -- like Paris Hilton , who had to spend 23 days in the slammer earlier this year .
According to People magazine , a prison spokesperson said , " Lindsay was fingerprinted , photographed , and put in a holding cell , but was let go due to our early release policy . "
Was Lindsay given special treatment ?
" Absolutely not , ” said spokesperson Steve Whitmore .
“ This is what we do for mostly everybody in this position .
In fact , 30 to 50 women are granted early releases from the facility every day . ”
For more complete information on Lindsay ’s charges see our sister site at McCafferty ’s Pub .
Now Lindsay can return to the more important things in life that she is so good at , like partying .

This A lot of American voters , says ABC's Martin Bashir , take a candidate 's faith into consideration when deciding who will get their vote .
On the heels of a speech given by former Massachusetts governor and current GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney about his Mormon faith , ABC's Nightline delves into the two biggest names being dropped by 2008 hopefuls : Jesus Christ and God. Much like President John F. Kennedy did , in countering attacks on his Catholic faith , and the sentiment that such faith would render him an operative of the Vatican , Romney delivered a speech Thursday to assure the public that his faith and his political life would remain separate ; his Mormon faith would not render him an operative of the LDS church as President .
Said Romney , at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station , Texas , " Let me assure you that no authorities of my church , or of any other church for that matter , will ever exert influence on presidential decisions .
Their authority is theirs , within the province of church affairs , and it ends where the affairs of the nation begin . "
" There 's only one explanation for it , and it's not a human one , " says Baptist minister and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee of his lead in the GOP Iowa primary polls .
" It 's the same power that helped a little boy with two fish and five loaves feed a crowd of five thousand people . "
When asked whether he thought the Mormon faith was Christianity , Huckabee said he did n't " know enough about Mormonism to know . "
Mitt Romney has come under fire , particularly from Evangelicals , for his Mormon faith .
Says First Baptist Church of Christ pastor Robert Jeffress , " Mitt Romney is not a Christian , he 's a Mormon , and mormonism is a cult . "
On November 9 , even the mother of opponent and Arizona Senator John McCain made light of Romney 's faith , connecting him with " the Mormons in Salt Lake City " and the scandal surrounding allegations of bribery to secure the Utah capitol 's hosting the 2002 Winter Olympics .
" The views of my mother are not necessarily views of mine , " assured McCain to MSNBC 's Chris Matthews .
All major Democratic and Republican candidates alike have professed their faith on the campaign trail , assuring that , if not just a foot in the door to the White House ; as Nightline puts it , God will be one 's " co-pilot . "
The following video is from ABC's Nightline , broadcast on December 5 , 2007 .
Mitt Romney 's entire speech is available at National Public Radio .
MEXICO CITY  Body - to - body contact is inescapable on Mexico City ’s crowded public transportation system .
Get on a train or a bus during rush hour and a man in a business suit may have his arm resting against your shoulder , a woman toting a bulky shopping bag may have her back pressed against your flank , and a teenager listening to an iPod may tap his sneaker all over your newly shined left shoe .
But many women complain that not all the contact is incidental .
Among the 22 million passengers who use the bus and subway system daily , women say , are lecherous men taking advantage of the cheek - to - jowl conditions to leer and grope and then quietly disappear .
“ There are good men in Mexico , but they ’re not the ones on public transport , ” said Mariana Vasquez , 30 , who waited to board a bus recently on her way to a job interview at a law firm .
“ They try to touch you .
They do n’t give you a seat .
Where are the gentlemen ? ”
One place they are not is on new women - only buses that Mexico City began running in January to reduce the harassment .
With pink placards and insistent drivers who growl at any man who tries to step aboard , the buses are quickly becoming a hit among women .
Multiple - drug - resistant tuberculosis cases in parts of the former Soviet Union have reached the highest rates ever recorded and could soar even higher , spreading the bacterial disease elsewhere , the World Health Organization said on Tuesday in releasing findings from the largest global survey of the problem .
The highest rate was in Baku , the capital of Azerbaijan , where 22.3 percent of new tuberculosis cases were resistant to the standard anti-tuberculosis drug regimen during the survey period from 2002 to 2006 .
That exceeded the previous high of 14.2 percent , in Kazakhstan .
Studies in China also suggest that multiple - drug - resistant TB is widespread in the inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang regions , W.H.O. said .
The new survey , the first in four years , shows that earlier predictions were correct and that governments have lost control of tuberculosis in many areas .
The reason , health officials say , is that countries have failed to invest enough to build , equip and staff the laboratories needed to detect the disease .
The countries also failed to assure sufficient amounts of standard drugs and then to monitor patients to ensure that they complete a full course of therapy .
Scott Belcher , Ph.D , of the University of Cincinnati , tested these polycarbonate bottles for Bisphenol A. Credit : UC Academic Health Center Communication Services
When it comes to Bisphenol A ( BPA ) exposure from polycarbonate plastic bottles , it ’s not whether the container is new or old but the liquid ’s temperature that has the most impact on how much BPA is released , according to University of Cincinnati ( UC ) scientists .
Scott Belcher , PhD , and his team found when the same new and used polycarbonate drinking bottles were exposed to boiling hot water , BPA , an environmental estrogen , was released 55 times more rapidly than before exposure to hot water .
“ Previous studies have shown that if you repeatedly scrub , dish - wash and boil polycarbonate baby bottles , they release BPA .
That tells us that BPA can migrate from various polycarbonate plastics , ” explains Belcher , UC associate professor of pharmacology and cell biophysics and corresponding study author .
“ But we wanted to know if ‘ normal ’ use caused increased release from something that we all use , and to identify what was the most important factor that impacts release . ”
“ Inspired by questions from the climbing community , we went directly to tests based on how consumers use these plastic water bottles and showed that the only big difference in exposure levels revolved around liquid temperature : Bottles used for up to nine years released the same amount of BPA as new bottles . ”
The UC team reports its findings in the Jan. 30 , 2008 issue of the journal Toxicology Letters .
BPA is one of many man-made chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors , which alter the function of the endocrine system by mimicking the role of the body ’s natural hormones .
Hormones are secreted through endocrine glands and serve different functions throughout the body .
The chemical — which is widely used in products such as reusable water bottles , food can linings , water pipes and dental sealants — has been shown to affect reproduction and brain development in animal studies .
“ There is a large body of scientific evidence demonstrating the harmful effects of very small amounts of BPA in laboratory and animal studies , but little clinical evidence related to humans , ” explains Belcher .
“ There is a very strong suspicion in the scientific community , however , that this chemical has harmful effects on humans . ”
Belcher ’s team analyzed used polycarbonate water bottles from a local climbing gym and purchased new bottles of the same brand from an outdoor retail supplier .
All bottles were subjected to seven days of testing designed to simulate normal usage during backpacking , mountaineering and other outdoor adventure activities .
The UC researchers found that the amount of BPA released from new and used polycarbonate drinking bottles was the same — both in quantity and speed of release — into cool or temperate water .
However , drastically higher levels of BPA were released once the bottles were briefly exposed to boiling water .
“ Compared to the rate of release from the same bottle , the speed of release was 15 to 55 times faster , ” explains Belcher .
Prior to boiling water exposure , the rate of release from individual bottles ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 nanograms per hour .
After exposure , rates increased to 8 to 32 nanograms per hour .
Belcher stresses that it is still unclear what level of BPA is harmful to humans .
He urges consumers to think about how cumulative environmental exposures might harm their health .
“ BPA is just one of many estrogen - like chemicals people are exposed to , and scientists are still trying to figure out how these endocrine disruptors — including natural phyto - estrogens from soy which are often considered healthy — collectively impact human health , ” he says .
“ But a growing body of scientific evidence suggests it might be at the cost of your health . ”

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama raised $ 55 million in February , a record for any presidential campaign in a single month , a campaign official said on Thursday .
The amount is well above the $ 36 million the Illinois senator raked in during January and is also much higher than the $ 35 million raised by his rival Hillary Clinton during February , even though that month marked a record for her fundraising .
Obama and Clinton , locked in an intense battle to become the Democratic nominee to run against Republican Sen .
John McCain , have stepped up their competition with one another for funds for their campaign coffers .
Both the Clinton and Obama camps have been pointing to the amounts of money their are hauling in as evidence their campaigns have enthusiastic backers .
But the growing campaign tallies also underscore the extent to which the candidates are scrambling to gain advantage over one another in the hard - fought race .
While Clinton was not able to keep up with Obama ’s total in February , she stepped up her fundraising that month after bringing in $ 14 million in January and making a personal loan to her campaign of $ 5 million .
Clinton , who has been lagging Obama in the race for delegates , racked up wins on Tuesday in Texas , Ohio and Rhode Island that broke a winning streak by Obama and marked a comeback for her .
About
DarkPlaces is a Quake modification I have built over the course of 6 years on and off experimenting , it got somewhat of an overhaul when the Quake engine source code was released , and I began developing a custom OpenGL - only engine for it and other mods , which supports Windows WGL and Linux GLX , and has greatly improved graphics and image quality .
It can not easily be described , as it is simply an improved Quake , not a total conversion ( yet , anyway ) .
The realism of shell casings falling to the floor , much improved bullet impacts , 32 bit color alpha blended explosions , blood flying everywhere and sticking to the walls ...
Behind the scenes the code has changed a great deal , I was not content with the original QuakeC code , and I have greatly changed the engine while maintaining compatibility with normal quake modifications .

Changed collision code to prevent getting stuck in many q3bsp maps and some q1bsp maps ( the new collision_extendmovelength cvar affects this , as well as collision_enternudge / leavenudge ) .
Fixed occasional black screens caused by r_useportalculling ( a portal closer than the nearclip plane was being culled in some cases , portal bounds are now expanded according to r_nearclip ) .
Fixed a bug in vid_soft when using a custom compiled SDL2 client ( the regular SDL client is SDL1 based ) where the decals would show garbage due to alpha compositing , alpha compositing is no longer used ( thanks to divVerent for fixing this ) .
2014-04-30 :
New darkplaces update :
FXAA added : r_fxaa 1 in console to activate it ( thanks graphitemaster )
r_glsl_postprocess will no longer force a blur effect unless the corresponding uservecs are in use ( thanks divVerent ) .
Updated ip address for master server dpmaster .deathmask.net and added ip6 address for it as well ( someday we 'll use threaded dns lookup instead ) .
Increased effectinfo.txt limits as requested by JKoestler who managed to have * that * many effects defined .
Allow .rtlights files to use style - 1 for compatibility with fteqw - produced rtlights files .
New vid_desktopfullscreen cvar will use your desktop resolution instead of changing video mode , this is better behaved on all platforms but especially Linux .
gl_vbo_dynamicvertex and gl_vbo_dynamicindex have been optimized ( but seem to still be slower on desktop GL than using conventional vertex arrays ) .
Fixed some issues with the unmaintained D3D9 renderer pertaining to vid_sRGB and vid_stereobuffer .
Fixed a bug with EF_FLAME and EF_STARDUST effects still emitting particles when paused .
Changed behavior when stuck in brush models such that you can will not be stuck in an entity such as a door or platform , only stuck if in solid world geometry ( an intentional quake behavior ) .
2013-03-04 :
New darkplaces update :
Fix a crash on OpenGL 2.0 ( DX9 - class ) video cards where glGetUniformBlockIndex is NULL , this was not properly guarded with an extension check , OpenGL 3.1 or higher drivers ( DX10 - class ) have this function .
2013-03-01 :
New darkplaces update :
added support for RMQe maps like " Something Wicked This Way Comes " by Tronyn , this map format is slightly worse ( smaller coordinate limit ) than the BSP2 that darkplaces already supported .
fixed bug with the two shalrath not spawning in hip2m3 - this took a far - reaching analysis and bugfix effort for droptofloor and MOVETYPE_STEP in general , this should improve compatibility with other maps too .
sv_gameplayfix_ cvars default off now , this should make most mods compatible by default rather than requiring tweaked cfg files , these cvars do default on for non-quake games however ( Nexuiz , Steel Storm : Burning Retribution , etc ) .
skeletal model animation is now hardware accelerated where possible ( OpenGL 3 / DX10 cards ) , this greatly improves fps in Nexuiz and other games with skeletal models .
New dpmod release to reenable the sv_gameplayfix_ cvars that are disabled by default now .
2012-12-22 :
New darkplaces update for the survivors of the end of the world :
support for X360 gamepad ( joy_enable 1 required ) .
- quoth support .
fixed hip1m1 gold key door bug .
fixed some bugs with effectinfo. txt parsing that could cause effects to not be properly initialized .
sound ( ) builtin now supports speed control ( pitch shifting ) and 128 channels with snd_channel * volume cvars controlling their volume level independently ( make weapon sounds louder / quieter compared to other sound types , etc ) .
reduced memory usage ( sounds are now resampled during mixing rather than at load time ) .
better support for static ( non-animated ) iqm models .
added dpshaderkillifcvar keyword in q3 shader files which allows alternative shaders to be used based on cvars ( games can use this to swap in different kinds of water shader among other things ) .
removed r_hdr cvar ( use r_viewfbo 2 instead ) .
multiple bugs with vid_sRGB 1 have been fixed .
made mdl rendering mode faithful to software Quake by removing an unwanted half - pixel texcoord offset .
added cvars r_nearest_2d and r_nearest_conchars which let you decide whether to use nearest filtering on the entire 2D UI or just the console font .
support for BSP2 format ( modified Quake bsp with higher limits ) to match the new hmap2 feature .
fix missing runes on the hud ( due to previously bugged detection of hipnotic / rogue qc code ) .
fixed playback of intro demos in Malice game .
fixed a bug where playing back demos and changing slowmo cvar would not immediately take effect .
New hmap2 release bringing support for much more complex maps ( beyond Quake limits ) , it is much less likely to crash on complex maps now and will write BSP2 format if necessary .
New dpmod release with some minor fixes .
2011-07-23 :
New dpmaster master server release from Mathieu Olivier , version 2.2 brings the following features :
Flood protection against abusive clients ( contributed by Timothee Besset ) .
Support for Return To Castle Wolfenstein servers .
Support for Wolfenstein : Enemy Territory servers .
2011-06-28 :
New DarkPlaces engine release to fix the following issues with the previous release :
OSX build now supports .ogg music and .ogv theora video recording as intended ( and as the other platforms do ) .
2011-06-26 :
New DarkPlaces engine release to fix the following issues with the previous release :
Really fixed the solid water bug on dedicated servers this time .
2011-06-25 :
New DarkPlaces engine release to fix the following issues with the previous release :
Fixed a bug where dedicated servers would incorrectly load Quake1 BSP Files and treat water as solid .
2011-06-24 :
New DarkPlaces engine release with many improvements and bugfixes , including :
Significantly optimized rendering , much higher framerates than previous release .
Photon traced 3D texture radiosity in realtime world mode ( r_shadow_bouncegrid 1 ) .
Experimental Software Renderer ( vid_soft 1 ; vid_soft_threads 4 ; vid_restart ) , not recommended for serious play , framerate is poor ( but it renders very accurately ) , not feature complete yet ; no fog for instance ...
Experimental Direct3D9 renderer choice ( vid_dx9 1 ; vid_restart ) , not recommended because the D3D9 shadowmapping method is very slow compared to the OpenGL method , with shadows off it performs almost identically to the OpenGL 2.0 renderer .
In other news , the DarkPlaces - powered game Steel Storm : Burning Retribution has been released on Steam , for those who love overhead arcade shooters and multiplayer mission editing .
Also important , the web - based Quake Expo 2011 is well underway and nearing the end of its week - long run , be sure to check out the booths .
Updated download page with autobuild download links for those who want to follow the latest in - development version , also added separate downloads for Windows and Windows 64bit without the Linux and OSX builds to decrease download size for most people .
2010-04-08 :
New DarkPlaces engine release with many improvements and bugfixes , including :
High quality shadowmapping - r_shadow_shadowmapping 1 to enable , or r_shadows 2 for shadowmapped model shadows only .
New Bounding Interval Hierarchy collision culling system to improve server performance on Q3BSP maps ( mod_collision_bih cvar is on by default ) .
In other news I am actively working on the console Nexuiz game coming this summer on Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade , powered by DarkPlaces engine , I had lots of fun at GDC , thanks everyone for the support and this game is going to rock ( on the topic of licensing please see the interview at timedoctor.org ) , this means I have even more reason to actively maintain DarkPlaces engine and will continue adding great features .
There is now a DarkPlaces wiki for modders , see this inside3d thread for more information and to contribute .
2010-01-13 :
New hmap2 ( q1bsp compiler ) release with the following changes :
Fixed rotating door compilation , it was generating corrupt hull data for player and shambler collisions , now works perfectly .
( To see this in action in your own q1 maps , try making a " func_wall " entity and setting the " origin " key to the center of rotation you want , then set " nextthink " " 999999999 " and " avelocity " " 0 90 0 " to see it spin 90 degrees per second on yaw and push you around )
2009-08-28 :
New dpmaster master server release from Mathieu Olivier , version 2.1 brings the following features of interest to game developers :
A game type value can now be any name , not just a number .
( Needed by Warsow 0.5 )
2009-07-09 :
New DarkPlaces engine build , this is purely a bugfix release - the ogg dlls were missing in the previous build , making sound / cdtracks / track002.ogg and other emulated cd tracks fail to play ( if you were not aware of this feature , see the readme for instructions on encoding and installing the Quake CD music for play without the CD in the drive ) .
2009-07-07 :
New DarkPlaces engine build , bringing more of the usual optimizations and bugfixes , this release is mainly to fix a permissions problem that kept the Mac version from starting in the last stable build .
2009-06-04 :
New dpmaster master server release from Mathieu Olivier , version 2.0 brings the following features of interest to game developers :
IP v6 support .
Logging system .
Game type filters in server list queries ( and ability to restrict supported games in the master server , may be of interest to game teams hosting their own master server ) .
Updated documentation and many fixes and improvements .
( Note : dpmaster is only of interest to game development teams who have a game engine that supports the Quake3 ( r ) master server protocol , or the extended dpmaster protocol , it is not of interest to users )
2009-01-28 :
New DarkPlaces engine build , this release is mainly to fix the crash caused by recent ATI windows drivers when changing resolution or quitting .
2008 -10-04 :
New DarkPlaces engine build with the following major changes :
Made savegames compatible with other Quake engines .
Extended savegame format with new features ( no longer glitches when you reload a savegame on a mod that randomly replaces monsters or items with other ones ) .
Disabled use of GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two extension on Mac because it often crashes or runs slowly ( some graphics chips fully support it but not all , and crashing is unacceptable ) .
2008-09-30 :
New DarkPlaces engine build adding missing files to the Mac build ( SDL .
framework was not included and thus it would not run ) .
2008-09-10 :
New DarkPlaces engine build with a fix for specular lighting issues .
2008-09-09 :
New DarkPlaces engine build including Mac binaries , mostly bugfixes since the previous release .
2008-08 -16 :
QuakeExpo 2008 is open as of August 15th and ending on September 12th ( 4 weeks - longest qexpo ever ) , be sure to give it a visit and see what people are doing with Quake , Quake II , and Quake III .
2008-08-08 :
New DarkPlaces engine build , many minor improvements have occurred , as well as optimizations and bugfixes .
Note : no Mac binaries included this time , I have not set up compiling on a Mac I have access to yet , if you need Mac binaries please email me to remind me .
2008-07-15 :
New dpmodel build with fixed md3 normals ( they were being calculated incorrectly - apparently Quake3 uses a strange latitude / longitude angle format instead of pitch / yaw ) , this utility converts . smd model files ( saved by HalfLife export plugins for various modeling programs ) to .dpm and .md3 model formats .
2008-06-16 :
New hmap2 build with better time estimates for vis and light , still not multithreaded however .
2008-06-15 :
Posted Elric 's new dpmaster version 1.7 , featuring a perl - based test suite , several bugfixes and minor one - time memory leak fixes , increases in default server limits , corrections to techinfo. txt , and other improvements .
( Note : this server - list database program is only interesting to independent game development teams and tournament administrators )
2007-11-20 :
New DarkPlaces build :
Improved performance on lowend cards ( probably only slightly ) by skipping a screen clear .
Improved performance of reflections on water .
Improved performance of GL 2.0 shader - glow layer was accidentally always enabled .
Improved performance of GL 2.0 shader - directional shading was being used in Quake1 levels despite the fact Quake1 maps do not have any directional model lighting information ( Quake3 maps do ) , this was using a very slow software code path to generate directional shading information on models , which went unused .
Fixed bug with loading a savegame while demos are playing .
You can now load / save multiplayer games ( just remember to have everyone rejoin in the same order before loading ) .
Improved performance of decals ( split particle system into particle and decal subsystems with more finely tuned code for each ) .
More than doubled blood opacity , it was hard to see before at default settings .
Probably a few other fixes and changes I should mention bug forgot about .
Known bugs : water does not reflect sky for unknown reasons ( not a new bug ) .
New dpmod build :
Updated episode 1 rtlights files from romi's site .
2007 -11-03 :
Updated screenshots page due to popular demand .
2007-09-28 :
New DarkPlaces build , this is the same as the previous one but adds Mac OSX binaries which failed to build last time ( due to my friend 's Mac being offline ) .
2007-09 -27 :
New DarkPlaces build :
Fixed the guardian boss in mission pack 2 ( Dissolution of Eternity ) not waking up .
Fixed some misplaced code causing the score display on the left side of the hud in multiplayer to show up even at viewsize 120 .
Added support for mouse button 4 ( left side button on some mice ) in - dinput mode ( in case anyone actually uses that ) , button 5 ( right side button ) still not supported in - dinput though .
Improved fps significantly in some maps such as masque.bsp ( Masque of the Red Death ) by using larger lightmap textures for maps with lots of lightmaps .
Rewrote OpenGL 2.0 shader in a way that may make it work with broken GL drivers on Mac OS X ( it already worked on ATI Radeon X1600 and above but not other cards , let 's see if this fixes it on other cards ) .
Implemented ( very slow ) experimental pixel shader water ( Try the following commands if you wish to try it : r_glsl_water 1;r_shadow_bumpscale_basetexture 4;r_restart;r_waterscroll 8;r_novis 1;r_wateralpha 0.1 )
In other news I put up a tech notes page which may be helpful to other engine developers , or to anyone interested in the technologies used in darkplaces .
Rygel 's 2.7GB ultra texture pack is amazing , be sure to set gl_texturecompression 1 before installing it however , it may not even load otherwise , and it takes about 3 minutes to load the first level !
2007-07-11 :
New DarkPlaces build to fix timing issues in Nehahra movie playback at scene transitions .
2007-07-07 :
New DarkPlaces build and dpmod build ( just for good measure ) , many bugfixes and improvements .
2007-04-12 :
New DarkPlaces build , this has the following significant changes :
Renders faster using the GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object extension if available to store the map , models , and shadow volumes on the video card for faster drawing .
Fixed crashes and broken lighting ( which mostly affected ATI cards which have a more strict shader compiler ) .
Fixed a significant issue in timing code that had been causing subtle timing issues such as inconsistent ping times , erratic shot timing , jerky movement of players using prediction .
Known bugs and workarounds :
If your cl_maxfps is near your rendering framerate it can be very jerky , if this happens please enter this in the console : cl_nettimesyncmode 1 ( a better fix is in the works )
DarkPlaces source code has moved from the cvs versioning system to the svn versioning system , if you are an avid DarkPlaces tester obsessed with having the latest in - development version at all times , or are maintaining patches for darkplaces for your games / mods , please do a fresh svn checkout and migrate your changes ( use cvs diff > patch.txt and then patch - i patch .
txt to apply it in your new svn checkout , you may need to copy other files as necessary ) , all future changes will only be committed to the svn , the cvs will not be updated , and will eventually die whenever icculus convinces all other projects to switch to svn .
All future build zips will lack the CVS directories and can not be updated ( sorry , but the .svn directory doubles the size of every zip , which is unacceptable ) , if you need to update please do a checkout instead of downloading a build zip .
This also means that I can now add more developers to the DarkPlaces project as I now have control over the logins for DarkPlaces ( for cvs , icculus was having to add real unix users for every developer and told me he would n't add any more , so some people were only able to submit patches to me , now they can commit directly without my intervention ) .
If you are just a player , do n't worry about this versioning system nonsense . :)
2007-03-15 :
New darkplaces engine and dpmod release :
Fixed a really bad bug in dpmod deathmatch 7 code that made all monsters spawn at only one of the spawn points , rather than a randomly chosen one as was intended .
Fixed bug that made ambient sounds not play ( except in demos ) .
Doubled default hearable sound range to match ProQuake .
Added support for the strange macros often found in FuhQuake / ezQuake .loc files .
Cleaned up the options menu and added some selectable presets for effects and lighting .
Changed default value of con_closeontoggleconsole cvar to 1 , to put an end to the nearly 2 years of complaints about the tilde key not closing the console .
Added code to setinfo pmodel / emodel when connected to a quakeworld server ( incase anyone cares about what version of player . mdl / eyes.mdl are being used ) .
Fixed bugs in server query code when using sv_protocolname QUAKE , the server now properly responds to quake1 query tools when running quake protocol .
Disabled cl_bobmodel code when cl_bob is 0 for better compatibility with quake configs that expected the gun bobbing to be off when view bobbing is off .
Fixed a crash in the " maps " command .
Optimized " maps " command which was taking seconds to execute with large numbers of files .
Disabled movement prediction code on Quake servers , as it never works right without proper synchronization of moves ( which only DP6 / DP7 / QW protocols offer ) .
2007-03 -14 :
New darkplaces engine release fixing some bugs with .loc files that proquake accepted but darkplaces did not parse properly , no other noteworthy changes .
2007-03-12 :
New darkplaces engine and mod release :
Many bugs fixed , some new features , fixed some map compatibility bugs ( items falling out of levels and such ) , fixed many network issues ( MUCH better now ) , some new network features ( such as automatic downloads of missing files from darkplaces servers ) , fully updated readme ( which has been converted to HTML and posted here , and now includes cvar and command lists ) , some optimizations , supports more OpenGL extensions to accelerate stencil shadows and other features , changed the look of rtlights to be a bit more realistic ( small performance penalty ) .
Removed pentium3 - optimized builds ( darkplaces_p3.exe and such ) because they were n't really any faster from the few reports I 've gotten , this reduces download size .
No longer posting nexuizengine builds because the Nexuiz team make their own anyway .
Note : no Mac version included in this release either , sorry .
2006-07-25 :
New darkplaces engine release :
Several bugs fixed , not much in the way of new features .
Note : no Mac version included in this release either , sorry .
Happy QuakeExpo 2006 everyone !
2006-06-06 :
New darkplaces engine release :
Many changes , bugfixes , features , and optimizations ...
Note : no Mac version included because my friend 's Mac is currently out of commission ( drive failure , already replaced but the system is not fully functioning yet ) .
Happy 6 - 6 - 6 everyone !
2005-08 -24 :
New dpmaster release , version 1.6 :
Several getserversResponse may now be sent for a single getservers .
A getserversResponse packet can no longer exceed 1400 bytes .
The maximum number of servers recorded by default has doubled ( now 256 ) .
The default hash size has been increased from 5 bits to 6 bits .
Several updates and corrections in the documentation .
Compilation on FreeBSD was fixed .
A couple of minor changes in " COMPILING DPMASTER " ( in techinfo. txt ) .
2005-08-18 :
New dpmod release , just more tweaks and scraps of code of interest to modders , nothing really new .
( Note : I 'd welcome a critique of the highly experimental Ragdoll stick physics code in gore.qc from an experienced physics programmer , I 'd like to find out how to fix the many problems with the stick physics )
New darkplaces engine release , monsterously huge summary of changes follows : ( the changelog itself is much larger )
Fixed a bug that was making models twice as bright as they should be in the merged renderer .
Added a special check for entities with NAN origins in server networking code to prevent a crash ( NAN origin means it has no location at all , it is everywhere at once , a very bad situation ) .
Black and LadyHavoc changed normal / tangent smoothing to use areaweighting rather than summing normalized vectors , this looks a little better and is a lot less cpu work on animated high poly models ( r_smoothnormals_areaweighting enables / disables this ) .
Black fixed some bugs preventing Tenebrae light entities in q3bsp maps from loading in the rtlights loader .
Elric fixed a crash with the mod coopmod .
Improved memory debugging capabilities of developer_memorydebug 1 setting , now detects double - free attempts and other errors quite reliably .
Added v_deathtilt , cl_deathscoreboard , and cl_deathnoviewmodel cvars to make certain clientside death behaviors optional .
Fixed a really bad mistake in the client login process , it was sending
( newline ) characters at the end of the signon commands ( the server does not expect newlines in these commands ) .
Added a small check to prevent the " cmd " command from forwarding an empty command to the server when given nothing to forward .
Added support for GL_NV_half_float OpenGL extension for a noticable lighting speedup on GeForce6 and a minor speedup on GeForceFX .
Black made changelevel start a map if there is no server running .
( so changelevel is now similar to QW 's map command .
Black added DP_CON_EXPANDCVAR and DP_CON_ALIASPARAMETERS
extensions .
DarkPlaces should now support 64 bit file sizes on non-windows platforms since windows makes it more difficult ( that 's 16 Exabytes , or 16,384 Petabytes , or 16,777,216 Terabytes , or 17,179,869,184 Gigabytes ) .
Fix problems with missing cubemap textures in GLSL .
Tomaz fixed a bug in the Windows client with vsync where it was not applied when the window first opened .
Black merged the menu and server QuakeC virtual machines for the most part , in preparation for client QuakeC .
Fixed a bug that was only allowing one active lightning beam owned by world .
Fixed a rare bug where stencil shadow volumes were not projected far enough to reach the light box .
Default Offset Mapping off ( as it messes up model skins ) .
Black added sv_playerphysicsqc to control whether the qc physics function is called ( if it is available ) .
Black added support for loading LNO files produced by fteqcc ( for reporting line numbers of QuakeC errors ) .
Black made the server try up to 100 ports above the default ( 26000 ) if the default one fails to open , automatically assigning ports when running multiple servers .
Added a patch from Christian Holmberg to make XK_section key ( I do not know what this is ) type ~ character for binds .
Removed r_editlights_rtlightssizescale and r_editlights_rtlightscolorscale cvars ( now they behave as if they were both 1.0 ) added r_editlights_edit commands radiusscale sizescale and colorscale ( use these to fix old - format .rtlights files ) .
Cured the ' ca n't bunnyhop ' bug .
Black added support for [ 515 ] 's BX_COLORTEXT extension .
( BX = Betwix engine .
Fixed crashes after level changes involving lightning bolt models that got unloaded during the level change ( was happening often in The Ascension of vigil ) .
Changed server to set self to world before calling SetNewParms qc function ( to intentionally crash any broken mods which assume self is valid in that function ) .
Fix a bug with savegames containing line breaks in their titles .
Tomaz added gl_picmip ( Texture Quality ) slider and r_restart button ( Renderer Restart ) to Graphics Options menu .
Tomaz added - demo and - demolooponly options ( - demo plays a demo and then quits , - demolooponly stays in the demo loops and only allows the escape key , which quits ) .
Elric added basic support for Q3's " getstatus " messages from Q3 server query tools ( based on a patch by divVerent ) .
Fixed several issues in filesystem searching functions ( now " dir *.cfg " should actually report the right files , as well as " ls maps /*.bsp " and so on ) .
Fixed a compile problem on Mandriva Linux ( patch by Zero_Dogg ) .
Elric added DP_SOUND_API targets ( NULL , OSS , ALSA , BSD , WIN , COREAUDIO ) in the makefile to allow choosing different sound drivers .
No longer averages ping times , just uses the latest ping time ( now all the ping numbers are nice round multiples of the server sys_ticrate ) .
Fixed several bugs with prydon cursor tracing ( including it constantly reporting world origin as the impact point ) .
Fixed a bug that was causing impulses to lost very often .
Now only gives shareware Quake warning if running GAME_NORMAL ( Quake ) .
Black added the cvars net_slist_timeout and net_slist_maxtries to query servers multiple times .
Server browser now queries servers over time to avoid flooding out requests and getting very bad pings ( net_slist_queriespersecond and net_slist_queriesperframe cvars control the rate of queries ) .
EvilTypeGuy added Solaris 10 x86 support .
Tomaz revised the embedded font to support all the special Quake font characters .
Fixed two severe geometry bugs in the zym loader ( which were causing parts of models to not render ) .
Fixed a bug in SDL client which was preventing typing after vid_restart .
Fixed some crashes with server commands ( kick , view * commands ) .
Fixed an endian swapping issue in Q3BSP loading ( so Q3BSP loading now works on Mac ) .
Added somewhat hacky support for Mac OS X .app packaging to allow proper Mac OS X binaries to be made .
Fixed bmodel trails ( if anyone ever dares to try them ) to come from the center of the bmodel , this also cleaned up the sound code ( and fixed a weird bug with a sound played in the same frame as an entity is removed ) .
Added DarkPlaces7 network protocol with QW - style local player movement capabilities , warning : this has speedcheat / lagaport potential ( and currently no way to force off cl_movement from the server ) .
Added DP_QUAKE3_MAP
extension .
zym models now support TraceBox calls ( bullet tracing among other things ) .
Fix bug with ClientDisconnect not being called if a client drops between " spawn " and " begin " commands , now it is reliably called .
Dhanged default heartbeat_period to 120 seconds so that usually two packets come in before the 5 minute timeout , this should help with packet loss in server heartbeats to the master servers .
Fixed bug that rotated all sounds 90 degrees to the right in Nexuiz ( because it has seriously messed up player models ) .
Fix portal clipping of lighting in a single cluster map ( box map ) which has no portals .
Fixed snow fluttering so it works properly again .
Fixed crashes with .
lit files of the wrong size ( a start .
lit in id1 for instance when running a mod which has its own start. bsp which is not compatible with the start .
lit from id1 ) .
Fixed envmap command to save the proper skybox layout ( matching Quake2 ) .
Fixed 64 bit compatibility issues in QuakeC VM , so DarkPlaces 64 bit builds now work .
Completely merged Q1 mdl , Q2 md2 , Q3 md3 , Nexuiz zym , Q1 BSP , and Q3 BSP rendering , this is a massive code reduction and ( more importantly ) easier to maintain ( which means less bugs ) .
Fixed problems with getting stuck in wedges in maps ( by turning off sv_newflymove cvar ) .
Added sv_gameplayfix_blowupfallenzombies and sv_gameplayfix_findradiusdistancetobox cvars ( to allow these changes to be disabled ) .
Fixed a bug with dead explosion shells not being removed ( resulting in them ceasing to work after a while ) .
Fixed a bug that made menu sounds come from world origin ( they are now global ) .
Revised notes in r_shadow.c on Creative Labs ' patent on the Carmack 's Reverse stencil shadow volume technique .
Rewrote scissor calculation to use brush clipping of the light box to determine which part is on screen and restrict rendering more exactly than before .
Improved readability of " memlist all " reports , they now include the filename / linenumber of each allocation .
Cleaned up init process again , now parses configs only once ( not twice for video settings and such ) and opens video as soon as the first map / startdemos / connect / playvideo / cd play command is executed ( connect actually waits until it connects and wo n't open the window if it fails ) .
Made r_restart / vid_restart reload models as intended .
Fixed a bug that made view - attached entities render in third person .
SDL builds are now enabled by default in the makefile .
Silenced some texture loading warnings in dedicated servers ( thanks to Biomass for reporting this ) .
Black changed the SDL window icon back to DP 's icon .
Black changed commands , cvars and aliases to be sorted by name ( for better console listings ) .
Fixed a stupid bug in the te_customflash server qc builtin , it was fading instantly .
Fixed a very minor bug in TE_CUSTOMFLASH parsing ( forgot to add 1 to radius ) .
Fixed missing gfx / net.lmp warning ( and a few others in gfx.wad ) , they are now accessed properly .
Fix a bug that made rtlighting crash ( thanks to Vic for reporting this ) .
No longer shows extra time reports in r_speeds report when using r_showtris 1 .
Added developer_texturelogging cvar ( logs all attempts to load images to textures.log , useful for texture replacement projects to know what textures matter to a map ) .
Default DLight shadows on .
Fixed a bug where the player would be stuck in place ( for a very long time ) when going from singleplayer to multiplayer .
Added cl_capturevideo_sound cvar ( defaulted to 0 ) to allow enabling / disabling sound saving , with sound disabled you can save videos at a framerate your machine can't maintain ( no sound sync to worry about ) .
Fixed bugs that made doors and other pushers ignore some entities .
Fixed transparency issues in q3 shader parsing .
Fix fogging in hlbsp by clearing view to fog color ( since sky polygons are missing in hlbsp ) .
Changed script init in Nexuiz to play the logo video if there 's nothing else to do .
Changed crosshair mode to static by default ( center of screen rather than showing where your shots will hit in the world ) .
Changed in_pitch_min/max defaults to 90 degrees so you can now aim straight up / down ( unlike in Quake ) .
Fixed an items parsing bug when playing hipnotic demos .
gl_texture_anisotropy now only affects mipmapped textures ( should fix issues with lightmaps ) .
Fixed a bug where gl_texturemode was changing textures that are n't supposed to be affected by it .
Default to insert mode instead of replace mode in console .
Cursoring past the end of the current commandline no longer takes characters from an old commandline .
Allow typing international characters in the console ( non - ASCII ) for mods that use Latin1 fonts rather than quake 's white / brown set .
Fixed a crash in network parsing when an entity is tagged to an entity that is outside the current range of entities .
Fixed a severe server bug affecting frikbots ( the engine was running physics code on disconnected clients ) .
Improved compliance with Targa spec in treatment of alpha and colormaps ( palettes ) in truecolor images - NOTE : this means many Paintshop Pro and Photoshop TGA files are no longer transparent , GIMP knows how to write them properly .
Renamed r_shadow_cursor cvars to actually have the word cursor in their name like they were supposed to .
Added playerclip and monsterclip brush support for q3bsp levels .

RTLights system now supports .ent override files .
Fixed a mouse twitch in GLX client after raising / lowering console ( mouse grab ) .
Fixed a messagemode / messagemode2 issue in which you could type " ; quit " as a chat message and have your client quit .
Fixed an r_restart crash in skybox code .
2005-06-21 :
New hmap2 release which now works properly when given .map filenames for vis and light stages ( which really want .bsp ) , this should fix problems with the GTKRadiant build menu , hmap has not been fixed ( it is obsolete ) .
2005 -03-08 :
I have moved all download files to the files directory to make beta builds easily accessible ( I do not make frequent official releases due to the work involved in making the " What 's new " descriptions ) .
This breaks any pages directly linking to old betas , please update links to point to the new directory instead .
A couple videos of the hard skill hall in start have been added to the screenshots page to demonstrate the darkplaces experience ( totally stock data except for a .rtlights file ) .
2005-01-31 :
Released new version of lmp2pcx with .tga output , and conversion of .mip files ( it already converted .lmp ) , now also outputs .lmp from gfx .
wad images ( in summary : wad outputs .mip/.lmp/.bin ( depending on lump type ) plus .pcx and .tga of each image , lmp and mip output .pcx and .tga of each image ) .
2005-01-22 :
Released some old maps ( ladyhavocmaps.pk3 ) with source .map files included :
ctfgold8 - my map for the CTF
Gold pack , designed to be a very linear map from base to base with two paths through the middle area , and a quad to spice things up , the bases are well equipped for prolonged fights , but full of deadly corners which make combat freightening at best in the base itself , the rooftop is relatively safe , and the traps at the sniper outposts are quite an odd touch , it has 1 quad and 2 red armors , 1 yellow armor , 3 rocket launchers , and all the other weapons can also be found , one goal of this map was to be difficult to quickly flag run despite being a small map , but due to the grappling skillz of many this turned out to be one of the fastest flag run maps and spawned a small competition to see the fastest cap possible , the fastest ever recorded on my server was 13 seconds ( 9 seconds has been reported from singleplayer using slow motion cheats to perfect it exactly , but that does n't count ) .
lhca1 - a Clan Arena map with a dm3 theme comprised of 3 massive interconnected arenas connected to eachother in a ring fashion with a central hub that was the site of many heated battles as it was smaller than the arenas themselves , the arenas turned out too large scale ( Quake rockets are n't that fast ) , inspired dpdm1 connectivity and design .
( previously unreleased ) .
lhdm4 - a DM map
I made on request for a DM tourney , very inconsistent connectivity and layout , although varied in theme as well , never got used because it was too small so I expanded it a bit , and then was told it was too large , go figure ( previously unreleased ) .
metlhell - a DM map I made very early , far too experimental and I was thinking more in a singleplayer theme when I made it , which resulted in terrible connectivity and lava laden rooms rather than arenas conducive to combat .
( previously unreleased ) .
rampcity - a DM map based on a very simple concept , this turned out better than expected , almost infuriatingly difficult vertical combat map , and the first map I ever made in the BSP map editor - still my favorite editor .
( previously unreleased ) .
2004-11-18 :
New hmap2 release , what 's new :
Vic sent a patch that checks for incomplete brushes , removes them and prints warnings instead of exiting with a CheckWinding error ( Thanks to Tomaz for committing the patch ) .
fixed origin key handling in brush loader , so rotating bmodels should work properly ( I hope ) .
added - harshshade option .
2004-10-19 :
New darkplaces release , what 's new :
Fixed a number of problems with scoreboard updates ( names / colors / frags ) in the server .
Fixed duplicate name bug in client mini-scoreboard ( the one to the right of the statusbar in multiplayer ) .
Tomaz enlarged particle font from 256x256 to 512x512 and added some code to allow saving it to a .tga ( and an example one has been posted on the download page ) .
Quitting without using the " quit " command in the console now disconnects from the server , and properly kicks off everyone on a local server .
Credited romi and | Rain| for their contributions in the readme .
Added 32 bit color support to SDL builds .
2004-10 -17 :
New darkplaces release , what 's new :
Rewrote Quake3 curve loading which finally makes maps look correct in all cases .
Added DP_QC_GETTAGINFO
extension written by VorteX so modders can find out where md3 model tags and attached entities are , thanks VorteX !
2004-10 -16 :
New darkplaces release with various bugfixes , what 's new :
Now detects a few quake3 shader types to make quake3 maps look mostly correct ( additive shaders are detected , as well as autosprite / autosprite2 , and twosided shaders , also loads first pass texture if it can't find a texture of the same name as the shader , and transparent textures in quake3 maps now require a shader to indicate they are transparent ) .
Fixed a bug that was preventing dynamic lights from lighting up quake3 maps .
Now prints 8 QuakeC opcodes instead of 5 when a crash or warning occurs .
MoALTz fixed the r_stereo_separation code so the anaglyph stereo glasses support works properly now .
Rewrote chat message handling code to be cleaner .
Added DP_LITSPRITES
extension string ( the feature existed already but was not documented ) .
Fixed connect status messages in join game menu ( it was only showing them in server list menu ) .
Simplified cl_net * cvars to just cl_netlocalping and cl_netpacketloss and removed sv_netpacketloss cvars .
Made tenebrae light cubemaps work on model entities again ( they were being disabled because the requested skin did not exist in the model , so the cubemap was being set to 0 ) .
Greatly optimized findradius builtin ( it now uses the physics culling data to avoid searching all entities ) .
Removed cl_nodelta cvar as it never worked properly , and is unnecessary with the current network protocol .
Fixed a bug that made the game world seem to freeze after a level change in multiplayer ( networking was falling apart ) .
Fixed framegroup animation on normal entities ( static entities like Quake 's torches worked already ) .
Changed movement interpolation a bit to better handle less frequent updates on far away entities .
Fixed a " blue dlight " bug when a map uses tenebrae dlights but the progs.dat did not support them ( it was a silly typo in the engine ) .
Fixed a crash when dedicated servers tried to talk to the players .
Fixed a " blue glow_trail " bug , it was not properly interpreting the palette color .
2004 -10-06 :
New darkplaces release with various bugfixes , what 's new :
fixed lingering entities in quake protocol , demos for example
added cl_beams_* cvars to effects options menu
now can connect to another server while remaining connected to current server up until the connection is accepted
now shows loading screen at appropriate times which also stops sound
fixed nehahra movie support
sprites now support EF_NODEPTHTEST
watershader now disabled on lightmapped water
now compiles on x86_64 successfully , server still crashes though ( will be fixed at some point )

fixed an entity colormapping bug which caused players to be white in dpmod
skybox works in hlbsp again
fixed weird player model angles when looking down
negative frags display correctly again
Mathieu fixed a logging problem which was not recording cvar creation notices to the log
Mathieu fixed sound channel volume clipping to work the same on 16bit and 8 bit sounds
removed detection of GL_NV_vertex_array_range as it's not used
added - novideosync disable for WGL swap control
fixed qc builtin cvar_string to not crash engine if the cvar does not exist
2004 -10-02 :
New darkplaces mod release : Just added my dpdm1.rtlights file , only of concern to people playing that map .
2004 -10-01 :
New darkplaces release , what 's new :
It works a LOT better than the previous release , has many more menu options , has a readme , GOOD network performance ( smoother than qw , although no prediction or clientside movement )
It 's just plain better :)
Thanks again to Tomaz for his ongoing efforts to beat down the todo list .
P.S. Hopefully I wo n't be so lazy about posting new releases in the future ; then again I 've said that a few times before .
New darkplaces mod release :
More of the usual little changes and balance tweaks , got rid of nailgun casings because they looked a bit silly ( although cool for making a pile of casings ) and dragged down network performance a lot , added back nails sticking in walls though ( and you can blast them loose ) .
2004-09-07 :
New version dpmaster released :
- version 1.5 :
Address mapping added ( see ADDRESS MAPPING in readme )
Servers on a loopback address are accepted again if they have a mapping
A valid " infoReponse " is now rejected if its challenge has timed out
The size of the challenge sent with " getinfo " has been made random
A timed - out server is now removed as soon as a new server needs a slot
Several little changes in the printings to make them more informative
A technical documentation was added
Compiling dpmaster with MSVC works again
2004-08-31 :
Fixed link to download hmap2 , sorry about that .
Thanks to Gleeb for reporting this .
2004-08-27 :
Updated sv_user.qc with bugfixes supplied by Sajt , it no longer moves slower when looking up / down , pitch no longer affects swim up / down when underwater , and FL_ONGROUND is cleared when noclipping or swimming , thanks Sajt !
2004-08-12 :
First release of hmap2 , a combined hqbsp / hvis / hlight/bsp2prt/bspinfo utility written by Vic based on hmap , and with further additions by me , tyrlite compatible ( hlight lighting no longer supported , sorry ) , compiles q1 / hammer/q2/q3/doom3 .map files ( bp texturing not supported in q3 map files , texturing not properly supported in doom3 map files which use bp texturing exclusively ) .
2004-05-21 :
Tomaz changed the website layout and cleaned it up to use css .
Thanks Tomaz !
Posted a new litsupport zip updated by Tomaz to fix a few minor things ( no actual bugs , just passing one parameter too many to a function , and fixed some begin / end comments ) .
2004-05-20 :
Changed email address because my telefragged account stopped working ( and I do n't think I can get it back , I have no telefragged site ) , I was also getting 10 spams a day , and telefragged has ssslllooowww email ( 300 spams downloaded in 15 minutes ) ...
So my email has changed , and is no longer a simple email link to confuse spammers .
( Yes there 's still a new build in the works , it is delayed until I rewrite the networking to fix an annoying bug )
2004-01-28 :
romi has completed his .rtlights file collection for Quake Mission Pack 1 : Scourge of Armagon ( also known as hipnotic ) , and for those not aware of his Quake .rtlights file collection as well , I recommend it :)
romi also has some videos in the works to show his lighting creations better than the screenshots do .
( If anyone does n't remember , to experience an rtlights file it must be placed in the maps directory , make sure in the Video Options menu that you are in 32 bit color mode ( sorry this can't be done on a 3 Dfx Voodo o 1 / 2/3 / Rush / Banshee ) , load up the map you want , and then simply type r_shadow_realtime_world 1 in the console , enjoy .
Maps without rtlights files are often slower and less colorful . )
2004-01-17 :
U8 Poo has sent a nice screenshot running of realtime lighting mode in a q3bsp map he made , to spice up the screenshots section , thanks !
In other news another release is still in the works ( as expected ) , already fixed some significant physics bugs ( which date back to july ) but for some reason still am not quite in the mood to release it .
2003-12-07 :
Another new engine release ( 20031207 b ) :
Added r_wateralpha cvar to the effects options menu .
New engine release :
No longer limits framerate to 20 fps while in console because I got so many complaints about this ( no REALLY that was not a bug like everyone assumes , that was a feature , just a very misunderstood one ) , so now it only drops to 20 fps when not the active window ( it already did this ) .
Changed hardware gamma handling in glx to no longer turn on / off based on mouse being in the window or not , but simply whether it is the active window .
Fixed 16 bit video modes in Linux support .
( oww this was broken , I only use 32 bit :)
Fixed a bug with console parsing that existed in almost all versions of quake except quakeworld by switching to the qwcl COM_Parse for console parsing ( in english : fixed connect commands involving a port , like 127.0.0.1:26000 ) , thanks very much to Fuh for mentioning this bug .
Removed need for gfx / menuplyr.lmp , some old unused code required it , no idea why that was still there ( in english : this has no importance to quake players , only modders making standalone stuff ) .
2003-11-30 :
Due to popular demand I put up some new screenshots of qe1 textures in e1m1 running realtime lighting mode .
2003-11-29 :
New engine release , now parses scripts /*. shader files ( including inside pak / pk3 archives ) when loading q3bsp maps to check for surfaceparms ( nodraw and trans and such ) this fixed up q3bsp rendering a bit ( at least in the sense that transparent textures for tricky opaque shaders are now rendered opaque ) .
Another new engine release , now uses the surfaceflags inside the q3bsp for all flags it can ( transparency is still read from shader surfaceparms as there is no surfaceflag for it ) , this may or may not affect anyone but it 's more correct .
2003-11-19 :
New engine release , this fixes the bullet holes in Scourge of Armagon ( and any other mods using oriented sprites ) .
New hmap release with some enhancements by Vic :
hqbsp now properly calculates node bounding boxes making them much smaller for non-axial planes ( this means maps run faster in engines other than darkplaces ; darkplaces already did this on loading )
detects and skips degenerate edges
corrected CheckWindingArea for portals area checking
precise .prt files output ( may fix some vis errors on complex maps )
New dpmaster release from Elric , this fixes two buffer overflow vulnerabilities so anyone hosting a dpmaster master server should update .
Here 's the readme 's words on the matter :
- version 1.3.1 :
SECURITY WARNING : 2 exploitable buffer overflows were fixed
Verbose option parsing fixed
Paranoid buffer overflow checkings added , in case of future code changes
2003-11-18 :
New engine release , this one has a few known bugs ( short summary : rtlights do n't handle animated textures or water motion ) but fixes enough very annoying bugs to warrant a new release anyway , and adds some features , such as :
Quake3 BSP file loading with rtlight support .
( rtlight editing note : q3map2 and probably q3 map itself , remove light entities when compiling , so do n't expect any lights until you add some )
Now defaults to 32 bit color ( I think this will still work on 3 Dfx because I know they support 32 bit screen modes with 16bit rendering ) and stencil is now automatically enabled on 32 bit color modes .
Added r_editlights_help and r_shadow_help commands to give some information so people do n't have to ask me about these subsystems .
Added a lot of QuakeC builtin error checking regarding bogus entities being passed in ( like trying to copyentity to / from world for example , or a free entity ) .
Input sticking through a level change has been fixed !
( thanks very much to Black for his work on this and other bugfixes in the input system :)
Now supports non-QWERTY keyboards in windows ( it already supported them in Linux ) .
( thanks to Black and Mercury for their combined work on this )
Added Anisotropic
Filter setting to menu .
( thanks to zinx for coding this , note : use r_restart to reload textures to make it take effect )
DirectSound should work in windows again ( been a long time since this worked because of DirectSound strangely needing an open window ) so the sound rate has been bumped to 44 khz ( 44 khz ran into issues with many drivers with no window open ) and the sound system is restarted by snd_restart or vid_restart ( due to the window ) .
Note : q3bsp support has NO SHADERS , this was meant for mods to use , not to play existing maps ( which often have very odd alpha textures for shader effects ) , and as yet has no global fog support or volumetric fog support because of lacking shaders , and there are no plans to add q3 shader support because they are quite incompatible with rtlights .
I would also like to announce that a new member called Black has joined the darkplaces team , and has been contributing a great deal of effort on the QuakeC subsystems ( as well as bugfixes particularly in the input subsystems ) , he has been working hard on a QuakeC menu system ( still experimental ) , and then after that , clientside QuakeC can begin to expand the horizons for quake mods :)
New mod release , this one does n't really fix many bugs to my knowledge ( probably introduces a few ) , but contains a new weapon management system that allows more weapons than quake ever had , so now for example you can shoot an enforcer and grab a laser rifle from the backpack ( being unable to use certain monster weapons like this always irritated me ) , note : laser rifle is a second weapon on impulse 3 , and there is an experimental ' plasma shotgun ' on impulse 2 which needs cells as well as shells .
2003-07-27 :
New engine release , hopefully this finally fixes the ' does n't work through NAT routers ' problem ( also known as DSL routers , cable modem routers , etc ) by reducing the connection packet size ( it is once again split up like netquake did ) .
New mod release , intended to fix some bugs that popped up such as backpacks giving no ammo , and other inventory glitches .
2003-07-18 :
New engine and mod release , the engine should fix a few bugs , and the mod reverts the Fury to Quad and allows " coop " difficulty settings to be changed during the game ( coop controls monster health scale ) , but is otherwise mostly the same as the version released on the DarkPlaces booth at QExpo , and I also posted the versions ( including Revelation ) that were released on the booth , for completeness .
2003-06-30 :
New hmap release adding support for HalfLife WorldCraft texture alignment ( as requested by FrikaC ) .
2003-06-15 :
Updated sv_user.qc to fix the name of the cl_rollangle variable ( apparently I typed cl_rollspeed for some reason originally ) , sorry about that .
Thanks to Electro for reporting this .
2003-06-10 :
New lhfire release :
Added spritetype command ( to allow types other than vp_parallel , like oriented for example )
Documented spritetype command
Documented worldbox command ( which was not previously documented )
2003-06-09 :
Fixed the download link for hmap build 20030607 , note to self : do not release in a hurry with no time to test links .
Fixed the download link for darkplaces mod build 20030607 , sorry about that being broken before !
2003-06-07 :
Another new release of darkplaces , changes :
Fixed savegame loading crash someone reported a few days ago ( thanks for reporting it ) .
Fixed a SOLID_BSP with non-BSP model error that often occurred after Host_Error ( this one 's been tormenting me for ages ) .
New release of darkplaces , dpmod , dpmaster , hmap , lhfire , lmp2pcx .
No information because I can't remember what changed since the last versions , however I do remember there were important bugfixes in hmap and dpmaster , and many changes in darkplaces and dpmod .
I really should set up nightly builds or something as most of these changes are quite old but never made it into builds until now .
I hope these new builds are useful ( and as always feel free to email me with suggestions / bug reports ) .
2003-04-08 :
New darkplaces release , changes are :
loading saved games should work again
playing dpv video streams should work again
added DP_QUAKE3_MODEL
extension for mods to check for
2003-04-06 :
New darkplaces release , changes are :
fixed savegame menu so it displays saved games again ( thanks to the two people who reported this bug - yes your saves are fine , it just was n't showing them ) .
split r_shadow_realtime into cvars r_shadow_realtime_world ( requires stencil ) and r_shadow_realtime_dlight ( which does not require stencil , and infact works on a voodoo ( but it 's ugly ) or decently on voodoo 2 ) and r_shadow_visiblevolumes .
PK3 archive support and jpeg texture and screenshot support ( scr_screenshot_jpeg 1 ) , HUGE thanks to Elric of the Transfusion project for these features !
2003-04-03 :
New darkplaces release .
Some of the new features I can remember : Color Control Options , hardware gamma now works in Linux , .viewmodelforclient now works ( useful for modders ) , should be able to connect through NAT ( such as Linux ipmasq , ADSL routers , etc ) , FrikaC 's file access and string handling extension FRIK_FILE has been added , more extensions added for some effects that have been around for quite a while .
Thank / blame diGGer for pestering me to release this new version ( his mod needs it ) , I wanted to upgrade the entity protocol ( to implement " rate " limiting for modemers - or people trying to play helm18 ) and bugtest for a few days , but here it is without either rate or bugtesting :)
2003-03-29 :
New dpmaster release , major bugfix ( no longer locks up after running for a very long time when someone asks for a server list , encountered this on my own dpmaster ) , thanks Elric !
2003-03-12 :
New dpmaster release , offering nice improvements ( such as an extra - secure daemon mode on UNIX / Linux and improved commandline options ) , thanks Elric !
2003-03-01 :
New engine release to fix bugs with using OgrO 's model skins ( for example the models are no longer invisible ) and changed gloss brightness from external textures to mimic tenebrae ( this is sad because I would imagine doom3 will not have a 25 % brightness hack ) .
New engine release ( yes it has n't even been months since the last one ! ) , MAJOR improvements to realtime lighting consistency and correctness ( even added back 3D attenuation texture use on supporting hardware ) , also fixed a graphical bug with the Chthon lightning trap in e1m7 ( it now looks like in quake , no polygon lightning falling short of the end nonsense ) .
2003-02-26 :
New engine release to fix realtime lighting mode on non-NVIDIA cards (* LadyHavoc slaps self for using GL_CLAMP when she knew better ) , no other changes .
New engine , mod , and dpmaster releases , sorry very little explanation on these , I 'm in a bit of a hurry ( as usual ) .
The new engine release fixes a lot of very annoying bugs in 20021103 , and should improve performance all - round ( especially in realtime shadowing mode ) , and can cope with totally insane mods ( at least as entity limits go ) .
The mod includes some weapon changes and new rtlights files for various id maps .
Some features in the works for next release : rate limiting ( this is mainly for sake of making banshee 's helm18 ( and successive maps ) not croak if you spawn in the middle of 10000 knights ) , more realtime shadowing optimizations ( must ... make ... it ... faster ! ) , hopefully more goodies
2002-11-29 :
I really should have released these rtlights files much earlier ( they are dated 2002 - 11 - 17 ) but here they are , rtlights for most of e1 ( start , e1m1 , e1m2 , e1m3 , e1m4 , e1m5 , e1m6 , e1m7 , and dm6 thrown in ) , also available on the download page .
Note : dm6 actually runs fairly quick in realtime mode for me , amazing :)
Next engine release still under development , it will have light reduction support so you can make the map a little darker for performance ( better results can be had by manually relighting it with r_editlights mode though ) , md3 model support , qe1m1 texture support ( qe1m1 uses some paletted and greyscale targas ) , and some optimizations ( to both normal rendering mode and realtime ) .
2002-11-14 :
Decided to post some new pics of realtime shadowing mode in the screenshots section , and here 's two pics 1 2 of dpdm2 soaked in blood from a game of deathmatch 7 in dpdm2 last night ...
Much fun was had .
Still experimenting with the new charge - up plasma rifle utilized so effectively by SSJ4 - Death and others in that game last night .
Discovered a few bugs too , which I need to fix ( teleporting fiends being the most annoying ) .
2002 -11-03 :
New engine release 20021103 , greatly improved and optimized r_shadow_realtime mode , ingame light editing ( r_editlights 1 , and r_editlights _ * cvars / commands - I should write up a guide for doing this , it 's not simple to explain , one tip though : r_editlights_edit and r_editlights_spawn use this list of parameters - radius red green blue style - and you do not need to type the whole set of them , for example 200 makes a normal white light , and 200 0.5 makes a dim white light ) , also note this fixes all Geforce2 compatibility problems ( just make sure you 're using vid_bitsperpixel 32 and vid_stencil 1 ) , if you want to force gloss on type r_shadow_gloss 2 ( looks cheesy in my opinion and is a slowdown , but useful for benchmarking in comparison to tenebrae ) , also note this release is CPU limited on my tbird 900 mhz , I need to optimize the model lighting more ( caching bumpmapping info ) .
Oh and a note , this probably makes normal rendering mode even slower , sorry about that , I need to re-optimize the normal mode .
Here 's my .rtlights files for start and e1m1 respectively ( these were made solely with r_editlights commands ) , drop them in your id1 / maps directory to get a performance boost , a bit of extra realism , and colored lighting .
note : these files only affect r_shadow_realtime mode .
2002-10-31 :
Since some people keep telling me I need to post pics to prove that darkplaces is doing the whole doom3 rendering thing , here are some pics taken in e1m2 with exagerated bumpmap settings ( and gloss forced on ) :
1 : gloss , nogloss
2 : gloss
3 : gloss
2002-10-28 :
A new pic of r_shadow_realtime 1 mode in start ( relit by hand ) with scissor clipping working ( gives about a 20 - 60 % speed gain ) , mostly just working on speeding it up and fixing any bugs I can find ( only one persists and it's rare , I do n't understand it yet , and it may be related to the map loading bug ( which seems to only occur with gcc 2.95.3 , not with VC ++ )
I 've been trying to hunt down for months ) , finally DP 's realtime lighting mode is CPU limited by my athlon 900 mhz instead of fillrate limited by my Geforce4 Ti4200 :)
2002-10 -24 :
A new pic of r_shadows 3 mode in e1m1 ( relit by hand ) with gloss working , reminds me of a sunset on water , not sure how soon the next release will be .
2002-10-20 :
A new pic of r_shadows 3 mode in dpdm2 ( yes the map with 116 enormous lights in one room with ridiculous poly count ) taken toward the end of dpdemo2 posted here , I 've more than tripled the performance of r_shadows 3 mode with some new code , not sure how soon the next release will be however , and it 's still not very playable even in more sane maps than dpdm2 .
2002-10-19 :
Thanks to John Truex for hosting a master server on his cable , anyone who wishs to use it ( as a client or server ) should use a command like this :
sv_master1 68.102.242.12
I will be adding it to the next release as sv_masterextra1 .
( which will not be saved to config , sv_master1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 settings are saved to config so I can't just change them as they would not take effect for most people )
I will also be adding a cvar sv_public which defaults to 0 , set it to 1 to have your server show up on master servers .
In other news , anyone trying out r_shadows 3 who suffers from severe slowness on their Geforce2 ( or crashing - that 's a driver bug , not my fault ) or similar , try r_light_quality 0 .
This is a temporary workaround for the fact it 's detecting 3D texture support ( albeit software emulated ) , I 'll fix this in the next release .
2002-10 -16 :
New engine release : fix for crash when starting r_shadows 3 mode , MSVC 's stack space is truly pathetic ...
New engine release : many bugfixes and r_shadows 3 mode now works correctly ( except for a few shadow bugs I have not figured out yet ) and looks great , it also now works on Geforce 2 class hardware ( it 's still horribly slow though ) , now includes both mingw ( darkplaces - mingw.exe ) and msvc ( darkplaces.exe ) builds of the engine because the mingw builds ( which all builds this year have been ) have a lot of strange crashs I have not been able to find ( this irritates me a great deal because the same errors occur in Linux gcc 2.95.3 ) , also now uses a specially constructed infinite farclip matrix ( got the code from tenebrae ) , I hope this works with all drivers , if it does not work for someone please email me about it .
New dpmaster release : now has commandline options , and some bugfixes , thanks again Elric :)
Took another picture of the in - development realtime lighting mode , this one is more recent and shows off the fact I have bumpmapping working , and much less obviously the fact I have Geforce2 support working ( the lowest card this mode supports ) .
2002-10 -14 :
Took some pictures of the in - development realtime lighting mode .
Here , Here , and Here .
( yes I will be making it faster , it 's currently unplayable , also currently requires a Geforce3 or Radeon 8500 class card because it relies on quadtexture )
2002-10 -12 :
Emailed John Carmack about merging attenuation and normalization ( for per pixel lighting and bumpmapping ) into one texture , his reply is here .
2002 -10-06 :
New engine , very minor update to try to make 3D texture support work with drivers that do n't report GL_EXT_texture3D ( strangely GF2 drivers do n't ?
I would think they would ... very odd ) by checking for the OpenGL 1.2 built in support for 3D textures .
( This only matters to those uncontrollably curious people who want to try r_shadows 3 )
New engine 20021006 , fixes the numerous map / changelevel / restart / load bugs in the previous release ( that release was embarassing ) .
Full dynamic shadowing in development .
I advise no one try r_shadows 3 unless they are uncontrollably curious , it is very incomplete / useless / etc ( and really only works in hlight maps like dpdm1 - which is pathetically slow ) , you have been warned .
2002-09 -28 :
New engine , now has ingame video mode switching ( vid_restart and various vid_ variables ) , and the 2D renderer now uses the 3D renderer ( this may work around bugs in some drivers ) , explosions now have sparks .
( Technical note to engine coders : cl_particles .c is intended to be reasonably easy to drop into glquake engines ( rename it to r_part.c and add #define WORKINGLQUAKE to the top , some other pieces of glquake need to be altered to use the new functions , requires programming knowledge ) .
New mod , rocket launcher 's altfire now fires spiraling rockets , a few bugfixes and cleanups elsewhere ( ca n't remember them ) .
2002-09 - 24 :
New engine , now has an internet master server browser ( net_inetslist command or use the menu ) , rendering has been a lot faster , and the spark effects look better now .
New mod , bots can play any simple map ( they 're idiots around liquids , doors , etc ) , weapons changed a bit ( pistol now has an altfire for rapid fire , plasma gun changed a bit and now fires 8 shots at once when sniping ( doubling the damage ) , grenade launcher now fires impact and proximity grenades ( detonate is gone ) , rocket launcher can load multiple rockets with it 's altfire ( detonate is gone ) ) , and various little bugfixes .
Please someone host a master server and tell me the IP so I can add it to the default master server list .
2002-09 -20 :
The website returns , on it's new home at
.
Unfortunately the most recent release I 've made is an old version ( 20020831 ) , I 'll try to find the time to make a new release someday soon .
Jeff Patton from Thoughtworks held a very interesting session at XpDay last month in London , focusing on a common misconception that causes “ agile ” projects to fall into the same trap that the waterfall ones typically do .
Incremental is not iterative
Using a very interesting combination of pop music and rock star images , Jeff Patton told a story of a failed agile project in his XpDay keynote “ Embrace Uncertainty ” .
The project started off nicely , almost by the book , with customer involvement and stories split into iterations , based on what functionality is to be delivered in what release .
After they got something delivered to play with , customers changed their minds ( as they so often do ) and new stories and features were introduced into the plan .
After a few deliveries , the scope kept growing and growing instead of reducing .
From the developer perspective everything worked as planned – customer was expanding the scope and developers are there to oblige , because that is the essence of agile practices .
Spice Girl Mel
B was used for the role of a developer writing user stories and losing all sight of the big picture ( while “ So tell me what you want , what you really really want ” was playing in the background ) .
For the customer , the thing simply did not work - iteration after iteration , they were not any closer to having the project done .
The problem was that the concept of iterating had been lost and iterations were replaced by increments – making the project fall into the same trap as waterfall projects do .
Iterations were aimed to deliver blocks of functionality .
Jeff demonstrated that visually using the Mona Lisa painting ( powerpoint slides from the keynote have still not been released , so the pictures below are not the same ones as Jeff used , but they show the point ) :
Although both these plans aim for the same thing , the incremental plan does not really reduce the risk of delivering something unsuitable to the client .
The big picture appears only at the very end .
Because increments are done in detail , a lot of effort is wasted when a piece needs rework ( and the initial releases are almost certain to fall into this category ) .
Iterative development offers a chance to see the picture from the start , and guide the development towards the full picture in steps .
Not carving stuff in stone from the start allows us to change them easier later on , and we know that we ’ll need to do that .
Jeff gave the following rule of thumb to check quickly if your plan is iterative or incremental : “ it ’s not iterating if you do it only once ” .
Dealing with uncertainty
However , iterative planning is harder to sell .
Stakeholders want the project delivered by a fixed date on a fixed budget , and an uncertain iterative plan does not help with that .
The XpDay keynote also offered three strategies for dealing with that :
Black Hat Conference : Security Researchers Claim To Hack GSM Calls
The creators of the in - development technology say they 'll be able to crack GSM encryption with only about $ 1,000 worth of equipment .
Security researchers presenting Wednesday at the Black Hat D.C. conference in Washington , D.C. , demonstrated technology in development that they say will be able to greatly decrease the time and money required to decrypt , and therefore snoop on , phone and text message conversations taking place on GSM networks .
Many mobile operators worldwide use GSM networks , including T - Mobile and AT&T in the United States .
The 64 - bit encryption method used by GSM , known as A5/1 , was first cracked in theory about 10 years ago , and researchers David Hulton and Steve , who declined to give his last name , said today that expensive equipment to help people crack the encryption has been available online for about 5 years .
Until now , however , it 's been prohibitively expensive for people to get their hands on this technology .
If it works , the technology Hulton and Steve are developing should be able to crack GSM encryption in less than 30 minutes with about $ 1,000 worth of equipment , or in about 30 seconds with $ 100,000 worth of equipment .
The technology could potentially be helpful to law enforcement investigators , but could also be taken advantage of by malicious hackers .
Hulton says he plans to commercialize the more expensive version of the technology .
Other hardware Hulton and Steve referenced uses two different techniques to snoop on GSM calls and can cost between $ 70,000 and $ 1 million .
So - called " active " systems simulate a GSM base station and do n't rely on encryption because they trick phones into connecting to the GSM network through them .
Other , so - called " passive " systems snoop on the traffic and are far more expensive .
Hutton and Steve 's technology relies on the use of an array of devices known as field programmable gate arrays to first create a table of all the possible encryption keys -- in this case 288 quadrillion -- and then decrypt each of those over the course of three months .
The resulting tables of keys could then be used by software to decrypt GSM communications , which first have to be intercepted using a receiver that can listen in on GSM frequencies .
During their talk , Hulton and Steve also discussed the vulnerabilities of mobile device SIM cards , noting that GSM networks broadcast SIM cards ' unique IDs in unencrypted text , which can tell attackers or law enforcement what kind of phone someone is using .
The GSM network also can tell snoopers how far a phone is from a base station , within 200 meters of error .
They noted that SIM cards run Java Virtual Machines that operators have access to , and suggested that it could be possible for malicious attackers to install applications on user 's phones without them ever knowing , potentially rerouting traffic to a third party who listens in to phone conversations .
The GSM Association , a trade group representing more than 700 GSM operators , said it could not comment on the specific claims Hulton and Steve are making .
However , spokesman David Pringle said in an e-mailed statement that while researchers have showed how A5/1 could be compromised in theory , none of their academic papers have led to " practical attack capability that can be used on live , commercial GSM networks . "
He also noted that more advanced encryption is beginning to be deployed for GSM networks and that other networks , including 3G networks , do n't use A5/1 .

One of the upcoming projects I am doing ( I will reveal it in one of the next blog posts . ) is going to be written entirely in Python .
I have a good understanding of Python but , same as I had with JavaScript , I have little experience doing projects from the ground up in it .
Update : the project was redditriver.com , read designing redditriver.com ( includes full source code ) .
Before diving into the project I decided to take a look at a few Python video lectures to learn language idioms and features which I might have not heard of .
Finding Python video lectures was pretty easy as I run a free video lecture blog .
First Python Lecture : Python for Programmers
Interesting moments in the lecture :
[ 07:15 ]
There are several Python implementations - CPython , PyPy , IronPython and Jython .
Python has similarities with [ 12:04 ] Java , [ 15:30 ] C++ and [ 19:05 ]
C programming languages .
[ 15:37 ]
Python is multi-paradigm language supporting object oriented , procedural , generic and functional programming paradigms .
[ 19:49 ]
Python follows C standard 's rationale : 1 . trust the programmer ; 2 . do n't prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done ; 3 . keep the language small and simple ; 4 . provide only one way to do an operation .
[ 13:02 ]
Python code is normally implicitly compiled to bytecode .
[ 13:25 ]
Everything inherits from object .
[ 14:56 ] Garbage collection in classic Python happens as soon as possible .
[ 24:50 ]
Python has strong but dynamic typing .
[ 28:42 ]
Names do n't have types , objects do .
[ 36:25 ]
Why are there two ways to raise a number to a power ( with double star ** operator and pow ( ) ) ?
- Because pow( ) is a three argument function pow( x , y , z ) which does x^y mod z .
[ 36:52 ]
Python supports plain and Unicode strings .
[ 38:40 ]
Python provides several built - in container types : tuple 's , list 's , set 's , frozenset 's and dict's .
[ 41:55 ] c[ i : j:k ] does slicing with step k .
[ 42:45 ] c[ i : j ] always has first bound included and last bound excluded .
[ 44:11 ]
Comparisons can be " chained " , for example 3 < x < 9 .
[ 45:05 ]
False values in Python are 0 , " " , None , empty containers and False .
[ 49:07 ] ' for ' is implemented in terms of iterators .
[ 52:18 ]
Function parameters may end with * name to take a tuple of arbitrary arguments , or may end with ** name to take a dict of arbitrary arguments .
[ 55:39 ] Generators .
[ 01:00:20 ] Closures .
[ 01:02:00 ] Classes .
[ 01:05:30 ] Subclassing .
[ 01:07:00 ] Properties .
[ 01:14:35 ]
Importing modules .
[ 01:16:20 ] Every Python source file is a module , and you can just import it .
[ 01:17:20 ] Packages .
Okay , this talk was a very basic talk and it really was an introduction for someone who never worked in Python .
I could not find many interesting points to point out from the lecture , so the last 8 points are just titles of topics covered in the lecture .
Second Python Lecture : Advanced Python or Understanding Python
Interesting moments in the lecture :
[ 03:18 ]
Python is designed by implementation .
[ 04:20 ]
Everything is runtime ( even compiletime is runtime ) .
[ 04:42 ]
A namespace is a dict .
[ 05:33 ]
A function is created by having its code compiled to code object , then wrapped as a function object .
[ 10:00 ] Everything is an object and a reference , except variables .
[ 11:00 ] Python has 3 - scopes rule - names are either local , global or builtin .
[ 11:12 ]
Global names mean they exist in a module , not everywhere !
[ 14:02 ] ' import mod ' statement is just a syntactic sugar for mod = __import__ ( " mod " ) .
[ 14:15 ] sys.modules contains a list of cached modules .
[ 14:30 ]
You may set the value of a module name in sys.modules dict to None , to make it unimportable .
[ 15:20 ]
Mutable objects are not hashable , most immutable objects are hashable .
[ 18:05 ]
Assignments , type checks , identity comparison , ' and or not ' , method calls are not object hooks .
[ 22:15 ]
Any Python object has two special attributes __dict__ which holds per object data and __class__ which refers to the class .
[ 27:18 ]
Iterators are not rewindable , reversible or copyable .
[ 29:04 ]
Functions with yield return generators .
[ 39:20 ] " New " style classes unified C types and Python classes .
[ 47:00 ] __slots__ prevent arbitrary attribute assignments .
[ 48:10 ] __new__ gets called when the object gets created ( __init__ gets called when the object has already been constructed ) .
[ 01:01:40 ]
Inheritance is resolved using a C3 Method Resolution Order algorithm .
[ 01:04:57 ] Unicode in Python .
[ 01:06:45 ] UTF8 is not Unicode , it 's a Unicode encoding !
[ 01:11:50 ] codecs module automatically converts between encodings .
[ 01:13:00 ] Recommended reading - Functional Programming HOWTO and Python source code ;)
This lecture gets pretty complicated towards the end as the lecturer goes deep into subjects which require adequate experience with Python .
Third Python Lecture : Python : Design and Implementation
Interesting moments in the lecture :
[ 01:27 ] Python started in late 1989 , around December 1989 .
[ 01:57 ]
Python 's named after Monty Python 's Flying Circus .
[ 06:20 ]
Python was first released to USENET and then a public group comp.lang .
python was started .
[ 08:06 ] Guido van Rossum , the author of Python , moved to US in 1995 .
[ 09:58 ]
Python will never become a commercial project thanks to Python Software Foundation , founded in 2001 .
[ 11:23 ]
Python origins go back to ideas from ABC programming language ( indentation for statement grouping , simple control structures , small number of data types ) .
[ 13:01 ]
Being on ABC 's implementation team , Guido learned a lot about language design and implementation .
[ 16:37 ]
One of the main goals of Python was to make programmer 's productivity more important than program 's performance .
[ 17:10 ] Original positioning of Python was in the middle between C and sh .
[ 21:13 ]
Other languages , such as , Modula - 3 , Icon and Algol 68 also had an impact on Python 's implementation details .
[ 24:32 ]
If a feature can be implemented as a clear extension module , it is always preferable to changing the language itself .
[ 25:23 ]
The reason Python uses dictionaries for namespaces is that it required minimal changes to the stuff the language already had .
[ 28:11 ]
Language features are accepted only if they will be used by a wide variety of users .
A recent example of a new language feature is the ' with ' statement .
[ 31:13 ] Question from the audience - " Ca n't the ' with ' statement be implemented via closures ? "
[ 34:25 ]
Readable code is the most important thing .
[ 37:57 ]
To add a new language feature , PEP , Python Enhancement Proposal has to be written .
[ 40:47 ]
Python 's goal was to be cross-platform ( hardware & OS ) right from the beginning .
[ 47:09 ]
Python 's lexer has a stack to parse indentation .
[ 49:20 ]
Two passes are run over abstract syntax tree , one to generate symbol table and the other to produce bytecode .
[ 50:20 ]
Bytecode opcodes are very high level , close to conceptual primitive operations in language , rather close to what hardware could do .
[ 01:02:54 ]
Jython generates pure Java bytecode .
[ 01:03:01 ] Jython 's strings are always Unicode .
[ 01:06:45 ] IronPython is as fast or even faster than CPython .
Question and answer session :
[ 01:08:57 ]
Have there been attempts to compile Python to machine code ( for example , x86 ) ?
[ 01:13:46 ]
Why not use simple tail recursion ?
[ 01:16:09 ]
How does the garbage collection work ?
This video lecture gives an insight on history and development ideas of Python language .
I believe it is important to know the history and details of the language design decisions to be really competent in it .
There are a few more lectures I have found :
There is also some great reading material available :
Have fun learning Python !
PS .
Do you know any other video lectures on Python that I have n't mentioned here ?
Feel free to post them in the comments !
Thanks !
Just after Comcast copped to throttling P2P traffic , a new net neutrality bill appeared on Capitol Hill .
Yesterday , US congressman Edward J. Markey , the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunication and the Internet , introduced something called " the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2008 " .
" [ This bill ] is designed to assess and promote Internet freedom for consumers and content providers , " Representative Markey explained , in a canned statement .
" Internet freedom generally embodies the notion that consumers and content providers should be free to send , receive , access and use the lawful applications , content , and services of their choice on broadband networks , possess the effective right to attach and use non-harmful devices to use in conjunction with their broadband services , and that content providers not be subjected to unreasonably discriminatory practices by broadband network providers . "
In other words , Markey wants the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) to play hardball with the likes of Comcast .
On the surface , the bill seems rather tame , discussing broadband Internet policies in very general terms .
But many net neutrality advocates believe that if this bill passes , it would make it that much harder for Comcast and other American ISPs to throttle or block certain types of traffic .
Legal teeth
" It 's quite a strong piece of legislation , " says Timothy Karr , the campaign director for the public advocate Free Press .
" It gives the FCC more federal statutory authority to act against the types of blocking that we 've seen increasingly in the last six to nine months [ We think he 's talking about Comcast .
- Ed ] .
It enshrines a very basic principle of non-discrimination in federal law .
And that would give us the legal standing to actually prosecute the types of discriminatory practices we 're seeing . "
Yes , the FCC is currently investigating Comcast , but the company claims that its BitTorrent busting is A - OK according to the commission 's 2005 Internet Policy Statement , which says ISPs are entitled to practice " reasonable network management " .
Karr and other anti-Comcasters are worried the company will wriggle through this loophole .
" The problem that we see at the FCC is that there remains a lack of clarity , " he says .
" What is reasonable network management ? "
Markey 's bill does n't try to answer that question .
But it does attempt to add some new language to the Federal Communications
Act that would specifically prohibit ISPs from " discriminating " against certain traffic .
This revised Communications
Act would guard against " unreasonable discriminatory favoritism for , or degradation of , content by 15 network operators based upon its source , ownership , 16 or destination on the Internet " .
That 's right , Markey wants to counter an FCC footnote that allows " reasonable network management " with a bill that prohibits " unreasonable discriminatory favoritism " .
But a federal law carries some weight , and those who speak Washingtonese assure us that this is a good thing .
" Markey 's legislation gives clarity on the issue , " Karr says .
Net neut 's heart and soul
Meanwhile , Google is pleased as punch that this bill would also require the FCC to arrange several " broadband summits " where average internet users could speak up on these topics .
" Internet users themselves will get a chance to answer those questions .
From the start , the heart and soul of the movement for net neutrality has been the grassroots - the thousands and thousands of ordinary Americans who have already spoken up for Internet freedom on sites like Save The Internet and beyond , " says Google policy analyst Derek Slater on the official Google Public Policy blog .
" Net neutrality is too often painted as just about particular companies ' competing interests , " Slater continues , " but that 's missing the point .
Rather , net neutrality and broadband policy are - and should be - about what 's ultimately best for people , in terms of economic growth as well as the social benefit of empowering individuals to speak , create , and engage one another online using the wide panoply of innovations available to them . "
Of course , the competing interest of certain companies also play a role .
Otherwise , Slater would n't be posting to a Google Public Policy blog .
But we 're all for making the people heard .
And hopefully these people will stick it to Comcast .
We acknowledge that Comcast has the right to a certain amount of network management .
But clearly , the company is uninterested in policing its own practices - or keeping its customers informed of these practices .

Some of the most awesome science fiction machines ever conceived for film , like the turbo - tank AT - ATs from Empire Strikes Back , were inspired by things the concept designers saw every day .
You may already know that George Lucas was allegedly inspired to create the AT - ATs by these cargo lifters at the Port of Oakland — but did you know the T - 1000 " liquid metal " Terminator was inspired by chocolate fudge ?
Find out which strangely ordinary items inspired eight of the coolest science fiction machines , and be humbled .

Robby the Robot , star of 1955 special effects blockbuster Forbidden Planet and later a main " charater " on the TV show Lost in Space , was the creation of legendary production designer Robert Kinoshita .
Apparently one of his biggest inspirations for the globular humanoid bot was washing machine tubs .
Kinoshita had worked on those before his career in the movies .
The comparison sounds strange to us today , until you look back and see what washing machines looked like in the 1940s , when Kinoshita worked on them .
This picture shows the odd similarities , with the bulbous roundness and strange silver knobs sticking out .

The HAL 9000 computer which famously refused to open the pod bay door in the 1969 movie 2001 was inspired by surveillance cameras which filmmaker Stanley Kubrick saw around London as CCTVs were being put in place .
Author Arthur C. Clarke , who worked with Kubrick adapting his novel for the screen , confirms that HAL was inspired by " television cameras in cities " in an interview .

Here is a rather odd reverse - inspiration .
The exoskeleton that Ripley used to fight big mama alien in Aliens is frequently mentioned by the designers for exoskeletons that might be used by soldiers or disabled people .
Here you can see Ripley 's cool device , and the exoskeleton for soldiers it inspired .

Since the special effects designers for Machine City in Matrix : Revolutions were located in San Francisco , it 's probably no surprise that they based it in part on the San Francisco skyline .
Effects designer Craig Hayes said in an interview that one of the first things he and his crew did was go out on the San Francisco Bay , about 8 miles from San Francisco , to see how the city would look from a distance .
That gave them a sense of how to build Machine City from Neo 's point of view as he zoomed into it .

Here you can see the hot fudge sundae that became the T - 1000 .
Director and effects maven James Cameron said that when he was first conceiving of the liquid metal Terminator , he thought a lot in terms of texture .
How should it ooze ?
How should the reflections look ?
In an interview , he admitted :
I wanted the effect of the T - 1000 to look like a spoon going into hot fudge ; it dimples down , then flows up over and closes .
That 's the look I wanted .
You have to work with the viscosity in order to get that look just right .

When Steven Spielberg set out to make futuristic computers for Minority Report , he did n't mess around .
He went straight to a research group at MIT , called the Tangible Media Group , which thinks up next - generation interfaces .
The group told him that gesture - commands would be the wave of the future , and even showed him a bunch of prototypes — some of which are now in use , several years later .
You can see an early gesture - controlled prototype here , on the left .
And there 's Tom Cruise doing his Minority Report gesture thing on the right .

And finally , there are the eXistenZ " metaflesh game pods , " created by David Cronenberg for his dizzying movie about virtual reality games that plug right into your spinal column via a creepily biological bio-port installed ( oh so Cronenberg style ) right above your butt .
Cronenberg has said a lot about how current technology is heading towards a merging with biology .
So it 's no surprise that his game pods look exactly like biological rehashings of late - 1990s Playstation controllers that he would have seen every day while making this movie .

Like a real bird , RoboSwift can sweep its wings back and forth , changing the shape and surface area .
A shape - shifting , robotic bird that can sweep through the skies without a peep has all the right stuff for ground surveillance and even spying on its real - life inspiration — the common swift .
Engineering students presented their design of the so - called RoboSwift at an annual Design Synthesis symposium at the Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands .
The robotic bird measures 20 inches ( 51 centimeters ) from wingtip to wingtip and weighs less than three ounces ( 80 grams ) .
The team expects to build the micro airplane in the coming months and fly it in January 2008 .
They hope to enter three RoboSwifts in the First American - Asian Micro Air Vehicle competition in India in March 2008 .
RoboSwift 's design is revealed in a new video .
Avian aviators
The team , from Delft and the Department of Experimental Zoology of Wageningen University in The Netherlands , based the design on recent findings on the common swift ’s flight features , as detailed in an April issue of the journal Nature .
During its lifetime , a common swift can fly up to five times the distance to the moon and back , or more than 2 million miles ( more than 3 million kilometers ) .
The Nature study found the common swift is able to endure the distance by constantly morphing its wings in response to the prevailing flight conditions .
By folding its feathers over one another and sweeping them back and forth , the bird changes its wing shape and the surface area exposed to the elements .
The feathery adjustments boost flight efficiency and maneuverability .
Flight crew
Much research has focused on the flight of birds such as the common swift , ranging from figuring out what makes them such fantastic aviators to how humans can replicate the traits .
The new robot has “ unprecedented ” features , the researchers say .
It relies on only four “ feathers ” for morphing ability .
To steer , it sweeps one wing back more than the other , creating a difference in lift force on the wings so that the craft can roll or make sharp turns in the air .
Like real birds , the robot can adjust both the wing shape and surface area continuously throughout flight .
Onboard lithium - polymer batteries power an electromotor that drives a propeller , allowing RoboSwift to follow a group of real birds for 20 minutes or perform ground surveillance for an hour .
The RoboSwift 's propeller can also fold back to reduce air drag .
RoboSwift carries three onboard micro cameras , with two mounted on the wing and one in the belly pointing downward .
A display mounted to the robo - plane ’s head will beam the images to the ground where pilots can get a bird ’s - eye view .
The wings of civilian aircraft are constructed to fly in a fixed position , making the planes much less efficient and agile than the common bird .
A few military aircraft , such as the F - 14 Tomcat and the English - German Tornado , are equipped with “ swing wings , ” which can sweep back and forth ( extending out for a glide and tucking into the body to speed up ) .
But the wings ca n’t adjust their shape , or morph , to significantly reduce surface area .
We had already a Russian on - ground ferry that helps some passenger cars to pass the hardest parts of Russian roads .
This is also an on - ground ferry but for some completely different purpose .
It helps the big river boats to cross the big dam on their way by … putting the big river boat on some sort of a train and transfer it a few miles on ground .
Look down for the pictures , personally I was fascinated with such an approach !
And here starts the most interesting part :
Wow !

With the recent surge in Java closures blogs , I thought I would do a roundup on some recent hot topics .
Probably the most important development is that we now have prototypes for the three major closures proposals .
That means it ’s time for the steel cage death match !
Ok , I guess that ’s not really necessary .
But we do have the tools now to do a comparison on syntax and functionality of these proposals :
BGGA ( spec ) – Neal Gafter is driving the most thorough proposal
FCM ( spec ) – Stephen Colebourne and Stefan Schulz have a method - oriented approach
CICE ( spec ) – Josh Bloch is championing a simpler approach to simplifying anonymous inner class syntax
java.net has been running a poll on closures and the results are kind of interesting .
At the moment , BGGA is in the lead , but neck and neck with NO closures .
FCM is making a respectable showing ( given it ’s lower profile ) and CICE has only a tiny percentage .
I suspect this poll probably is n’t too useful since the vast majority of those voting have not taken an in - depth look at the proposals and really understood the details and differences .
Peter Ahé ( former tech lead for javac ) , requested a boycott of the poll in principle .
Another area of focus lately has been on the closure syntax , which of course is something that will look foreign to any Java developer unfamiliar with closures .
Here are some recent syntax articles :
I ca n’t say I ’m too excited about the pointer syntax idea .
I find FCM ’s syntax to be a little nicer in general although I do n’t like the placement and notation of return types .
I initially disliked BGGA ’s syntax , but I ’ve seen enough of it now that it does n’t bother me .
I think the final blog there is an interesting one and it would be convenient to use the same syntax in Groovy and Java .

At the end of 2006 , the FBI 's Telecommunications Intercept and Collection Technology Unit compiled an end - of - the - year report touting its accomplishments to management , a report that was recently unearthed via an open government request from the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Strikingly , the report said that the FBI 's software for recording telephone surveillance of suspected spies and terrorists intercepted 27,728,675 sessions .
Twenty - seven million is a staggering number given that the FBI only got 2,176 FISA court orders in 2006 from a secret spy court using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
According to the math that means each court order resulted in 12,742 " sessions , " all in regards to phone , not internet , surveillance .
FISA watchers have long wondered whether FISA warrants covered more than one person .
Knowing how many calls or text messages the FBI captured could add a piece to the puzzle .
Unfortunately , nothing in the documents turned over yet to the Electronic Frontier Foundation explain what a session is .
Does it refer to one session of listening in on a target 's conversation , even if it is minimized for not being relevant ?
Does it include text messages ?
Does the incoming call number and the recording of the call count as two sessions ?
Do cell phone pings that reveal the general location of a target count as a session ?
Unknown .
Steven Aftergood , who runs Secrecy News for the Federation of American Scientists , says it 's an odd , and not so useful statistic :
I 've never seen a number like that .
When I hear 27 million sessions that sounds like they are talking about individual communications that were monitored for each individual target .
Aftergood thinks that if you take the number of targets and add them up , it 's not that crazy a number .
He also suspects that there are likely less than 2,100 foreign surveillance targets and that each target likely gets multiple orders - one for a fax line , one for a cell phone , one for a secret house search , etc .
It 's a surprising statistic to keep because it does n't tell you much .
What you want to know is how many of the foreign intelligence surveillance sessions were of significance .
If only three out of 27 million were useful , that would tell you something , but one number without the other is meaningless .
Of note is that the software at issue , the DCS - 5000 gets information from carriers after they turn on surveillance on their switches once they get a court order ( CALEA mandates the switches be wiretap - compliant ) .
That means this number ostensibly has nothing to do with the government 's secret warrantless wiretapping program , or the government 's data - mining of billions of call records .
See the 27 million figure here ( .pdf ) ( p. 35 ) and drop your reasoned or snarky hypotheses in the comments .

New - build flats sold four years ago at £ 180,000 are now fetching just £ 130,000 .
Miles Brignall reports from Manchester , on the frontline of the housing slowdown
The spectre of negative equity that blighted so many households in the 90s is back with a vengeance .
Prices for new - build flats are in freefall , with some buyers who paid top - of - the - market prices as recently as 2005 now seeing the values of their homes down 40 % .
We focused on Manchester and found flats selling for £ 50,000 less than the owner paid for them .
Repossessed flats are being dumped on the market for prices that would have seemed unimaginable a few years ago .
Meanwhile buyers are reluctant to enter the market in case they end up over - paying .
We highlight block after block of new - builds where prices are tumbling :
· A one - bed flat sold by a developer for £ 140,000 in 2001 fetched just £ 87,970
· A two - bed flat selling for £ 180,000 in 2005 struggles to get £ 128,000
· Estate agents windows marked up with " price corrections " , and one saying : " Make me an offer - I may say yes . "
In recent years Manchester has enjoyed an economic renaissance .
Developments such as Salford Quays hope to cash in on the arrival of thousands of BBC employees relocated from London .
But the signs of over - supply elsewhere are evident ; rents are falling , and the buy - to - let investors who drove up prices are now fast evaporating .
It 's not just new - builds in Manchester that are suffering .
The pattern is being repeated in cities across Britain , where " luxury city centre apartments " are witnessing big price falls .
One agent in Nottingham warned potential investors that even at this level they may fail to find tenants to support buy - to - let mortgages .
There is a " buyers ' strike " , in which people are unwilling to purchase until the floor in prices is found .
The global credit crunch is compounding the problem , with mortgages becoming tougher to obtain .
This week Bradford & Bingley revealed that its profits had halved .
Advantage Home Loans ( one of four providers that had signed up to the government 's HomeBuy scheme ) was closed down by its owner , Morgan Stanley .
However , it 's not all bad news : first time buyers are seeing previously unaffordable homes fall back into reach .
" There are so many flats on the market , buyers have n't got the time to get round them all .
One couple said to me they had so many flats to choose from they could n't make a decision , " one agent said .
Another agreed that first - time buyers would be the big winners .
" For them , the fall in prices is great news but you have to feel for the people who are in negative equity .
You can expect to see a lot more repossessions over the coming months , " another agent said .
The losers are likely to be the late - comers to buy - to - let .
When Guardian Money spoke to the residents of new - build apartment blocks in Manchester , we found that virtually all were occupied by tenants whose landlord was a buy - to - let investor .
Early investors are still sitting on large gains .
But more recent entrants have been burnt by price falls , and those who have been unable to find tenants are now facing repossession .
We highlight the story of Tamsin Barks , a Sussex vet who was persuaded by a property seminar company that she could make a fortune by investing in new - builds .
She bought seven properties , including one in Manchester , but estimates her total losses after costs at £ 350,000 .
Brokers specialising in buy - to - let say talk of a crisis is misleading as it is based purely on the new - builds in city centres .
Solar Thermal Power Could Supply Over 90 percent Of US Grid Plus Auto Fleet
Converting the national electricity grid to solar thermal power would reduce overall American global warming pollution by 40 percent .
The combination of plug - in hybrids and solar thermal power would eliminate the importation of 13 million barrels of fuel per day .
The study finds that because the seasonal and daily patterns of solar radiation already correlate strongly with electricity use , just 16 hours of thermal storage can provide reliable , load - following electric power .
by Staff Writers
Palo Alto CA ( SPX ) Mar 07 , 2008
Ausra has published a peer - reviewed study showing that over 90 percent of the U.S. electric grid and auto fleet 's energy needs could be met by solar thermal power .
Solar power is the nation 's largest primary renewable energy resource , offering many times total U.S. energy needs .
Solar thermal power stations use fields of mirrors to capture the sun 's energy as heat to boil water and drive steam turbines .
Solar thermal 's low - cost , efficient heat storage makes solar thermal power uniquely able to provide a reliable energy supply from ever - varying sunshine .
The Department of Energy 's Energy Information Administration projects over 70 percent total growth in the nation 's electricity demands by 2025 , and analysts predict a further increase in electricity needs as plug - in electric hybrid vehicles come to the market .
" The U.S. could nearly eliminate our dependence on coal , oil and gas for electricity and transportation , drastically slashing global warming pollution without increasing costs for energy , " said David Mills , chief scientific officer and founder at Ausra .
" This new study shows that our daily and annual energy needs closely match the energy production potential from solar thermal power plants with heat energy storage , and our models show solar thermal power will cost less than continuing to import oil . "
Mills is the inventor of the absorber surfaces used in the majority of the world 's solar hot water heaters and the pioneer of Ausra 's compact linear Fresnel ( CLFR ) technology .
He presented his findings yesterday at the IEA SolarPACES solar research conference in Las Vegas .
He co-authored the new paper with Robert Morgan , Ausra 's chief development officer .
A copy of the complete findings can be found here .
Converting the national electricity grid to solar thermal power would reduce overall American global warming pollution by 40 percent .
The combination of plug - in hybrids and solar thermal power would eliminate the importation of 13 million barrels of fuel per day .
The study finds that because the seasonal and daily patterns of solar radiation already correlate strongly with electricity use , just 16 hours of thermal storage can provide reliable , load - following electric power .
" Near - zero pollution technology has to replace most of our current electricity generation by mid-century to prevent the worst global warming outcomes , " said Stephen Schneider of Stanford University , who was a principal author of the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report .
" We 've got to cut pollution 80 percent by mid-century , and that means transforming both our electric power and transportation sectors . "
Solar thermal power complements other technologies such as wind , solar photovoltaic and geothermal generation .
" Historically , our country has moved rapidly to build generation to meet market opportunities and grid needs , " said Robert E. Fishman , Ausra 's chief executive officer .
" Between 1996 and 2005 , the decade of gas , we built over 250 gigawatts of natural gas - fired power plants , a quarter of total U.S. generating capacity .
As the solar thermal power industry moves to scale now , we are entering the decade of solar and building a reliable , affordable source of power to meet both the needs of our growing economy and the challenge of eliminating pollution . "
( Adds White House declining comment , paragraph 9 )
LONDON , Feb 5 ( Reuters ) - Britain's Prince Andrew launched a sharp attack on Tuesday on U.S. President George W. Bush for failing to listen to Britain during the conflict in Iraq .
In a newspaper interview before 10 - day visit to the United States to support British business , the prince , fourth in line to the throne , said the aftermath of the Iraq war had left Britons with a " healthy scepticism " about what was said in Washington .
" If you are looking at colonialism , if you are looking at operations on an international scale , if you are looking at understanding each other 's culture , understanding how to operate in a military insurgency campaign -- we have been through them all , " he said .
" We 've won some , lost some , drawn some , " he told the International Herald Tribune .
" The fact is there is quite a lot of experience over here which is valid and should be listened to . "
The prince , who also has the title Duke of York , said that while Britain remained the number one ally of the United States , the post - war situation in Iraq had prompted many to wonder " why did n't anyone listen to what was said and the advice that was given " .
" ( There are ) occasions when people in the U.K. would wish that those in responsible positions in the U.S. might listen and learn from our experiences , " he said ,
He added that , after all , it was the Americans who had asked for advice : " It 's not as if we had been forcing that across the Atlantic . "
The prince 's comments were seen as a break with protocol in Britain , where tradition normally forbids members of the royal family from intervening in politics .
In Washington , a White House spokesman declined to comment on his criticism .
Prince Andrew served in the British navy for 22 years and was a helicopter pilot during the Falklands war with Argentina in 1982 in which more than 1,000 people were killed .
He described that experience as one that changed him " out of all recognition " and had given him a different view of life .
Now , as a full - time trade envoy for Britain , Andrew said he realised " the real people who are actually making the United Kingdom what it is are the people who are doing business " .

With the news yesterday that J. Craig Venter Institute scientists had built the first bacterial genome from the raw chemical components of DNA , we saw a host of science writers step up to contextualize the work and explain its significance .
Our own Carl Zimmer did an excellent job scaling down the announcement to fit within the grand narrative of science as discovery in his Dissection column , " Artificial Life ? Old News " :
" Creating a new living thing will just mean creating a new set of mysteries , " he wrote .
" To solve them , scientists will have to plod away with a vast number of experiments .
Only then will they get a deeper understanding of life . "
In Zimmer 's column , there is a purpose , a teleology , to the study of biology : " a deeper understanding of life . "
But for many synthetic biologists , that 's not the primary point of their work .
Synthetic biology is to biology what electrical engineering is to physics .
In the latter case , both fields involve electrons , but they do n't necessarily have the same goals and can't be measured with the same yardsticks .
Instead of asking , " What have you learned ? " or " What do we understand ? " we can ask " What have you made ? " and " How did you make it ? "
When I interviewed Tom Knight , one of the fathers of synthetic biology , about the international Genetically Engineered Machine ( iGEM ) competition , he encapsulated the difference between biologists and engineers with a joke :
The biologist goes into the laboratory in the morning and she discovers that the system she 's looking at is two times as complicated as she thought it was .
Great !
she says , I get to write a paper .
The engineer goes into the lab , gets the same result and says , " Damn .
How do I get rid of that ? "
One method of reducing complexity is to simply ignore it .
The approach is called " black boxing " and it 's common in many types of engineering .
A black box is a piece of a system that you view merely in terms of what goes in and what comes out .
If you drink five beers ( x ) , you know you will get drunk ( y ) .
You do n't have to know all the complexities of what the ethyl alcohol does to your brain , you just know , if X
then Y .
A perfect example of " black boxing " is the mechanism the yeast uses to stitch the four long strands of DNA that Venter 's team created into the completed genome .
A biologist would probably want to understand how that works .
An engineer would take it at face value and say , " Great .
Let 's use it . "
And that 's what they did .
Drew Endy , soon - to - be of Stanford , but a colleague of Knight 's at MIT and frequent Wired star , explains synthetic biology like this in a YouTube clip : " It 's an approach to engineering biology ... it 's not the particular application , it 's the method .
Synthetic biology is n't making a specific thing .
It 's how you make something . "
Zimmer asks of the discovery , " What does it teach us about life that we did n't know before ? "
But another way to look at Venter 's paper is on synthetic biology 's terms :
What did they make and how did they make it ?
On the first score , we should be impressed .
The combination of techniques yielded a bacterial genome from standard - issue DNA strands that you or I could order over the Internet .
But on the second question –how did they make it–others in the field seem less impressed .
Drew Endy again , this time from his Google News comment :
The technologies pioneered in Japan and at the Venter Institute for genome construction are relatively slow and expensive .
We still need to develop " one step "
genome construction methods in order to reduce the costs and turn time of genome construction .
Chris Voigt , my main source for our article , provided a beautiful image for why synthetic biologists are impressed but not awed by the new paper :
There 's this great computer in the MIT museum .
There 's this one computer sitting in there and it is the most intricate woven set of wires .
It looks like a rug almost but it was hand put together .
That represented the last point when one person could sit there with Radio
Shack components and build the best computer in the world ...
" That 's what you 're seeing in this paper , " he concluded .
In other words , we just witnessed the end of the beginning for biological engineering .
From here on out , as Voigt told me , the construction of genetically - engineered machines will require far more physically - engineered machines and tools .
So , Carl Zimmer and I share a lack of overwhelming excitement about this paper , but for different reasons .
For him , it 's about the science and the lack of new discovery .
For me , it 's about the engineering and the lack of a scalable process .
Handmade artificial life is n't going to form the basis of the next century of synthetic biology .
I 'm waiting for fast , cheap genome construction .
That will be news , even if it teaches us absolutely nothing about life , because it's how we 'll go from the biological equivalents of the ENIAC to the Mac .
" At the end of the 1800s ... basically , physics had told you everything that there was to know about electronics , " Knight said .
" What happened subsequently though , is that we had a century of invention which really was in some sense , not science , but engineering ...
My outlook is that this century will be dominated by the engineering that comes out of biology . "

On March 31 , 2007 at exactly 7:30 p.m. , Sydney Harbour was cast into darkness .
First the lights of the Harbour Bridge were turned off , followed by those of the famous Opera House , then the office buildings and restaurants along the city 's coastline .
Nearly a hundred McDonald 's restaurants dimmed their golden arches in a sign of environmental solidarity .
One by one , businesses , government departments and individuals pulled the plug for Earth Hour – a project aimed at bringing the issue of energy conservation and climate change to the fore .
The idea behind Sydney 's hour of darkness began as a joint effort between the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) and the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper .
Their goal was two - fold : to launch a year - long campaign to reduce Sydney 's greenhouse gas emissions by 5 per cent , and to find a way to bring the fight against climate change into every home .
" It had to be simple , " Andy Ridley , WWF co-ordinator of the global Earth Hour movement , said in a telephone interview from Sydney .
" We wanted to break out of the classic environmental audience and take it to the mainstream . "
They first approached the city with the idea , and then moved on to commercial businesses occupying the equivalent of 30 per cent of Australia 's office space .
Eventually , the whole city caught green fever , and ideas for participating in the hour of darkness began pouring in .
That spirit – and idea – has spread .
This year , at 8 p.m. on Saturday , March 29 , 17 cities in seven countries will take part in the first global Earth Hour .
Toronto was the first city outside Australia to join in .
" We wanted this to be a street party instead of a street protest , " Ridley says of last year 's inaugural event .
So , Sydneysiders dusted off their flashlights , stocked up on candles and got in the mood .
Couples held wedding receptions in candlelight ; restaurateurs fed hungry customers under the moonlight .
Thousands of families sat by the harbour watching the lights go out , and , thanks to the reduced light pollution , the stars as they began to reappear .
Stadiums dimmed their lights and sports fans watching games at home were reminded to turn off theirs .
Politicians , musicians and Hollywood actors helped with extensive media coverage counting down the weeks , days and seconds to the event .
In the minutes before darkness was to fall , Ridley held his breath .
" I could n't help be nervous , " he recalls .
" At 7:29 p.m , you just do n't know if it 's going to work , if it 's something people will think is important enough to do . "
It was .
More than 2 million residents pulled the plug and the city went dark .
Energy usage dropped by 10.2 per cent across the business district , more than double what organizers were aiming for , representing a reduction of 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide – the equivalent of taking 48,613 cars off the road for an hour .
" It was amazing , " Ridley says .
" These are the kinds of events that show how much spirit a city has , and I was impressed by Sydney's . "

WASHINGTON --
After delaying a domestic satellite - surveillance program for more than two months , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff expects to finalize a new charter for it this week , a move that attempts to quell civil - liberties concerns and get the program back on track .
Mr. Chertoff also plans soon to unveil a cyber - security strategy , part of an estimated $ 15 billion , multiyear program designed to protect the nation 's Internet infrastructure .
The program has been shrouded in secrecy for months and has also prompted privacy concerns on Capitol Hill because it involves government protection of domestic computer networks .
Both areas put Homeland Security in the middle of a public debate over domestic spy powers , kicked off by the revelation two years ago that the National Security Agency had been eavesdropping on some conversations in the U.S. without a warrant .
In the fall , the department put the satellite program on hold after an outcry on Capitol Hill .
Lawmakers have also asked Mr. Chertoff to delay the introduction of the cyber - security initiative .
" One lesson I 've learned is it 's not enough to say we know what we 're doing is going to be OK , " Mr. Chertoff said in an interview .
" We 've got to really make it clear to the public that we 're doing this , but we 're not doing that . "
The satellite program , which would be run by a new department branch called the National Applications Office , would expand the domestic use of satellite imagery by federal and local authorities .
Congress lashed out at the department when The Wall Street Journal reported plans for the program in August .
Mr. Chertoff suspended the program until legislators received more information .
The satellite - spy technology was originally developed to monitor activities and people outside the U.S .
Most anyone who pays attention to Web 2.0 news knows about the privacy face - plant caused by Facebook 's Beacon service .
However , it looks like the guys at Google may have missed it , given the brouhaha brewing over Google 's decision to open the doors to user 's Google Reader feeds .
The move seemed simple enough at the time : On December 14 , Google added a feature — enabled by default — intended to make it easier for users to share their Google Reader feeds with Gmail and Google Talk contacts .
Users already had the ability to setup feeds and share them with selected Google Reader contacts , but the new change extended access to those feeds to all of a user 's Gmail and GTalk contacts .
Many users feel the change is a privacy invasion , allowing contacts access to information they were never intended to see .
Angry complaints have pointed out the possibility of employers , children , and business contacts to discover embarrassing and potentially actionable content .

Nicolas Sarkozy 's ex-wife is this weekend to wed the millionaire lover she had an affair with while she was married to the French president , it emerged today .
Cecilia Ciganer - Albiniz , 50 , will marry PR guru Richard Attias in New York this Sunday .
Friends have described the wedding as " revenge " on her ex-husband for marrying Italian model Carla Bruni , 40 , just six weeks earlier .

One told French daily le Figaro : " She feels Sarkozy has embarrassed her by marrying a beautiful former model ten years her junior .
" Her wedding had been planned for this summer , but now seems to have been moved forward . "
The former French First Lady walked out on Sarkozy for a three - month fling with Moroccan - born Attias , 48 , in the summer of 2005 .
But she then dumped Attias and finally returned to Sarkozy 's side in the run-up to the French presidential elections last year , before they split up again and divorced last October .

Upstaged : Carla Bruni with President Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace
Cecilia 's wedding would a a " low - key , private affair " with 150 guests , glossy French magazine Point de Vue said .
It added : " The ceremony will take place at a secret city centre location , and be followed by a party .
" Guests will not be allowed to carry cameras , or phones with cameras , to protect their privacy .
" The happy couple will both be wearing Versace , and so apparently will many of the guests . "

The wedding comes after Cecilia admitted feeling humiliated that her ex-husband had married Miss Bruni just three months after their divorce .
She said in a recently published biography that she believed Sarkozy had wed the model - turned - singer on the " rebound " .
She also branded the president a " stingy womaniser " , and was said to have added : " Carla Bruni wo n't make him forget me in a hurry . "
Sarkozy fuelled the fire in December by giving Miss Bruni an identical engagement ring to the one he had given Cecilia 12 years earlier .
In January , Cecilia then sued a magazine for publishing pictures of her riddled with cellulite alongside images of the beautiful and unflawed Miss Bruni .
Another magazine then claimed Sarkozy had sent Cecilia a text message just a week before his wedding to Bruni reading : " If you come back , I 'll call everything off . "
Sarkozy denied sending the message and in a bid to quell the feud , Cecilia has now also denied receiving it .
The president this week dropped a lawsuit for libel after the journalist who wrote the story is said to have written a personal letter of apology to Bruni .
The stunning Italian heiress is now trying hard to adopt a more conservative poise befitting a First Lady of France after photos recently appeared of her posing in nothing but black leather thigh boots and a wedding ring .
She has now been pictured posing demurely ' at home ' at the Elysee Palace - but even those photos published by Italian magazine Oggi risk enraging Cecilia on the eve of her wedding day , with one shot showing the new First Lady grinning broadly as she perches seductively on the edge of her predecessor 's ornate Louis XVI style desk .
Mr Sarkozy and Ms Bruni are due in Britain next week , where they will be guests of the Queen and will spend the night in Windsor Castle .
Movitz : a Common Lisp x86 development platform
Most recent news
2008-02 -25 Frode V. Fjeld * movitz.asd : Created an ASDF system definition .
* movitz / asm.lisp , movitz/asm-x86.lisp : Created new assembler and disassembler that 's less overengineered ( the design goals of ia -x86 were not originally to serve as an assembler ) .
This speeds up compiles considerably ; on the order of twice as fast , and reduces the overall footprint of the movitz system too .
2008-01 -13 Frode Vatvedt Fjeld * movitz/losp/muerte/memref.lisp : Fixed ( setf memref - int : type :unsigned - byte32 ) , which did n't really work at all I think .
It would write to the wrong address , or go into unbounded recursion .
Introduction
The Movitz system aspires to be an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp that targets the ubiquitous x86 PC architecture " on the metal " .
That is , running without any operating system or other form of software environment .
Movitz is a development platform for operating system kernels , embedded , and single - purpose applications .
There can potentially be several completely different operating systems built using Movitz .

HETHEL , England – The Lotus 2 - Eleven is $ 80,000 of race car so singular in purpose and flawless in execution that it can make your grandmother look like Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton .
Almost .
I discovered this at the Lotus test track when I nearly grazed a cone taking a corner at 70 mph , then stood on the brakes with the next turn approaching at 120 .
Any other car would have punished me with a skid and a spin .
The 2 - Eleven shrugged it off , its traction control and anti-lock brakes making me look good as I took the turn at 50 .
Simply put , the 2 - Eleven is one of the best track cars money can buy .
Loud , fast and smooth , it 'll hang with all but the priciest German and Italian supercars without the nightmarish maintenance bills .
Lotus drew deep from its racing heritage with the 2 - Eleven , named for the gorgeous Lotus 11 of the late 1950s .
Its obsession with saving weight reaches insane levels here , and the 2 - Eleven weighs a scant 1,477 pounds .
The bodywork , made from monofilament fiberglass , accounts for just 80 .
The car does n't have anything that is n't absolutely necessary to make it accelerate , turn or stop .
Leather upholstery ?
Stereo ?
Headlights ?
Pfft .
The 2 - Eleven does n't even have doors .
It is designed for one thing only – circumnavigating a track in as little time as possible .
It 's not even street - legal in the U.S. , where it will arrive later this year with a $ 79,500 price tag .
A mere 1.8 liters is able to crank out 252 horsepower with the aid of a supercharger that pumps the engine with air .
High - powered cars in this class often have engines with twice the volume .
Photo : Bruce GainRace - spec hardware includes
Ohlins coil - over shocks with remote reservoirs , AP Racing brakes with Goodridge stainless steel lines and forged alloy wheels with Yokohama tires .
The suspension offers so much adjustment that Lotus includes directions for setting it up .
Glorious quantities of power flow from a 1.8 - liter supercharged Toyota engine with variable valve timing .
It 's good for 252 horsepower and a zero - to - 60 time of 3.8 seconds .
It 's quicker than a Porsche 911 GT3 RS and a tick or two slower than a Ferrari F430 .
The 2 - Eleven can keep up through the quarter mile ( 12.2 seconds ) , but the two cars easily outrun the 2 - Eleven 's top speed of 150 mph .
The bare - aluminum interior sports an SCCA - spec roll cage , six - point safety harness and a fire extinguisher .
There 's no windshield to speak of , so a full - face helmet is mandatory .
Do n't bother looking for paddle shifters behind the steering wheel , either .
You change the 2 - Eleven 's six gears with a lever between the seats , just as God and Colin Chapman intended .
Lotus says paddle shifters add dead weight and needless complication .
The company also downplays the level of technology in the 2 - Eleven , insisting that it focused more on aerodynamics and engine design than algorithms and sensors .
Do n't let that fool you .
Adjustable traction control limits slip from 7 percent to 100 percent ( at which point traction control is turned off entirely , and you 're on your own ) .
It 's never intrusive , and with the anti-lock brakes , you can confidently push the 2 - Eleven to its limits , assuming you 're good enough .
If you are n't , the 2 - Eleven will let you look like you are .
What the Tar Sands Need
Processing requires massive inputs of water , energy , land , labour
by Dru Oja Jay
The Dominion - http://www.dominionpaper.ca
Water
For each barrel of oil produced from the tar sands , between two and 4.5 barrels of water is needed .
The water is used in the process of extracting bitumen from the naturally occurring the tar sand .
The bitumen is later " upgraded " into synthetic crude oil .
In 2007 , the government of Alberta approved the withdrawal of 119.5 billion gallons of water for tar sands extraction , of which an estimated 82 per cent came from the Athabasca River .
Of that , extraction companies were only required to return 10 billion gallons to the river .
Most of the water used ends up in giant , toxic tailing ponds .
As of 2006 , tailing ponds covered 50 - square kilometers of former boreal forest .
By 2010 , according to the Oil Sands Tailings Research Facility , the industry will have generated 8 billion tons of waste sand and 1 billion cubic metres of waste water -- enough to fill 400,000 olympic - sized swimming pools .
Today , the largest human - made dam by volume of materials is the Syncrude tailing pond , a few kilometres from the Athabasca river .
The waste sand and water contain naphtha and paraffin , which are used in the extraction process , and oil leftovers like benzene , naphthenic acid and polyaromatic hydrocarbon , among others .
Chemicals found in the tailing ponds are known to cause liver problems and brain hemorrhaging in mammals , and deformities and death in birds .
It is difficult to estimate the volume of toxins that make their way into the Athabsca , but downstream communities like Fort Chipewyan have reported high occurrences of rare cancers , lupus , multiple sclerosis and other diseases in recent years .
Local fishermen have reported boils and deformities in fish .
One winter , an oil slick was discovered under the ice .
Syncrude later admitted that there had been a spill about 200 kilometres upstream .
The Athabasca also feeds Great Slave Lake , Deh Cho ( the Mackenzie River ) and vast northern watersheds .
Water from the Athabasca flows all the way to the Arctic Ocean , and plays an essential role in the lives of indigenous communities and vast areas of Boreal forest .
Energy
Between digging up the tar sand , separating out the bitumen , and subsequently upgrading it to synthetic heavy crude , the extraction process requires vast amounts of energy .
Because the tar sand and bitumen must be heated , about 1/ 6 of the energy provided by a barrel of oil is expended to extract one barrel of oil from tar sand .
Opponents of the tar sands say that burning a relatively clean fuel like natural gas to produce oil undermines any efforts to reduce climate - changing greenhouse gas emissions and transition to sustainable fuel sources .
According to estimates from the Pembina Institute , the tar sands will account for 25 per cent of Canada 's emissions by 2020 , if Kyoto targets are reached .
The vast amounts of natural gas needed to extract millions of barrels of oil per day are leading to an anticipated shortage of supply .
As a result , several energy megaprojects have been proposed .
Perhaps the most contentious of the proposals is the $ 7 billion Mackenzie Gas Project , a 1220 kilometre pipeline that runs along the Mackenzie River Valley , from the Arctic Ocean to Alberta 's northern border .
The project would connect the estimated 82 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Mackenzie River delta with the tar sands extraction plants to the south .
A second project , the Alaska Gas Pipeline would connect Alaska 's north slope , home to an estimated 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas , with the Mackenzie valley route .
In part to make up for the natural gas supply taken up by the tar sands , Liquid Natural Gas terminals have been proposed in multiple locations on the west coast , east coast and along the Saint Lawrence Seaway .
The terminals would receive natural gas from tankers incoming from the Middle East , Russia and other overseas sources .
Natural gas supply is still not enough to keep up with anticipated growth , leading industry to explore options such as nuclear power .
Alberta 's first nuclear power plant has been proposed in the town of Peace River , though it has faced some local opposition .
Much to the dismay of environmentalists , there is also discussion of building new coal - burning power plants into future tar sands upgrading facilities .
Labour
The Conference Board of Canada predicted in 2006 that Alberta would face a shortage of 332,000 workers by 2025 .
The figure has been dismissed as exaggerated ( it is based on the current rate of growth continuing unimpeded ) , but it seems to be an accurate reflection of the concern Alberta 's industrial sector has shown recently .
That tar sands require a massive influx of labour is not disputed .
Another estimate says that 20,000 new positions will be created in the tar sands over the next three years .
The signs of a labour shortage are already apparent in Alberta .
Workers from Newfoundland and the Maritimes are offered flights to and from Fort McMurray for the duration of their work term .
Grocery stores and fast food joints offer hourly wages in the double digits , and sometimes offer signing bonuses .
Increasingly , workers are brought in from countries like China and the Philippines .
In 2006 , Immigration Canada issued 15,172 new " temporary work permits " in Alberta , bringing the number of temporary workers to 22,392 .
Temporary workers differ from immigrants in that they have no access to immigration services , and can effectively be sent home .
According to some reports , the workers ' temporary status leaves the door open to abuse .
In one case , 12 men brought in by a trucking company were charged $ 500 per month to live in a three - bedroom bungalow .
The temporary foreign workers program has sparked a debate over the development of the tar sands .
" Most skilled workers would prefer to have 20 years of stable employment rather than seven or eight years of frantic development , " writes Gil McGowan of the Alberta Federation of Labour .
If the pace of development was slowed , he writes , the need for temporary foreign workers would diminish .
Currently , development is heading in the opposite direction , with plans to increase production fivefold in the next twenty years .
Regulations are being " streamlined , " and plans are in place to further increase the number of foreign workers .
Land
Open pit mining of tar sands , according to the Government of Alberta , involves " clearing trees and brush from a site and removing the overburden - the topsoil , muskeg , sand , clay and gravel - that sits atop the oil sands deposit . "
The " overburden " that is removed is up to 75 metres ( about 25 stories ) deep , and the underlying tar sands are typically between 40 and 60 metres deep .
After trees and brush are clearcut and either burned or sent to sawmills , the area is drained , and any local rivers are rerouted .
Giant trucks then remove soil , clay and sand to uncover the prized tar sands .
The sands are then removed and taken to plants to be processed .
In the end , an average of four tonnes of earth must be removed to render one barrel of oil .
In addition to tailing ponds ( see " Water " ) , vast amounts of waste sand are generated .
These sands , still containing traces of bitumen and other chemicals , are inhospitable to life .
Near Syncrude 's extraction plant , for example , a vast desert stretches over the horizon .
The expanse shows no signs of life , and carries the overpowering smell of asphalt .
The tar sands cover an estimated 141,000 - square kilometres , of which approximately 3,400 - square kilometres will be strip mined if currently - approved projects go forward .
Government regulations require the strip - mined land to be " reclaimed , " and returned to a " stable , biologically self - sustaining state . "
According to Syncrude 's web site , this means " productive capability at least equal to its condition before operations began . "
Syncrude envisions " a mosaic landscape dominated by productive forests , wetland areas alive with waterfowl and grasslands supporting grazing animals . "
So far , Suncor says it has reclaimed 858 hectares , accounting for less than 9 per cent of the land it has mined since 1967 .
Syncrude has mined 18,653 hectares , a little under a fifth of which it says it has reclaimed .
None of the land , however , has been officially certified as reclaimed by the government .
Both corporations have billboard advertisements in Fort McMurray proclaiming the success of their reclamation programs .
In the end , it is not clear that land will be fully reclaimed , and government agencies have been criticized as lax in enforcing regulations .

NAIROBI , Kenya , Nov. 30 — Hundreds of demonstrators in Khartoum , Sudan ’s capital , poured into the streets on Friday demanding the execution of a British teacher who was convicted of insulting Islam because her class of 7 - year - olds named a teddy bear Muhammad .
The protesters , some carrying swords , screamed , “ Shame , shame on the U.K. ! ” and , “ Kill her , kill her by firing squad . ”
They were calling for the death of Gillian Gibbons , the teacher who was sentenced Thursday to 15 days in jail .
Under Sudanese law , she could have spent six months behind bars and received 40 lashes .
Despite the display of outrage , witnesses said that many of the protesters were government employees ordered to demonstrate , and that aside from a large gathering outside the presidential palace , most of Khartoum was quiet .
Imams across the city brought up the case in sermons after Friday Prayer , but few of them urged violence .

CNN ’s Jack Cafferty Deplores Chris Dodd for Arguing Against Impeaching Bush
By Brent Baker
In the 7 pm EDT hour of Tuesday ’s The Situation Room on CNN , Jack Cafferty expressed disappointment in Democratic presidential candidate Chris Dodd for rejecting efforts to impeach President Bush because of how it would hurt Democratic chances in 2008 .
“ So , Senator Dodd is putting the election prospects of the Democratic Party next year ahead of whether or not President Bush might be guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors of a kind which would mandate his removal from office , ” Cafferty lamented .
He noted that “ Congress ’s job is oversight of the executive branch ” and then , he sniffed , with a disapproving shake of his head : “ Unless , of course , that oversight interferes with getting elected . ”
Cafferty soon reiterated his displeasure with the liberal Connecticut Senator : “ It ’s a pretty amazing statement to come out of Senator Dodd ’s mouth . ”

Florida policewoman
Tasers female shopper for yelling at her
A police officer used a stun gun to subdue a woman who yelled at her in a crowded electronics store , and prosecutors are reviewing whether to pursue charges against the customer .
While Elizabeth Beeland was trying to purchase a CD player at a Best Buy on Nov. 26 , she stepped outside to talk on her phone , leaving her credit card .
Concerned about the sudden exit , a store clerk suspected Beeland was using a stolen card and called over a police officer .
Officer Claudia
Wright wrote in a police report that when she approached , Beeland became " verbally profane , abusive , loud and irate . "
She said she warned Beeland to calm down or face arrest .
In a video , Beeland is seen backing away and avoiding Wright , then crumpling to the ground after being hit with the Taser .
Wright was not disciplined , and police Chief Mike Chitwood defended her actions .
Beeland was refusing an officer 's orders , and using a Taser avoided use of other weapons , he said .
Police verified Beeland , 35 , was using her own credit card , but she was arrested on two misdemeanors , disorderly conduct and resisting a police officer without violence .
She has since pleaded not guilty , and state prosecutors are reviewing whether to pursue the case .
Beeland 's attorney William Chanfrau Jr. said he is reviewing the encounter and declined further comment .
The Daytona Beach News - Journal reported Friday that Daytona Beach police used a Taser 10 times in November , but Beeland was the only person stunned who was n't acting violently or fleeing .
Amnesty International and American Civil Liberties Union representatives criticized the use of a Taser on Beeland , saying yelling at an officer is not illegal and other methods could have been used .
Fox News interviewed Daytona Police Chief Mike Chitwood , who defended his officer 's actions , but said that the incident was being investigated .
He also admitted the woman never threatened the police officer , but the " force continuum " allows for stunning if " their actions force the officer to use physical maneuvers to establish control . "
Chitwood said that the woman was n't complying to demands from an officer and called it " passive physical resistance . "
" Absolutely , " Chitwood said when asked if his officer did the right thing but he added that it was " not a good incident , " regardless .
( with wire reports )
This video is from Fox 's Fox News Live , broadcast on December 21 , 2007 .
Mr. Blevins , 45 , said there were plenty of families like his still living in Camden , working people with no connections to the drug trade .
But even his family has been touched by the violence :
In July , his granddaughter ’s aunt was shot and killed outside a Camden bar .
Image Raymond Morales , 35 , is testifying in federal court .
Credit ... Jessica Kourkounis for The New York Times
“ She was No. 12 , ” said the granddaughter , Da’Ja Cooksey , 8 , as she finished her homework at the dining room table .
Da’Ja ’s mother , Joya Kilcrest , corrected her :
In fact , it was the 14th murder of that year .
“ I ’ve steered plenty of kids away from drugs , ” said Mr. Blevins , who has pulmonary fibrosis and often stays home , wired to an oxygen tank .
“ And I ’ve gone to a lot of funerals . ”
Mr. Blevins is one of many people in the city following the trial of Mr. Morales , who pleaded guilty in 2005 to ordering six killings , running a drug operation and tampering with witnesses .
In court , he spoke of the magnitude of his decision to cooperate with the authorities , which led to scores of other arrests .
“ I broke the code I lived and breathed , ” he said .
A cocaine retailer and wholesaler , Mr. Morales explained how he took a great deal of care to maintain his empire .
He met associates in person , always changing the location , and kept his phone conversations short .
Twice , cameras that the authorities had trained on Mr. Morales and his associates were disabled , the wires feeding them cut .
He made millions selling cocaine delivered by couriers from Arizona and New York .
He could make $ 1,000 profit on a kilogram of cocaine , he testified , and his corner operation , run by a manager , could gross up to $ 7,500 a day .
All this went to his operating costs : houses for his wife and girlfriends , prostitutes and other , grimmer expenses .
Here on the " we will disclose everything " forum it occurred to me that a much underdiscussed topic is that of " attempting to urinate while you have an erection . "
And when I say this is a big problem for * man * kind you 'll know I 'm being PC
There will be more than one occassion when the male of the species will wake up with a raging hard - on .
This in itself is not of too much concern , but when your bladder is screaming at you for instant relief , that trek to the toilet can be filled with a mixture of expectation , racing thoughts , fear and dread .
Those that are not initiated to the concept may think " Hey big deal .. it still comes out no problem " , but let me throw one very serious word your way .. " angles " .
An erect penis would not be problem in these circumstances if toilets were mounted on the wall and bathrooms were fitted with anti-gravity devices .
If you have experienced this angle problem you 'll probably have considered sending a letter to your old math teacher about updating the curriculum with some more practical real world examples .
Put simply , any attempt to urinate at an angle below the horizontal cuts off the waterworks instantly ( Geez , I hope other people are experiencing this or I am going to look mighty wierd out here in nodeland ) .
This problem can cause you to attempt some far - out contortions and do some really dumb things .
The pinnacle of these dumb ideas can be attempting to place your body horizontal to the floor AND 3 feet above the ground at the same time .
Of course that is impossible and it usually leads to a gradual progression from leaning over , to leaning over the toilet , to a full on tilt action with hand over cistern and legs splayed out like some sort of squashed spider .
Do n't even consider drunk , erect and busting to go .
That can end in some serious toilet carnage as you fall and get wedged between the toilet bowl and the wall , looking like some hideous mutant toilet turtle with an out of place erect penis .
The second dumb idea is attempting to urinate at range .
I do n't know about you but two factors come into play here - accuracy and water pressure .
The intense need to urinate can dampen even the most accurate of sharp shooters and in case you have n't noticed ( despite prayers that it would ) urine does not exit the penis at your standard car 's tyre pressure .
At first it might be a dribble or a perhaps an ever increasing arc .
The outcome naturally is a nice puddle leading up to the toilet .
That is something not appreciated by your significant other .
The other option is to wait it out like a good bladder soldier .
Sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't .
But be warned ...
I am pretty sure there are men out there that have been walking around for years with an erectic penis waiting for it to go down .
There seems to be some biological infinite loop where a full bladder reinforces penis erection and so on .
Also be warned - PLAYING WITH IT WILL NOT MAKE IT GO AWAY !
except for some of the freaks out there .
If you are lucky the erection will subside in due course before you explode in a massive spray of urine , mangled flesh and blood .
This might be a good time for nature lovers to dash outside and pretend that no one else can see them urinating in their backyard with an erect penis .
The rest of the global economy may be experiencing a credit crunch , but not China , where easy credit has fueled a spectacular run-up in real estate prices and stock markets .
Despite a cascade of State Council decrees restricting bank lending this year and a high - profile Politburo meeting in November that focused on the risk of inflation , bank lending last month grew by over 800 billion renminbi ( $ 112 billion ) -- equivalent to 22 % of the total loan quota that Beijing 's technocrats meted out to state - owned banks for 2008 .
This rate of credit expansion is similar to the rate last seen in the second quarter of last year , when China 's economy grew by nearly 12 % from a year earlier .
And it comes just as the Party is trying to ratchet down inflation , which in January hit 7.1 % year - on - year on consumer prices .
Technical factors do n't fully explain why the monetary base grew with such fervor in January .
The lunar new year holiday took place earlier this year than usual , driving up demand for cash .
However , new year cash spending usually means withdrawing one 's savings , not borrowing from banks .
A severe winter snow storm forced the central government to release tens of billions of renminbi in funds to pay for emergency spending .
But this amount would be a blip in the Chinese monetary landscape , which runs into the trillions of renminbi in a given quarter .
More convincingly , major borrowers are pressuring banks to lend out as much of the credit quota as possible .
Companies want to take advantage of low real interest rates and lock in cheap cash for the remainder of the year .
Although large firms , many of which are powerful state - owned entities , are undoubtedly exerting pressure on banks , State Council loan ceilings precisely seek to minimize the effect of firm pressure by coordinating all banks simultaneously to cut back on lending .
However , bankers called the technocrats ' bluff and proceeded to lend with gusto .
In effect , they are daring Beijing technocrats to enforce the credit ceiling and risk a widespread liquidity shortage in the latter part of the year .
This is an unusual game of chicken .
China 's major banks , all of which are majority state - owned and run by managers appointed by the Communist Party , are simply ignoring decrees issued by the highest authorities .
In a state - dominated banking system , this is as unexpected as mid-level managers blatantly acting against the wishes of both the CEO and the board of directors .
Formally the technocrats have the full backing of the ruling Communist Party and can dismiss any banker at any time .
However , senior state bankers do not behave as if they take the threat of removal seriously .
They 've stared down such threats before , anyway -- in China , elite political discord has often compelled banks to disobey formal decrees .

In the world of top secret spy tech , there ’s sneaky cool and then there is sneeeaky cool .
This next item is set firmly in the second camp .
The US Air Force Research Lab ( AFRL ) is working on a tiny spy plane that has the ability to land on a standard power - line and siphon off energy to re-charge its battery .
What ’s even cooler is that they ’ll be able to transform to look like an ordinary piece of trash caught on the line .
The remote controlled planes have a wingspan of about three feet ( a meter to everyone else in the world ) and are expected to fly at ~ 46 miles per hour ( 74 km / h ) .
Upon landing on the wire for a recharge their wings would collapse and they ’d hang limply in the wind , blowing around like your typical cast - off shopping bag .
The idea is n’t without its challenges however .
Some experts fear that such a craft could spark shorts on the line , knocking out power for itself and potentially the entire surrounding neighborhood , to say nothing of how hard it ’ll be programming them to be able to flawlessly land on a wire half an inch in diameter .
The AFRL will be running test flights in 2008 , so keep on the lookout for strange , potentially sparking shopping bags with camera eyes fluttering on power lines anytime after ’09 .
Big Brother is watching .

Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity is many things : a mystery , a science fiction epic , a tale of the downtrodden rising up against a cruel master , and . . . boobies .
Yes , lots and lots of boobies .
Boobies in bras , boobies with robots in the background , boobies in pirate castles on remote planets .
Basically , here 's the deal : two hot ladies ( with boobies ) escape from a slave planet , steal a ship ( while wearing teeny outfits that show their boobies ) , then crash land on another planet controlled by a psycho guy who gives them awesome , see - through , boobie - revealing outfits .
Then it turns out he 's mean and they have to escape — hopefully with boobies intact !
In this clip , one of the ladies flirts with an android in her effort to escape the psycho .
For such a boob - heavy flick , there are an awful lot of scenes full of the bad guy talking and the women making plans to escape , which is one of the things that 's perennially annoying about B - movies where really , let 's face it , we 're in it for visuals .
Luckily in this scene , the psycho has shut his pie hole and is using his robot slave to get some boobies .
I am probably going to some special hell for bloggers for thinking this scene is actually kind of hot .

SAN FRANCISCO 
A group led by a Princeton University computer security researcher has developed a simple method to steal encrypted information stored on computer hard disks .
The technique , which could undermine security software protecting critical data on computers , is as easy as chilling a computer memory chip with a blast of frigid air from a can of dust remover .
Encryption software is widely used by companies and government agencies , notably in portable computers that are especially susceptible to theft .
The development , which was described on the group ’s Web site Thursday , could also have implications for the protection of encrypted personal data from prosecutors .
The move , which cannot be carried out remotely , exploits a little - known vulnerability of the dynamic random access , or DRAM , chip .
Those chips temporarily hold data , including the keys to modern data - scrambling algorithms .
When the computer ’s electrical power is shut off , the data , including the keys , is supposed to disappear .
Limbo is a term I use but VCS authors do n’t .
However , that ’s because they tend to ignore a certain state that exists in all major VCSes ( and give it no name because they tend to ignore it ) despite the fact that this state seems to be the largest source of errors .
I call this state limbo .
How to make git behave like other VCSes
Most potential git users probably do n’t want to read this whole page , and would like their knowledge from usage of other VCSes to apply without learning how the index and limbo are different in git than their previous VCS ( despite the really cool extra functionality it brings ) .
This can be done by
Always using git diff HEAD instead of git diff
instead of git diff and Always using git commit - a instead of git commit
Either make sure you always remember those extra arguments , or come back and read this page when you get a nasty surprise .
The concept of Limbo
VCS users are accustomed to thinking of using their VCS in terms of two states — a working copy where local changes are made , and the repository where the changes are saved .
However , the working copy is split into three sets ( see also VCS concepts ) :
( explicitly ) ignored — files inside your working copy that you explicitly told the VCS system to not track
— files inside your working copy that you explicitly told the VCS system to not track index — the content in your working copy that you asked the VCS to track ; this is the portion of your working copy that will be saved when you commit ( in CVS , this is done using the CVS / Entries files )
— the content in your working copy that you asked the VCS to track ; this is the portion of your working copy that will be saved when you commit ( in CVS , this is done using the CVS / Entries files ) limbo — not explicitly ignored , and not explicitly added .
This is stuff in your working copy that wo n’t be checked in when you commit but you have n’t told the VCS to ignore , which typically includes newly created files .
The first state is identical across all major VCSes .
The second two states are identical across cvs , svn , bzr , hg , and likely others .
But git splits the index and limbo differently .
One could imagine a VCS which just automatically saves all changes that are n’t in an explicitly ignored file ( including newly created files ) whenever a developer commits , i.e. a VCS where there is no limbo state .
None of the major VCSes do this , however .
There are various rationales for the existence of limbo : maybe developers are too lazy to add new files to the ignored list , perhaps they are unaware of some autogenerated files , or perhaps the VCS only has one ignore list and developers want to share it but not include their own temporary files in such a shared list .
Whatever the reason , limbo is there in all major VCSes .
Changes in limbo are a large source of user error
The problem with limbo is that changes in this state are , in my experience , the cause of the most errors with users .
If you create a new file and forget to explicitly add it , then it wo n’t be included in your commit ( happens with all the major VCSes ) .
Naturally , even those familiar with their VCS forget to do that from time to time .
This always seems to happen when other changes were committed that depend on the new files , and it always happens just before the relevant developers go on vacation … leaving things in a broken state for me to deal with .
( And sure , I return the favor on occasion when I simply forget to add new files . )
A powerful feature of git
Unlike other VCSes , git only commits what you explicitly tell it to .
This means that without taking additional steps , the command “ git commit ” will commit nothing ( in this particular case it typically complains that there ’s nothing to commit and aborts ) .
git also gives you a lot of fine - grained control over what to commit , more than most other VCSes .
In particular , you can mark all the changes of a given file for subsequent committing , but unlike other VCSes this only means that you are marking the current contents of that file for commit ; any further changes to the same file will not be included in subsequent commits unless separately added .
Additionally , recent versions of git allow the developer to mark subsets of changes in an existing file for commit ( pulling a handy feature from darcs ) .
The power of this fine - grained choose - what - to - commit functionality is made possible due to the fact that git enables you to generate three different kinds of diffs : ( 1 ) just the changes marked for commit ( git diff –cached ) , ( 2 ) just the changes you ’ve made to files beyond what has been marked for commit ( git diff ) , or ( 3 ) all the changes since the last commit ( git diff HEAD ) .
This fine - grained control can come in handy in a variety of special cases :
When doing conflict resolution from large merges ( or even just reviewing a largish patch from a new contributor ) , hunks of changes can be categorized into known - to - be - good and still - needs - review subsets .
It makes it easier to keep “ dirty ” changes in your working copy for a long time without committing them .
When adding a feature or refactoring ( or otherwise making changes to several different sections of the code ) , you can mark some changes as known - to - be - good and then continue making further changes or even adding temporary debugging snippets .
These are features that would have helped me considerably in some GNOME development tasks I ’ve done in the past .
How git is more problematic
This decision to only commit changes that are explicitly added , and doing so at content boundaries rather than file boundaries , amounts to a shift in the boundary between the index and limbo .
With limbo being much larger in git , there is also more room for user error .
In particular , while this allows for a powerful feature in git noted above , it also comes with some nasty gotchas in common use cases as can be seen in the following scenarios :
Only new files included in the commit Edit bar Create foo Run git add foo Run git commit
In this set of steps , users of other VCSes will be surprised that after step 4 the changes to bar were not included in the commit .
git only commits changes when explicitly asked .
( This can be avoided by either running git add bar before committing , or running git commit - a .
The - a flag to commit means “ Act like other VCSes — commit all changes in any files included in the previous commit ” . )
Missing changes in the commit Create / edit the file foo Run git add foo Edit foo some more Run git commit
In this set of steps , users of other VCSes will be surprised that after step 4 the version of foo that was commited was the version that existed at the time step 2 was run ; not the version that existed when step 4 was run .
That ’s because step 2 is translated to mean mark the changes currently in the file foo for commit .
( This can be avoided by running git add foo again before committing , or running git commit - a for step 4 . )
Missing edits in the generated patch Edit the tracked file foo Run git add foo Edit foo some more Run git diff
In this set of steps , users of other VCSes will be surprised that at step 4 they only get a list of changes to foo made in step 3 .
To get a list of changes to foo made since the last commit , run git diff HEAD instead .
Missing file in the generated patch Create a new file called foo Run git add foo Run git diff
In this set of steps , users of other VCSes will be surprised that at step 3 the file foo is not included in the diff ( unless changes have been made to foo since step 2 , but then only those additional changes will be shown ) .
To get foo included in the diff , run git diff HEAD instead .
These gotchas are there in addition to the standard gotcha exhibited in all the major VCSes :
How all the major VCSes are problematic
Missing file in the commit Edit bar Create a new file called foo Run vcs commit ( where vcs is cvs , svn , hg , bzr…see below about git )
In this set of steps , the edits in step 1 will be included in the commit , but the file foo will not be .
The user must first run vcs add foo ( again , replacing vcs with the relevant VCS being used ) before committing in order to get foo included in the commit .
It turns out that git actually can help the user in this case due to its default to only commit what it is explicitly told to commit ; meaning that in this case it wo n’t commit anything and tell the user that it was n’t told to commit anything .
However , since nearly every tutorial on git [ *] says to use git commit - a , users include that flag most the time ( 60 % of the time ?
98 % ? ) .
Due to that training , they ’ll still get this nasty bug .
However , they ’re going to forget or neglect this flag sometimes , so they also get the new gotchas above .
[ *]
Recent versions of the official git tutorial being the only exception I ’ve run across .
It ’s fairly thorough ( make sure to also read part two ) , though it is n’t quite as explicit about the potential gotchas in certain situations .
How bzr , hg , and git mitigate these gotchas ( and cvs and svn do n’t )
These gotchas can be avoided by always running vcs status ( again , replace vcs with the relevant VCS being used ) and looking closely at the states the VCS lists files in .
It turns out bzr , hg , and git are smart here and try to help the user avoid problems by showing the output of the status command when running a plain vcs commit ( at the end of the commit message they are given to edit ) .
This helps , but is n’t foolproof ; I ’ve somehow glossed over this extra bit of info in the past and still been bit .
Also , I ’ll often either use the -m flag to specify the commit message on the command line ( for tiny personal projects ) or a flag to specify taking the commit message from a file ( i.e. using - F in most vcses , - l in hg ) .
watching everything
Counterterrorism “ tsar ” Richard Clarke says that , on 9/11 , the Secret Service had “ a system that allowed them to see what FAA ’s radar was seeing . ” ( Page 7 )
Barbara Riggs , a future deputy director of the Secret Service who was in its Washington , DC headquarters on 9/11 , says that the Secret Service was “ monitoring radar ” during the attacks ( see also Star - Gazette 6/5/2006 )
The official story of 9/11 is that the FAA delayed notifying the military about the hijackings .
That false statement has been debunked elsewhere .
However , even if the FAA for some reason had not notified the military , it does n't matter .
Why ?
Because the Secret Service -- which is in contact with the President and Vice President at all times -- wasthe FAA was watching on their radar :
So even if the FAA never even lifted a finger to inform the military of the hijacked airplanes , the Secret Service would have seen the same thing with their own eyes , and the President , Vice President , and the military would immediately have been informed of what was happening .

Sweet Jesus , I get a headache from watching Bill O'Reilly .
How many hack arguments can you make in a single segment ?
In their discussion of the Elliot Spitzer escort scandal , Billo and guest Laura Ingraham employ a kitchen sink , scorched earth strategy to blame European values , left wing loons , the internet , and anything else within reach ( child molestation , STD rates among teenage girls , domestic violence among others ) for society today .
Truly dizzying intellect .
But do n't think that Billo is reveling in this ... it deeply disturbs him to have to show close ups of the escort service 's web page with scantily - clad models .
Really .
But he does it because it's his responsibility to educate his viewers .
INGRAHAM : At some point , I think we all become complicit in this , and we all have a role in amplifying all of this stuff …
O’REILLY : See , I disagree with you on that .
We disagree about the role of the media .
My role is to educate the people on what ’s happening , why it ’s happening , who ’s involved in it , whether the government should intervene , and you know , we do n’t exploit the situation and I think if you watch the next segment coming up behind you , you ’ll see that .
INGRAHAM : Well , I ’ll be looking forward to watching … but I think …
O’REILLY : Look , we ’re not …we ’re not reveling in this .
I said right at the top .
INGRAHAM : Are you telling me that cable news is not reveling in this ?
O’REILLY : I ’m telling you that The Factor reveling in it .
I hate this story , I hate it .
All right ?
I do n’t like to see Gov.
Spitzer or his family torn to pieces and I do n’t like to see people delighting in it .
I think that ’s terrible , but it ’s happening .
But on the other hand you have to report the fact that here 's a sitting governor , he did it , it 's easy to do ...
Twitter で 「 OSD って不自由だよね」みたいな会話をちょっとしたので、(それとは関係なく)自分がリリースするソフトウェアにGPLを採用している主観的な理由を書いておこうと思った。
自作のソフトウェアをオープンソースソフトウェア(ないしはフリーソフトウェア)として配布しようとして、OSDを参照すると、けっこうさまざまな制約が課せられていることに気づいて、「なんだ、けっこう不自由だな」と感じてしまうのはよくあることだ。これは、そもそもOSDが謳う「自由」の主体が作者ではないことに思い至らないことに起因している。
作者にとって最大限の自由をもたらず配布形態は(いろいろと別の問題を抱えはするものの)public domainなわけで、そこにさまざまな条件を加えたOSD準拠のライセンスを選択することはなんらかの不自由を呑むことに他ならない。じゃあ、OSDが謳う「自由」は誰のための自由かと言えば、利用者のための「自由」だ。自由の主体を利用者に置くために、作者には「あれをしちゃダメ、これをしちゃダメ」とさまざまな制約がつけられている。
ここまではよい。自分もFOSSの利用者としてはその自由を享受する立場にあるわけで、自作のソフトウェアを公開するにあたり、同じ自由を利用者に分け与えるのはやぶさかではない。
では、数あるOSD準拠ライセンスの中から、なぜGPLを選択するのかと言えば、GPLにおける自由の主体は、実は利用者ですらないと考えているからだ(おれが ) 。
GPL の最大の特徴といえば、やはり改変したソフトウェアも同じGPLで配布しなければならないという、いわゆる「汚染」条文にある。これをもって最大の不自由と考え、GPLを採用しないプロジェクトはけっこう多いように見受けられる。たしかにこれは、よりによって利用者の自由を制限しているわけで、他のOSD準拠ライセンスとは一線を画している 。
しかしこれは、利用者でない何かに最大の自由を与えるために設けられているのだと考える(おれが ) 。
その「何か」とはつまり、ソースコードそのものだ。この条文があるからこそ、ソースコードは利用者の勝手な裁量から離れ、真の自由を手に入れる。被創造物が、造物主のくびきから逃れるイメージを思い浮かべていただきたい。絵心があれば、ここらあたりでソースコードちゃんの擬人化でもやってるところである。
この、人ならざるものに対して最大の便宜を与えるために、造物主である人間の自由さえも制限するという、ある種の本末転倒さに、自分はもっとも魂を揺すぶられたので 、もう、GPL以外のライセンスを採用することなど思い浮かびもしないのである。こんなぶっ飛んだライセンスを考え付ける人間ってすごい。RMSスゲーよ。←このあたりが「主観的」たる理由。
以後、人から「 tDiaryはなんでGPLなんですか」とか聞かれたらここを読んでもらうことにする。ちなみに客観的な理由は特にない。実は「いろいろ選ぶのが面倒だったから」という……ってこれも主観か。

4年近く前にほとんど同じことを書いていたことに気づいた。あっちはCCライセンスについての話だけど。
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) just turned five years old .
It seems like it was born just yesterday .
The department ’s growing pains have made it a slow learner and a downright ugly child .
Born in an atmosphere of tension and fear , and cobbled together from pieces of other government departments and agencies , the prospects for this Frankenstein offspring were always dim .
Yet , as Congress frequently does in times of crisis , the legislative body , in the wake of 9/11 , had to be seen as doing something  anything  to respond to the crisis , even if its actions were ineffective and even counterproductive .
And predictably , the Department of Homeland Security has been a disaster .
In the wake of the federal government ’s failure to prevent or stop 9/11  when the principal problem was the failure of large , slothful security agencies to coordinate against a small , agile terrorist group  the last thing the country needed was another ponderous department .
Yet Congress glued together 22 disparate agencies , superimposed another layer of bureaucracy on top of them to manage the new department , astronomically increased the department ’s budget to $ 38 billion per year and its personnel from 170,000 to 208,000 employees , and oversaw the department ’s activities with 86 congressional committees and subcommittees .
In creating more bureaucracy to coordinate , Congress never told the American people exactly how security against nimble , non-bureaucratic terrorist groups would be enhanced .
In fact , over its five years , the department has become the butt of jokes for its color - coded terror warning system , grossly incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina , pork - barrel spending , intrusive and largely ineffectual airline security , and expensive security projects gone awry .
Throughout its history , the color - coded warning system seems to just toggle between the mid-levels , orange and yellow , leading to suspicion that it is designed as merely for show , to demonstrate to the American public that their government is ever vigilant against terrorists .
Setting the dial at red would cause everyone to stay locked down in their homes  afraid to go to the shopping mall to buoy the faltering economy .
If the government were to move the indicator to blue or green and a terrorist attack occurred , fingers would be pointed at DHS for sleeping as the threat worsened .
So the indicator stays between orange and yellow , even though the department has not made clear what the public should do at any of the levels .
Most politically damaging to DHS was its abysmal and incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina .
Yet many members of Congress became " disgusted " with the department ’s response in New Orleans at the same time they were sending DHS money elsewhere to their own states and congressional districts for useless pork - barrel projects .
Much of DHS spending still spreads the pork to cities and states around the country to help the reelection chances of politicians , rather than sending money to cities that might actually have a remote chance of being hit by a terrorist attack ( for example , New York and Washington ) .
Politics has also been involved in security for air travel .
Even if the federal government had done nothing , air security would have improved dramatically after Sept. 11 .
Prior to 9/11 , airline crewmembers and passengers had been encouraged to cooperate with any airplane hijackers .
In many hijackings over the years , a familiar pattern had emerged , wherein the hijackers would at worst shoot a couple of passengers to show they meant business and order the plane to Cuba or some other remote location .
The hijackers ’ purpose was to draw attention to their cause , and if the crew and passengers played ball , most could expect to live .
That paradigm changed drastically on 9/11 .
On the fourth plane , apparently the passengers and crew realized that they were being forcibly recruited for a suicide mission that would end not only all of their lives , but potentially those of many more people in any building the plane would hit .
Heroically , they evidently got nasty with the terrorists and foiled the hijacking attempt .
Later , a similarly surly crew and passengers famously foiled an attempt by Richard Reid to set his explosive shoes on fire .
With far more aggressive passengers and crew  having visions of dying in a mass suicidal bombing mission  pity ( not really ) the terrorists who try to take over or destroy a plane in a post - 9/11 world .
If this monumental security improvement , which DHS had nothing to do with , was not enough , the department probably could have stopped once it had hardened cockpit doors .
Federalizing airport security checkpoints , making passengers partially disrobe and requiring them to throw away liquid toiletries , provides only marginal security improvement but much passenger frustration .
Despite such security " enhancements , " repeated investigative studies have shown that alarming amounts of contraband still get through the checkpoints undetected .
DHS overinvests in such checkpoint measures because many voters fly and thus are reminded that their government is taking very visible actions ( however annoying ) to make them safe .
In contrast , less money is spent , for example , on the security of air cargo , ports , or chemical plants , because few voters visit air cargo terminals ( or even the baggage compartment of their own plane ) , the dock where their new Toyota is being delivered , or the factories where the petrochemical ingredients of many consumer products are made .
Once again , DHS ’ priorities are based more on politics than on actual threats .
Finally , the DHS bureaucracy has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars by blowing the development and purchase of many new high - tech security systems .
Even with the excessive emphasis on air security , the department has projected that it could require $ 22 billion and 16 more years to deploy advanced systems for screening airline baggage , and has been inept at fielding new " puffer devices , " which blow air on passengers to detect explosives , according to the Washington Post .
At the ports and borders , DHS is also struggling .
Granted , the congressional demand that all inbound shipping containers be scanned is unrealistic , unnecessary , and ridiculous , but Congress was reacting to DHS ’ having put port security on the back burner .
In addition , DHS has proven incompetent in fielding equipment to detect nuclear devices .
At the borders , despite prescient warnings by outside experts , the expensive " virtual " border fence of sensors was so poorly designed that DHS had to pay the contractor to start over , and the first phase of the project may not be completed until 2011 .
Finally , the project to track the entry and exit of foreign visitors using photos and fingerprints has been scrapped indefinitely ( on the exit side ) because of its excessive cost and technological difficulties .
Thus , at the age of five , DHS has all the bureaucratic sclerosis of an octogenarian and is on the road to juvenile delinquency .
On the morning of March 11 , 2005 , Brian Nichols embarked on one of the most notorious crime sprees in recent American history .
Nichols , a thirty - three - year - old African - American , was being retried on rape charges in Atlanta and was in custody at the Fulton County Courthouse , where his first trial had ended in a hung jury .
In a holding cell on the eighth floor , where he was changing into the street clothes that he was to wear in court , he overpowered a sheriff ’s deputy and stole her gun .
Then Nichols entered the courtroom and shot and killed Judge Rowland Barnes as well as the court reporter , Julie Ann Brandau , before escaping down a stairwell .
On the sidewalk outside the building , he shot and killed another deputy sheriff , Hoyt Teasley .
A multiple - murder case illustrates a paradox in death - penalty law .
GUY BILLOUT
Nichols immediately became the object of a frenzied manhunt in the Atlanta area .
Over the next few hours , he hijacked as many as five cars and , apparently while looking for shelter , murdered a federal agent , David Wilhelm .
Finally , Nichols took as hostage a woman named Ashley Smith and held her in her apartment in the suburb of Duluth for seven hours , until she persuaded him to surrender to the authorities .
Paul L. Howard , Jr. , the district attorney of Fulton County , announced that he would seek the death penalty against Nichols .
The case appeared to be open - and - shut : the first two murders , of the Judge and the court reporter , took place in front of several witnesses , and Nichols confessed to all four of the killings in statements to police .
But almost three years later the case has stalled , caught in a bitter dispute over funding for Nichols ’s defense team , which has so far been paid about $ 1.2 million by the state of Georgia .
The state agency responsible for indigent defense has run out of money , and other cases are at risk of being delayed or derailed .
Jury selection in Nichols ’s trial , which began more than a year ago , has not been , and may never be , completed .
The prosecutor has petitioned , so far unsuccessfully , to have the trial judge removed from the case and to change the defense team .
During a recent hearing , the judge , Hilton Fuller , implored members of the public to “ write me an anonymous letter ” with suggestions about how to bring the case to trial .
Some Georgia legislators , furious about the delays , have advocated impeaching Judge Fuller .
The Nichols case illustrates a troubling paradox in death - penalty jurisprudence : the more heinous a crime — and the more incontrovertible the evidence of a defendant ’s guilt — the greater the cost of the defense may be .
Death - penalty trials require juries not only to determine whether the defendant is guilty but also to make other complex moral judgments — why a defendant committed a crime , whether he is likely to do so again , what punishment fits the crime .
Defendants are entitled to often costly expert assistance , including the services of psychiatrists , as they prepare their cases .
Yet spending large sums of public money on the defense of capital cases is politically incendiary , and in Georgia the consequences may be cataclysmic .
According to Stephen B. Bright , the senior counsel for the Southern Center for Human Rights , in Atlanta , “ We are just now starting to see the ripple effect of Nichols .
The question now is whether the whole thing is going to come crashing down . ”
In 1963 , the Supreme Court ruled , in Gideon v. Wainwright , that indigent criminal defendants must be provided with lawyers free of charge .
But the Court allowed local officials to decide whether to establish full - time staffs of defense lawyers for the poor or to assign private lawyers on a case - by - case basis , as well as to determine how much the government should pay for them .
Until 2005 , Georgia , like many states , lacked a coherent plan for providing attorneys .
“ Georgia has a hundred and fifty - nine counties , and each one had a different system of hiring lawyers for the poor , ” Bright told me .
For decades , Bright fought to change the system in Georgia and , over the years , developed the weary patience of a liberal in a conservative state .
He has led the small , tenuously financed Southern Center for Human Rights for twenty - six years , overseeing a staff of nine lawyers who fight against the death penalty and for improved prison conditions .
By the nineteen - nineties , the indigent - defense system , hobbled by cronyism , incompetence , and under - funding , had become an embarrassment for the state , and there was a broad consensus for reform .
In the spring of 2003 , the state legislature , with Bright ’s help , created public - defense offices for most of the state ’s forty - nine judicial circuits and a new agency , the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council , to oversee them .
An office in Atlanta , now known as the Georgia Capital Defenders , was established to provide attorneys , all trained in the intricacies of death - penalty law , for indigent defendants in capital cases .
In order to avoid the spectre of taxpayer money being used to pay for such an unpopular cause , the new law required that the defense lawyers ’ compensation be derived from fees assessed on plaintiffs in lawsuits and other participants in the court system .
The new regime went into effect on January 1 , 2005 .
Ten weeks later , Brian Nichols was taken to the holding cell near the courtroom to change his clothes .
Over three decades , Nichols ’s life took a steady , then precipitous , descent from middle - class respectability to incomprehensible violence .
He grew up in Baltimore , where his mother worked for the Internal Revenue Service and his father owned various small businesses .
In 2003 , Nichols ’s parents , who had retired , moved to Africa , and his mother , Claritha , took a job with the Tanzania Revenue Authority .
The couple were in Africa when they learned that their son had been charged with four murders .
Brian was a football player in high school , and his skills as a linebacker won him admission to Kutztown University , in rural Pennsylvania .
Nichols left during his sophomore year , after three arrests for minor charges , including disorderly conduct .
He eventually enrolled in Newberry College , in South Carolina , but was asked not to return to school when , two years later , he was charged with stealing audio equipment from a dorm room .
In 1995 , he moved to the Atlanta area , where again he got into trouble with the law : he was caught with marijuana and was on probation from 1996 to 1999 .
For a time , Nichols worked for UPS .
During his years in Atlanta , Nichols had a steady girlfriend , a corporate executive with an M.B.A. , who was as accomplished as Nichols was feckless .
At one point , Nichols lived with her in the suburb of Sandy Springs ; he drove a BMW that she gave him , and they worshipped together at a Word of God church in nearby Suwanee .
In April , 2004 , the couple broke up , but started dating again that summer .
Nichols had been seeing another woman , who became pregnant .
News of the pregnancy was apparently enough to persuade Nichols ’s girlfriend to end their relationship for good .
She began dating a minister at their church , which enraged Nichols .
On two occasions in August , he confronted the minister outside the woman ’s apartment .
After Nichols threatened to commit suicide , his ex-girlfriend sent his mother an e-mail , in which she wrote , “ Things between Brian and I are spiraling out of control . ”
Early on the morning of August 19th , Nichols again appeared at her apartment and , she later told police , raped her .
Nichols was arrested and held without bail .
His first trial , before Judge Barnes , began on February 21 , 2005 , and he testified in his own defense .
“ From a defense perspective he was a very good witness , ” Ash Joshi , the assistant district attorney who cross - examined Nichols , told me .
“ He would take my question and then turn toward the jury and give the answer , the way you would teach a witness to do it .
He was a charismatic individual . ”
Nichols acknowledged that he was upset about his ex-girlfriend ’s relationship with the minister .
“ There ’s a section of the Bible that talks about qualifications for a pastor , ” he testified .
“ It says that a pastor should be blameless , you know .
A person not covetous , merciful . ”
But the core of Nichols ’s defense was his claim that the sex had been consensual .
“ We ended up being intimate , ” Nichols told the court .
“ It was with her consent , you know , which is why we ’re here .
And , you know , let me say this : as a man , I ’ve never put my hands on a woman . ”
The jury could not agree on a verdict , splitting eight - to - four in favor of acquittal .
Judge Barnes ordered a retrial , which began on Monday , March 7th .
The prosecutors called more witnesses this time , and the government lawyers felt confident that they would win the case .
Nichols apparently agreed .
At the lunch break on Wednesday , March 9th , he told Joshi , “ You ’re doing a much better job this time . ”
That evening , sheriff ’s deputies found two shanks — thick pieces of metal — in Nichols ’s shoes , and the next morning Judge Barnes called the lawyers into his chambers to discuss the matter .
“ We all decided that at the time of the verdict there would be a great deal more security in the courtroom , ” Joshi said .
“ When that verdict comes out , the Judge said he wanted nothing on the defense table — no pens , no pencils , nothing he could use as a weapon .
But the sad part was we mistakenly thought that , once we got the shanks away from him , his plot had been foiled . ”
Most courts in Atlanta are housed in one of two buildings connected by sky bridges : the old Fulton County Courthouse , a Beaux Arts building dating from 1914 , and , directly behind it , the Justice Center Tower , which was completed in 1995 .
By 2005 , virtually all of the judges had moved to courtrooms in the tower , but Judge Barnes preferred the homier charms of the older building .
Barnes , who was sixty - four at the time of his death , was a popular judge , a bearded , genial man who had been on the bench since 1998 .
At 8:30 A.M. , on Friday , March 11th , an hour before Nichols ’s trial was to resume , Barnes heard a legal argument on a motion in a contract dispute .
Richard Robbins , a partner in a large Atlanta law firm , who had argued many cases before Judge Barnes , was representing the plaintiff .
“ As soon as he took the bench that morning , I could tell I was going to win — just the look on his face , ” Robbins told me .
One of the lawyers for the defendant spoke first .
“ She was going on and on , and I was watching the clock , ” Robbins recalled .
“ It was within a moment or two of nine .
She said I had argued a contrary position in an earlier case .
And Judge Barnes looked at me and smiled , and said , ‘ Wait a minute , you mean our Mr. Robbins ? ’
And he winked at me .
“ Then I heard a loud sound .
Nichols had come into the courtroom and shot the Judge and shot the court reporter , but I honestly do n’t have a memory of seeing him do that .
The first thing I have a memory of is seeing the Judge slump over .
I knew he was dead .
Then Nichols was standing right in front of me .
I remember thinking he was very nice - looking .
He looked like a law clerk , not the usual kind of thug you see around the courthouse .
And I remember thinking , He ’s going to kill the prosecutor , too , and I am at the prosecution table .
He had this totally calm , methodical look on his face .
There was no point in lying down or hiding .
I thought ,
He ’s going to shoot me next . ”
Almost three years later , Judge Barnes ’s courtroom remains a crime scene , its main door locked and shielded from view by a large folding screen .
Robbins took me to the hall to describe what happened next .
“ I ran straight ahead , right here , to one of the sky bridges to the new building , ” he said .
“ Nichols did n’t follow me , but turned left and went down the stairs .
As I was running in one direction , I saw a deputy running after Nichols to the stairs .
That was Hoyt Teasley , and Nichols killed him when they got to the sidewalk .
When I got to the new tower , I pushed through a locked security door like it was n’t even there .
After about an hour , I realized that I had broken my hand on it . ”
The response by law - enforcement officials to Nichols ’s crimes was marred by terrible errors .
After the shanks were discovered , Judge Barnes said he wanted the sheriff ’s department , which handles security in the courthouse , to provide Nichols with additional guards , yet he was escorted to court by a single female deputy sheriff .
Part of his attack on the deputy was captured by surveillance cameras , but no one was monitoring them .
The Atlanta police , who did not begin searching for Nichols until forty minutes after the first shootings , failed to seal off access to two parking garages where Nichols had been seen ; he escaped from both .
During a subsequent investigation , five sheriff ’s deputies were found to have lied about their actions with regard to Nichols .
Eight deputies were fired for misconduct , all but two of whom were later rehired .
The courts have done little better in handling Nichols ’s case .
In the nineteen - seventies , the Supreme Court struck down mandatory death - penalty laws passed by many states .
Instead , after jurors in a capital case find a defendant guilty , there is now a separate mini-trial , known as the penalty phase , in which they decide whether to impose a death sentence .
“ Ever since the Court started allowing the death penalty again , it has been trying to make it a rational process — make sure that jurors have legitimate reasons for imposing death , ” Carol Steiker , a professor at Harvard Law School , said .
“ So the Court says the state must list any of the so - called ‘ aggravating factors ’ that justify a death sentence , like murder of more than one person , or murder of a law - enforcement officer . ”
At the same time , the Court ruled that defendants may present evidence — known as mitigating factors — suggesting why they do not deserve the death penalty .
“ The jury has to be free to consider anything about the defendant that might call for a sentence of less than death , ” Steiker said .

A prototype of what may be the next generation of personal computers has been developed by researchers in the University of Maryland 's A. James Clark School of Engineering .
Capable of computing speeds 100 times faster than current desktops , the technology is based on parallel processing on a single chip .
Parallel processing is an approach that allows the computer to perform many different tasks simultaneously , a sharp contrast to the serial approach employed by conventional desktop computers .
The prototype developed by Uzi Vishkin and his Clark School colleagues uses a circuit board about the size of a license plate on which they have mounted 64 parallel processors .
To control those processors , they have developed the crucial parallel computer organization that allows the processors to work together and make programming practical and simple for software developers .
" The single - chip supercomputer prototype built by Prof .
Uzi Vishkin 's group uses rich algorithmic theory to address the practical problem of building an easy - to - program multicore computer , " said Charles E. Leiserson , professor of computer science and engineering at MIT .
" Vishkin 's chip unites the theory of yesterday with the reality of today . "
Desktop Parallel Processing
Parallel processing on a massive scale using numerous interconnected chips or computers has been used for years to create supercomputers .
However , its application to desktop systems has been a challenge because of severe programming complexities .
The Clark School team found a way to use single chip parallel processing technology to change that .
Vishkin , a professor in the Clark School 's electrical and computer engineering department and the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies ( UMIACS ) , explained the advantage of parallel processing like this : " Suppose you hire one person to clean your home , and it takes five hours , or 300 minutes , for the person to perform each task , one after the other , " Vishkin said .
" That 's analogous to the current serial processing method .
Now imagine that you have 100 cleaning people who can work on your home at the same time !
That 's the parallel processing method .
" The ' software ' challenge is : Can you manage all the different tasks and workers so that the job is completed in 3 minutes instead of 300 ? "
Vishkin continued .
" Our algorithms make that feasible for general - purpose computing tasks for the first time . "
Vishkin and his team are now demonstrating their technology , which in future devices could include 1,000 processors on a chip the size of a finger nail , to government and industry groups .
To show how easy it is to program , Vishkin is also providing access to the prototype to students at Montgomery Blair High School in Montgomery County , Md .
From Theory to Reality
For years , the personal computer industry achieved advancements in computer clock speed , the fundamental rate at which a computer performs operations , thanks to innovations in chip fabrication technologies and miniaturization .
Moore 's Lawwhich dictates that the number of transistors on integrated circuits in computers will double every 18 to 24 monthswas coupled with a corresponding improvement in clock speed .
But no advancements in clock speed have been achieved since 2004 .
From an early stage , Vishkin foresaw that Moore 's Law would ultimately fail to help improve clock speed due to physical limitations .
This has guided his perseverance over his professional career in seeking to improve computer productivity by distributing the load among multiple processors , accomplishing computer tasks in parallel .
In 1979 , Vishkin , a pioneer in parallel computing , began his work on developing a theory of parallel algorithms that relied on a mathematical model of a parallel computer , since , at that time , no viable parallel prototype existed .
By 1997 , advances in technology enabled him to begin building a prototype desktop device to test his theory ; he and his team completed the device in December 2006 .
The prototype device 's physical hardware attributes are strikingly ordinarystandard computer components executing at 75 MHz .
It is the device 's parallel architecture , ease of programming and processing performance relative to other computers with the same clock speed that get people 's attention .
" Based on the very positive reactions of my graduate students this spring , " Vishkin stated , " I knew that it was time to take the technology public . "
Earlier this month , Vishkin and his Ph.D. student , Xingzhi Wen , published a paper about his newly - built parallel processing technology for the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM ) Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures , and showcased it at a major computing conference , the ACM International Conference on Supercomputing ( ICS ) in Seattle .
At the ICS event , Vishkin allowed conference participants to connect to the device remotely and run programs on it in a full - day tutorial session he conducted , offering colleagues and student participants the opportunity to experience the prototype technology firsthand .
Vishkin also participated in a panel discussion at a special invitation - only Microsoft Workshop on Many - Core Computing on June 20 - 21 in Seattle , Wash .
In August , Vishkin will present a keynote address at the Workshop on Highly Parallel Processing on a Chip in Rennes , France , held in conjunction with the 13th Euro - Par , an international European conference on parallel and distributed computing .
" This system represents a significant improvement in generality and flexibility for parallel computer systems because of its unique abilities , " said Burton Smith , technical fellow for advanced strategies and policy at Microsoft .
" It will be able to exploit a wider spectrum of parallel algorithms than today 's microprocessors can , and this in turn will help bring general purpose parallel computing closer to reality . "
Vishkin has filed several patents on his parallel processing technology since 1997 .
Funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense , his research has also received significant interest from the computer industry , which he believes his technology will revitalize .
" The manufacturers have done an excellent job over the years of increasing a single processor 's clock speed through clever miniaturization strategies and new materials , " he noted .
" But they have now reached the limits of this approach .
It is time for a practical alternative that will allow a new wave of innovation and growthand that 's what we have created with our parallel computing technology . "
In addition to Xingzhi Wen , Vishkin 's research teams includes students Aydin Balkan , George Caragea , Mike Detwiler , Tom Dubois , Mike Horak , Fuat Keceli , Mary Kiemb and Alex Tzannes , as well as electrical and computer engineering professors Rajeev Barua and Gang Qu .
Naming Contest
To increase awareness of his new technology , Vishkin is inviting the public to propose names for it .
The name should reflect the features and bold aspirations of the new machine and its parallel computing capabilities , Vishkin said .
The winner will receive a $ 500 cash prize and be credited with the naming of the innovative technology .

Jonathan Schaeffer 's quest for the perfect game of checkers has ended .
The 50 - year - old computer scientist from the University of Alberta in Edmonton left human players in the dust more than a decade ago after a trial by fire against the greatest checkers champion in history .
And now , after putting dozens of computers to work night and day for 18 years — jump , jump , jump — he says he has solved the game — king me !.
" The starting position , assuming no side makes a mistake , is a draw , " he says .
Schaeffer 's proof , described today in Science ( and freely available here for others to verify ) , would make checkers the most complex game yet solved by machines , beating out the checker - stacking game Connect Four in difficulty by a factor of a million .
" It 's a milestone , " says Murray Campbell , a computer scientist at IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center in Hawthorne , N.Y. , and co-inventor of the chess program Deep Blue .
" He 's stretched the state of the art . "
Although technological limits prohibit analyzing each of the 500 billion billion possible arrangements that may appear on an eight - by - eight checkerboard , Schaeffer and his team identified moves that guaranteed the game would end in a draw no matter how tough the competition .
Like any complicated mathematical proof , the result will have to withstand scrutiny .
But " it 's close to 100 percent , " says computer scientist Jaap van den Herik of Maastricht University in the Netherlands , who has seen the details .
" He has never published anything that was not completely true . "
Opening Play : Walking a Precipice
Schaeffer 's odyssey began in the late 1980s .
He had written a top chess program but IBM was on the verge of pouring its far vaster resources into Deep Blue .
" I like to be competitive , " he says , so he turned his attention elsewhere .
" I naively thought I could solve the game of checkers , " he recalls .
" You can teach somebody the rules in a minute . "
Setting out in 1989 with 16 megabytes of computer memory , he quickly found that checkers , like chess , was too rich with possible positions to dash off a solution .
So he switched gears , vowing to topple legendary checkers champion Marion Tinsley , who had lost only three games in tournament play since 1950 .
In 1992 Schaeffer 's program Chinook took on Tinsley , who had resigned as world champion when the American Checker Federation and English Draughts Association temporarily refused to sanction the man-computer matchup .
Tinsley was so good that his opponents played dull games in the hope of securing at least a draw , according to Schaeffer ; Chinook apparently put the magic back in the game for the champ .
" It played brash , aggressive moves — it walked on the edge of a precipice , " Scheaffer anthropomorphizes .
" It would do things people looked at and said , ' Man , is that program crazy ? ' "
The program actually beat Tinsley twice , but computer glitches led to a forfeit that gave the human a 3 – 2 lead with two games left in a best - of - 40 match .
Schaeffer set Chinook on an aggressive course to try to recoup , resulting in another loss for the computer that cost it and its creator the match , Schaeffer recounted in his book One Jump Ahead .
In a rematch two years later , Tinsley withdrew suddenly after six drawn games , citing health problems , making Chinook the winner of the Man–Machine World Championship by default .
The checkers champ was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer , which killed him less than a year later .
Chinook soundly beat the top human player in 1996 , but Schaeffer 's memories of those years are bittersweet .
" With hindsight , maybe winning was more important to me at that time than other things .
I was a bit obsessed , " he says .
" My wife would say more than a bit obsessed . "
Endgame : King Me !
Early this decade he decided that improved computer speed and memory had brought his goal of solving the game within reach .
The first of the solution 's two pieces builds on work begun during the Tinsley days .
The Alberta researchers exhaustively checked the final stages of play for any arrangement of 10 pieces or less , identifying which of the 3.9 x 1013 positions won , lost or drew .
Next they identified 19 representative opening sequences and searched through subsequent moves for the easiest - to - find connections to final positions — win , lose or draw .
To save time , they ignored pointless back - and - forth moves or those that did not turn a draw into a win .
If the sequence of possible moves branches like a tree , the group found that main branch after main branch led to a draw .
On April 27 , Schaeffer says , the program traced the final branches , completing his 18 - year task .
He had received his king .
The result itself was not surprising .
" We expected that it should be a draw , because at the highest levels there are many games that end in a draw , " Herik says .
What the proof does , Watson 's Campbell says , is highlight the power of methodically checking outcomes one by one .
The most robust chess programs such as Deep Blue and Deep Fritz have beaten world champions by combining swift number crunching with rules of thumb derived from years of human play .
The checkers solver is comparatively dumb , Campbell notes .
" All it knows is this move wins or this move does n't , " he says .
" It ca n't ' explain ' what it knows . "
For that reason , Herik says the results wo n't be much help to players until researchers can figure out how to translate them into rules or procedures the human mind can follow — a major challenge in itself .
Next Move ?
So what game will fall to computers next ?
Schaeffer and colleagues speculate it will be Othello , an eight - by - eight disk - flipping game .
Chess presents a far mightier challenge , but researchers are " in the realm of thinking about " solving it , Herik says , which he calls " a tremendous achievement . "
The great white whale of games remains the Asian pastime Go . Although programs have recently become competitive with grand masters on nine - by - nine boards , they remain toothless on the full 19 - by - 19 game .
Schaeffer , a true game lover — his two dogs are named Scrabble and Rummicub — intends to pit his poker program against two top players next week in a 500 - hand match designed to minimize the role of chance .
He has come a long way since being fixated on the world championship .
Whatever games lie ahead , he can take satisfaction in his current victory .
" Eighteen years later , " he says , " I 'm finally done . "
Update :
Guess what babies ?
All your wildest dreams are about to come true ( provided they do n't get too wild ) .
That 's right , according to new PR for Sony 's upcoming CES showing , Skype is apparently coming to the PSP .
Details are scarce at the moment ( i.e. , nonexistent ) , but the company makes clear mention of a Skype client for the handheld game system on its CES 2008 promo site , which is pretty official -- though we 're gonna hold our breath a little till we see a press release .
Obviously , we 'll be hearing a lot more about this when the big show kicks off this month , but until then at least we can all sleep a little better at night knowing the PSP is about to get yet another succulent function .
Just hit the read link and click on the controller icon , all you need to know is listed in the sidebar .
Thanks to some sleuthing by the crew over at UberGizmo , a perverse and exciting little easter egg has been found in the PSP promo video which accompanies this new info .
For literally one frame , Sony all but confirms
Skype on the handheld with a nearly - subliminal image that reads " Make calls with Skype . "
Check the image after the break and see for yourself .

Chef Andrew Forster now eats fish and chicken as well as biscuits
Andrew Forster , 27 , from Consett in County Durham , has lived on digestives , caramel wafers and Blue Riband biscuits since he was a toddler .
Despite his eating problems , he leads a busy kitchen at the Italian restaurant Sale Pepe in Shotley Bridge , Durham .
Mr Forster features in BBC3's Freaky Eaters which follows his attempts to tackle his food problem .
He wanted to take part in the programme fearing his unhealthy eating habits would lead to an early grave .
He said : " I was 18 months old when it started to happen .
I would n't eat for days .
" My mother was distraught but the doctors said it was just a phase .
" I ate biscuits morning , noon and night .
It affected everything - my social life , concentration , skin tone , teeth . "
Shock tactics
Mr Forster 's daily food intake would often include up to two packets of biscuits , plus the occasional piece of toast , a bowl of cereal or a packet of crisps .
He said he became a chef to try and tackle his addiction .
" I wanted to be closer to food and understand it more .
But it sorted of hindered me in a way .
Being around it all day puts you off eating , " Mr Forster said .
During the making of the programme , experts used shock tactics and distraction techniques to try and cure his addiction .
He said : " I could taste things on the spoon but it was the swallowing action I had trouble with - but now I do n't have half as many biscuits . "
Mr Forster 's diet now consists of smoothies , fruit , fish , meat and chicken with the occasional biscuit .
Mr Forster features in BBC3's Freaky Eaters on 19 March
Sitting in her north London restaurant , Juliette Banner pours herself a glass of what is probably the most expensive tap water in the world .
Thames
Water charges the Crouch End restaurateur less than a tenth of a penny for each litre it pipes , or about 0.02 p per glass .
Yet , for the past three years , Banner has been asking her customers to cough up 15 p per glass , an astonishing mark - up of almost 75,000 per cent that would , if slapped on wine , cause a riot in even the most refined Chelsea restaurant .
The difference is that Banners , a low - key bistro where no two chairs are the same and whose patrons include the musicians , artists , and media types who dot this leafy corner of the capital , donates all the money it makes on tap water to WaterAid , a UK charity that helps some of the 1.1 billion people in the world for whom a glass of safe drinking water is just a dream .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Banner 's brainchild has been so successful – more than 6,000 diners have so far donated more than £ 10,000 – WaterAid has taken on her initiative and is in talks with at least one major restaurant chain in the hope that , soon , all the country 's food outlets will start offering water for small change that could make a big difference .
" It 's outrageous that in the 21st century a sixth of the world 's population can't get clean water , " says WaterAid 's fundraising chief , Alan Machin , who heads up the charity 's Tap into WaterAid campaign .
" If one restaurant in London can raise £ 10,000 , a significant sum in the world 's poorest nations , think what we could do as a country . "
Banner , the former partner of the troubled radio presenter Andy Kershaw , was inspired by a growing consciousness that in the UK we take for granted easy access to tap water .
But , concerned that customers might sniff at a charge for what she calls " one of the last free things in life " , Banner sat on her bright idea .
" People told me I was mad , and when I went round to other restaurants , and showed them information packs , it was like hitting my head against a brick wall , " she recalls , " but I had a feeling that it would work . "
And work it did .
Banner slipped information sheets into her menus , whose pages bulge with exotic offerings such as Cambodian chicken skewers and Malaysian fish curry , and the pennies soon started piling up .
" The response was fantastic , " she gushes , " the customers were so tickled by it because it seems so cheeky to ask people to pay for tap water , but they loved it . "
Banners still feeds and waters diners who prefer not to donate , and the restaurant continues to stock mineral water , but Banner says sales of bottled water are down .
The news will delight campaigners who say our national obsession with packaged water – the industry is worth £ 2bn in the UK alone – is " morally indefensible " .
Defra minister Phil Woolas invoked the ire of the bottled water industry by making the comments on the BBC's Panorama last month .
But he is unrepentant : " I find it arrogant and in defiance of all logic that there are more than a billion people in the world who do n't have access to safe water and yet , here we are with pure water on tap , buying the stuff in bottles .
I 'll say it again – it 's morally indefensible . "
Every day , we knock back some six million litres of bottled water in the UK – enough to fill almost two Olympic swimming pools .
We pay an average 95 p a litre , almost 1,000 times the price of the average litre of tap water .
The industry , which has grown 200 - fold in the past 40 years , produces 200,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year as firms ship in half a million bottles , the majority from France .

Today , at the cinema , The Ranger learnt in the opening credits of Bee Movie that :
According to all the laws of aviation it is impossible for a bee to fly …
It was a really funny film – recommended .
But that opening sequence got the Ranger thinking .
This is another of those scientist - bashing stories , you see .
Stupid scientists get it wrong .
How daft are they ?
Obviously bees can fly .
So why do scientists persist with this patent untruth ?
Actually , they do n’t , and never really did .
A few years ago , Boeing engineer John McMasters looked into the origins of this tale , and published an article in Scientific American ( McMasters , J. H. 1989 .
The flight of the bumblebee and related myths of entomological engineering .
Am. Sci. 77 : 164″169 . ) .
He found the tale was circulating in German technical universities back in the early 1930s , in the infancy of true aerodynamic science .
Further enquiries by others revealed that some observations about bumblebee flight were published in 1934 by the entomologist Antoine Magnan , who discussed a mathematical equation by André Sainte - Laguë , a mathematician .
This informal work compared a bee to an aeroplane of similar size , and was based on the assumption that bees wings were more - or - less smooth , flat plates .
The resulting calculations not surprisingly ‘ proved ’ the bee to be incapable of flight .
But , of course , and crucially , bees ’ wings are far from flat .
As McMasters said in 1989 :
The assumptions were almost wildly wrong , and the [ scientist ] himself later discovered part of his error by examining a bee ’s wing under a microscope — but not , alas , before the myth was born in the hands of overeager journalists .
So the tale went from novelty to received wisdom overnight , and has been used to chastise scientists ever since – despite the subsequent scientific rigour of the original authors and many others having corrected their work .
But does it matter ?
It ’s a good dinner - table story , and if it raises a chuckle , so what ?
In fact , it does matter , because misinformation like this gives science in general a bad name , and there are plenty of people who are not reluctant to assist it .
Former US presidential candidate , the ironically - named Mike Huckabee , for one , who has publicly asserted it as fact .
He ’s also a chap who espouses the teaching of intelligent design in schools .
Really , we should n’t be giving this kind of argument any more ammunition than is absolutely necessary .
So if the bee question is ever raised let us be proud to proclaim that bees can fly , and what ’s more , we can prove it !
Rosie O'Donnell and Elisabeth Hasselbeck Friends Again ( Video )
says " peace prevails " between herself and .
The two very strongly opinionated women formerly worked together on the daytime talk showuntil they had a blow - out and Rosie said enough is enough .
Rosie was interviewed on her way into a Broadway premiere of The Little Mermaid last night .
The reporter asked about the ongoing battle with Hasselbeck .
O'Donnell said that Elisabeth 's second child , 2 month old Taylor Thomas , is adorable and that not only did she send lots of gifts for him but she also sent his 2 year old big sister Grace gifts too .
She added that the two have been exchanging emails .
It sounds like they must talk quite a bit these days .
Rosie did n't seem to have anything negative to say about her former co-worker .
She even went on to say Elisabeth looks as if she adopted because her body does n't look like it gave birth just 2 months ago .
Hasselbeck returned to work this week and is lucky enough to bring her child to work with her .
If you can't remember the final blowout fight between the two talk show hosts , continue on to the next page and check out the video .

A Necessary Evil : A History of American Distrust of Government by Pulitzer Prize winning Garry Wills is a book with a mission .
Wills contends that a charming Yankee trait -- an ornery suspicion of all things political -- is based upon an intricate misunderstanding .
He claims that historians have mistakenly concluded that the Founding Fathers and framers of the Constitution believed government was " a necessary evil . "
Accordingly , Wills sets out to correct the " myths " of freedom that have distorted American history and contributed to what he considers to be an overly harsh attitude toward government .
For instance , he explains that the Second Amendment , which begins " The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . , " has no bearing on private gun ownership .
Like many liberals , Wills is evidently fed up with Constitutional gun arguments .
Indeed , the second paragraph of his introduction explicitly mentions the National Rifle Association , and does so in a peculiar manner .
Wills writes , " The Federalist , written mainly by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton , is not just yesterday 's scholarship but today 's weapon . "
He calls the book " useful to the National Rifle Association . "
The reference is peculiar because pro-gun advocates typically do not draw upon The Federalist but cite the Bill of Rights instead .
The Bill of Rights was demanded by Anti-Federalists who argued against Madison and Hamilton during the ratification debates .
Wills is either unaware of the pro-gun arguments or he deliberately misrepresents them .
On the other hand , he can't be entirely unaware : elsewhere , Wills admits that Second Amendment " commentators like to quote extensively from the Antifederalist attacks . "
There is a slipperiness to this book .
Wills 's statements often contain enough truth to pass all but informed scrutiny .
In short , A Necessary Evil is a well - executed sleight - of - hand that purports to be original interpretation .
The book is not only bad history , it is also anti-intellectual at the core .
Consider the first charge leveled : sleight - of - hand .
Wills contends that " resistance to government " is largely based on an erroneous view of the American Revolution and the Constitution .
Wills claims , " [t ] he American attitude toward central power is rooted in the fact that the founding colonies had no central organ of expression . "
On the surface , this sounds plausible .
Certainly , the extreme differences between the colonies ( e.g. on religion ) contributed to their later tendency to embrace state 's rights and reject centralized authority .
But the post -Revolution colonies did have a central organ of expression : namely , the Congress established by the Articles of Confederation .
It was no less a central organ simply because it was loosely constituted .
Moreover , the colonists ' suspicion of centralized power came not from ignorance but from experience .
They had experience living under British rule .
They had imbibed the classical liberalism of Locke and Paine , and the political theories of such giants as Montesquieu .
As with the Second Amendment , Wills seems pointedly unaware of the ideology underlying both the American Revolution and the subsequent suspicion of centralized power .
In analyzing the Constitution , Wills sets up similar straw men .
For example , his Constitutional Myth # 4 states the ' erroneous ' notion that " competition of the governmental units encourages an ethos of competing power centers , pitting factions against themselves in a self - correcting process described [ in ]
The Federalist . "
Wills observes that the term ' check ' occurs only nine times in The Federalist and not at all in the Constitution .
Thus , he concludes that the division of powers was primarily meant to promote governmental efficiency .
This conclusion dove - tails two claims .
The word ' check ' was not important to the framers of the Constitution ; and , their goal was efficiency .
Consider Wills ' first claim .
In analyzing the importance of the word ' check , ' Wills does not refer to Madison 's two - volume record of the Constitutional Convention .
Unlike The Federalist , which was self - conscious propaganda , this quasi - transcript reflects the real concerns of those at the Constitutional proceedings .
On June 26th , 1787 , Madison himself declared to the assembly : " An obvious precaution against this danger [ a corrupt Senate ] would be , to divide the trust between different bodies of men , who might watch and check each other where all business liable to abuses is made to pass through separate hands , the one being a check on the other . "
On July 2nd , the staunchly Federalist Gouverneur Morris defined the purpose of the " second branch " : " What is this object ?
To check the precipitation , changeableness , and excesses of the first branch ..
In the first place , the checking branch must have a personal interest in checking the other branch . "
The Anti-Federalists , who opposed centralized government , were even more enthusiastic about checking federal power .
Only by ignoring the records of the Constitutional Convention and of the ratification debates could Wills destroy his own straw man .
Consider Wills 's second claim -- that the goal of the framers was efficiency .
Again , Wills tells enough truth to be plausible on the surface .
Delegates to the Constitutional Convention were greatly concerned with efficiency .
But efficiency has meaning only with reference to a goal .
Madison himself declared , " In order to judge of the form to be given to this institution [ the Senate ] , it will be proper to take a view of the ends to be served by it . "
The goals of delegates differed radically .
Some sought the stability of a strong Union , others argued for the primacy of state 's rights .
In short , a demand for checks might not indicate an inefficiency of government , but the very reverse .
A lack of definition makes the key concepts of this book -- e.g. " efficiency , " " government " - soft and pliable .
For a book that purports to correct misconceptions about the basis of government , there is no clearly articulated definition of the institution or of its proper basis .
At one point , Wills obtusely explains , " on a kind of ladder of interchanges , we have moved up from physical marketing to intellectual dialogue as the basis for government . "
He briefly refers to the need for a third party to resolve contractual disputes , then blithely assumes this third party is government .
How he moves from contractual disputes to advocacy of a strong centralized government is a mystery .
Wills 's arguments , like his ' definitions , ' lack substance though they are strong on emotional rhetoric .
For example , he juxtaposes the welfare of society and individual rights as being in natural conflict .
Wills writes ,
" The real victims [ of Constitutional arguments ] are the millions of poor or shelterless or medically indigent who have been told , over the years , that they must lack care or life support in the name of their very own freedom . "
This is the mission of A Necessary Evil - - to eviscerate Constitutional arguments that block social programs .
To claim that the Emperor [ the Constitution ] has no clothes , and never did have .
To demolish the " myth of freedom , " Wills dips so selectively into centuries of American history that he could prove virtually anything .
For example , a quote from " a Continental soldier expressing the ' common sentiment ' about riflemen " is used to devastate the 2nd Amendment .
Even if the soldier 's observation were accurate , it would do nothing to counter the principles upon which the Amendment was based .
In eschewing an examination of ideology , Wills elevates snippets of history to the level of theory , making them snippets - on - stilts .
The second charge I have leveled at A Necessary Evil is that it is anti-intellectual .
Wills states -- perhaps to explain the absence of theory in his book , " There is good reason to be suspicious of any approach to American history that sees it as a recurring clash between two principles . "
Yet Wills himself engages in massive and simplistic dualities : Federalist v. Anti-Federalist , anti-governmental values v. governmental values , efficiency v. inefficiency .
Even painting with such broad , vague strokes , he does n't get it right .
For example , he calls those who opposed strong centralized government " anti-government " : more often than not they simply advocated a different sort of government , e.g. one that gave primacy to state 's rights .
The lack of definition , the misidentification of positions , the refusal to deal with underlying principles : all these factors and more lead the reader to exclaim , " Where are the ideas in this presentation of ideas ? "
In his multi-volume analysis of American history , " Conceived in Liberty , " ( now being reprinted by the Mises Institute ) Murray Rothbard not only offered ideas , he also explained his ideological context .
He wrote , " My own perspective is to place central importance on the great conflict which is eternally waged between Liberty and Power . "
Rothbard was on the side of Liberty that recognizes government as the enemy .
Wills is on the side of Power that recognizes individual freedom as its antithesis .
As pretentious and dishonest as A Necessary Evil may be , it is part of an interesting phenomenon .
Hardly a day goes by without some establishment commentator lamenting the public 's lack of trust in government .
Americans do n't vote en masse anymore .
Americans are cynical about politicians .
They refuse to surrender their guns to government .
In short , the common sense and individualism of Americans stands in the way of " efficient " government -- that is , strong centralized government .
A Necessary Evil will undoubtedly be lauded by these ' court commentators ' because it allows them to escape the reality that the United States was born in rebellion against precisely the sort of government they champion .
And , if the average American questions whether the original ideals have been betrayed by the Leviathan encroachment of Power over two centuries , Wills answers , " You have totally misunderstood the original ideals . "
In the end , this book is heartening .
If A Necessary Evil is state - of - the - art for statist arguments , then advocates of Power are in trouble .
Can allegedly smart people stop making racist and stupid comments ?
Pretty please ?
I am talking to you , Geraldine Ferraro :
In an interview with the Breeze , Ferraro said , “ If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position .
And if he was a woman ( of any color ) , he would not be in this position .
He happens to be very lucky to be who he is .
And the country is caught up in the concept . ”
Yes .
It appears that the legacy of slavery and years of segregation , Jim Crow laws , poll taxes , anti-miscegenation laws , have all worked to propel black men to the Presidency .
That is why we have had so many black Presidents .
Basically , we have made it too easy for a black man to become President , because they can just glide to the Presidency .
Something needs to be done to help the whte man out , since it has been so long since we have had a white President .
Seriously , though , I do n’t know what she is trying to say , what she is thinking , or even if she is thinking .
However , this is not the first time she has said something like this :
Placid of demeanor but pointed in his rhetoric , Jackson struck out repeatedly today against those who suggest his race has been an asset in the campaign .
President Reagan suggested Tuesday that people do n’t ask Jackson tough questions because of his race .
And former representative Geraldine A. Ferraro ( D - N.Y. ) said Wednesday that because of his “ radical ” views , “ if Jesse Jackson were not black , he would n’t be in the race . ”
Kevin Drum begged people yesterday to stop accusing the Clinton campaign of racism .
I think that is a fair request , provided they stop making racist and crypto-racist statements , and they do something about Geraldine Ferraro .
If Samantha Power had to step down for calling Hillary a monster , I think there is MORE than enough reason for Hilary to dissociate herself from Ferraro .
Of course we all know she wo n’t .
Call it the Clinton Rules .
Sometimes I wonder if the Pythagoreans had the right idea .
Yes , I 've written about how " science " is inherently public .
I 've written that " science " is distinguished from merely rational knowledge by the in - principle ability to reproduce scientific experiments for yourself , to know without relying on authority .
I 've said that " science " should be defined as the publicly accessible knowledge of humankind .
I 've even suggested that future generations will regard all papers not published in an open - access journal as non-science , i.e. , it can't be part of the public knowledge of humankind if you make people pay to read it .
But that 's only one vision of the future .
In another vision , the knowledge we now call " science " is taken out of the public domain — the books and journals hidden away , guarded by mystic cults of gurus wearing robes , requiring fearsome initiation rituals for access — so that more people will actually study it .
I mean , right now , people can study science but they do n't .
" Scarcity " , it 's called in social psychology .
What appears to be in limited supply , is more highly valued .
And this effect is especially strong with information — we 're much more likely to try to obtain information that we believe is secret , and to value it more when we do obtain it .
With science , I think , people assume that if the information is freely available , it must not be important .
So instead people join cults that have the sense to keep their Great Truths secret .
The Great Truth may actually be gibberish , but it 's more satisfying than coherent science , because it 's secret .
Science is the great Purloined Letter of our times , left out in the open and ignored .
Sure , scientific openness helps the scientific elite .
They 've already been through the initiation rituals .
But for the rest of the planet , science is kept secret a hundred times more effectively by making it freely available , than if its books were guarded in vaults and you had to walk over hot coals to get access .
( This being a fearsome trial indeed , since the great secrets of insulation are only available to Physicist - Initiates of the Third Level . )
If scientific knowledge were hidden in ancient vaults ( rather than hidden in inconvenient pay - for - access journals ) , at least then people would try to get into the vaults .
They 'd be desperate to learn science .
Especially when they saw the power that Eighth Level Physicists could wield , and were told that they were n't allowed to know the explanation .
And if you tried to start a cult around oh , say , Scientology , you 'd get some degree of public interest , at first .
But people would very quickly start asking uncomfortable questions like " Why have n't you given a public demonstration of your Eighth Level powers , like the Physicists ? " and " How come none of the Master Mathematicians seem to want to join your cult ? " and " Why should I follow your Founder when he is n't an Eighth Level anything outside his own cult ? " and " Why should I study your cult first , when the Dentists of Doom can do things that are so much more impressive ? "
When you look at it from that perspective , the escape of math from the Pythagorean cult starts to look like a major strategic blunder for humanity .
Now , I know what you 're going to say : " But science is surrounded by fearsome initiation rituals !
Plus it 's inherently difficult to learn !
Why does n't that count ? "
Because the public thinks that science is freely available , that 's why .
If you 're allowed to learn , it must not be important enough to learn .
It 's an image problem , people taking their cues from others ' attitudes .
Just anyone can walk into the supermarket and buy a light bulb , and nobody looks at it with awe and reverence .
The physics supposedly are n't secret ( even though you do n't know ) , and there 's a one - paragraph explanation in the newspaper that sounds vaguely authoritative and convincing — essentially , no one treats the lightbulb as a sacred mystery , so neither do you .
Even the simplest little things , completely inert objects like crucifixes , can become magical if everyone looks at them like they 're magic .
But since you 're theoretically allowed to know why the light bulb works without climbing the mountain to find the remote Monastery of Electricians , there 's no need to actually bother to learn .
Now , because science does in fact have initiation rituals both social and cognitive , scientists are not wholly dissatisfied with their science .
The problem is that , in the present world , very few people bother to study science in the first place .
Science cannot be the true Secret Knowledge , because just anyone is allowed to know it — even though , in fact , they do n't .
If the Great Secret of Natural Selection , passed down from Darwin Who Is Not Forgotten , was only ever imparted to you after you paid $ 2000 and went through a ceremony involving torches and robes and masks and sacrificing an ox , then when you were shown the fossils , and shown the optic cable going through the retina under a microscope , and finally told the Truth , you would say " That 's the most brilliant thing ever ! " and be satisfied .
After that , if some other cult tried to tell you it was actually a bearded man in the sky 6000 years ago , you 'd laugh like hell .
And you know , it might actually be more fun to do things that way .
Especially if the initiation required you to put together some of the evidence for yourself — together , or with classmates — before you could tell your Science Sensei you were ready to advance to the next level .
It would n't be efficient , sure , but it would be fun .
If humanity had never made the mistake — never gone down the religious path , and never learned to fear anything that smacks of religion — then maybe the Ph.D. granting ceremony would involve litanies and chanting , because , hey , that 's what people like .
Why take the fun out of everything ?
Maybe we 're just doing it wrong .
And no , I 'm not seriously proposing that we try to reverse the last five hundred years of openness and classify all the science secret .
At least , not at the moment .
Efficiency is important for now , especially in things like medical research .
I 'm just explaining why it is that I wo n't tell anyone the Secret of how the ineffable difference between blueness and redness arises from mere atoms for less than $ 100,000 —
Ahem !
I meant to say , I 'm telling you about this vision of an alternate Earth , so that you give science equal treatment with cults .
So that you do n't undervalue scientific truth when you learn it , just because it does n't seem to be protected appropriately to its value .
Imagine the robes and masks .
Visualize yourself creeping into the vaults and stealing the Lost Knowledge of Newton .
And do n't be fooled by any organization that does use robes and masks , unless they also show you the data .
People seem to have holes in their minds for Esoteric Knowledge , Deep Secrets , the Hidden Truth .
And I 'm not even criticizing this psychology !
There are deep secret esoteric hidden truths , like quantum mechanics or Bayes - structure .
We 've just gotten into the habit of presenting the Hidden Truth in a very unsatisfying way , wrapped up in false mundanity .
But if the holes for secret knowledge are not filled by true beliefs , they will be filled by false beliefs .
There is nothing but science to learn — the emotional energy must either be invested in reality , or wasted in total nonsense , or destroyed .
For myself , I think it is better to invest the emotional energy ; fun should not be needlessly cast away .
Right now , we 've got the worst of both worlds .
Science is n't really free , because the courses are expensive and the textbooks are expensive .
But the public thinks that anyone is allowed to know , so it must not be important .
Ideally , you would want to arrange things the other way around .
Column “ Dork Talk ” published on Saturday February 2nd 2008 in The Guardian
“ Deliver us from Microsoft ” – The Guardian headline
Stephen
Fry introduces the open source platform that will see off Windows .
In recent weeks I have banged on about Open Source , expending two articles on Firefox alone .
Open Source applications make their code available to everyone .
Disagreements and rabid balkanisation within the Open Source community aside , for our purposes the term might as well refer to free software whose licence allows you to share the source code , alter it , use it , do with it what you will .
The two great pillars of Open Source are the GNU project and Linux .
I sha n’t burden you with too much detail , I ’ll just make the outrageous claim that your computer will be running some descendant of those two within the next five years and that your life will be better and happier as a result .
I am writing this article on a kind of mini John the Baptist , a system that prepares the way of the software saviour whose coming will deliver the 90 % of world computer users who suffer under Windows from the expensive , clumsy , costly , ugly , pricey toils of Microsoft .
The Asus EEE PC perched on my knee combines GNU software with a Linux kernel powered by an Intel Celeron Mobile Processor to produce a very extraordinary little laptop .
It weighs less than a kilogram , starts up from cold in about 12 seconds and shuts down in five .
It has no internal hard disk and no CD drive .
It offers 512MB of RAM , 4GB of storage and a seven - inch display ; wireless , dial - out modem and ethernet adaptors are available for networking and internet connections , three USB ports , mini - jack sockets for headphones and microphone , a VGA out , an SD card slot and a built - in webcam .
All for about £ 200 – less than the price of a show , dinner and taxi for two in London ’s West End .
Advertisement
When you press the EEE ’s power button , the lightning speed and quietness of boot - up tell you that you are in the hands of a solid state flash drive : no vulnerable moving parts and buzzing platters here .
Within seconds a tabbed screen will appear on your display : the tabs are labelled Internet , Work , Learn , Play , Settings and Favourites .
A click on each reveals a page containing bright , clear icons that relate to 40 separate applications and half a dozen or so selected web links .
The applications include Skype , Firefox , Thunderbird ( the Mozilla mail client ) and OpenOffice.org , an Open Source suite of applications that allows you to create and edit Word , Excel and Powerpoint documents .
One of the pre-installed web links is to Google Docs , which lets you do the same MS Office compatible work online .
This combination of “ server side ” applications and Open Source software is , rightly , scaring the heck out of Microsoft which is in danger of relying , in a few years ’ time , on its excellent Xbox games console for income and kudos , its domination of personal computing a rapidly diminishing memory .
Well , I ’m allowed to dream .
The EEE is far from perfect : system software claims two - thirds of its meagre 4GB of storage , the keyboard is sub-par , the trackpad worse ; it seems a shame to boast a built - in webcam and a full field of IM clients , yet be incapable of videochat ; the OS , a customised version of Linux , part Debian , part Asus ’s own creation , makes downloading outside the bundled software updater uncertain .
But these defects are minor compared with the machine ’s astounding value and functionality – and to the future trends in computing it heralds .
This is a computer designed as an introductory machine for children or adults , as well as a simple cheap do - it - all machine along the “ One Laptop Per Child ” model but which is also absolutely ideal as a truly cheap , portable , resilient device to slam into a backpack or briefcase .
Everything you could want is there in free , Open Source form .
It does not pretend to cater for the power user but , while file management is basic for the average person , tuxheads ( Linux experts ) can go straight to terminal mode and do their stuff .
Meanwhile , for the rest of us , this is a wonderful little friend who does all we need straight out of the box .
And it is only the beginning …

String comparison algorithms are plentiful in computer science .
You have Boyer - Moore , Knuth - Morris - Pratt , Rabin - Karp , and even the old - fashioned manual comparisons .
Expert systems also require extensive pattern matching during their execution , but it is a special case of pattern matching .
The Rete matching algorithm was invented to speed up that pattern - matching process .
One class of expert systems is known as production systems , which contain a database of production rules that govern behavior .
Production systems such as OPS5 are straightforward ; see Figure 1 .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
Everything is orchestrated by the interpreter .
A set of rules sits in production memory , and a set of facts , or assertions , sits in a database called data memory .
First a pattern matcher looks at both memories to see which rules have their conditions satisfied by the facts .
After the matcher generates a list of rules whose conditions have been satisfied , called the conflict set , it calls sort of conflict - resolution system .
This system looks at everything in the conflict set and , according to some algorithm , determines which particular rule will fire .
The rule makes some changes in either data memory or production memory , and the cycle starts again .
Matching algorithms compare all the data elements in data memory with all the rules in production memory to determine which rules have their conditions satisfied and should be put in the conflict set and sent to the conflict resolver .
For example , an expert system for a detective might have the following rules in production memory :
If a person x did something illegal , then person x is a criminal .
If fingerprints belonging to person x are on object y , then person x touched y at some point in the past .
If person x shot person y , then person x did something illegal .
If person x is dead , then person x should not be invited over for dinner .
And it might have the following data element in data memory :
Person Fred shot person Sam .
Person Sam is dead .
The Rete matching algorithm product is a conflict set containing two rules :
If person x shot person y , then person x did something illegal , and If person x is dead , then person x should not be invited over for dinner .
All this takes a lot of pattern matching .
Each time the inference engine cycles , the pattern matcher must compare the data stored in data memory with the rules stored in production memory to see which rules had all their conditions satisfied .
This comparison process can be very lengthy if the production system has hundreds of data items and thousands of rules , as many real systems do .
Charles Forgy , inventor of the OPS5 rule - based language , devised the Rete algorithm in the late 1970s to speed up the comparisons .
He found that old systems spent as much as 90 % of their performing pattern matching .
They would iterate through the process , taking each rule in turn and looking through data memory to see it the conditions for the rule were satisfied and then proceeding to the next rule .
Some people found ways to index data elements and rule conditions .
This speeds up program executing but still requires iterating through the series of rules and data elements .
The Rete algorithms eliminates the iterative step and hence is a substantial improvement over competing algorithms .
The Rete matching algorithms avoids iterating through the data elements by storing the current contents of the conflict set in memory , only adding and deleting items form it as data elements are added and deleted from memory .
For example , assume that the expert system for a detective has the following rule in its conflict set :
If someone is did charging a firearm at me , then duck .
This means that somewhere in data memory is the fact that someone is discharging a firearm at me .
The conflict set might contain other rules :
If someone is discharging a firearm , then he is committing an illegal act ; if someone is wearing a symbol of an inverted badger , then he is a member of the Dreaded Legion of Inverted Badgers , and so on .
When it comes time to update memory , either as a result of new input or of as a result of rule firing , the Rete algorithm would update the conflict set .
Let 's say the expert system decided to have our hero duck ( a prudent move ) .
That would delete the fact a someone is discharging a firearm at our hero ; hence the rule , If someone is discharging a firearm , then he is committing an illegal act , would not be deleted from the conflict set .
In the other hand , the conflict resolver might decide to fire a different rule .
As a result , this might add the fact that the person shooting him is a member of the Dreaded Legion of Inverted Badgers .
Another rule might have its conditions satisfied , and it would be added to the conflict set .
For example :
If a member of the Dreaded Legion of Inverted Badgers discharges a firearm at me , then it is futile to duck because the firearm is equipped with special Inverted Badger Homing Bullets ... and so on .
The point of all this is that the interpreter does n't have to iterate through the entirety of data memory to see if a given pattern matches any of the data memory elements .
A list of elements that match is stored with each pattern .
When a new element is added to data memory , then the interpreter finds all the match it can and adds it to their lists .
When an element is deleted from data memory , the interpreter finds all the patterns that matched it and deletes them from the lists .
The pattern matching algorithm never has to look at data memory , since the algorithm keeps a record of how data memory affects the rules and the conflict set .
This alone would still force the pattern matching to iterate through production memory , looking for rules that must be updated because of changes in data memory .
However , there is another half that iteration as well .
The Rete algorithm stores the conditions of all the production rules in a tree - structured sorting network .
The Rete algorithm complies the network from the list of production rules and then keeps the network current as rules are added and deleted from the lists .
To see how that works , let 's look at some rules in a candy company 's expert system .
Two production rules in that system are :
Rule Red__Round__Ones :
If the goal is to identify a piece of candy , and if the candy sample is red , and if candy sample is round , then hypothesize it is a jellybean .
Rule Red__Cylindrical__Ones :
If the goal is to identify a piece of candy , and if the candy sample is red , and if the candy sample is cylindrical , then hypothesize it is a licorice stick .
In OPS5 talk :
( P Red__Round__Ones ( Goal | Type Identify | Object { N} ) ( Candy | Name { N} | Color Red | Shape Round | Company { X} ) -> then clause , which is not important in this context ) -> ( P Red__Cylindrical__Ones ( Goal | Type Identify ?
Object { N} ) ( Candy | Name {N} | Color Red | Shape Cylindrical | Company { X} ) -> then clauses
OPS5 notation is easy to understand .
P is the symbol for the production rule ; it is followed by the name of the rule .
The two lines after the name are the two elements that make up the statement that consists of class , of type , of element , and a list of attributes .
The symbol | is OPS5's way of distinguishing attributes ( Shape , for example ) from values ( Cylindrical , for example ) .
Data memory might look as follows :
( Goal | Type identify | Object Sample7 ) ( Candy | Name Sample7 | Color Red | Shape Round | Company FerraraPan )
To determine if the conditions for the first rule were satisfied , the pattern matcher would first check if there were a data element in data memory of class Goal , with the Type attribute of Identify and some Object variable .
Then it would check of there were some data element of class Candy , with some Name variable , a Color attribute of Red , a Shape attribute of Round , and a Company attribute of some unknown variable .
Finally , it would compare the value of the Object variable of the Goal with the value of the Name variable of the Candy .
If all those subconditions were satisfied , the pattern matcher would add the rule Red__Round__Ones to the conflict set .
Then , if it were a conventional iterative pattern matcher , it would step down to the rule Red__Cylindrical__Ones and perform almost the exact same steps .
Those two production rules are almost identical .
Rete 's tree - structured sorting network takes advantages of these redundancies .
The pattern complier builds a network of individual subconditions .
It first looks at each element of a production rule individually , building a chain of nodes that tests for each attribute individually .
Then it looks at comparisons between elements ( comparing the Object variable of the Goal with the Name variable of the Candy , for example ) and connects chains with new nodes .
Finally , terminator nodes are added to signal that all the conditions for the production rule have been satisfied .
The tree structure for Red__Round__Ones is shown in Figure 2 .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
Additional production rules are grafted onto the same network .
If they have no test in common , they do n't interact at all .
How does all this work ?
The root node starts the process .
Whenever a new element is added to data memory , it distributes it down the tree .
Single - input nodes do their tests .
If the element passes the test , then the node passes it downstream ; if the element fails the test , then the node drops it into the bit bucket .
Two - input nodes behave the same way , except that if they get only one input , they save it until the second input comes along .
If , sometime later in the expert system 's churning , the second element entered data memory , the pattern matcher would not have to process the first element all over again .
It would just process the new pre-existing input would perform the test and either send the elements downstream or save them for next attempt .
Let 's watch this in action .
Assume data memory starts empty and then has the following data element added : ( Goals | Type Identify | Object Sample7 ) .
The root distributes the element .
It is not a Candy , so the right tree stops there .
It is a Goal , so the left node passes it down .
The value of the Type is Identify , so it passes down yet again to two different nodes .
These nodes , both two input nodes , receive the element .
They have only one of their two inputs satisfied , so they both save the fact that their Goal element was satisfied with Object equal to Sample7 .
Sometime later in the program 's execution , the following data element is added to data memory : ( Candy | Name Sample8 | Color Red | Shape Round | Company FerraraPan ) .
Now it is processed through the network .
It is not a Goal , but it is a Candy .
The value of Color is Red .
Now it is passed to two different nodes .
the value of Shape is not cylindrical , but it is Round .
Now one if the joins has both to its inputs satisfied ( remember , it has saving the Goal element ) , so it looks for cases where the Name of the Candy equals the Object of the Goal .
There are none , so it saves both elements .
The other join does n't do anything .
Even later , a third data element appears in data memory : ( Goal | Type Identify | Object Sample8 ) .
It is processed like the previous Goal where the Object equals Sample8 as well as whose Name equals Sample8 .
That fact is sent downstream : the final node indicates that all the conditions for the rule Red__Round__Ones have been satisfied .
Deleting data elements from the network is similar .
The element is processed the same way and deleted from any two - input node in which it is stored .
Thus the network is kept current and constantly mirrors the contents of data memory .
The Rete algorithm has applications in all expert system applications that involve these production rules .
It is especially suited for this many object / many pattern matching problem , in which many data memory elements are compared with many production memory rules .
The only caveat is that the elements must be relatively consistent between iterations .
Since the Rete algorithm maintains itself between iterations , applications in which most of the data changes between iterations will be slowed down with this algorithm .
What the Rete algorithm basically says is that production systems are best implemented as a series of sophisticated tree walks that everything else is nothing more than syntactic sugar .
Considerable mental leverage can be gained in thinking in terms of rules and conditions , but when it comes time for implementation , that should all be thrown away .
The Rete algorithm does not claim to make any conceptual changes to the production system model -- it is simply a way to implement that model efficiently on a computer .

What is it like to devote two hard years to running for the White House - and then fail ?
Ed Pilkington talks to former presidential candidates about the shattering loss , the humiliation and the elite club they call the Misery Circle
Hillary Clinton likes to tell her senior aides at times of crisis , " Somebody has to win , and somebody has to lose . "
She is implicitly referring to Barack Obama , but there is a group of people scattered across America for whom the words carry a deeply personal resonance .
These are the members of an elite group : the failed would - be presidents club .
Only 13 people alive have run for the US presidency in a general election ( discounting those who polled less than 2 % ) .
Of those , four went all the way to the most powerful job on earth .
The remaining nine - five Democrats , one Republican and three third - party candidates - never got to sit behind that desk in the Oval Office .
They are the people who know best the toll of running for the White House .
They can warn Clinton , Obama and John McCain of the booby traps that lie ahead .
They have been the butt of attack ads , have worked around the clock for two years solid , and , whatever their political colours , have shared the same overwhelming disappointment .
In short , they know what it is to lose .
A trip in midwinter to see the elder statesman of the White House losers involves a flight across a vast nothingness - the Great Plains , which are covered in a featureless blanket of snow , as though an eraser has been rubbed across them .
The journey ends in Mitchell , South Dakota , a small town frequented by hunters , fishermen , travelling corn salesmen - and a steady trickle of people interested in George McGovern , the Democratic firebrand of the 1972 elections .
My meeting with him is scheduled in the McGovern Library , a stately building in municipal brown brick dedicated to his abortive White House run .
The minute you step inside , you get a sense of how exhilarating , inspirational , hip even , the McGovern campaign was .
The walls of the library are lined with badges in hippy rainbow colours , as if you are walking into a Yes album .
Words such as " Hope " and " Peace " abound .
There is a poster with planes dropping bombs over Vietnam on one half , a white dove on the other .
" Come home America , " it reads .
Faded front pages show McGovern addressing huge crowds , his tie loosened an inch or so , a look of elation in his eyes .
You half expect that same man to step out of the photo and come forward to greet you .
Instead , a slightly stooped , avuncular - looking figure accompanied by a big black labrador ushers me into his private office .
I begin by asking whether the 2008 presidential race is throwing up memories for him , and I 'm taken aback by the alacrity with which he responds .
" Oh yes .
Almost every day . "
He says the Clinton - Obama battle has brought back all the excitement of being at the centre of things .
" Being on the front pages , cameras following you around .
The thrill of the crowds pouring themselves into the campaign , wanting to touch you , just to get close enough to touch your finger .
That 's a head - turning , heart - throbbing experience . "
McGovern 's bid for the presidency came like a blast from nowhere .
Running against establishment Democratic figures - Hubert Humphrey , Ed Muskie - he seemed at first to have no chance .
He was rated by one well - known odds - maker , Jimmy " the Greek " Snyder , at 200 to one .
Yet slowly but surely , McGovern shrugged off the doubters and won a string of big primary victories .
His campaign mesmerised millions of first - time voters - the legendary McGovern army - as well as the cream of Hollywood .
There was Jack Nicholson , Burt Lancaster and Raquel Welch , Julie Christie , Warren Beatty and his sister Shirley MacLaine ( who appears in a picture in the library amid a sea of McGovernites holding up a placard that reads , " Where are you now Jimmy the Greek ? " )
The gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson spent months following McGovern around the country in a cloud of political euphoria and narcotics .
Among the foot soldiers of the McGovern army were Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton , then in their mid-20s .
" We had them in Texas , " McGovern says .
" Trying to sell George McGovern in Texas is one formidable task , but they never wavered . "
It was partly Hillary Clinton 's connections forged in Texas in 1972 that helped her win the state earlier this month and keep her presidential hopes alive .
Yet the Clinton connection seems paradoxical today , because it is not Hillary 's 2008 race to which McGovern 's 1972 run bears an uncanny resemblance but Obama's .
Both McGovern and Obama started as rank outsiders but came to prominence mobilising young grass - roots support ; both ran at a time when America was divided and angry , and came to embody a popular mood for change ; both stood as the prime antiwar candidate , over Vietnam then and Iraq now .
The parallels are not lost on McGovern .
" I 've found myself even more emotionally involved this year than usual .
It reminds me so much of what was going on 36 years ago . "
Some of the elation of those front pages sparks back into his eyes , and his voice , though frail , grows impassioned .
" I do n't think that ' 72 campaign has ever been far away from my consciousness .
We brought millions of people into the political process , just as Barack is doing today .
It was a mighty army . "
In the hiatus between winning the nomination and facing Richard Nixon , the incumbent president , he remembers relaxing back at home in South Dakota in preparation for a contest that he knew would be tough but that he thought he could win .
He went horseriding and drank cocktails with reporters .
He signed postcards showing his face superimposed alongside the four presidential profiles in the local landmark , Mount Rushmore .
" It was just glorious to finally win that nomination and come home for a while .
That was great .
One of the happiest periods of my life . "
The elation lasted for all of three days .
And then , as Hunter S Thompson put it , " Without warning , it became the bleak hills . "
If ever there were a lesson for Obama , that the fervour of the crowd can vanish as quickly as it erupts , it is what happened next .
McGovern chose as his running mate a senator called Thomas Eagleton - a sensible choice until it transpired a few days after the announcement that he had a history of mental illness and had been given electroshock therapy for depression .
McGovern at first stood by his putative vice - president , but when his financial backers went into revolt and his money dried up he was forced to sack Eagleton .
" It turned almost overnight , " he says now .
" We had gone for a year and a half without making a single mistake , referred to as the brilliant McGovern operation .
After this we were seen as clumsy and naive .
It was shattering .
You feel like you are out in a sailing boat with a brisk wind blowing you along , then all of a sudden it is becalmed and the sails droop ... A great campaign went off the tracks . "
To tumble into political oblivion is heart - rending , and McGovern has had to seek solace where he can .
One of the main sources of comfort has been the company of fellow presidential losers - even those from the enemy party .
After 1972 , McGovern became close to the Republican Barry Goldwater , who had lost to Lyndon Johnson eight years previously .
When I hear him talk about their " real bond of friendship " that lasted until Goldwater died in 1998 , I skip a beat .
McGovern , arguably the most leftwing candidate to run for the White House in 50 years , and Goldwater , who made his name opposing unions , the welfare state and Johnson 's civil rights act - friends ?
McGovern says he also remains close to another Republican member of the club , Bob Dole , and to fellow Democrat Walter Mondale .
" I think there is a sense in which we bolster each other , " he says .
He recalls how he bumped into Mondale in Washington in 1988 , four years after Mondale had gone down in an electoral blaze every bit as dramatic as his own .
" George ! Stop ! Stop ! "
Mondale had shouted .
" You 're the only guy in this country that can answer this question : how long after you 've lost 49 states before it quits hurting ? "
McGovern paused , and then he replied - and remember , this is 16 years after he , too , had lost 49 states : " Ah well , Fritz , I 'll let you know when I get there . "
When I meet Walter " Fritz " Mondale , he knows immediately what I 'm talking about when I ask him about the ties that bind members of this rarefied club .
He even has a name for it .
" Yes , we have a kind of misery circle .
We run into each other once in a while .
I see [ Michael ] Dukakis , McGovern and [ Jimmy ] Carter .
There 's a recognition that each of us had a unique experience . "
Mondale knows as much as anyone about running for the White House - he 's been on the national ticket three times .
He won with Carter in 1976 to become vice - president , lost with Carter four years later , and then stood as presidential candidate in 1984 .
" It 's a lot more fun to win , " he says wryly .
He recalls the inauguration in 1976 - the parade was starting to run down and an aide came over to him and said , " Let 's go inside . "
" It had n't dawned on me that I was going to walk into the White House and work there .
Suddenly I was in the White House and in my office . "
We are sitting in the plush law offices where Mondale now works in Minneapolis , in his home state of Minnesota .
There is a wonderful view from his window of the Mississippi snaking through the town .
He gives me a visual tour of the city , and as he does so he relates how his great - grandfather came here from Norway and was rewarded for fighting on the Union side in the civil war with a small plot of land .
There is still a good deal of the northern European about Mondale .
There 's a solidness to him , and he exudes a profound sense of duty and public service and Old World values .
( In his family , he tells me , children were spanked for bragging . )
Such qualities turned him into a fine and upstanding man , and a respected senator .
They also made him a lousy presidential candidate .
His opponent was Ronald Reagan , as antithetical to a northern European as you could get .
Mondale was about principles , Reagan results .
Reagan was the master of the soundbite who captured the spirit of the times in one phrase : " It 's morning in America . "
Mondale was wary of such politics - as - marketing and stuck to lengthy discourses on the need for equality and justice .
His biographer calls him the last major political figure to have resisted television .
He chuckles and admits , " Yeah , I could be .
One of my opponents called me a media Luddite .
I was n't good at it .
Reagan , he was a genius at it .
He could walk in front of those cameras and it would come out magic .
I would walk in and it would be a root canal . "
Mondale 's staff tried frantically to reform him , to drag him into the television age .
They urged him to change his hairstyle , his shirt collars , his hand gestures , his voice , even his smile , so as to come across better on TV .
The Norwegian in him hated it .
He was intensely aware that , though he was probably going to lose , he wanted his family - his sons , in particular - to be proud of him .
It was a dignity thing .
" I did n't like it , and I told them so .
I said , ' Look , I 'm all I 've got .
I ca n't be someone I 'm not . ' "
It 's striking how much the world had changed in the 12 years that separated McGovern 's race from Mondale's .
Buzz concepts such as " media training " and " communications advisers " were hardly around in 1972 , and McGovern 's army was recruited as much by word of mouth as through the airwaves .
By 1984 , Mondale 's disdain for the small screen had become a huge disability , and with each election the centrality of television has grown .
All three remaining candidates in the 2008 race , you can be certain , will have been media trained to within an inch of their lives .
The focus on candidates has become more and more intense .
Take McGovern 's disastrous choice of running mate .
Mondale , of course , knew all about that , so he was careful to vet his desired number two .
What he did not take into account was how far the scrutiny would extend .
By 1984 it was not enough for the running mate to be squeaky clean .
Her spouse had to be , too .
I go to visit Geraldine Ferraro to hear her story of the almost inhuman pressures that are put on any presidential contender - particularly , and pertinently to the election this year , if she is a woman .
I find her in her lawyer 's office on the 14th floor of a lower Manhattan building overlooking Ground Zero , with breathtaking views of the foundations of the Freedom Tower .
( There 's a theme here - run for the White House and get a spectacular view . )
Ferraro recalls vividly the tremendous sense of pride when she was asked by Mondale to be the first woman vice - presidential candidate in US history .
Then , just two weeks later , it was revealed that her husband , John Zaccaro , had failed to make public his tax returns .
The press descended and her family became embroiled in a frenzy of questioning and speculation , with particular emphasis on her husband 's Italian surname .
" They came after my husband as if he were a member of the mafia .
He 's a fifth - generation American .
I could n't believe it , and he was stunned by it all .
He was so frightened , he did n't know where to turn . "
In her book on the 1984 election , My Story , Ferraro describes walking into her bedroom at home at the height of the tax furore to find her husband in tears .
It was only the second time in her life she had seen him cry .
" Please do n't do this to yourself , " she said , putting her arms around him .
" What had he done to deserve all this ? " she writes .
" This good man , who had supported me in everything I 'd ever done , was being destroyed .
And all on account of me . "
She burst into tears herself , and they stood together in the centre of the room , surrounded by tax returns and receipts , clinging to each other and weeping .
At that moment , their 20 - year - old son , John Jr , walked in on them .
She notes that her son " grew up on the spot " .
There 's clearly a lesson here for any presidential candidate : check out your choice of running mate to the point of obsession .
And not only them .
Vet the husband , the wife , the aunt , the nanny , the cat and anyone else who has ever come within 50 metres of them .
However , Mondale is convinced that the reason the press tore into Ferraro 's husband was gender .
" It 's a kind of cultural thing .
A lot of people believe a woman is n't really the VP candidate , it 's the husband that 's important .
I hope that 's not how we think any more . "
Ferraro recalls constant smaller humiliations .
After a televised debate with her Republican counterpart , George Bush the elder , he told the press that he had tried to " kick a little ass " .
On another occasion she was asked by a TV reporter whether she was " strong enough " to push the nuclear button , a question that had never been put to a man running for the White House .
Unsurprisingly , Ferraro is backing Clinton in 2008 , and is one of her most vocal supporters .
What is surprising , however , is that Ferraro should herself have stooped to questionable tactics in this campaign : she blazed her way into the headlines with the comment that Obama would not be the Democratic frontrunner " if he was a white man " .
The remark landed her in a huge controversy .
When I spoke to her soon afterwards , she said that the storm that engulfed her this time had been far more threatening than when she 'd been a candidate herself .
" In 1984 I did n't have to face an orchestrated campaign like this - hate mails , voicemails , nasty messages to my law firm , people ridiculing me for my age .
Back then , you could understand the White House trying to undermine me , but in 2008 ?
I 'm a nothing , a nobody . "
Ferraro quit her fundraising role with the Clinton campaign , though she stands by what she said .
" I 've always told my kids that if you tell the truth , you will never get in trouble .
So much for the advice I gave as a mother .
But it is true .
In 1984 I was chosen as vice - presidential candidate because I was a woman ; it does n't mean I could n't do the job - and the same thing as a black man goes for Obama . "
She dismisses as " ridiculous " Obama 's characterisation of her remarks as divisive .
" Nobody who knows me could say I was a racist , " she says .
It 's hard , though , not to see her comments as a rewording of old grumblings about affirmative action - successful blacks are there only because of preferment , rather than by dint of their own abilities .
Ferraro's wider point was to signal that Clinton 's gender still acts as a drag on her prospects , even in 2008 ; but , in fact , gender is probably not Clinton 's biggest headache .
As I meet more members of this exclusive club I realise quite what an ordeal presidential candidates go through - they are subjected to afflictions that can reasonably be compared to torture : sensory overload ; ritual humiliation ; strangers invading your body space at all hours of day and night ; disorientation ; sleep deprivation .
McGovern clocked up 51,465 air miles travelling between 64 cities within less than three months of general election campaigning .
Ferraro trumped that with 55,000 miles and 85 cities in 87 days , and Mondale did substantially more even than that .
As this year 's primary season has been stretched beyond all expectation , Mondale has grown increasingly worried for the candidates .
" Look under their eyes - they are using lots of make - up now .
They are exhausted .
You can hear it in their voices .
The body only has so much to give . "
There is a real danger here for Clinton and Obama , who could be slogging each other to burn - out and beyond .
McGovern thinks his downfall was in part brought on by tiredness that led him to make bad decisions .
He campaigned seven days a week , 16 hours a day , for almost two years .
" Fatigue is a treacherous thing .
You are haunted by it , yet not fully aware of it .
It keeps you from doing your best at anything , whether it 's chasing a pretty girl , or making a good speech , or choosing a running mate . "
He asked Goldwater what lessons he 'd learned from his drubbing at the polls .
" Do n't get exhausted .
It 's lying out there ready to trap you and make you do all sorts of half - arsed things , " was the reply .
" I wish you 'd told me that before I ran , " McGovern replied .
" Up on a plane , down ; up on a plane , down ; up on a plane , down . "
This is Michael Dukakis , who lost to George Bush senior in 1988 , describing the candidate 's life .
" There 's nothing more boring , let me tell you , " he says in his Boston drawl .
Except making the same stump speech hundreds of times .
By November , McCain and Obama or Clinton will have been doing that for 18 months or more .
Obama may be a great orator , but I for one can recite by heart several of his favourite lines .
I ask Dukakis what that 's like , living the political equivalent of Groundhog Day .
" Boring as hell . "
Dukakis is cooped up in a tiny office on the third floor of a university block in Boston that is a pastiche of the academic environment : worn brown carpets and scuffed walls .
His door in the politics department is embossed with the words : Distinguished Professor .
The room next door is labelled Staff of Dukakis , which must be an ironic joke .
In 1988 he had a volunteer force of thousands working for him across the country .
Here at Northeastern University , the Staff of Dukakis amounts to one , part - time .
The modest surroundings contrast strikingly with Dukakis himself , who grows expansive as he warns the 2008 candidates of the perils of negative advertising .
In his case he was hit by the notorious Willie Horton ad .
It focused on a black prisoner in jail for murder who committed rape while on temporary release under a rehabilitation scheme approved by Dukakis .
What really proved fatal was not the ad itself , but Dukakis 's failure to rebut it .
" I made a decision from the beginning that I was going to run a positive campaign .
Little ol ' me says I 'm not going to respond to the Bush attacks .
That was a huge mistake .
You can't just sit there and let the other guy beat your brains out .
And by the time I woke up to the damage that was being done , it was almost all gone . "
Dukakis warns the Democratic nominee to expect the same .
" These people are not nice , they will go after you . "
He 's probably right , despite McCain 's promise to wage a clean campaign , but the two remaining Democratic candidates are a lot more savvy than Dukakis was .
They 've studied what happened to him ; to McGovern , who was accused of being in favour of the three As - amnesty for Vietnam refuseniks , abortion and acid ; and , of course , to John Kerry in the Swift Boat saga of 2004 , and they have refined their rebuttal systems like a stealth bomber .
Clinton and Obama now respond to attacks via email within minutes .
Dukakis warns of another pitfall - the distortion of a candidate 's character by the media ; he points to the example of Al Gore , who in 2000 was made out to be wooden and dull ( remember Al Bore ? ) but who has since re-emerged as a charismatic Nobel Peace Prize winner .
In Dukakis 's case , he was lampooned as an administrator .
One commentator dubbed this son of Greek immigrants " Zorba the clerk " , while Richard Nixon called him a word processor .
" A story line begins to develop , and journalists buy into it , " Dukakis says .
" Dukakis is a bloodless technocrat .
Al Gore is stiff .
Bob Dole looks like an undertaker .
Bob Dole !
Bob Dole is the funniest guy I 've ever met .
I 'm not kidding you - he is witty as hell . "
It 's true that since Dole lost to President Clinton in 1996 he has made something of a career out of that wit .
He has been on Saturday Night Live and the Jay Leno show and appeared in commercials for Viagra .
But there was n't a lot of humour on display on the campaign trail .
I ask Dole why that was .
He agrees that sobriety became a feature of both his failed runs on the White House , as running mate to Gerald Ford in 1976 and his own Republican candidacy in 1996 .
He remembers Ford telling him he wanted Dole to keep things straight : " We do n't want a comedian putting out the funny stuff . "
Sobriety remained the order of the day when Dole ran against Bill Clinton .
This time , the injunction to cut out the jokes came from his own advisers .
" I think in '96 we listened too much to people who said , ' These are serious times . '
Of course they were serious .
Times are always serious . "
The comedy moments were all at his expense .
Dole was 73 , facing a youthful Clinton , aged 50 , and his opponent made the most of it - a foretaste , perhaps , of what may befall John McCain , now 71 , should he be up against Obama , 46 .
A decorated second world war hero , Dole was wounded in action in Italy in 1945 and his right arm is paralysed .
That did n't stop the Clinton camp and the media ridiculing him after he fell off a stage at a campaign event ( see cover image ) .
" The secret service had n't nailed down the barrier around the stage , so when I leaned on it ...
That was played on TV over and over again , and gave them the chance to revisit the age thing , " he recalls .
Dole spells out the problems he faced in his campaign - lack of cash , a popular and lavishly well - funded opponent who had the huge benefit of being incumbent president , the economy doing well ...
By the time he has finished the list , I want to scream out : so why do it to yourself ?
Why at the age of 73 take on a punishing race that you are almost certain to lose ?
I ask whether he was motivated by vanity and ego , a sense of duty , or because he had a mission he wanted to achieve ?
" Some of each , " Dole replies .
" You need a certain ambition - call it ego .
I believed I could do a good job as president .
But it 's a tough , tough thing .
We are human , too .
You have other things going on in your life over those 18 months that nobody knows about - other stresses , other pressures .
It 's not easy every day , from 7 am to late at night , devoting yourself to running for the White House . "
It can't be put off any longer .
Election night .
There is no denying that Democratic candidates have been particularly good at losing over the past 40 years , which is why there are so many of them in the misery circle .
The Republicans have been in power for all but 12 of those 40 years .
McGovern 's shoulders visibly droop when we speak of the final count .
He knew a few weeks before the end that he was sinking , but he refused to admit it to anyone - himself included .
After he and his wife , Eleanor , had cast their votes on election day , they were being driven back home from the polling station and he remarked to her how strange it would be no longer having secret service protection .
She turned to him and gave him a long , silent look .
" Oh , Eleanor , " he said , " I did n't really mean that . "
McGovern remembers preparing to make his concession speech .
As he was walking towards the podium , he saw ABC 's top political reporter with tears in his eyes .
" To see a hard - boiled Washington news man in tears as he was about to go on camera ... it was hard to resist them myself .
There were a lot of tears among my campaign workers and in my family that night .
I did n't shed any , but I certainly shed them inside .
It was a sad night . "
McGovern did n't just lose , he lost magnificently .
Though the Watergate crisis was already looming by November 1972 , he was given a kicking .
He even lost his home state of South Dakota .
In fact , he lost all states bar one - Massachusetts - and the District of Columbia , an annihilation on a scale matched only by Barry Goldwater 's massacre in 1964 and that of another friend , Walter Mondale , in 1984 .
" I remember sitting there and watching Reagan 's colour , red , filling the map .
It just kept coming at you , " Mondale says .
Mondale also took only one state - Minnesota - and DC , which at least threw McGovern a crumb of comfort .
" I never let Mondale forget that Massachusetts has four more electoral votes than Minnesota . "
Each individual coped with the immediate aftermath of defeat in his or her own way .
Ferraro says the demands of caring for a young family brought her instantly back to reality .
Dukakis was back at his desk as governor of Massachusetts the very next morning .
He says one of the hardest parts was feeling you had disappointed your supporters .
" Thousands of people out there worked their tails off for you .
They believed in you .
I did not run a great campaign .
I ran a lousy campaign , and I 'd let a lot of people down . "
Dole agrees that " you feel you let the party down , colleagues down , family down .
But then you have to decide it 's over .
You have a couple of courses you can take : you can set yourself up as a critic of the president who beat you , or you can get on with your life .
I chose to get on with my life . "
Even if you avoid bitterness and sniping , you still have the agony of watching your opponent run the country for the next four or eight years .
More profoundly , each member of the club has had to cope with the idea that if they had won the race , America - indeed , the entire world - would be a different place .
That kind of thought can drive a person crazy .
Mondale believes his defeat marked the final triumph of Reaganism - the fundamentalist view that the market will solve all problems .
The causes Mondale espoused , of social justice and equality , were pushed into the wilderness and are only now , he believes , a quarter of a century later , enjoying a revival .
" We lost 25 years .
A whole generation of people never got a shot , and I 'm really sorry about it ...
We could have made a difference . "
The game of consequences plays out most chillingly for Dukakis .
Here 's the thought : no defeat to Bush Sr in 1988 , no Bush Jr , no Iraq war .
" If I 'd beaten the old man , we never would have been landed with the kid .
And we would n't be in this mess today . "
Ralph Nader has had to face , much more directly , the accusation that he is responsible for the Iraq war .
Many people hold him personally to blame for allowing Bush into the White House in 2000 by standing as a Green party candidate .
In Florida , Nader polled more votes than Gore needed to take the state and hence the presidency .
When we meet in Washington , he fires complicated mathematical arguments at me to show that the attack is wrong and that , actually , he helped Gore .
" Our entry into the 2000 race got Gore more votes than if we had n't been there , " he says .
I ask how he has coped with the vitriol that has been thrown at him , some of it by people who used to be among his closest allies .
" I 'm not into mood changes , " he says .
" These ups and downs undermine consistency and persistency of purpose .
Once you become susceptible to moods , you become susceptible to discouragement and demoralisation , which I abolished , ab initio . "
Wow !
That 's quite a gift , I think to myself , being able to eradicate mood changes .
Just think how much money you could make if you managed to distil that ability and bottle it .
But even more than with Dole , I want to scream at him : why do it to yourself ?
Let alone for a third time , in 2008 , as he has announced he will ?
His answer has clearly been rehearsed : " I will not allow people to keep the citizens of this country from having a chance to improve this country , and as long as I have a chance to contribute to that , I will never give up . "
Nader is an interesting , thought - provoking and intelligent man .
But a phrase keeps popping into my head : sucker for punishment .
Which , of course , is precisely the kind of thinking that Nader abolished , ab initio .
They have n't done badly out of life , the White House losers .
Walter Mondale is a prominent lawyer in a big international firm , as is Geraldine Ferraro .
Michael Dukakis may have a pokey office , but he takes great joy in teaching a new generation of political leaders .
Bob Dole has an institute of politics in his name in the University of Kansas .
But they all carry the scars .
Mondale says he has paid a price for all those months of round - the - clock adrenaline .
" For a while , the system keeps you moving , as you can see it doing with the candidates today .
But I think it took something out of me .
I do n't have a clinical explanation , but an edge was gone and I never got it back . "
So do they regret their decision to run in the first place ?
Was it worth the pain ?
Ferraro comes closest to admitting her doubts .
" If God had said to me before the nomination , ' I want to sit you down and show you the next six months of your life , ' I would have said to God , ' Do me a favour ...'
I would not have done it . "
But then she adds , rather undermining the thought , that if the choice had been between her and yet another grey - haired man , " I would have said to God , ' Give me five minutes to talk to my family ' . "
The others speak as one voice - that despite all the knocks they took along the way , they would n't have foregone the experience .
" Are you kidding ? " squawks Dukakis .
" Look , you are dying to govern .
My God !
Let me have it .
Give me the keys to the White House and let 's get on with it .
People come up to me and say , you must prefer it without all that pressure .
I say , you do n't understand guys like us .
We love pressure .
We want to be there to make decisions .
We are in the middle of this stupid war in Iraq , the dumbest war ever , and why do you think the guys on my side are running ?
Because they want to end it . "
Mondale puts the same sentiment more succinctly : " If I were 45 , I would do it all again . "
He says he knows of people within the misery circle who are still wrestling with their disappointment .
" I 've got friends who never get over it .
They keep kicking themselves around .
I 've tried not to do that , not to mope .
I count my blessings . "
Mondale wo n't name names , but we know , by his own admission , the identity of one such person who has never fully recovered .
George McGovern has had his compensations , too - the library in his honour that opened two years ago at a cost of $ 10 m is evidently a source of huge pride .
Then there are the many friendships he made in 1972 .
But he still feels the hurt of what happened 36 years ago .
" You are never going to get over it , " he says .
" You get so you can live with it , and you do n't brood about it , but when the subject comes up , you feel a little pain .
A little sadness . "
Somebody has to win , and somebody has to lose .
Given the chance , I ask , would he be out there on the campaign trail in 2008 , taking on John McCain ?
McGovern 's shoulders rise , his chin comes up , that spark of elation is in his eyes .
" Oh sure ! " he says .
" It 's always the same .
Every four years I 'm ready to go again ! "

Wim Hof is commonly nicknamed Iceman .
He holds nine world records including a world record for longest ice bath .
In 2007 , he attempted , but failed , to climb Mount Everest wearing nothing but shorts .
He plans another attempt in 2008 .
He broke his previous world record by staying for 1 hour and 12 minutes immersed in ice outside of the Rubin Museum of Art in New York City on Saturday January 26 , 2008 .
Scientists can't really explain it , but the 48 - year - old Dutchman is able to withstand , and even thrive , in temperatures that could be fatal to the average person .
On March 16 , 2000 , Wim Hof swam 57.5 m. ( 188.6 ft. ) under three feet of an ice lake near the Finnish village of Kolari , deep inside the Arctic Circle .
Using no special equipment , he wore only swim shorts and a pair of goggles .
Just freezing .
In January 2007 , Wim Hof ran a half Marathon ( 21 km ) above the polar circle in Finland .
He wore only a pair of shorts and no shoes .
The ground ( snow ) temperature was 35 below .

WASHINGTON ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
The major motion picture studios had egg on their faces Wednesday as they tried to explain to Congress and educators why a key number in a highly touted study of on - campus piracy was wrong .
A 2005 study commissioned by the Motion Picture Association of America “ incorrectly concluded that 44 percent of the motion picture industry ’s domestic losses were attributable to piracy by college students , ” MPAA spokesman Seth Oster said Wednesday .
It turns out that only 15 percent of the industry ’s domestic losses were caused by college students , he said .
LEK , the firm that the MPAA had hired to do the survey , discovered the error when it was computing losses for the MPAA ’s 2007 study .
“ We take this error very seriously and have taken strong and immediate action to both investigate the root cause of this problem as well as substantiate the accuracy of the latest report , ” Oster said .
The mistake , which MPAA sources said LEK attributed to a “ data entry ” error , has left the association scrambling to contain any damage it might cause to the studios ’ battle against piracy .
MPAA president and chairman Dan Glickman and other executives have used the 44 percent number in their arguments to get lawmakers to enact sanctions against an education community that has at times been reluctant to aid moviemakers ’ anti-piracy crusade .
When told of the mistake , Glickman was said to be apoplectic and began a review of the association ’s “ relationship ” with LEK .
The MPAA also hired a third party to review LEK ’s numbers for the nearly finished 2007 report .
MPAA officials pointed out that even though the number is about one - third of the one it had been using , the piracy problem on campuses remains huge , with the 15 percent figure translating to losses of nearly $ 250 million .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Three national polls of Democrats show Sen. Barack Obama is the front - runner for the nomination .
But what 's behind this latest momentum ?
New national polls show Sen. Barack Obama , right , trumping Sen. John McCain in November .
There 's growing evidence that Obama is seen as more electable than Sen. Hillary Clinton .
If you average the " poll of polls " -- AP - IPSOS , USA Today / Gallup and CBS / New York Times -- Obama leads Clinton 50 percent to 40 percent , with 10 percent unsure .
Here 's something Democrats agree on even more :
In two different polls , around 70 percent of Democrats polled believe Obama will get their party 's nomination .
When Democrats were asked about the general election , the New York Times - CBS News poll showed Obama had the best chance of beating Sen. John McCain -- 59 percent to Clinton 's 28 percent .
And it 's not just Democrats .
The USA Today - Gallup poll asked Republicans which Democrat would McCain have a better chance of beating .
The answer : Clinton 66 percent , Obama 18 percent .
Republicans are just itching to run against her .
Her response ?
She 's heard it all before .
" I hear all these folks talking about who is or is n't electable .
Well , they said the same thing about me when I started running in New York .
...
You know , nobody would vote for me , good grief .
I was wasting my time and my money , " Clinton recently said .
" But I trust the voters , and frankly that 's who matters . "
All three national polls asked voters the electability question in a general election matchup .
They show Clinton in a dead heat with McCain -- both coming in with 46 percent .
Obama , meanwhile , leads McCain by seven points -- 49 to 42 percent .
So why does Obama do better ?
Here 's his answer :
" It 's a choice between going into the general election with Republicans and independents already united against us , or running with a campaign that has already united Americans of all parties around the agenda for change .
Now that 's the choice , " Obama has said .
Independents are crucial swing voters .
They give McCain a solid lead over Clinton , according to the New York Times - CBS News poll .
But independents abandon McCain for Obama .
If Obama 's the alternative , McCain 's support among independents drops from 52 percent to 36 percent .
The difference in electability looks small , and neither Democrat looks like a sure winner or a sure loser .
But the belief that Obama is more electable is taking hold .
The national " poll of polls " consists of three surveys : AP - IPSOS ( February 22 - 24 ) , USA Today / Gallup ( February 21 - 24 ) , and CBS / NYTimes ( February 20 - 24 ) .

INTRODUCTION
The following is a treatise on the unconstitutionality of the Fourteenth Amendment , based upon the most comprehensive research and documentation of every angle in the unlawful procedures involved in its purported adoption .
This work was done , and is offered with a realization that the federal courts are not ready to give consideration to the subject , because the U. S. Supreme Court and inferior courts have used the the 14th Amendment to enlarge upon their ungranted powers without limit or reserve .
Socialist organized and directed violent mass demonstrations and armed rebellion in the nation ’s capital and in many American cities are extorting from Congress more and more radical legislation .
These “ laws ” threaten basic personal freedom , private property rights and encroach upon and destroy more and more the constitutional right of self - government by the people on state and local levels .
Executive orders extend toward further federal control of every aspect of life in the Nation , either by shutting off federal funds to those who will not subscribe to their forced dictums or by court injunctive orders to the same effect .
There lies the greatest danger to our country ’s future : so that the end result in the next or succeeding generation can only be a deteriorated industrial empire and a weakened national defense , which must result in abject surrender to our mortal enemy , – world - wide Socialism and Totalitarianism .
That is the ultimate end of the subversive use of the unconstitutional 14th Amendment .
It is hoped that this treatise , exposing the absolute unconstitutionality of the l4th amendment , will be given sufficient general circulation and publicity to awaken a “ consensus ” of public sentiment to reach the seats of power in Washington , D. C. , so that ultimately the stamp of unconstitutionality may be placed upon the 14th amendment , and constitutional government and national sanity once more may prevail .

THE 14th AMENDMENT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
The purported 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution is and should be held to be ineffective , invalid , null , void and unconstitutional for the following reasons :
1 . The Joint Resolution proposing said amendment was not submitted to or adopted by a Constitutional Congress per Article I , Section 3 , and Article V of the U. S. Constitution .
2 . The Joint Resolution was not submitted to the President for his approval as required by Article I , Section 7 of the U. S. Constitution .
3 . The proposed 14th Amendment was rejected by more than one - fourth of all the States then in the Union , and it was never ratified by three - fourths of all the States in the Union as required by Article V of the U. S. Constitution .
CHAPTER I
THE UNCONSTlTUTIONAL CONGRESS
The U. S. Constitution provides :
Article I , Section 3 . “ The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State ”
Article V provides : “ No State , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate . ”
The fact that 28 Senators had been unlawfully excluded from the U. S. Senate , in order to secure a two - thirds vote for adoption of the Joint Resolution proposing the 14th Amendment is shown by Resolutions of protest adopted by the following State Legislatures :
The New Jersey Legislature by Resolution of March 27 , 1868 , protested as follows :
“ The said proposed amendment not having yet received the assent the three - fourths of the states , which is necessary to make it valid , the natural and constitutional right of this state to withdraw its assent is undeniable “ .
“ That it being necessary by the constitution that every amendment to the same should be proposed by two - thirds of both houses of congress , the authors of said proposition , for the purpose of securing the assent of the requisite majority , determined to , and did , exclude from the said two houses eighty representatives from eleven states of the union , upon the pretence that there were no such states in the Union : but , finding that two - thirds of the remainder of the said houses could not be brought to assent to the said proposition , they deliberately formed and carried out the design of mutilating the integrity of the United States senate , and without any pretext or justification , other than the possession of the power , without the right , and in palpable violation of the constitution , ejected a member of their own body , representing this state , and thus practically denied to New Jersey its equal suffrage in the senate , and thereby nominally secured the vote of two - thirds of the said house s . ”
The Alabama Legislature protested against being deprived of representation in the Senate of the U. S. Congress .
[ Cite 2 ]
The Texas Legislature by Resolution on October 15 , 1866 , protested as follows :
“ The amendment to the Constitution proposed by this joint resolution as article XIV is presented to the Legislature of Texas for its action thereon , under Article V of that Constitution .
This article V , providing the mode of making amendments to that instrument , contemplates the participation by all the States through their representatives in Congress , in proposing amendments .
As representatives from nearly one - third of the States were excluded from the Congress proposing the amendments , the constitutional requirement was not complied with ; it was violated in letter and in spirit ; and the proposing of these amendments to States which were excluded from all participation in their initiation in Congress , is a nullity . ”
The Arkansas Legislature , by Resolution on December 17 , 1866 , protested as follows :
“ The Constitution authorized two - thirds of both houses of Congress to propose amendments ; and , as eleven States mere excluded from deliberation and decision upon the one now submitted , the conclusion is inevitable that it is not proposed by legal authority , but in palpable violation of the Constitution . ”
The Georgia Legislature , by Resolution on November 9 , 1866 , protested as follows :
“ Since the reorganization of the State government , Georgia has elected Senators and Representatives .
So has every other State .
They have been arbitrarily refused admission to their seats , not on the ground that the qualifications of the members elected did not conform to the fourth paragraph , second section , first article of the Constitution , but because their right of representation was denied by a portion of the States having equal but not greater rights than themselves .
They have in fact been forcibly excluded ; and , inasmuch as all legislative power granted by the States to the Congress is defined , and this power of exclusion is not among the powers expressly or by implication , the assemblage , at the capitol , of representatives from a portion of the States , to the exclusion of the representatives of another portion , cannot be a constitutional Congress , when the representation of each State forms an integral part of the whole .
This amendment is tendered to Georgia for ratification , under that power in the Constitution which authorizes two - thirds of the Congress to propose amendments .
We have endeavored to establish that Georgia had a right , in the first place , as a part of the Congress , to act upon the question , ‘ Shall these amendments be proposed ? ’
Every other excluded State had the same right .
The first constitutional privilege has been arbitrarily denied .
Had these amendments been submitted to a constitutional Congress , they never would have been proposed to the States .
Two - thirds of the whole Congress never would have proposed to eleven States voluntarily to reduce their political power in the Union , and at the same time , disfranchise the larger portion of the intellect , integrity and patriotism of eleven co-equal States . ”
The Florida Legislature , by Resolution of December 5 , 1866 , protested as follows :
“ Let this alteration be made in the organic system and some new and more startling demands may or may not be required by the predominant party previous to allotting the ten States now unlawfully and unconstitutionally deprived of their right of representation to enter the Halls of the National Legislature .
Their right to representation is guaranteed by the Constitution of this country and there is no act , not even that of rebellion , can deprive them of its exercise . ”
The South Carolina Legislature by Resolution of November 27 , 1866 , protested as follows :
“ Eleven of the Southern States , including South Carolina , are deprived of their representation in Congress .
Although their Senators and Representatives have been duly elected and have presented themselves for the purpose of taking their seats , their credentials have , in most instances , been laid upon the table without being read , or have been referred to a committee , who have failed to make any report on the subject .
In short , Congress has refused to exercise its Constitutional functions , and decide either upon the election , the return , or the qualification of these selected by the States and people to represent us .
Some of the Senators and Representatives from the Southern States were prepared to take the test oath , but even these have been persistently ignored , and kept out of the seats to which they were entitled under the Constitution and laws .
Hence this amendment has not been proposed by ‘ two - thirds of both Houses ’ of a legally constituted Congress , and is not , Constitutionally or legitimately , before a single Legislature for ratification . ”
The North Carolina Legislature protested by Resolution of December 6 , 1866 as follows :
“ The Federal Constitution declares , in substance , that Congress shall consist of a House of Representatives , composed of members apportioned among the respective States in the ratio of their population , and of a Senate , composed of two members from each State .
And in the Article which concerns Amendments , it is expressly provided that ‘ no State , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate . ’
The contemplated Amendment was not proposed to the States by a Congress thus constituted .
At the time of its adoption , the eleven seceding States were deprived of representation both in the Senate and House , although they all , except the State of Texas , had Senators and Representatives duly elected and claiming their privileges under the Constitution .
In consequence of this , these States had no voice on the important question of proposing the Amendment .
Had they been allowed to give their votes , the proposition would doubtless have failed to command the required two - thirds majority .
If the votes of these States are necessary to a valid ratification of the Amendment , they were equally necessary on the question of proposing it to the States ; for it would be difficult , in the opinion of the Committee , to show by what process in logic , men of intelligence could arrive at a different conclusion . ”
CHAPTER II
JOlNT RESOLUTlON INEFFECTIVE
Article I , Section 7 of the United States Constitution provides that not only every bill which shall have been passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States Congress , but that :
“ Every Order , Resolution , or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of Adjournment ) shall be presented to the President of the United States ; and before the Same shall take Effect , shall be approved by him , or being disapproved by him shall be repassed by two - thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill . ”
The Joint Resolution proposing the 14th Amendment [ Cite 9 ] was never presented to the President of the United States for his approval , as President Andrew Johnson stated in his message on June 22 , 1866 . [ Cite 10 ]
Therefore , the Joint Resolution did not take effect .
CHAPTER III
PROPOSED AMENDMENT NEVER RATlFIED BY THREE -FOURTHS OF THE STATES
1. Pretermitting the ineffectiveness of said resolution , as above , fifteen ( 15 ) States out of the then thirty - seven ( 37 ) States of the Union rejected the proposed 14th Amendment between the date of its submission to the States by the Secretary of State on June 16 , 1866 and March 24 , 1868 , thereby further nullifying said resolution and making it impossible for its ratification by the constitutionally required three - fourths of such States , as shown by the rejections thereof by the Legislatures of the following states :
Texas rejected the 14th Amendment on Oct. 27 , 1866 .
Georgia rejected the 14th Amendment on Nov. 9 , 1866 .
Florida rejected the 14th Amendment on Dec. 6 , 1866 .
Alabama rejected the 14th Amendment on Dec. 7 , 1866 .
North Carolina rejected the 14th Amendment on Dec. 14 , 1866 .
Arkansas rejected the 14th Amendment on Dec. 17 , 1866 .
South Carolina rejected the 14th Amendment on Dec. 20 , 1866 .
Kentucky rejected the 14th Amendment on Jan. 8 , 1867 .
Virginia rejected the 14th Amendment on Jan. 9 , 1867 .
Louisiana rejected the 14th Amendment on Feb. 6 , 1867 .
Delaware rejected the 14th Amendment on Feb. 7 , 1867 .
Maryland rejected the l4th amendment on Mar. 23 , 1867 .
Mississippi rejected the 14th Amendment on Jan. 31 , 1867 .
Ohio rejected the 14th amendment on Jan. 16 , 1868 .
New Jersey rejected the 14th Amendment on Mar. 24 , 1868 .
There was no question that all of the Southern states which rejected the 14th Amendment had legally constituted governments , were fully recognized by the federal government , and were functioning as member states of the Union at the time of their rejection .
President Andrew Johnson , in his Veto message of March 2 , 1867 , pointed out that :
“ It is not denied that the States in question have each of them an actual government with all the powers , executive , judicial and legislative , which properly belong to a free State .
They are organized like the other States of the Union , and , like them they make , administer , and execute the laws which concern their domestic affairs . ”
If further proof were needed that these States were operating under legally constituted governments as member States in the Union .
the ratification of the 13th Amendment by December 8 , 1865 undoubtedly supplies this official proof .
If the Southern States were not member States of the Union , the 13th amendment would not have been submitted to their Legislatures for ratification .
2 . The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution was proposed by Joint Resolution of Congress and was approved February 1 , 1865 by President Abraham Lincoln , as required by Article I , Section 7 of the United States Constitution .
The President ’s signature is affixed to the Resolution .
The 13th Amendment was ratified by 27 states of the then 36 states of the Union , including the Southern States of Virginia , Louisiana , Arkansas , South Carolina , Alabama , North Carolina and Georgia .
This is shown by the Proclamation of the Secretary of State December 18 , 1865 .
Without the votes of these 7 Southern State Legislatures the 13th Amendment would have failed .
There can be no doubt but that the ratification by these 7 Southern States of the 13th Amendment again established the fact that their Legislatures and State governments were duly and lawfully constituted and functioning as such under their State Constitutions .
3. Furthermore , on April 2 , 1866 , President Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation that ,
“ the insurrection which heretofore existed in the States of Georgia , South Carolina , Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Alabama , Louisiana , Arkansas , Mississippi and Florida is at an end , and is henceforth to be so regarded . ”
On August 20 , 1866 , President Andrew Johnson issued another proclamation pointing out the fact that the House of Representatives and Senate had adopted identical Resolutions on July 22nd and July 26th , 1861 , that the Civil War forced by disunionists of the Southern States , was not waged for the purpose of conquest or to overthrow the rights and established institutions of those States , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and to preserve the Union with all equality and rights of the several states unimpaired , and that as soon as these objects ere accomplished , the war ought to cease .
The President ’s proclamation on June 13 , 1866 , declared the insurrection in the State of Tennessee had been suppressed .
The President ’s proclamation on April 2 , 1866 , declared the insurrection in the other Southern States , except Texas , no longer existed .
On August 20 , 1866 , the President proclaimed that the insurrection in the State of Texas had been completely ended ; and his proclamation continued :
“ the insurrection which heretofore existed in the State of Texas is at an end , and is to be henceforth so regarded in that State , as in the other States before named in which the said insurrection was proclaimed to be at an end by the aforesaid proclamation of the second day of April , one thousand , eight hundred and sixty - six .
And I do further proclaim that the said insurrection is at an end , and that peace , order , tranquillity , and civil authority now exist , in and throughout the whole of the United States of America . ”
4 . When the State of Louisiana rejected the 14th Amendment on February 6 , 1867 , making the 10th state to have rejected the same , or more than one - fourth of the total number of 36 states of the Union as of that date , thus leaving less than three - fourths of the states possibly to ratify the same , the Amendment failed of ratification in fact and in law , and it could not have been revived except by a new Joint Resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives in accordance with Constitutional requirement .
5 . Faced with the positive failure of ratification of the 14th Amendment , both Houses of Congress passed over the veto of the President three Acts known as Reconstruction Acts , between the dates of March 2 and July 19 , 1867 , especially the third of said Acts , 15 Stat. p. 14 etc. , designed illegally to remove with “ Military force ” the lawfully constituted State Legislatures of the 10 Southern States of Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Alabama , Mississippi , Arkansas , Louisiana and Texas .
In President Andrew Johnson ’s Veto message on the Reconstruction Act of March 2 , 1867 , he pointed out these unconstitutionalities :
“ If ever the American citizen should be left to the free exercise of his own judgment , it is when he is engaged in the work of forming the fundamental law under which he is to live .
That work is his work , and it cannot properly be taken out of his hands .
All this legislation proceeds upon the contrary Assumption that the people of each of these States shall have no constitution , except such as may be arbitrarily dictated by Congress , and formed under the restraint of military rule .
A plain statement of facts makes this evident .
In all these States there are existing constitutions , framed in the accustomed way by the people .
Congress , however , declares that these constitutions are not ‘ loyal and republican , ’ and requires the people to form them anew .
What , then , in the opinion of Congress , is necessary to make the constitution of a State ‘ loyal and republican ? ’
The original act answers the question : ‘ It is universal negro suffrage , a question which the federal Constitution leaves exclusively to the States themselves .
All this legislative machinery of martial law , military coercion , and political disfranchisement is avowedly for that purpose and none other .
The existing constitutions of the ten States conform to the acknowledged standards of loyalty and republicanism .
Indeed , if there are degrees in republican forms of government , their constitutions are more republican now , than when these States – four of which were members of the original thirteen – first became members of the Union . ”
In President Andrew Johnson ’s Veto message on the Reconstruction Act on July 19 , 1867 , he pointed out various unconstitutionalities as follows :
“ The veto of the original bill of the 2d of March was based on two distinct grounds , the interference of Congress in matters strictly appertaining to the reserved powers of the States , and the establishment of military tribunals for the trial of citizens in time of peace .
A singular contradiction is apparent here .
Congress declares these local State governments to be illegal governments , and then provides that these illegal governments shall be carried on by federal officers , who are to perform the very duties on its own officers by this illegal State authority .
It certainly would be a novel spectacle if Congress should attempt to carry on a legal State government by the agency of its own officers .
It is yet more strange that Congress attempts to sustain and carry on an illegal State government by the same federal agency .
It is now too late to say that these ten political communities are not States of this Union .
Declarations to the contrary made in these three acts are contradicted again and again by repeated acts of legislation enacted by Congress from the year 1861 to the year 1867 .
During that period , while these States were in actual rebellion , and after that rebellion was brought to a close , they have been again and again recognized as States of the Union .
Representation has been apportioned to them as States .
They have peen divided into judicial districts for the holding of district and circuit courts of the United States , as States of the Union only can be districted .
The last act on this subject was passed July 28 , 1866 , by which every one of these ten States was arranged into districts and circuits .
They have been called upon by Congress to act through their legislatures upon at least two amendments to the Constitution of the United States .
As States they have ratified one amendment , which required the vote of twenty - seven States of the thirty - six then composing the Union .
When the requisite twenty - seven votes were given in favor of that amendment – seven of which votes were given by seven of these ten States – it was proclaimed to be apart of the Constitution of the United States , and slavery was declared no longer to exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction .
If these seven States were not legal States of the Union , it follows as an inevitable consequence that in some of the States slavery yet exists .
It does not exist in these seven States , for they have abolished it also in their State constitutions ; but Kentucky not having done so , it would still remain in that State .
But , in truth , if this assumption that these States have no legal State governments be true , then the abolition of slavery by these illegal governments binds no one , for Congress now denies to these States the power to abolish slavery by denying to them the power to elect a legal State legislature , or to frame a constitution for any purpose , even for such a purpose as the abolition of slavery .
As to the other constitutional amendment having reference to suffrage , it happens that these States have not accepted it .
The consequence is , that it has never been proclaimed or understood , even by Congress , to be a part of the Constitution of the United States .
The Senate of the United States has repeatedly given its sanction to the appointment of judges , district attorneys , and marshals for every one of these States ; yet , if they are not legal States , not one of these judges is authorized to hold a court .
So , too , both houses of Congress have passed appropriation bills to pay all these judges , attorneys , and officers of the United States for exercising their functions in these States .
Again , in the machinery of the internal revenue laws , all these States are districted , not as ‘ Territories , ’ but as ‘ States . ’
So much for continuous legislative recognition .
The instances cited , however , fall far short of all that might be enumerated .
Executive recognition , as is well known , has been frequent and unwavering .
The same may be said as to judicial recognition through the Supreme Court of the United States .
To me these considerations are conclusive of the unconstitutionality of this part of the bill now before me , and I earnestly commend their consideration to the deliberate judgment of Congress .
Within a period less than a year the legislation of Congress has attempted to strip the executive department of the government of some of its essential powers .
The Constitution , and the oath provided in it , devolve upon the President the power and duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed .
The Constitution , in order to carry out this power , gives him the choice of the agents , and makes them subject to his control and supervision .
But in the execution of these laws the constitutional obligation upon the President remains , but the powers to exercise that constitutional duty is effectually taken away .
The military commander is , as to the power of appointment , made to take the place of its President , and the General of the Army the place of the Senate ; and any attempt on the part of the President to assert his own constitutional power may , under pretence of law , be met by official insubordination .
It is to be feared that these military officers , looking to the authority given by these laws rather than to the letter of the Constitution , will recognize no authority but the commander of the district and the General of the army .
If there were no other objection than this to this proposed legislation , it would be sufficient . ”
No one can contend that the Reconstruction Acts were ever upheld as being valid and constitutional .
They were brought into question , but the Courts either avoided decision or were prevented by Congress from finally adjudicating upon their constitutionality .
In Mississippi v. President Andrew Johnson , ( 4 Wall. 475-502 ) , where the suit sought to enjoin the President of the United States from enforcing provisions of the Reconstruction Acts , the U. S. Supreme Court held that the President cannot be enjoined because for the Judicial Department of the government to attempt to enforce the performance of the duties by the President might be justly characterized , in the language of Chief Justice Marshall , as “ an absurd and excessive extravagance . ”
The Court further said that if the Court granted the injunction against enforcement of the Reconstruction Acts , and if the President refused obedience , it is needless to observe that the Court is without power to enforce its process .
AND NOW TO THE COURT .
In a joint action , the states of Georgia and Mississippi brought suit against the President and the Secretary of War , ( 6 Wall .
50 - 78 , 154 U.S. 554 ) .
The Court said that :
“ The bill then sets forth that the intent and design of the acts of Congress , as apparent on their face and by their terms , are to overthrow and annul this existing state government , and to erect another and different government in its place , unauthorized by the Constitution and in defiance of its guaranties ; and that , in furtherance of this intent and design , the defendants , the Secretary of War , the General of the Army , and Major - General Pope , acting under orders of the President , are about setting in motion a portion of the army to take military possession of the state , and threaten to subvert her government and subject her people to military rule ; that the state is holding inadequate means to resist the power and force of the Executive Department of the United States ; and she therefore insists that such protection can , and ought to be afforded by a decree or order of his court in the premises . ”
The applications for injunction by these two states to prohibit the Executive Department from carrying out the provisions of the Reconstruction Acts directed to the overthrow of their government , including the dissolution of their state legislatures , were denied on the grounds that the organization of the government into three great departments , the executive , legislative and judicial , carried limitations of the powers of each by the Constitution .
This case went the same way as the previous case of Mississippi against President Johnson and was dismissed without adjudication upon the constitutionality of the Reconstruction Acts .
In another case , ex parte William H. McCardle ( 7 Wall. 506-515 ) , a petition for the writ of habeas corpus for unlawful restraint by military force of a citizen not in the military service of the United States was before the United States Supreme Court .
After the case was argued and taken under advisement , and before conference in regard to the decision to be made , Congress passed an emergency Act , ( Act March 27 , 1868 , 15 Stat. at L. 44 ) , vetoed by the President and re-passed over his veto , repealing the jurisdiction of the U. S. Supreme Court in such case .
Accordingly , the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal without passing upon the constitutionality of the ReconstructionActs , under which the non-military citizen was held by the military without benefit of writ of habeas corpus , in violation of Section 9 , Article I of the U. S. Constitution which prohibits the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus .
That Act of Congress placed the Reconstruction acts beyond judicial recourse and avoided tests of constitutionality .
It is recorded that one of the Supreme Court Justices , Grier , protested against the action of the Court as follows :
“ This case was fully argued in the beginning of this month .
It is a case which involves the liberty and rights , not only of the appellant , but of millions of our fellow citizens .
The country and the parties had a right to expect that it would receive the immediate and solemn attention of the court .
By the postponement of this case we shall subject ourselves , whether justly or unjustly , to the imputation that we have evaded the performance of a duty imposed on us by the Constitution , and waited for legislative interposition to supersede our action , and relieve us from responsibility .
I am not willing to be a partaker of the eulogy or opprobrium that may follow .
I can only say …
I am ashamed that such opprobrium should be cast upon the court and that it cannot be refuted . ”
The ten States were organized into Military Districts under the unconstitutional “ Reconstruction Acts , ” their lawfully constituted Legislatures illegally were removed by “ military force , ” and they were replaced by rump , so - called Legislatures , seven of which carried out military orders and pretended to ratify the 14th Amendment , as follows :
Arkansas on April 6 , 1868 ;
North Carolina on July 2 , 1868 ;
Florida on June 9 , 1868 ;
Louisiana on July 9 , 1868 ;
South Carolina on July 9 , 1868 ;
Alabama on July 13 , 1868 ;
Georgia on July 21 , 1868 .
6 . Of the above 7 States whose Legislatures were removed and replaced by rump , so - called Legislatures , six ( 6 ) Legislatures of the States of Louisiana , Arkansas , South Carolina , Alabama , North Carolina and Georgia had ratified the 13th amendment , as shown by the Secretary of State ’s Proclamation of December 18 , 1865 , without which 6 States ’ ratifications , the 13th Amendment could not and would not have been ratified because said 6 States made a total of 27 out of 36 States or exactly three - fourths of the number required by Article V of the Constitution for ratification .
Furthermore , governments of the States of Louisiana and Arkansas had been re-established under a Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln December 8 , 1863 .
The government of North Carolina had been re-established under a Proclamation issued by President Andrew Johnson dated May 29 , 1865 .
The government of Georgia had been re-established under a proclamation issued by President Andrew Johnson dated June 17 , 1865 .
The government of Alabama had been re-established under a Proclamation issued by President Andrew Johnson dated June 21 , 1865 .
The government of South Carolina had been re-established under a Proclamation issued by President Andrew Johnson dated June 30 , 1865 .
These three “ Reconstruction Acts ” under which the above State legislatures were illegally removed and unlawful rump or puppet so - called Legislatures were substituted in a mock effort to ratify the 14th amendment , were unconstitutional , null and void , ab initio , and all acts done thereunder were also null and void , including the purported ratification of the l4th Amendment by said 6 Southern puppet State Legislatures of Arkansas , North Carolina , Louisiana , South Carolina , Alabama and Georgia .
Those Reconstruction Acts of Congress and all acts and thing unlawfully done thereunder were in violation of Article IV , Section 4 of the United States Constitution , which required the United States to guarantee every State in the Union a republican form of government .
They violated article I , Section 3 , and article V of the Constitution , which entitled every State in the Union to two Senators , because under provisions of these unlawful acts of Congress , 10 States were deprived of having two Senators , or equal suffrage in the Senate .
7 . The Secretary of State expressed doubt as to whether three - fourths of the required states had ratified the 14th Amendment , as shown by his Proclamation of July 20 , 1868 .
Promptly on July 21 , 1868 , a Joint Resolution was adopted by the Senate and House of Representatives declaring that three - fourths of the several States of the Union had ratified the 14th Amendment .
That resolution , however , included purported ratifications by the unlawful puppet Legislatures of 5 States , Arkansas , North Carolina , Louisiana , South Carolina and Alabama , which had previously rejected the 14th Amendment by action of their ) awful )y constituted Legislatures , as above shown .
This Joint Resolution assumed to perform the function of the Secretary of State in whom Congress , by Act of April 20 , 1818 , had vested the function of issuing such proclamation declaring the ratification of Constitutional Amendments .
The Secretary of State bowed to the action of Congress and issued his Proclamation of July 28 , 1868 , in which he stated that he was as acting under authority of the Act of April 20 , 1818 , but pursuant to said Resolution of July 21 , 1868 .
He listed three - fourths or so of the then 37 states as having ratified the 14th Amendment , including the purported ratification of the unlawful puppet Legislatures of the States of Arkansas , North Carolina , Louisiana , South Carolina and Alabama .
Without said 6 unlawful purported ratifications there would have been only 26 states left to ratify out of 37 when a minimum of 28 states was required for ratification by three - fourths of the States of the Union .
The Joint Resolution of Congress and the resulting Proclamation of the Secretary of State also included purported ratifications by the States of Ohio and New Jersey , although the Proclamation recognized the fact that the Legislatures of said states , several months previously , had withdrawn their ratifications and effectively rejected the 14th Amendment in January , 1868 , and April , 1868 .
Therefore , deducting these two states from the purported ratifications of the 14th amendment , only 23 State ratifications at most could be claimed ; whereas the ratification of 28 States , or three - fourths of 37 States in the Union , were required to ratify the 14th Amendment .
From all of the above documented historic facts , it is inescapable that the 14th Amendment never was validly adopted as an article of the Constitution , that it has no legal effect , and it should be declared by the Courts to be unconstitutional , and therefore null , void and of no effect .
CHAPTER IV
THE CONSTlTUTION STRIKES THE 14TH AMENDMENT WITH NULLITY
The defenders of the 14th Amendment contend that the U. S. Supreme Court has finally decided upon its validity .
Such is not the case .
In what is considered the leading case , Coleman v. Miller , 507 U. S. 448 , 59 S. Ct. 972 , the U. S. Supreme Court did not uphold the validity of the 14th Amendment .
In that case , the Court brushed aside constitutional questions as though they did not exist .
For instance , the Court made the statement that :
“ The legislatures of Georgia , North Carolina and South Carolina had rejected the amendment in November and December , 1866 .
New governments were erected in those States ( and in others ) under the direction of Congress .
The new legislatures ratified the amendment , that of North Carolina on July 4 , 1868 , that of South Carolina on July 9 , 1868 , and that of Georgia on July 21 , 1868 . ”
And the Court gave no consideration to the fact that Georgia , North Carolina and South Carolina were three of the original states of the Union with valid and existing constitutions on an equal footing with the other original states and those later admitted into the Union .
What constitutional right did Congress have to remove those state governments and their legislatures under unlawful military power set up by the unconstitutional “ Reconstruction Acts , ” which had for their purpose , the destruction and removal of these legal state governments and the nullification of their Constitutions ?
The fact that these three states and seven other Southern States had existing Constitutions , were recognized as states of the Union , again and again ; had been divided into judicial districts for holding their district and circuit courts of the United States ; had been called upon by Congress to act through their legislatures upon two Amendments , the 13th and 14th , and by their ratifications had actually made possible the adoption of the 13th Amendment ; as well as their state governments having been re-established under Presidential Proclamations , as shown by President Andrew Johnson ’s Veto message and proclamations , were all brushed aside by the Court in COLEMAN by the statement that :
“ New governments were erected in those States ( and in others ) under the direction of Congress . ” and that these new legislatures ratified the Amendment .
The U. S. Supreme Court overlooked that it previously had held that at no time were these Southern States out of the Union .
White v. Hart , 1871 , 13 Wall .
646 , 654 .
In COLEMAN , the Court did not adjudicate upon the invalidity of the Acts of Congress which set aside those state Constitutions and abolished their state legislatures , - the Court simply referred to the fact that their legally constituted legislatures had rejected the 14th Amendment and that the “ new legislatures ” had ratified the Amendment .
The Court overlooked the fact , too , that the State of Virginia was also one of the original states with its Constitution and Legislature in full operation under its civil government at the time .
The Court also ignored the fact that the other six Southern States , which were given the same treatment by Congress under the unconstitutional “ Reconstruction Acts ” , all had legal constitutions and a republican form of government in each state , as was recognized by Congress by its admission of those states into the Union .
The Court certainly must take judicial cognizance of the fact that before a new state is admitted by Congress into the Union , Congress enacts an Enabling Act , to enable the inhabitants of the territory to adopt a Constitution to set up a republican form of government as a condition precedent to the admission of the state into the Union , and upon approval of such Constitution , Congress then passes the Act of Admission of such state .
All this was ignored and brushed aside by the Court in the COLEMAN case .
However , in COLEMAN the Court inadvertently said this :
“ Whenever official notice is received at the Department of State that any amendment proposed to the Constitution of the United States has been adopted , according to the provisions of the Constitution , the Secretary of State shall forthwith cause the amendment to be published , with his certificate , specifying the States by which the same may have been adopted , and that the same has become valid , to all intents and purposes , as a part of the Constitution of the United States . ”
In Hawse v. Smith , 1920 , 253 U. S. 221 , 40 S. Ct. 227 , the U. S. Supreme Court unmistakably held :
“ The fifth article is a grant of authority by the people to Congress .
The determination of the method of ratification is the exercise of a national power specifically granted by the Constitution ; that power is conferred upon Congress , and is limited to two methods , by action of the Legislatures of three - fourths of the states , or conventions in a like number of states .
Dodge v. Woolsey .
18 How .
331 , 348 , 15 L. Ed. 401 .
The framers of the Constitution might have adopted a different method .
Ratification might have been left to a vote of the people , or to some authority of government other than that selected .
The language of the article is plain , and admits of no doubt in its interpretation .
It is not the function of courts or legislative bodies , national or state , to alter the method which the Constitution has fixed . ”
We submit that in none of the cases , in which the Court avoided the constitutional issues involved in the composition of the Congress which adopted the Joint Resolution for the 14th Amendment , did the Court pass upon the constitutionality of the Congress which purported to adopt the Joint Resolution for the 14th Amendment , with 80 Representatives and 23 Senators , in effect , forcibly ejected or denied their seats and their votes on the Joint Resolution proposing the Amendment , in order to pass the same by a two - thirds vote , as pointed out in the New Jersey Legislature Resolution on March 27 , 1868 .
The constitutional requirements set forth in Article V of the Constitution permit the Congress to propose amendments only whenever two - thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary , - that is , two - thirds of both houses as then constituted without forcible ejections .
Such a fragmentary Congress also violated the constitutional requirements of Article V that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate .
There is no such thing as giving life to an amendment illegally proposed or never legally ratified by three - fourths of the states .
There is no such thing as amendment by laches ; no such thing as amendment by waiver ; no such thing as amendment by acquiescence ; and no such thing as amendment by any other means whatsoever except the means specified in Article V of the Constitution itself .
It does not suffice to say that there have been hundreds of cases decided under the 14th Amendment to supply the constitutional difficiencies in its proposal or ratification as required by Article V .
If hundreds of litigants did not question the validity of the 14th Amendment , or questioned the same perfunctorily without submitting documentary proof of the facts of record which made its purported adoption unconstitutional , their failure cannot change the Constitution for the millions in America .
The same thing is true of laches ; the same thing is true of acquiescence ; the same thing is true of ill considered court decisions .
To ascribe constitutional life to an alleged amendment which never came into being according to specific methods laid down in Article V can not be done without doing violence to Article V itself .
This is true , because the only question open to the courts is whether the alleged 14th Amendment became a part of the Constitution through a method required by Article V .
Anything beyond that which a court is called upon to hold in order to validate an amendment , would be equivalent to writing into Article V another mode of amendment which has never been authorized by the people of the United States .
On this point , therefore , the question is , was the 14th Amendment proposed and ratified in accordance with Article V ?
In answering this question , it is of no real moment that decisions have been rendered in which the parties did not contest or submit proper evidence , or the Court assumed that there was a 14th Amendment .
If a statute never in fact passed by Congress , through some error of administration and printing got into the published reports of the statutes , and if under such supposed statute courts had levied punishment upon a number of persons charged under it , and if the error in the published volume was discovered and the fact became known that no such statute had ever passed in Congress , it is unthinkable that the Courts would continue to administer punishment in similar cases , on a non-existent statute because prior decisions had done so .
If that be true as to a statute we need only realize the greater truth when the principle is applied to the solemn question of the contents of the Constitution .
While the defects in the method of proposing and the subsequent method of computing “ ratification ” is briefed elsewhere , it should be noted that the failure to comply with Article V began with the first action by Congress .
The very Congress which proposed the alleged 14th amendment under the first part of Article V was itself , at that very time , violating the last part as well as the first part of Article V of the Constitution .
We shall see how this was done .
There is one , and only one , provision of the Constitution of the United States which is forever immutable – which can never be changed or expunged .
The Courts cannot alter it ; the executives cannot change it ; the Congress cannot change it ; the State themselves – even all the States in perfect concert – cannot amend it in any manner whatsoever , whether they act through conventions called for the purpose or through their legislatures .
Not even the unanimous vote of every voter in the United States could amend this provision .
It is a perpetual fixture in the Constitution , so perpetual and so fixed that if the people of the United States desired to change or exclude it , they would be compelled to abolish the Constitution and start afresh .
The unalterable provision is this . . . “ that no State , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate . ”
A state , by its own consent , may waive this right of equal suffrage , but that is the only legal method by which a failure to accord this immutable right of equal suffrage in the Senate can be justified .
Certainly not by forcible ejection and denial by a majority in Congress , as was done for the adoption of the Joint Resolution for the 14th Amendment .
Statements by the Court in the COLEMAN case that Congress was left in complete control of the mandatory process , and therefore it was a political affair for Congress to decide if an amendment had been ratified , does not square with Article V of the Constitution which shows no intention to leave Congress in charge of deciding whether there has been a ratification .
Even a constitutionally recognized Congress is given but one volition in article V , that is , to vote whether to propose an Amendment on its own initiative .
The remaining steps by Congress are mandatory .
If two - thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary , Congress shall propose amendments ; if the Legislatures of two - thirds of the States make application , Congress shall call a convention .
For the Court to give Congress any power beyond that to be found in Article V is to write the new material into Article V .
It would be inconceivable that the Congress of the United States could propose , compel submission to , and then give life to an invalid amendment by resolving that its effort had succeeded , - regardless of compliance with the positive provisions of Article V .
It should need no further citations to sustain the proposition that neither the Joint Resolution proposing the 14th amendment nor its ratification by the required three - fourths of the States in the Union were in compliance with the requirements of Article V of the Constitution .
When the mandatory provisions of the Constitution are violated , the Constitution itself strikes with nullity the Act that did violence to its provisions .
Thus , the Constitution strikes with nullity the purported 14th Amendment .
The Courts , bound by oath to support the Constitution , should review all of the evidence herein submitted and measure the facts proving violations of the mandatory provisions of the Constitution with Article V , and finally render judgment declaring said purported amendment never to have been adopted as required by the Constitution .
The Constitution makes it the sworn duty of the judges to uphold the Constitution which strikes with nullity the 14th Amendment .
And , as Chief Justice Marshall pointed out for a unanimous Court in Marbury v. Madison ( 1 Cranch 136 at 179 ) :
“ The framers of the constitution contemplated the instrument as a rule for the government of courts , as well as of the legislature . ”
“ Why does a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the constitution of the United States , if that constitution forms no rule for his government ? ”
“ If such be the real state of things , that is worse than solemn mockery .
To prescribe , or to take this oath , becomes equally a crime . ”
“ Thus , the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle , supposed to be essential to all written constitutions , courts , as well as other departments , are bound by that instrument . ”
The federal courts actually refuse to hear argument on the invalidity of the 14th Amendment , even when the issue is presented squarely by the pleadings and the evidence as above .
Only an aroused public sentiment in favor of preserving the Constitution and our institutions and freedoms under constitutional government , and the future security of our country , will break the political barrier which now prevents judicial consideration of the unconstitutionality of the 14th Amendment .

The proposed “ Corwin ” 13th of 1861 legalizing Slavery and acknowledging States rights , signed as approved by Buchanan two days before Lincoln ’s inauguration , and the Anti-Slavery Amendment , signed by then President Lincoln were the only two signed by presidents .
So President Andrew Johnson ’s argument was probably defective .
It may be helpful to know that the 14th amendment proclamations of July 20 , 1868 , cite 51 , and July 28 , 1868 , cite 53 , were issued as Presidential Executive Orders .

In this light the 14th ( amendment ) , which has perplexed many , is an Executive Order , not an ( Article ) of Amendment to the Constitution of the united States of America , albeit a statute and so remains an Executive Order .
What really counts are these points :
It is extremely difficult for a single Iranian man in his twenties to obtain a visa to visit countries in the West .
So when my 25 year old cousin lucked out and got a Schengen visa , we had to take advantage and travel to Europe -- his first visit across the borders of Iran .
The thing Americans take for granted the most : their passports , which allows them to travel freely .
Due to the US sanctions Iran is not allowed to buy new airplanes .
Instead , Iran Air -- once one of the world 's safest airlines -- now spends millions fixing the planes they already own and keeping them flying at any cost .
I did n't even trust the sticker that read " Life vest under your seat " ( roll over ) .
We did land safely in Cologne , Germany , but one of the plastic roof panels fell upon landing !
The mere sight of the Dom cathedral in Cologne will leave you breathless .
You can find better photos of this and other buildings and sites online .
I have tried to reduce the touristiness of my photos .
Also , let it be said that my observations can only be as good as my first impressions .
I would have to live in each of the cities we visit in order to be able to tell you how life really goes on there ...
We arrived on the final days of the Cologne ( Koln ) Carnival .
The mainstream American films and TV portrays Germans as David - Hasselfhof - loving , polka - music - listening people who do not know how to party .
That 's clearly not the case .
At the same time in Iran , bus loads of poor people were being dropped off in Tehran with a promise of food so that they march in celebration of the 29th anniversary of the revolution for TV cameras .
When a beverage becomes a symbol of freedom for you , you know you must have been living under an oppressive regime !
We got our first taste of " freedom " minutes after arriving .
Unlike America , you can buy your alcoholic beverage at any store , open the bottle and drink it out in the street .
So in a sense , there is more freedom in Germany than in the US .
Kolsch is the local beer in Cologne and at bars it is served in thin glasses .
This way you are always drinking cold beer .
The problem is that you just keep drinking without realizing how much you have had and you may in fact overdose on cold thirst - quenching beer !
Most buildings I 've been to in Cologne have lots of stairs and no elevators .
I am told this is because most these buildings were built before World War II and since Cologne was for the most part left undamaged , they have kept their old structure and have n't bothered adding elevators .
( UPDATE : Turns out , Cologne had heavy casualties during the war and I was mis-informed .
Read this . )
I always have an identity crisis when I visit Europe .
When people ask where I am from , I do n't know if I should say Tehran or LA .
If I say Tehran , then they question my American accent and mannerisms .
If I say LA , then they wonder why I do n't look like an " American ! "
Europeans in general do n't understand the concept of being something - American , in my case , Iranian - American .
At $ 1.47 a Euro , I found Europe to be very expensive .
Specially since I was traveling on borrowed - from - credit - card money !
For example , I once paid 4 Euros for a bottle of Coke at the airport .
That 's $ 5.88 for a 20 ounce bottle of Coke !
I could do nothing but to damn President Bush for the falling value of the US Dollar .
But luckily there are a great number of discount airlines that let you travel across Europe for very little money .
You can find them on AirNinja.com .
We flew on Germanwings to Barcelona , Spain , where we stayed at the Centric Point hostel found on hostelworld .com .
My world - traveling friend Tony helped me plan our trip .
Tony , congratulations for finishing your travels .
You 're an inspiration to us all ...
I immediately fell in love with Barcelona .
I have never said this about any city , but with Barcelona , it was love at first sight .
The city was alive and had a soul .
Most western European cities are rather soul - less and I can never see myself living in one .
But this was not the case with Barcelona .
One great thing about Barcelona is its beautiful architecture .
But what is impressive is not just the fabulous collection of buildings designed by Gaudi , here even the modern buildings look inspired .
There is a beautiful building peeking at you from every other corner .
Internet speeds are limited in Iran .
I still have a modem connection at home .
Plus half the internet is blocked by the Islamic censors .
So I caught up with the rest of the world wherever there was free high speed internet .
This creepy dude with no friends was using the free internet at the hostel on his Mac .
It seems that Facebook and MySpace are all the rage with kids everywhere .
A girl kissing her boyfriend on a bench by a Barcelona pier .
It is sad and pathetic that you never see people kissing in Tehran .
You only see them fighting and arguing .
What a shame , because Iranians are generally affectionate people .
But ours is a government that has banned even the very act of showing affection in a public space .
This is something you will never see in Los Angeles ; Bikes for rent provided by the city .
They are everywhere .
You can pick one up at the city center and drop it off by the beach .
Another couple kissing as a business woman on her lunch break looks on .
This is the famous beach featured in American movies and ads where women can go topless during the hot summer season .
Coming from Iran , I was just happy to see women free to show their hair !
Spanish girls are even more beautiful than I had anticipated .
And my image of them comes from watching the Spanish film Sex & Lucia !
One might find oneself fall head over heels with every other girl who walks by in Barcelona .
A homeless man sleeping underneath an ATM machine as a drunk homeless man approaches and later falls on him .
It was actually a funny scene .
But also sad I guess .
You do n't see many homeless people in Tehran .
I wonder if that is because they simply just die because unlike the developed countries , they can't live off of other people 's change in Iran ?!
Barcelona is truly a city that never sleeps .
The clubs open their doors at 1:00 am and together with the bars , they go on until the last guests leave .
This is at a time when in Los Angeles , the last call for drinks is at 1:30 am and the bars close at 2:00 am .
A view of Passeig de Garcia from our hostel room .
Barcelona is definitely a city I will come back to , and Spain is a country worth exploring .
Next stop was the world 's most overrated city : Paris .
I did n't like Paris the first time I visited it a few years back , so I had to give it a second chance .
And for some reason , I still did n't like it .
Paris is not the fairy tale city in Amelie , where Audrey Tatou asks to be gently kissed on the cheek .
Paris is the city in Irreversible , where Monica Bellucci violently gets raped and beaten .
But to be fair , those are the two extremes of what Paris is capable of being and you might find yourself closer to one or the other .
Paris itself features a number of iconic buildings that are in fact very beautiful .
But the people are the main problem .
The city is filled to the rim with immigrants who never assimilate and fit in because the French are too proud to ever accept them as French .
This is most visible with the bitter old French ladies who look at people like me and wonder " what 're you doing here ?!
Go back to where you come from ! "
Ancient Iranian art is on display at a section of the Louvre .
Us Iranians are too proud of our ancient past .
So proud that we forget to deal with our present .
This is partially due to our need to separate ourselves from our current regime .
We live in 500 B.C. as a means to distance ourselves from 2008 A. C.!
But too much pride leads to blindness .
The Mona Lisa being protected from thousands of tourists .
The TEV ( Tourist Eye View ) is something I have thought about extensively .
Tourists are like birds that pry in on the lives of people in countries they visit .
The more they exercise their TEVs , the better they will become in being able to look at their own lives with a TEV , and the easier it will become for them to overcome obstacles in life .
Valentine 's
Day in what is often dubbed the world 's most romantic city is just as pathetic as anywhere else in the world .
Love as a commodity has even found its way to Tehran .
We happened to walk by the Paris premiere of Paul Thomas Anderson 's There Will Be Blood on Champs - Elyse .
Unfortunately I did n't get to watch it and I will have to settle for the bootleg DVD to make it out to Tehran .
It 's a shame because he is one of my favorite filmmakers .
One that makes me wonder if I am cut out to make films .
Next stop was a small town in Germany called Rheinmunster near the French border where we visited my cousin 's uncle .
It turned out to be what I needed after Paris , where I suffered from a horrible fever .
I used our four nights in Rheinmunster to recover .
As is the case with small towns anywhere , there was nothing to do but to play cards and drink .
I once again let Jose get the best of me .
We spend our last days back in Cologne where we practiced the great Iranian tradition of buying soghati .
When you travel , you are supposed to bring back gifts to your friends and family .
Doner kabobs are really popular in Germany .
You find a wild variety of chicken and doner kabob joints in every other corner .
This is a gift of the Turkish people to the Germans .
America 's gift is McDonald's , Burger King , Subway , Pizza Hut and KFC , all of which we hit up as it is still very affordable .
Public pools and saunas in Germany are mixed gender .
And they have this little unwritten law where you have to enter the sauna butt - naked .
Men and women of all ages share a space wearing nothing but their skins .
It 'll be centuries before Iran and Iranians can reach this point .
As for America and Americans , perhaps it will take a few more decades .
On the Iran Air flight back to Tehran you are witness to an episode of Transformers !
As the plane inches closer to Tehran , women start to look less and less Western and more and more Islamic .
By the time the door opens in Tehran they are born - again - muslims !
A bearded moral police officer standing immediately outside the plane makes sure of that .
He reminds them with his grumpy look that they are indeed back in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
The only thought crossing my mind upon returning to Tehran was that we deserve better .
We deserve more color in our lives , in our city , our country ;
We deserve more freedom in the way we dress , in what we eat and how we express ourselves .
We deserve to have tourists .
The only benefit of living in Tehran I thought is the advantage of high pressured water over dry wipes .
Yes , Iran at the moment is the best country for you to poop on !
I shared my birthday cake with Life Goes on in Tehran who is now a year old .
Thank you to the 30,229 unique visitors from 3973 cities in 126 countries who have helped make this site a relative success .
And thank you for your birthday wishes on MySpace or Facebook , I am sorry if I cannot write you back , because those sites are blocked in Iran .
Here 's to another year of LGOIT .
COM and me getting closer to 30 and hopefully realizing my dreams ...
A panoramic view of Barcelona .
I dream of a day where Tehran and other cities in Iran become hotspots for tourists from all around the globe .
With a friendly government , Iran has potential to be one of the leading destinations for them and tourism can be Iran 's number one source of income , above even that of oil and gas sales .
I dream of a day when YOU can visit Iran and fall in love with it .
I dream of a day that the name Iran will make you think of love , peace and calm , and not fear , terror and chaos .
That will be the day ...

The next time you see the doctor , you might not spend an hour in a waiting room , read eight - month - old magazines or be examined in a cold , antiseptic room .
You might not do any of these things , because the next time you see the doctor , you might see him at your own home .
In New York City , health care has joined Chinese food as a takeout option .
The once common but now rare house call is making a comeback .
Thanks to smaller , more portable tests , a lack of urgent care infrastructure and a willingness to ignore insurance companies , the last year has seen a boom in doctors who integrate house calls into their business to provide convenience and care for a wide range of patients .
Last year , doctors Robert Glatter and Jay Parkinson of New York City altered their separate practices to concentrate on house calls .
Neither was aware of what the other was doing , but the same forces were motivating them both .
" I feel like a country doctor , but in the city , " said Parkinson , whose practice focuses exclusively on house calls .
" It 's going back to a time before the middleman . "
Throughout most of medical history , doctors primarily treated patients in their homes , only sending them to hospitals for emergencies .
That paradigm changed in the mid-1960s , when health care moved to a more specialist - intensive regime .
Soon , insurance companies adjusted their payments to take advantage of the newly centralized health care apparatus , making house calls unprofitable for doctors , and therefore almost pushed the practice to extinction .
Recently though , technology and demand have dovetailed to allow Glatter and Parkinson to bring the house call back .
On the technology front , communication and medical technology have unshackled doctors from the hospital .
With laptops , iPhones and BlackBerries , doctors can be reached anywhere , anytime .
They can exchange patient charts via e-mail and book appointments over the Internet .
Parkinson even uses instant messaging to communicate with his patients .
Medical technology has also allowed the doctors to be more mobile .
Miniature X - ray machines , mini - sonograms , rapid strep throat tests and other assays allow the doctors to bring formerly bulky equipment and complex exams out of the hospital and into the home .
From the demand side , Parkinson and Glatter have tapped into a client base fed up with the state of urgent care .
This is a level of need below emergency but above a chronic problem , like a large cut that needs stitches or a bad case of the flu or strep .
Most of those cases are routed to emergency rooms , where the patients will most likely sit for hours , triaged as a lower priority than gunshot wounds or labors .
This discontent with the urgent care system provided a niche that Parkinson and Glatter attempt to fill with their house calls .
Rather than waiting in line at an emergency room , wasting an entire day and risking further complications , patients can be treated promptly at their home or workplace .
Once enabled by technology to move around more , Parkinson and Glatter were still inhibited by the low insurance reimbursements that made house calls prohibitively expensive .
To solve this tangle , both Parkinson and Glatter simply ignore insurance companies , while serving two very different populations .
For Glatter , this means serving a population that is willing and able to pay the high costs of medical care without insurance in exchange for the convenience of house calls .
Businessmen who do n't have the time to wait for hours at the hospital for urgent care have Glatter come to their home or office , thus allowing them to avoid missing work .
Glatter has even had his practice integrated into real estate developments , where an on - call physician has been included as an amenity .
Parkinson , on the other hand , aims to serve an uninsured population .
His main client base is the large community of artists and young professionals in west Brooklyn who , by virtue of working freelance or in the service industry , cannot afford insurance .
Parkinson also puts a premium on saving his clients ' time , making sure that people who really need the money miss as few work hours as possible while seeing the doctor .
This demand for quick and personal medical care is only going to grow in the coming years , said Michael Gusmano , an assistant professor of health policy and management at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University .
It seems that Parkinson and Glatter have tapped into a demand far larger than even they realize .
According to Gusmano , the demand for service when and where one wants is a hallmark of the aging Baby Boomer population .
As they age , Medicare will adjust to fit their desire for medicine at the time and place of their choosing .
Once Medicare changes , the insurance companies are sure to follow .
When the insurance companies make house calls profitable , the last hurdle is to see if it would work outside of New York City , in a place where the population is less centralized and travel more complex .
Either way , home calls are clearly something consumers want .
As Ciara Lacy , a patient of Parkinson 's said , " If I could get really good care without having to leave home , why not ? "

Up until now , all eyes have been on the losses that are hitting the financial sector from the acronym soup of new instruments such as CDOs and SIVs .
Everyone is scared , and rightly so , of the MUB ( Monster Under the Bed ) that might be lurking in supposedly safe havens .
Still , financial stocks staged a big rally on the last trading day before the weekend , and again Monday , due to the belief that the worst is past , and that the government will step in to save the Street should that MUB pop out from under the bed .
But even once the current crisis is past , there 's another issue facing the financial sector :
Will it look like it used to ?
" I think it is important to step back and ask some broader questions about our financial system , " wrote Ben Inker , the chief investment officer for quantitative equities in global developed markets at money management firm GMO , in a recent paper .
" What it does , how big it should be ; and what its sustainable level of profitability might be . "
These questions are obviously important for financial services firms .
At its recent peak stock price in December 2006 , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , for instance , sold for $ 53.34 , or over 2 times its reported book value ( and over 4 times if you exclude goodwill and intangibles ) and almost 13 times its reported 2006 earnings .
Do those numbers represent a baseline to which we 'll return when this crisis has passed , or are they anomalies ?
And the size of the financial sector may also matter for the rest of the market .
In a piece last summer , credit rating agency Moody 's opined that the market was safe from systemic risk in part because the $ 45 billion in profits reported by a group of financial firms including Citi and Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) were " considerable and significantly larger than in 1998 , " when those same firms reported profits of $ 12 billion .
As the events surrounding Bear Stearns show all too clearly , the market is n't safe from systemic risk .
Was Moody 's wrong partly because that $ 45 billion is n't sustainable - or was n't real in the first place ?
One way to think about this is to look at the profits of the U.S. financial sector versus GDP .
Inker did this , and the result was what he describes as a " truly striking chart . "
From 1947 to 1997 , financial profits were stable at around 0.75 % of GDP .
But over the last ten years , the share of GDP represented by financial profits began to shoot higher .
In the last few years - before the Street began to report massive writeoffs - financial profits represented roughly 2.25 % of GDP .
Inker says that it is too simplistic to say that the right number should be 0.75 % .
But when you think about what financial profits consisted of at the height of the boom , 2.25 % seems unsustainable too .
The last decade saw the explosion of securitization - the carving up and redistributing of risk - the boom in hedge funds , and the private equity mania .
It 's apparent now that Wall Street can't transform a sub prime mortgage into a triple A credit , and that the redistribution of risk does n't get rid of it .
Unless ( or until ) we forget that simple lesson , it 's hard to see the securitization game being played again .
As for hedge funds , some commentators , such as Pimco 's Bill Gross , predict the demise of broad swaths of them .
With that goes the rich profits Wall Street has earned on prime brokerage .
And fees from private equity , which at the height made up huge chunks of the Street 's investment banking revenues ?
That wo n't come back roaring without cheap credit .
" We are going to have to create whole new ways of securitizing and funding debt of all types , but especially mortgages and consumer credit , " wrote John Mauldin , the president of Millenium Wave Advisors , in a recent newsletter .
" While I have confidence that those intrepid bankers on Wall Street will figure out something , as their future bonuses depend on it , it is going to take time to replace a system that took decades to build . "
You also have to consider the massive writeoffs that the Street has taken .
Thus far , Citigroup has taken $ 32 billion in writedowns related to the subprime crisis .
Merrill Lynch 's writedowns have totaled $ 22 billion .
So were Citi's 2006 profits really the reported $ 21.2 billion , and were Merrill 's the reported $ 7.5 billion ?
Or was some percentage of that an illusion ?
If Bear can be sold for $ 2 or $ 10 a share , then how solid was Bear Stearns ' $ 84 per share in reported book value ?
Thought about more broadly , if commentators are right that mortgage losses alone will total $ 300 billion to $ 500 billion , then , as Inker writes , " profits that look like they have been 2.25 % of GDP in the past several years have actually been more like 1.75 % , if we smooth the losses over the last 3 years and into next year as rough justice . "
And of course , mortgage losses are only a subset of the total losses .
Think back to what Ken Lewis , the CEO of Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , said last fall when his company announced its first round of writedowns : " Making money for several years , only to give most of it back in one year , is not a brilliant business model . "
Inker says that the data does n't point to any firm conclusions about what the level of financial profits should be .
His best guess , though , is that a " normal " level of profits would be about half the amount that the financial sector reported in 2006 .
Then , you also have to think about the multiple of those earnings that investors should be willing to pay .
In a paper published in the fall of 2005 , risk management gurus Leslie Rahl and Barbara Lucas of Capital Markets Risk Advisors , noted that in the past decade , a lot of things have happened that are n't supposed to happen , from the interest rate hikes of 1994 to the 1998 collapse of LTCM to the 2001 terrorist attacks .
Or as the authors put it , " once - in - a - lifetime events seem to occur every few years . "
If that 's the case and if such events now mean that Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) can go from seemingly viable to threatening to bring down the entire financial system in the space of a week - then what sort of multiple should investors pay for Bear , or for any financial firm ?
Maybe investors should n't pay 12 times earnings , and maybe they should pay a discount to , rather than a multiple of , reported book value .
Of course , trying to guess how this will play out is just that - guessing .
But if you say , for instance , that Merrill 's normalized profits would be half the 2006 level , you get to about $ 4 billion .
If you think that we should be willing to pay a smaller multiple for those earnings than we did in the past - let 's be generous and say 10 times - then you get to a total market value for Merrill Lynch of $ 40 billion .
That 's still a 10 % discount from today 's valuation .
I have spent the past week in San Francisco at Apple WWDC ( Worldwide Developers Conference ) .
It was the richest and more energetic WWDC I have ever participated in .
Apple announced a lot of new features that are going to benefit our XMPP and push platforms for iOS and our mobile software .
But , as I still ponder the overall implications of the conference , I wanted to share some of my initial thoughts and debunk two misunderstandings .
The general media failed to understand how major this conference was
My first comments are about the gap in understanding by the general media regarding this conference .
In France , for example , Le Monde , one of the major French newspapers , wrote that Apple is refreshing its iOS , but no revolution has been announced .
This was a common pattern found in the non-technical press .
This fails to measure how radical the change in iOS and OSX was for the development community .
Apple did open a new set of API , allowing interapplication communication and custom widgets for the notification center .
It also created a new language to improve the overall platform for developers .
More generally , most of the 100 + talks at WWDC were about granting more power to developers on various levels , improving API , and solving common and old technical limitations .
Example from a random conference :
Core data performance has been improved on two use cases — batch update and async fetch .
This announcement alone is a reply to a complaint on core data performance for mass record changes ; see On switching away from Core Data by Brent Simmons .
At the conference , there was general agreement that nearly all the wishes and complaints from Apple developers had been satisfied .
Some said it was the most important Apple developer event in 10 years , with beta testing , performance , more powerful API , and even a new modern language called “ Swift ” .
In a single week , the Apple development landscape radically changed .
Marco Arment , a high - profile developer , noted that Apple opened new territory .
Casey Liss said that during this conference , Apple changed its mindset , and its new message was about building a platform together with the development community .
WWDC is a developer conference , and it is getting back to its roots .
The media was expecting hardware or software announcements .
Apple has announced new hardware in the past at WWDC ( examples are iPhone 3GS or iPhone 4 ) but was disappointed by announcements targeted at the developer community .
However , it happens that the developers are the ones building the ecosystem .
What Apple gives them is the tools that will make the platform much better and more powerful in the coming years .
It will take a while to have everyone notice , but it is a profound change .
This is a seed to improve the application ecosystem on iOS for the coming years .
“ Swift ” impact
Apple surprised the public with an announcement of a brand - new programming language .
Despite it having being in development for four years , Apple managed to keep the secret until now .
Launching a new programming language will have a huge impact on the development community .
For developers , it was like Christmas in June .
That said , the impact was , again , largely misunderstood .
It was described as a way to make the development with iOS simpler and accessible to more developers .
However , having assisted at many talks on Swift , it is clear to me that the goal is not to appeal to a mass of new developers .
Google is using Java — one of the most taught languages in the world — on this platform , and there is no way to compete with the ubiquitous knowledge of that platform among developers .
Code factories are mostly based on Java skills , and Java is a programming language with a massive amount of manpower behind it .
What Apple proposes with Swift is that it be a language that is efficient , making it very adequate for mobile environments .
It also is a language that is much more expressive and enjoyable to write than Objective C , the existing de facto language for iOS and OSX programming .
What Swift is not is a simple language .
It is extremely expressive and powerful — and , as such , it requires a deep understanding of many programming paradigms ( object oriented , functional ) .
Developing for iOS and OSX requires knowledge of the many features available in the frameworks .
No matter how you express your code , learning those frameworks takes time .
You will still need a great deal of skills to write mobile apps .
Swift is there because Apple wants to help attract good developers — not simply a mass of developers .
Apple wants to appeal to developers that are constantly looking for a better way to express their code and improve the performance and maintainability of their software .
Reading the first articles and analysis on Swift is by no means about “ writing iOS or OSX software in 21 days ” .
It is profound how the articles analyze the influence and semantics of the language , and what design choices were made .
For example , these are the first thoughts from the original lead developer of Rust , a language that was an inspiration for Swift .
This is an example of the type of articles coming from professionals that want to use a state - of - the - art programming environment in a practical way .
For example , Evan Miller explains how he found it more practical than Haskell , while inheriting some of its benefit in his piece , Swift impressions .
Haskell is a language acclaimed for its properties , but it is often said to be used more in academic environments than by programmers for typical mobile or web software .
With Swift , what Apple wants is to do is attract and keep the best mobile developers working on iOS .
More to come on post - WWDC analysis
I will write more later on implications and expected improvements for ProcessOne and Boxcar software .
I need time to think more about all the pieces of information I gathered during five days of talks and discussion with developers .
Reason number 999 why Obama was wise not to run an overtly progressive campaign .
Among some conservative Democratic politicians last night , there was an almost palpable sense of relief that Obama showed he could win over their constituents — the blue - collar , rural whites who , they feared could bleed over to the GOP in the fall .
“ It ’s not Senator Clinton ’s fault , but the baggage she carries is the divisiveness of the 1990s , ” [ Rep. Chet ] Edwards [ D - TX ] said .
“ People are wanting to turn the chapter to the future rather than going back to the last chapter .
It ’s not fair but that is the reality . ”
Actually , a more populist campaign might have attracted rural white blue collar voters , but it would n’t have won the support of the press , much of the party elite , or the Blue Dog Democrats that represent rural white districts .
John Edwards learned this first hand .
How much less effective would Edwards ’ strategy have been if Obama had attempted it ?
In all the post - mortems I ’ve read today , no one anywhere has expressed any ideological discomfort with the prospect of an Obama presidency .
That ’s the genius of Obama ’s campaign so far .
He has managed to inspire the masses without making the suits nervous .
And that is no small trick .
In fact , I have never seen it done before .
But it is precisely his ability to make everyone feel comfortable that is fatal to any Clinton attempt to rally the Establishment to save her candidacy at a brokered convention .
The Establishment has no compelling reason to save Clinton because they are perfectly content to live with a President Obama .
And , while many see this situation as evidence that Obama will govern exactly to the Establishment ’s liking , you should look at the current lay of the land and ask yourself : could he have succeeded any other way ?
Even now , in the face of one bruising and humiliating defeat after another , the Clintons are not shying away from the strongest of strong - arm tactics … a convention fight that they ’ll enter with less pledged delegates , less overall votes , and less states won .
If the Establishment had any compelling reason to reject Obama , the Clintons might still prevail .
But Obama has stubbornly refused to provide them with any reasons .
The best evidence for his qualification for the office is his campaign itself , which does n’t leak , uses its money and resources wisely , and wins , wins , wins …all things Team Clinton cannot claim .
If race was originally a concern , Obama ’s crushing victories in the country ’s whitest states and his ability to carry white men in places like Virginia have laid that concern to rest .
Obama carried 89 % of Virginia voters 17 - 24 .
He is driving so many young people to the polls that no state is safe for Republicans in the fall .
Obama is promising a Reagan - like blowout … a forty - state blowout .
And it is n’t making anyone by partisan Republicans nervous .
That , more than anything else , shows the genius of Obama ’s campaign , and why Clinton should start looking for an opportune time to drop out of the race .

QED .
CONCORD , N.H.  Senator Barack Obama hops up to the stage in that hip - mod gray suit of his , clapping along with the audience on Friday , clapping for himself , clapping for this moment .
He gazes at 1,200 people in overcoats and woolen hats and snow boots and asks for a show of hands .
Be honest .
How many of you are undecided about who you will support ?
A sea of arms shoots up .
This is for a presidential candidate a golden sight .
He is talking to those who yearn to be converted .
He turns to two young aides and offers a stage whisper : “ See that ?
We got a lot of live ones . ”
Then he takes off at a rhetorical gallop , pulling the crowd behind him , lifting it , then slowing down .
He is recruiting followers , yes , and his Democratic primary race here with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton could not be tighter .
But the moment is suffused , so as almost not to require that he make it explicit , with a sense of historical moment .
I , you , we can make history , he says , by turning the nation ’s sorrowful racial narrative into something radiant and hopeful .
Partisan divisions , racial divisions , blur in his telling .
He rarely hits the bass pedal on race .
He talks of Selma and Montgomery and of the Revolutionary War and the Battle of the Bulge .
But as he tells his own primal tale , heads nod in the audience .
Introducing Clinton at UC Davis , Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef said , " He continues as a living hero .
Hope — it 's about giving people hope . "
It certainly is .
Bill Clinton gives hope to every one of us potato - nosed oafs from nowhere with our shiftless relatives and our marriages that are like being sewn up in a sack full of cats .
If this knight of the manure shovel , this gas pudding , can become the leader of the free world , there 's hope for us all .
We observe his ragamuffin character stitched together from scraps of prevarication and ribbons of fantasy .
We watch his hinge - heeled ethical contraption flap in the breeze of fundraising and personal finance .
We cluck at the spectacle of a sad rip and his homely girlfriends .
No annoying crick in the neck from looking up to this hero .
But Clinton succeeds .
The rest of us do not .
Various theories have been put forth to explain the somewhat surprising rise of Bill Clinton and his truly astonishing failure to fall .
My friends who listen to AM talk radio say I am not the first to suggest that he made a pact with Satan .
But I do n't think Bill did that .
A pact with Hillary , yes — but a modern presidential administration is a corporate pyramid in its delegation of powers .
The selling of souls in the Clinton White House was conducted at a lower level on the organizational chart , by such as George Stephanopoulos , Sidney Blumenthal , and Erskine Bowles .
Speculations of a more likely nature credit Clinton 's political skills , his charm , his brains , and his luck , although it 's not the kind of luck that one would want to have .
Clinton has been lucky most of all in his enemies .
He has something by which right - wingers are driven crazy ( not much of a journey in many cases ) .
It is n't the policy Clinton pursued .
Once comprehensive health care ( where archaeologist Al Gore went digging ) had been entombed , Clinton 's policies were mostly too small or skittering to attract a maniacal response .
Opposing his legislative initiatives was a varmint hunt , not a mad quixotic crusade .
Some of those varmints even proved useful — for example , the big lab rat of welfare reform currently running through the sociological labyrinth .
Sorry if conservatives ate the cheese at the end of the maze .
Something else lit the lichen on the mossbacks .
Maybe it was seeing that loosey - goosey sixties generation at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue eating peas off its knife on Dolley Madison 's china .
Or maybe it was the little smirk that Clinton has , or the much larger one that belongs to his wife .
Anyway , Clinton 's enemies had a tendency to explode with anger , most notably during the impeachment .
The walls of the House and Senate chambers were left covered in a goo of spit venom and slung mud .
Red -faced , dirty Bill looked swell by comparison .
All cleaned up and calmed down , he certainly looked swell in comparison with the other dignitaries at the October 10 , 2002 , Boston Teachers Union rally for the gubernatorial candidate Shannon O'Brien .
Mayor Tom Menino spoke , followed by the candidate for lieutenant governor Chris Gabrieli , and then O'Brien herself .
Clinton put a finger to his temple in a pose of interest .
Clinton cupped his chin in his fist in a gesture of concentration .
Clinton rubbed the back of his head for a heedful effect , ran a thumb down the line of his jaw to mime a thought provoked , and , in short , made use of every theatrical trope to indicate rapt attention while failing to look unbored .
Clinton is reputed to be a man who does n't sleep much , but there seemed every likelihood of his getting forty winks at the Boston Teachers Union Hall .
Motorola has announced 3 new Handsets at 3GSM .
1st off , they have rolled out a new Z6 slider , now called the Moto Z6w , with added Wi-Fi capabilities with the same base design of the original GSM Z6 Phone .
The new Moto Z6w also offers Unlicensed Mobile Access ( UMA ) for making calls over a VoIP connection .
Motorola also introduces two new world phones , the Moto W161 and Moto W181 , both which focus on budget prices for developing countries , stripping out the extra goodies of having a camera or Bluetooth , except for the perk of an FM radio .
The Moto W161 offers a monocrome display for an ultra- budget price , with the Moto W181 offering a color display .
Both are planned for release next month .
007 's diving car is finally ready , but it has a leak Driving sQuba without a wetsuit is not advisable
Since he saw The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977 , sQuba creator Frank Rinderknecht says he has " tried to imagine how it might be possible to build a car that can fly under water . "

GENEVA — OK , so the Swiss have invented a car that runs on land and underwater .
But did they REALLY have to make it a convertible ?
It 's called the " sQuba , " and conjures up memories of James Bond 's amphibious Lotus Esprit from The Spy Who Loved Me .
That fictional vehicle traveled on land and , when chased by bad guys in a helicopter , plunged into the water and became an airtight submarine — complete with " torpedoes " and " depth charges . "
But " Q " is n't responsible for this one .
The concept car — which unlike Bond 's is not armed — was developed by Swiss designer Rinspeed Inc. and is set to make a splash at the Geneva Auto Show next month .
Company CEO Frank Rinderknecht , a self - professed Bond fan , said he has been waiting 30 years to re-create the car he saw Roger Moore drive off a dock .
The sQuba can plow through the water at a depth of 30 feet and has electrical motors to turn the underwater screw .
You 'll have to break out the wetsuit , however .
Do n't be in a hurry
The car has an open top , meaning that the two passengers are exposed to the elements .
" For safety reasons , we have built the vehicle as an open car so that the occupants can get out quickly in an emergency , " said Rinderknecht , 52 .
Passengers will be able to keep breathing underwater through an integrated tank of compressed air similar to what is used in scuba diving .
The sQuba 's top speed on land is about 77 mph , but it slows down to 3 mph on the surface of the water , and 1.8 mph underwater .
Working with engineering specialists , Rinspeed removed the combustion engine from a sports car and replaced it with several electrical motors .
Three are located in the rear — er , aft — with one providing propulsion on land and the other two driving the screw for underwater driving .
" We always want to do cars that are outrageous , which nobody has done before .
So we thought , ' Let 's make a car dive , ' " said Rinderknecht , whose innovative company has made transparent , flying and voice - activated cars in previous attention - grabbing displays at the Geneva Auto Show .
The company calls the sQuba the first real submersible car .
Unlike military amphibious vehicles , which can only drive slowly on a lakebed , the sQuba travels like a submarine .
No practical value ?
The interior is resistant to salt water , allowing the skipper to drive into a lake or the sea .
" Many concept cars introduce important new technology , " said John Cabaniss at the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers in Washington .
" Anything to improve the efficiency of a vehicle , streamlining or reducing the weight of materials , while maintaining strength ... is put into concept cars first . "
Cabaniss said the lithium - ion batteries in Rinspeed 's car were " state - of - the - art " and added that the car industry in general would be looking for more ways to make things work electronically .
But he was skeptical of the overriding idea .
" Other than some kind of a movie situation , for Bond - like stuff with lots of gimmicks , I can't imagine it will have any practical value , " Cabaniss said .
" Maybe people will need to go from land to water , and traverse a body of water , but underwater ?
Especially as it gets your suit wet . "
Rinderknecht said it cost more than $ 1.5 million to make the sole sQuba in existence , and that it was difficult to make a car watertight and pressure - resistant enough to be maneuverable underwater .
" The real challenge , however , was to create a submersible car that moves like a fish in water , " he added .
Rinderknecht said it was unlikely that people would soon spot the sQuba tolling down the highway or popping up in your nearby lake .
" They might sell as toys for rich people , perhaps , " he said .
" I do n't see mass transportation switching to cars that dive . "
Hindu monks are to sue the RSPCA in protest over the killing of a sacred cow .
A group of monks from Bhaktivedanta Manor Hindu temple , in Hertfordshire , yesterday served legal papers on the animal welfare charity for trespassing when they put down the temple 's sacred cow Gangotri on 13 December last year .
Gauri das , temple president at Bhaktivedanta Manor , who marched with five other saffron - robed monks to the RSPCA 's West Sussex headquarters , said : " The RSPCA unlawfully trespassed on temple property and unlawfully trespassed on the life of a cow .
The cow was under veterinary care and was recovering .
There was absolutely no reason for her to be killed .
" The way they carried out this act on the sacred premises of a temple with no dialogue was completely unacceptable . "
The cow , a Belgian blue - jersey cross , was killed while monks were worshipping , and the temple alleges that the RSPCA used an illegal warrant to enter their property .
The charity was in negotiations with the temple for weeks over the slaughter of the 13 - year - old animal because it had a broken leg and had bed sores .

John Rolls , RSPCA director of animal welfare promotion , greeted the delegation .
He said : " We believe we acted properly , within the law , but clearly they are of a different opinion .
I am sorry it has got to this point . "
Radha Mohan das , a spokesman for the temple , said the action was " highly offensive " and that the charity had conducted itself in a " high - handed and devious fashion " .
The animal welfare charity said the cow needed to be put down for welfare reasons .
Three independent vets agreed it was suffering and should be put down .
The cow had been ill for a year and was unable to stand because of its injuries , but Mr Mohan das said that the RSPCA 's actions were " an insult and a threat to the Hindu community " .
He said the heavy - handedness of the RSPCA had been an attempt to stave off a legal battle like that which took place over the killing of Shambo the bull last year .
Shambo , a sacred bull belonging to the Skanda Vale religious community near Carmarthen , Dyfed , tested positive for bovine TB last year and was finally slaughtered in July after much controversy .
Kapil Dudakia , of the Gangotri task force , said the RSPCA had caused great offence to the Hindu community .
" The killing of a cow on grounds where we have a temple is the worst act that anyone can have committed to Hindus , " he said .
" It showed a level of contempt that deserved a challenge . "
The RSPCA apologised for any offence caused , and added : " The RSPCA will always seek to respect religious views , but the most important thing is to stop animals suffering .
That is what the RSPCA is for , and what the public expects us to do .
Nonetheless , the RSPCA is based on a profound respect for animals , something we share with many religious communities .
Since the death of Gangotri , we have requested to meet with Hindu bodies and hope to hear from them very soon , to begin progressive dialogue to ensure this situation never arises again . "
Last month around 100 protesters gathered outside the House of Commons to to protest against the RSPCA 's actions .
Back in early February , we covered the rapid rise of the Mega - D botnet and its various social - engineering - based attack methods .
At the time , there was some question as to what malware was behind the creation of Mega - D ( it has since been identified as Ozok ) , and no definite time frame as to when the botnet might be shut down .
Now , according to security firm Marshal , Mega - D's profile is shrinking , thanks to a 10 - day control server failure , but another botnet , Srizbi , is quickly moving into the gap .
Srizbi is a spambot trojan that has been on a self - propagating kick of late .
The attack vector in this case is unsophisticated and involves a great deal of celebrity porn spam .
We recently reported on the malware market 's increasing preference for multilingual hackers , but the folks behind Srizbi apparently have n't gotten that memo ; a screenshot of one offending advertisements informs potential prey that " The pornos is New ! "
Anyone dumb enough fooled into clicking on such a link is handed a file to download .
Once downloaded and run , the system in question is infected with a number of other Trojans , including Srizbi itself .
Wash , rinse , repeat , and the entire cycle starts over again .
Srizbi's attack methodology is relatively primitive compared to Mega - D's ; the latter attempted to mimic social web site emails and actually displayed Flash animations once users had installed a " Flash update . "
Srizbi is not alone in the post - Storm botnet world .
Marshal estimates that six botnets account for 85 percent of the total spam sent world - wide .
Srizbi is currently in the lead , with 39 percent of the " market , " followed by Rustock at 20 percent , Mega - D at 11 percent , Hacktool .
Spammer at seven percent , Pushdo ( 6 percent ) , and Storm ( two percent ) .
These numbers track the amount of spam each botnet is producing rather than the total number of systems infected by each botnet .
The two numbers can vary widely ;
At its peak , the Storm network accounted for 21 percent of all spam and contained an estimated 85,000 bots .
Mega - D , on the other hand , grew to encompass 32 percent of the spam network in early February , but contained only an estimated 35,000 bots .
One interesting development that may also provide further proof that the botnet industry is commercializing is the mounting body of evidence that suggests multiple botnets are being used to advertise a single product or group of products .
Over the past few weeks , Marshal picked up advertisements for the " Express Herbals " website from sources infected by Srizbi , Rustock , Hacktool .
Spammer , and Pushdo .
If this trend continues , it may indicate the growth of a twisted competitive advertising environment in which fraudulent companies with useless products actively " advertise " over certain botnets .
The attractiveness of any given botnet might even be evaluated in terms of its size , audience composition , and resistance to attack .
The idea of a competitive botnet market in which various companies with established botnets compete for a black hat corporation 's advertising dollars is somewhat twisted , but its a logical step for an industry that 's reinventing itself on increasingly commercial terms .

What ’s the first thing you think of when you consider the Ruby Language ?
Dynamic types , right ?
Ruby is famous ( infamous ? ) for its extremely flexible type system , and as a so - called “ scripting language ” , the core of this mechanism is a lack of type checking .
This feature allows for some very concise expressions and a great deal of flexibility , but sometimes makes your code quite a bit harder to understand .
More importantly , it weakens the assurances that a certain method will actually work when passed a given value .
Several different solutions have been proposed to workaround this limitation .
The canonical technique involves intensifying tests and increasing test coverage .
Ruby has some excellent unit test frameworks ( such as RSpec ) which serve to ease the pain associated with this approach , but no matter how you slice it , tests are a pain .
Having to rely on tests to take the place of type checking in the code assurance process can be extremely frustrating .
Another , less common technique is to simply perform dynamic type checks within the method itself .
Like so :
def create_name ( fname , lname ) raise " fname must be a String " unless fname .
kind_of ?
String raise " lname must be a String " unless lname .
kind_of ?
String fname + " " + lname end
This code explicitly checking the dynamic kind of the parameter values to ensure that they are of type or subtype of String .
The issues with this sample should be relatively obvious .
Primarily , it ’s ugly !
This sort of repetitious , boiler - plate conditional checking is exactly the sort of thing Ruby tries to avoid .
What ’s more is the added bulk of all of these repetitive checks ( assuming you perform one check per-parameter per-method ) because far more unwieldy than just improving the rspec test coverage .
While manually type checking may be a bad solution syntactically , it ’s on the right track conceptually .
What we really want is some sort of assertion that the parameters are of a certain type , but that wo n’t overly bloat our existing code .
We need some sort of framework that will “ weave in ” ( think AOP ) its type assertions without getting in the way our our algorithms .
Well it turns out that someone ’s already done this .
Eivind Eklund kindly pointed me to his type checking framework in a comment on a previous post .
The basic idea is to perform the type checking assertions , but to factor the work out into an API encapsulated by an intuitive DSL .
So rather than performing all those nasty unless statements as above , we could simply do something like this :
typesig String , String def create_name ( fname , lname ) fname + " " + lname end
It ’s really as simple as that .
Passing the type values to the typesig method just prior to a method declaration give the cue to the Types framework to perform some extra work on each call that method .
Now we have the runtime assurances that the following code will not work ( with a very intuitive error message ) :
create_name ( " Daniel " , 123 )
Will produce the folling output :
ArgumentError : Arg 1 is of invalid type ( expected String , got Fixnum )
But the fun does n’t stop there .
Ruby encourages the “ duck typing ” pattern , where algorithm developers concern themselves not with what the value is but rather what it does .
This means that the type checking really should be done based on what methods are available , not just the raw type .
It turns out that the Types framework supports this as well :
class Company def name " Blue Danube " end end class Person def name " Daniel Spiewak " end end typesig String , Type : : Respond ( : name ) def output ( msg , value ) puts msg + " " + value .
name end c = Company .
new p = Person .
new output ( " The company name is : " , c ) output ( " The person is : " , p ) output ( " The programmer is : " , " a genius " ) # error
Types can check not only the kind of the object but also to what methods it responds .
This is crucial to enabling its adoption into modern Ruby code bases , many of which rely heavily on this “ duck typing ” technique .
You can think of the Types framework just like another layer in your testing architecture .
Obviously it ’s not performing any sort of static type checking ( since Ruby has no compile phase ) .
All it ’s doing is providing that extra certainty that you ’re never passing something weird from somewhere in your code , something that would break your algorithm .
So what ’s the catch ?
Well , obviously you need to have the Types framework installed .
It ’s not as easy as just typing gem install types either , since the framework actually predates Ruby Gems .
You ’ll have to download the framework and then copy around the types.rb file yourself .
But this is just deployment semantics .
The more interesting issue are the limitations of the code itself .
As far as I can tell , the only restriction on the framework is that it must be used within a proper class , not in the root scope .
This means that all of my examples above would have to be enclosed in a class , rather than just copy - pasted into a .rb file and run in place .
But other than this one limitation , the framework is incredibly flexible .
I really have n’t shown you the seriously interesting stuff in terms of the API ( there are more examples at the top of the types.rb file ) .
In many ways , Types is actually more powerful than any static type checking mechanism could be ( yes , I ’m even including Scala in that evaluation ) .
I have n’t had a chance to use Types on any serious project myself , but I can see tremendous potential , particularly for companies with large - scale Ruby / Rails deployments or even smaller projects looking for just a bit tighter code assurance .
As far as I ’m concerned , there should n’t be a non-trivial Ruby project attempted without this lovely library , Rails or no Rails .

Our female readers are invited to imagine the folllowing scenario :
It 's Monday , you 're at work , you 're bored , you 're thinking " how could I possibly spice up this trawl of the 2,000 weekend emails in my inbox ? " when it occurs to you that if someone were to invent an SMS - triggered Bluetooth vibrator then your partner could bring you to an earth - shattering climax simply by texting a few sweet words of lurv , leaving you totally satisfied as a woman and fit to face the most daunting online task .
Well , you 're in luck , because UK outfit the Cool & Groovy Toy Company Ltd has plugged this particular gap in the life - enhancing technology market with The Toy , described as a " hi - tech vibrating bullet " .
The blurb explains :
Connected to a mobile phone with Bluetooth it becomes an intimate , silent connection between two lovers , regardless of distance .
Custom designed for your pleasure , it is intelligent , sophisticated and invented for bliss .
The Toy is worn internally , linked to a mobile phone and controlled by sms text messages sent to the phone .
Once read , the message is transported automatically to The Toy , which turns it into vibrations - with a huge range of movements , depending on what you have written .
Just say what you feel , The Toy will do the rest .
Good Lord .
Apparently , you crack off a quick SMS containing a secret six - digit tag which enables the device .
Twenty - six letters each have three " different movement profiles " with five speeds and three time settings .
This allows 45 possible effects from any single letter and an astounding " 7200 variations from a single text message " .
No , we have n't really got a clue what that 's all about , so let 's have a quick shufti at the specs .
Suffice it to say , we 're talking cutting edge electronics , intelligent CPU and turbo - boost circuitry packed into a throbbing 90 mm of can javelin .
Oh yes , it also has a 14.5 cm high tensile coated cable antenna which doubles as a handy extractor - a nice touch .
Finally , The Toy is " not discoverable in a Bluetooth search " , so there 's no chance of your other half being molested by a wireless groper . ®

Criminal defense lawyers say they will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review a novel legal approach the government has begun using to win stiff mandatory prison terms for those who 've downloaded child pornography from file - sharing sites .
At issue is a new interpretation of a 1986 law , amended in 2003 under the Protect Act , intended to curb child - porn advertising by imposing a mandatory 15 - year prison term on anyone convicted of publishing " notice " offering to distribute kid porn across state lines .
Last year , Walter Sewell , a 43 - year - old pharmacist from Missouri , was sentenced under the act to the automatic 15 - year prison stretch after downloading and sharing sexually explicit images over the Kazaa file - sharing network .
He was the nation 's first defendant to be prosecuted under what authorities admit is an " innovative use " of the Protect Act .
" He 's getting more time than people actually molesting kids , " says Eric Chase , a California attorney representing Sewell .
" He did n't make it .
He did n't sell it .
He did n't even buy it . "
Last year a jury found that Sewell downloaded thousands of images of child pornography using Kazaa and made them available to others from his share folder .
Chase conceded that his client is guilty of distributing child pornography , which normally carries a five - year sentence .
But he argues that sharing such files over Kazaa should n't qualify as advertising under the law , and therefore should n't be subject to the mandatory 15 years .
Last week , the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and upheld Sewell 's sentence and conviction ( .pdf ) .
On Thursday , Chase said he would ask the Supreme Court to review the case .
In its ruling , the 8th Circuit found that the " descriptive fields " identifying the files in Sewell 's share folder alerted Kazaa users that he was offering such illegal material .
The files were named " Pedo 12 - 14yr.jpg , " " PBC Bro 's given it to Mom& Sis " and " Underage Pornography Erotica , " among others .
" It 's an innovative use of the statute , " said Don Ledford , a spokesman for prosecutors in the Western District of Missouri , in Kansas City .
" We were the first district in the country to use the statute that way to get the 15 - year mandatory minimum . "
U.S. attorneys throughout the country , he said , are beginning to experiment with charging Kazaa child pornography users like Sewell .
Kazaa is an open system , meaning the authorities can easily learn a user 's identity from his internet protocol address by subpoenaing the internet service provider .
In Sewell 's case , the FBI made the case .
" Prior to the internet playing such a dominant role among pedophiles and child sexual exploiters , publishing a notice for child pornography might have meant classified advertising or a notice online in a chat room or message board offering to sell child pornography , " Ledford continued .
" What 's innovative here is the Kazaa software itself generates that notice . "
In 1986 , Congress approved the statute under which Sewell was prosecuted , and it originally carried a mandatory 10 - year minimum sentence .
The sentence was increased in 2003 to 15 years without the possibility of parole .
The law was adopted to counter illegal smut advertising in the traditional sense .
Still , even three decades ago , Congress was concerned about preventing the exchange of pornographic materials through computers .
Although Kazaa did not exist in 1986 , Congress specifically mentioned one of its technological forebears , computer " bulletin boards , " as being a source of an illicit child - porn trade .
In upholding the conviction , the 8th Circuit ruled Jan. 17 that " Kazaa 's purpose is to allow users to download each other 's files , and the purpose of the descriptive fields is to alert interested users to the content of downloadable files . "
The court reiterated language from a 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision last year , a decision often cited by the Recording Industry Association of America in its music downloading lawsuits against Kazaa file sharers .
" A Kazaa file 's descriptive fields are like a roadside sign to a self - serve gas station at which the owner need not be present to distribute fuel to passing motorists , " the court wrote .
" No one would stop at the station without the sign telling them where the gas station is .
The context of such a sign tells motorists that the owner of the station is offering to distribute fuel to them . "
" We , like , half made eye contact a few times , " he said " Right as the train stopped she got up and , like , everyone else rushed in between us .
We made eye contact , really solid eye contact . . . and , right when the words were going to leave my mouth , she was off the train . "
That is his story as told to a friend and posted on the internet .
He could have surrendered his dignity and chased her through the crowd , although that oh - so - casual line about what she had been writing may have needed some reworking .
Or he could have let it go .
Or , as it happened , he could create a webpage dedicated to finding her in a city of 8 million people .
He called it nygirlofmy dreams.com .
He included a drawing of her , with her blue tights and blue gym shorts and red cheeks , and a drawing of himself labelled : tall ; skinny ; not insane .
And he included his mobile phone number .
In less than 48 hours , Brooklyn boy had found his dreamgirl .
He had some help .
A story about his search ran in the New York Post .
It became a typing point on other websites , and finally a co-worker of Camille Hayton 's made the link .
It was the flower in her hair and the rosy cheeks that caused her co-worker to identify Ms Hayton , formerly of Kew , as the muse in this internet love match .
She is identified as an intern at BlackBookmag.com , which now reports a timeline of the encounter , and the pursuit of Ms Hayton by what the site variously calls her " stalker " and a " subway skirt chaser " .
When not attending to her duties at the magazine , she is a 22 - year - old aspiring actress who is thought to have been engaged as an extra in the filming of the feature Sex and the City .
The couple , however , have yet to meet .
Still , this may be a refreshing diversion for Ms Hayton .
Friends have claimed that her New York home burnt to the ground just weeks ago .
Meanwhile , she is believed to have agreed to tell her story to a television show .
He , for his part , is withdrawing from scrutiny .
A recorded message on his phone declares he has found his dream girl and that " the website totally worked " .
But he does not think he will update the website further , and he said he is unlikely to do any interviews .
He does not want to become some gimmicky story .
This , he said , is an authentic thing .
Asked by his unseen friend in the website interview if he was ready to meet the dream girl he replied : " Yeah . . . ( pause of several seconds ) . . . hopefully . "
He told the New York Post they were meeting for coffee this weekend .
No pressure .
Just 8 million people waiting on the outcome .
He insisted that the faithful should stick stubbornly to their religions , as he himself sticks to the faith of his fathers .
He insisted that God - talk should remain a vibrant force in the public square and that judges should be guided by the foundations of their faith .
He lamented the faithlessness of Europe and linked the pro-life movement to abolition and civil rights , just as evangelicals do .
It is not always easy to blend an argument for religious liberty with an argument for religious assertiveness , but Romney did it well .
Yesterday , I called around to many of America ’s serious religious thinkers  including moderates like Richard Bushman of Columbia , and conservatives like Neuhaus and Robert George of Princeton .
Everyone I spoke with was enthusiastic about the speech , some of them wildly so .
Image David Brooks
Before yesterday , most pundits thought Romney was making a mistake in giving the speech now .
But in retrospect , it clearly was not a mistake .
Romney did n’t say anything that the Baptist minister Mike Huckabee could n’t say , and so this one address will not hold off the Huckabee surge in Iowa .
But Romney underlined the values he shares with social conservatives , and will have eased their concerns .
Among Mormons , the speech may go down as a historic event .
And yet , I confess my own reaction is more muted .
When this country was founded , James Madison envisioned a noisy public square with different religious denominations arguing , competing and balancing each other ’s passions .
But now the landscape of religious life has changed .
Now its most prominent feature is the supposed war between the faithful and the faithless .
Mitt Romney did n’t start this war , but speeches like his both exploit and solidify this divide in people ’s minds .
The supposed war between the faithful and the faithless has exacted casualties .
Sorority Girl ostracized for not having an Eating Disorder
Los Angeles , California -
You would think that 20 year old Sarah Telarian has it all .
She 's cute , gets good grades , and is in the most popular sorority on campus here at UCLA - Delta Epsilon .
Unfortunately for Sarah , however , she is being ostracized for not having an eating disorder , as do the majority of her sorority sisters .
" It just sucks .
I mean , I do n't even have anything against having an eating disorder , I just happen to have a high metabolism . "
That high metabolism has proven to be a blessing and a curse for the 20 year old sophmore from San Diego .
Sarah has repeatedly not been asked to accompany fellow sorority sisters on trips to the bathroom for purging sessions .
" I realize I do n't make myself throw up " , said Sarah , " but I could at least be invited into the bathroom with them and hold their hair back when they throw up .
Being left out of numerous eating disorder related activities has created a distance between Sarah and her sorority sisters .
" It 's just hard to be one of the girls when your constantly by yourself in the kitchen eating .
And what makes it worse is that I have to hear it from both sides .
When I eat some chips , the anorexic girls yell at me , and then when I do n't throw them up , the bullemic girls yell at me for not purging .
I 'm really thinking about de-pledging . "
Calls to the sorority went unanswered , but an anonymous source from within the sorority had this to say :
" We really do n't have anything against Sarah .
We actually think she 's really cool .
But we 're not going to change our eating habits , or lack thereof , just because she 's feeling left out .
We have a fraternity formal next week with Beta and it's even extra important that we look good .
It 's a barn dance and no one wants to look like a pig .
haha get it ?
a pig ? in a barn ? ! "
Indeed .

People with depression are facing long waits for treatment
He has warned the over -use of pills and poor mental health services were failing the public .
The party has obtained figures showing waits of more than two years for some counselling and psychotherapy services .
Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems would guarantee treatment within 13 weeks .
The government guarantees hospital , but not community care , within 18 weeks .
' Crutch '
In a speech to The Guardian Public Services Summit in St Albans , Hertfordshire , Mr Clegg said : " Britain has become the true Prozac Nation .
I believe this trend has gone too far .
" We must cut the number of anti-depressants prescribed by doctors .
Pills must not be a crutch for the wider issues in our society which cause mental health problems . "
The Lib Dems questioned over 100 NHS trusts - receiving 33 replies - about the psychology , counselling , psychotherapy and eating disorders help they provide .
Three years is too long to make someone wait for help that could transform their life , possibly even save their life
Paul Farmer , of Mind
' I walked streets screaming '
They asked the trusts for data on the longest waits they had for the non-emergency treatment .
Psychotherapy and counselling services had the longest waits with six trusts recording waits of more than two years .
Overall , the longest wait recorded by each trust averaged out at seven months .
The findings , obtained under the Freedom of Information Act , come as hospital patients face shorter and shorter waits .
By the end of this year , trusts have to ensure all patients are seen within 18 weeks .
But this does not cover community care , such as the mental health services for people with conditions like depression .
Private treatment
The Lib Dems believe this should be rectified with Mr Clegg setting out a range of policies to help people needing mental health treatment .
If elected , the Lib Dems pledge treatment within 13 weeks and if that target was missed patients would have the right to private treatment .
Experts have blamed the long waits in mental health care for the soaring rates of antidepressant drug prescriptions .
More than 31 m prescriptions for drugs such as Prozac were issued in England in 2006 after an almost continuous rise over the last 10 years .
Mr Clegg said he recognised there was a role for medication , but that it should not be the default option .
' False economy '
Paul Farmer , chief executive of Mind , said : " Three years is too long to make someone wait for help that could transform their life , possibly even save their life .
" Scrimping on basic mental health services is a false economy .
I waited 72 weeks to see a psychologist
Alan Heeler , Nuneaton
Sane chief executive Marjorie Wallace said : " Only by treating mental illness as being as life - threatening as cancer or heart disease will we bring services to the front line and end the years of chronic neglect . "
But a Department of Health spokesman said : " We are continuing to work towards improving access to mental health services and specifically psychological therapies , where we know capacity is particularly challenged . "
She said £ 170 m of extra funding for psychological therapies would mean an extra 900,000 will get treatment for conditions such as depression and anxiety over the next three years .
Are you affected by this story ?
Are you unhappy with treatment you received for mental health problems ?
Do you think anti-depressant drugs are prescribed too readily by doctors ?
Your comments :
Working in mental health services I can tell you that all of our units and community teams are screaming out for staff .
We can't cover our shifts properly , we do n't have enough beds and shuffle patients from hospital to hospital in a permanent bed crisis .
The service is not being run for the patients , nor for the staff .
It 's not a question of efficiency , we are on our knees through lack of resources .
Tony , North of England
I have suffered from depression most of my teenage and adult life ( I am now 28 ) and have never once received adequate care .
When it was mild depression , I was given prozac and told to exercise more , when it was severe depression I took overdose after overdose and was put on a waiting list for counselling .
After waiting patiently for 2 years , I was told they 'd lost my file and I had to start again from scratch .
In the end I got myself in a stupid amount of debt by paying for therapy myself .
I am now halfway to being " cured " but I have the added stress now of being seriously in debt !
Claire Martin , Colchester , UK
Eight years ago I developed anxiety and clinical depression and I was treated very badly by the NHS system .... Drug treatment was given by my GP without any real follow up and I was not offered any form of counselling .
I then used my company medical insurance and was admitted to a private clinic for treatment .
The contrast in care was quite unbelievable and within a month I had made such an enormous recovery .
The NHS system does not know how to treat mentally ill patients and a ten minute doctor 's consultation just wo n't do it .
People need professional help by qualified mental health experts .
Depression is without doubt one of the worsed sorts of suffering that a human can endure .

Mental illness is like a mental cancer ... it eats away at people and is completely misunderstood and disrespected .

Baking bread might be a relaxing weekend activity , but making the flour that goes into that bread is a dangerous business .
Ever since the Washburn flour mill explosion near Minneapolis in 1878 killed 18 people , the milling industry has tried to reduce the risk of flour particles igniting into flour bombs .
Unfortunately , that ’s tougher than it sounds .
In fact , General Mills ’ Gold Medal Flour factory , uses " explosion - proof " motors for added protection .
“ Flour dust that is suspended in air is more explosive than coal dust , " Paul Steinlage , milling manager , told Food Engineering Magazine this month .
" With the number of motors we need to run the mill , we absolutely have to have the best explosion - proof motors so we feel protected . ”
Throughout agriculture and food processing , there were 115 reported dust explosions [ pdf ] between 1994 and 2003 , the most recent numbers available , most of them in grain elevators .
These stats left me asking : why is dust explosive ?
I called up the Bill Stevenson of CV Technology , which bills itself as a dust explosion consulting company .
He explained that there are five key components to a dust explosion : 1 ) dust 2 ) suspended in a cloud 3 ) within a confined space 4 ) with enough air 5 ) and some type of ignition .
He said this was called the " explosion pentagon " .
Without all of those factors , you wo n’t get a dust explosion .
" If you had a layer of ( flour ) on your kitchen counter and you put a benzine torch to it , you could get it to ignite but it would n’t blow up , " he said .
Flour sitting on your counter just does n’t have enough oxygen to burn , he said .
But airborne flour particles ( or corn starch , as in the video above ) have enough oxygen available for combustion AND yet remain close enough to each other to create the chain reaction that results in an explosion when one flour particle is ignited .
If you find yourself in a romantic comedy style flour fight in the kitchen , however , do n’t worry too much .
Stevenson noted that the amounts of grain used in home cooking are n’t really enough to do serious damage .
" The amount of corn starch or flour that you use at home is a 1 cup here or 2 cups there .
That ’s not what we ’re worried about , " he said .
" What we ’re worried about is the railroad car load . "

Notice that the corn starch used in the video is n’t confined , so it does n’t cause an explosion , just a nice fireball .

FBI documents contradict 9/11 Commission report Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Thursday February 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hijacker had post -9/11 flights scheduled , files say Newly - released records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request contradict the 9/11 Commissions report on the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks and raise fresh questions about the role of Saudi government officials in connection to the hijackers .
The nearly 300 pages of a Federal Bureau of Investigation timeline used by the 9/11 Commission as the basis for many of its findings were acquired through a FOIA request filed by Kevin Fenton , a 26 year old translator from the Czech Republic .
The FBI released the 298 - page hijacker timeline  Feb .
4 . The FBI timeline reveals that alleged hijacker Hamza Al - Ghamdi , who was aboard the United Airlines flight which crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center , had booked a future flight to San Francisco .
He also had a ticket for a trip from Casablanca to Riyadh , the capital of Saudi Arabia .
Though referenced repeatedly in the footnotes of the final 9/11 Commission report , the timeline has not previously been made available to the public .
The FBI timeline is dated Nov. 14 , 2003 but appears to have been put together earlier ( since the last date mentioned in the document is Oct. 22 , 2001 ) and was provided to the 9/11 Commission during its 2003 investigation .
The final Commission report cites the FBI timeline 52 times .
Post Sept. 11 , 2001 flights
The FBI timeline reveals that Al - Ghamdi , the alleged United hijacker , was booked onto several flights scheduled for after the 9/11 attacks , a piece of information not documented in the Commissions final report .
According to the FBI timeline , Al - Ghamdi was booked on another United Airlines flight on the very day of the attack .
On page 288 under an entry pertaining to H AlGhamdi ,  the FBI timeline reads : " Future flight .
Scheduled to depart Los Angeles International Airport for San Francisco International Airport on UA 7950 . "
The sourcing reads simply : UA passenger information . 
The timeline similarly documents Al - Ghamdis bookings for several other post 9/11 flights , including one on Sept. 20 , 2001 from Casablanca , Morocco to Riyadh , Saudi Arabia and another on Sept. 29 , 2001 from Riyadh to Damman , Saudi Arabia .
( FBI Timeline 2 , p. 296 under  H Alghamdi )
No additional information or explanation is offered in the FBI timeline itself .
The Saudi connection
In January 2000 , then - FBI Director Louis Freeh and CIA Director George Tenet attended regular briefings as Malaysian intelligence conducted surveillance of a terrorist summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur .
Among the attendees were Nawaf al - Hazmi and Khalid al - Mihdhar , two men who would later allegedly hijack American Airlines Flight 77 and crash it into the Pentagon .
A week after the Malaysian summit , al - Mihdar and al - Hazmi traveled to the United States .
According to the 9/11 Commission report , they arrived in Los Angeles on Jan. 15 and spent about two weeks there before moving to San Diego . 
( 9/11 Commission report , p. 215 , chapter 7 ) .
The footnote for this item shows that the Commission relied on a different FBI report , Summary of Pentbom Investigation ,  Feb.29 , 2004 ( classified version ) , p.16 .
But the FBI timeline contradicts this claim , placing the alleged hijackers in San Diego with specific details .
According to the timeline , the two men resided in Apartment 152 at Parkwood Apartments , San Diego , from Jan. 15 through Feb. 2 , 2000 .
 A rental application shows that before renting Apartment 150 Parkwood Apartments on 02/05/2000 , AL - MlHDHAR and Nawaf Alhazmi alleged that they resided with [ REDACTED ] from 01/15/2000 to 02/02/2000 at Apartment 152 of the same apartment complex ,  page 52 of the FBI timeline reads .
Two pages later , the same apartment complex is noted again , this time with its full address : AL - MIHDHAR and Nawaf Alhazmi resided at Parkwood Apartments , located at 6401 Mount Ada Road , Apartment 150 , San Diego , CA . [ REDACTED ] was the co-signor and guarantor on the lease agreement for this apparement .
The rental application shows that before renting Apartment 150 , AL - MIHDHAR and Nawaf Alhazmi resided with [ REDACTED ] . "
( A photograph of apartment 152 appears atop this article .
An image of apartment 150 appears on page 2 . )
In other words , according to the only public account , both Al - Mihdhar and Hazmi were in San Diego , not Los Angeles , contrary to the Commissions report .
Why did the Commission use an alternate source for the whereabouts of the two men , when the FBIs own timeline said they were in San Diego by Jan. 15 , the same day as their arrival in the US ?
Paul Thompson , author of the The Terror Timeline : Year by Year , Day by Day , Minute by Minute : A Comprehensive Chronicle of the Road to 9/11 -- and America 's Response , has been wading through the FBI timeline since its release .
His preliminary analysis can be found at the website of the History Commons ( formerly known as the Center for Cooperative Research ) .
Thompson believes that the possible motive for the Commission to alter the dates is to obscure official Saudi ties to the hijackers .
He points to the redaction of the name of a person who is a known employee of a Saudi defense contractor , Omar al - Bayoumi , who lived at the same location .
 We know its Bayoumi ,  said Thompson , because after 9/11 , the Finnish Government mistakenly released a classified FBI list of suspects that showed Bayoumi living in apartment # 152 of Parkwood Apartments . 
That information is available here .
 But also important is that it strongly suggests that the hijackers already had a support network in Southern California before they arrived ,  Thompson continued .
 In the official version of the story now , the hijackers drift around L.A. listlessly for two weeks before chancing to come across Bayoumi in a restaurant [ according to Bayoumis account ] ,  Thompson added .
 Whereupon he's an incredible good Samaritan and takes them down to San Diego , pays their rent , etc . 
 But from the FBI 's timeline , we now know the hijackers started staying at Bayoumi 's place on Jan. 15  the very same day they arrived ,  Thompson says .
 So obviously they must have been met at the airport and taken care of from their very first hours in the US .
That 's huge because the FBI maintains to this day that the hijackers never had any accomplices in the US . 
Robert Baer , a former CIA case officer in the Middle East whose See No Evil : The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA 's War on Terrorism became the inspiration for the award winning film Syriana , concurs with Thompsons view .
 There are enough discrepancies and unanswered questions in the 9/11 Commission report that under a friendly administration , the 9/11 investigation should be re-opened ,  Baer wrote in an email message Tuesday night .
 Bayoumi clearly offered material assistance to [ the 9/11 hijackers ] .

When I finished my MBA last year with $ 20,000 in unused school loans , I realized I could tap that money to start my own business .
With a degree from the London Business School , I figured I could take my entrepreneurial talents anywhere in the world .
I chose Afghanistan .
It was even more of a challenge than I expected .
The main difficulty was n't so much the security situation .
More problematic was the fact that years of war and chaos have made Afghan businesspeople cautious about offending the mullahs and the government .
I planned to sell ringtones and other mobile - phone content .
To do that I had to get my customers - the country 's mobile - phone providers - to take a chance on services that the culture had yet to accept .
Along the way I got quite an education .
My interest in the Middle East began in 2003 , when I served a six - month tour of duty as a U.S. Marine Corps officer during the invasion of Iraq .
In the aftermath I saw that development of the region 's private sector was almost nonexistent .
I wanted to get involved .
I visited Afghanistan for the first time in 2005 , when I interned at a new staffing agency during my summer break from business school .
Back in London , I searched for a business in which I could draw on what I had learned about Afghan business culture .
A friend suggested mobile - phone content .
" Man , people would go bananas for this , " he said .
I thought he was right .
The country was just discovering cellphones .
I put together a business plan .
I returned to Afghanistan in April 2006 to set up Danebarf , which means " snowflake " in Dari , one of the languages spoken there .
At the time there were about a million mobile - phone users in the country , and the number was growing fast .
After grueling efforts to meet with the right contacts at the country 's three large mobile - phone companies , I persuaded them to let me sell ringtones to their customers .
But my main goal was to deliver products with higher margins .
I proposed a text - messaged horoscope service .
The executives rejected the idea .
They feared that we might offend religious leaders who consider horoscopes offensive to God .
They also nixed my idea to offer alerts on mobile phones when there was a riot or bombing .
If the warnings offended government officials , the companies might lose their licensing .
Afghan phone companies turned out to be searching for entertainment services , such as voting on MTV - style videos .
I delivered what they wanted , but I knew Danebarf needed to sell more profitable products to survive .
The real deathblow to my startup came when leaders of a nonprofit group abandoned plans to partner with me on two products , hinting that they felt my venture was too commercial .
I had just about run out of my startup money .
Seven months after I arrived , I decided it was time to wrap up .
What I learned is that I needed to allow more time to make my business work .
I could n't expect to find solutions to deep cultural differences instantly .
Now I 'm building my sales skills at Adeara , a value - added reseller of computer systems in the San Francisco Bay Area .
I would like to return to the developing world again as a social entrepreneur .
And when I do , I 'll make sure I have more cash to help me stay the course .

The Peculiar Pain of Paper Cuts Experts offer theories on how such little cuts can hurt so much .
Feb. 8 , 2008  --
They always strike when least expected — opening the mail , rummaging through notes , and in an instant , it 's " ouch ! " and you 're sucking air in through your teeth .
Oh , the paper cut .
Since the dawn of office work , it has been the one thing that can make even the most composed business person spew profanities .
Somehow , that little cut stings more than any other nick — and it keeps hurting , too .
But why ?
Theories of office lore circulate the Internet — from the microscopic structure of paper , to the chemicals used in paper plants , to bacteria living on our faxes .
While dermatologists know which theories are wrong , the most annoying pain in the office still remains a bit of a medical mystery .
Hogging the Nerves
" Nobody really knows the answer , " says Dr. Joseph Eastern , a dermatologist in private practice in Belleville , N.J. But , Eastern adds , there are a few good theories .
The first culprit would be our hands ' nociceptors — the nerve fibers that send touch and pain messages to our brain , particularly the somatosensory cortex .
The hands hog more nociceptors than the arms , the legs , or the stomach , as a way to protect us .
" If we touch something hot or sharp , or in anyway painful , we are most likely to do it with our hands — and so , our hands should be a great judge of those bad or painful things , " says Dr. Mark Abdelmalek , chief of laser and dermatologic surgery at Drexel University College of Medicine .
" If you had a paper cut on your thigh , it would n't hurt nearly as bad because the thigh does n't deserve all that attention in the brain 's somatosensory cortex , " he says .
But the strategic concentration of nerves on our hands does n't explain why paper cuts instantly sting in a way other scrapes and cuts on our hands do not .
To explain that , people often turn to the weapon — paper .
Do n't Blame Just Hands , Blame Paper
Internet forum posts are full of blame for paper , and most are a little off the mark .
One frequent claim is that paper is porous , and therefore , a better host to bacteria than the clean surface of a razor or a knife .
Cut yourself with paper , and you 'll leave behind debris and bacteria to sting you .
But dermatologists do n't always agree .
" Number one , bacteria do n't cause pain , " says Eastman .
" You get pain with an infection , because your skin is inflamed , trying to fight off bacteria , but bacteria does n't cause pain . "
Second , says Eastman , " I do n't know that there 's any evidence that paper leaves behind more dirt and bugs than anything else you cut yourself with . "
However , paper is still part of the problem .
Paper is sharp , but it 's duller than knives and razors .
It 's also more flimsy than needles and rocks .
Unfortunately , for office workers , the combination of paper 's unique qualities results in awful cuts .
The Perfect Painful Cut
The flexible , relatively dull edge of paper means paper cuts never go very deep .
But while a dull , shallow cut sounds less painful , pain specialists say it 's worse .
First , the dull edge of the paper is more likely to rip flesh than tear it .
" This means paper could do more microscopic damage , " says Eastman .
The microscopic damage hits the most sensitive nerves , too .
The concentrated nerves on the hands have a very low threshold to activate and send a signal to the brain , says Dr. Carmen R. Green , associate professor of pain medicine at the University of Michigan .
Meanwhile , larger nerves , which send dull aching pain , are tucked safely away deeper in the flesh .
" Sometimes , you can slice your finger open and it looks bad , but it does n't hurt that much , " says Green .
So , since a paper cut is shallow , and unlikely to bleed a lot , it will more likely sting , instead of produce a dull throb .
Unfortunately , the shallow cut only brings more bad news .
Because paper cuts are shallow , they are less likely to bleed , clot and seal up the wound with a scab .
That means the raw nerves are open to the air , and keep sending new messages of pain to the brain .
What To Do
Cover the cut .
Sealing the wound will stimulate fewer pain receptors , and it will help the cut heal , says Dr. Nicole Neuschler , assistant professor of dermatology at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York .
" People often do n't try to seal the wound , " says Neuchler .
" But it could be as simple as Vaseline , liquid bandage , Super Glue or Crazy Glue . "
Bill Maher
AKA William Maher , Jr.
Born : 20 - Jan-1956
Birthplace : New York City
Gender : Male
Religion : Agnostic [ 1 ]
Race or Ethnicity : White
Sexual orientation : Straight
Occupation : Talk Show Host
Nationality : United States
Executive summary : Politically Incorrect
Bill Maher was born in New York City , and grew up in New Jersey .
His father was Catholic , a newsman with a sense of humor who told jokes around the house .
His mother was Jewish , a nurse , generally quiet and serious .
As a young boy , Maher was too shy to make many friends .
While attending college at Cornell , Maher tried stand - up at New York 's famous Catch a Rising Star night club .
He was terrified and not terribly funny , but it was n't a disaster .
He hung out at the club for several years , getting to know the comedy business , and getting better at it .
Maher eventually landed the emcee job at the club , which quickly got him noticed by a talent scout for Johnny Carson 's Tonight Show .
He made numerous appearances on Tonight , always funny and always invited back , but Maher felt constrained by the show 's rules -- every comedian 's material was vetted in advance down to the smallest detail , and anything political had to be inoffensive to every important demographic .
The banter between guest and host was largely based on pre-interviews with staff members .
Maher had an itch to try something more spontaneous .
In 1993 , Maher found a format that fit his talents : Politically Incorrect debuted on Comedy Central , with Maher and celebrity guests discussing political issues of the day , but with a sense of humor and few constraints .
Maher 's perspective was and remains mostly libertarian , and his show was bizarrely open - minded by mainstream network TV standards , with guests ranging from pinkos to the conservative extreme .
It was The McLaughlin Group without the pretentiousness , and the ratings were good enough to get ABC 's attention .
The show jumped from cable to the network in 1997 .
Yet Politically Incorrect died in 2002 , a lingering casualty of its own political incorrectness .
In the immediate aftermath of September 11 , it was supposed to be unanimous that the terrorists were simply cowards who hated American freedoms .
But only six days after the attacks , Maher and the East Indian conservative Dinesh D'Souza had this conversation on the show :
D'SOUZA : Bill , there 's another piece of political correctness I want to mention .
And , although I think Bush has been doing a great job , one of the themes we hear constantly is that the people who did this are cowards .
MAHER : Not true .
D'SOUZA : Not true .
Look at what they did .
First of all , you have a whole bunch of guys who are willing to give their life .
None of them backed out .
All of them slammed themselves into pieces of concrete .
MAHER : Exactly .
D'SOUZA : These are warriors .
And we have to realize that the principles of our way of life are in conflict with people in the world .
And so -- I mean , I 'm all for understanding the sociological causes of this , but we should not blame the victim .
Americans should n't blame themselves because other people want to bomb them .
MAHER : But also , we should -- we have been the cowards lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away .
That 's cowardly .
Staying in the airplane when it hits the building , say what you want about it , it 's not cowardly .
You 're right .
Sears and Federal Express immediately yanked their ads from the show , and 17 local ABC stations stopped airing Politically Incorrect .
Instead of making its usual profit for the network , Maher 's show was suddenly costing more than it earned .
Maher made a semi-apology to people who had misconstrued his remarks , and the show limped along for several months before the axe quietly fell .
Maher quickly started a similar show on HBO , Real Time , aired live for an hour weekly .
The new show sports
Maher still saying what he thinks , with three guests instead of four -- and no sponsors or affiliates to offend .
