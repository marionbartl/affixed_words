I know this is wrong , and if I owned this Captain America hoodie I would probably pass through some kind of threshold of nerdom of no return .
However , how cool is this hoodie ?
Seriously , how cool is this hoodie ?
If this is wrong , I do n’t want to be right !

Miss Mathurasingh met Bristol while working in Trinidad A woman was stabbed repeatedly by her ex-lover after he saw a picture of her with her new boyfriend on Facebook .
Paul Bristol , 25 , was found guilty at the Old Bailey of murdering Camille Mathurasingh , 27 , at her east London home in April 2009 .
The IT technician , who lived in Trinidad and Tobago , flew to London within two weeks of seeing the picture and killed the accountant .
Bristol , who denied murder , is expected to be sentenced later this month .
The court heard he could not accept " it was over " and had come to " win " his girlfriend back .
Bristol , who worked for the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Administration , and Miss Mathurasingh met during the three years she worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Port of Spain , Trinidad .
' He looked evil '
After her return to London in 2008 their relationship continued through emails and telephone calls , but last year she began having doubts about their future and decided to go out with her new boyfriend .
Simon Denison QC , prosecuting , said : " It would appear she tried to bring about the end of her relationship with this defendant gently and did not tell him about her new boyfriend .
Bristol flew to London two weeks after seeing the Facebook picture " He found out when he saw pictures of them together on Facebook .
" He would say he could not accept it was over and he decided to come here to see if he could win her back . "
The day before her murder , she told her sister Nadine that she had to flee her home as Bristol had arrived from Trinidad , but she saw him following her .
Nadine said of the conversation : " She said she looked into her rear - view mirror .
She said he looked evil . "
Metropolitan Police said they caught Bristol when he fled on foot after a collision between his car and a black cab in east London .
When stopped he had blood over his face and clothes and admitted killing his girlfriend .
He claimed he committed manslaughter through provocation .
Following the verdict , the victim 's mother Indra Mathurasingh said : " Justice has been served for Camille .
She was snatched from us and we are empty without her . "

Australia 's relations with Israel have hit a new low , with Foreign Minister Stephen Smith expelling an Israeli diplomat over the faking of four Australian passports used in the killing of a senior Hamas official in January .
Mr Smith told Parliament today that investigations by intelligence agencies had concluded Israel was responsible for the fake passports .
" Investigations and advice have left the government in no doubt Israel was responsible for the abuse and counterfeiting of these passports , " he said .
The scandal over the use of fake passports erupted internationally after Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , one of Hamas 's top arms dealers , was murdered by alleged Mossad agents in his Dubai hotel room on January 20 .

Time for another game of ‘ Shop job or Shadow : Gizmodo ’s received a picture from someone claiming that they found the upcoming Motorola Shadow on the floor at a Verizon corporate gym .
According to the tipster they had enough time to confirm most of the rumored specs of the phone before it was remotely locked down , though suspiciously , they only had enough time to snap one picture .
Engadget notes that the angle of the picture is uncannily similar to that of the leaked ‘ Getting Started ’ manual that we ’ve covered earlier .
The tipster ‘ confirmed ’ the following specs :
8 MP camera
4.3 ” screen
16GB of internal storage
Snapdragon CPU
HDMI port
Again , take the above information , or at least the new information ( Snapdragon CPU / 16 GB internal storage ) with a grain of salt .
If these specs are in fact true , this will turn out to be a pretty decent handset , and with a QWERTY keyboard to boot .

Israel 's criminal water policy Fawaz Turki *
The world 's most precious resource , when you get down to it , is not oil , but water .

By robbing Palestinians of their resources , Tel Aviv intends to see that they will wither away or emigrate into oblivion
April 23 , 2010
Stipulated : Since 1967 , when it occupied the Palestinian territories , Israel has been progressively robbing Palestinians of their land , thus pauperising them and stultifying their economy .
A given .
But what seems to have passed largely unnoticed here is the robbery of these people 's water supplies , a more reprehensible crime with a more devastating impact on the quality of life in the occupied territories .
The world 's most precious resource , when you get down to it , is not oil , but water .
Rob a people of their water resources , or dramatically reduce their access to them , and you transform them into a community living in the manner of beasts .
The United Nations has appointed Pittsburgh the North America host for World Environment Day 2010 , a series of conferences book - ended by Earth Day on April 22 and The Water Matters !
Global Water Conference on June 3 , the latter being the marqee event , with keynote speakers from different countries around the world and panel discussions on water - based topics , highlighting our dependence , as human communities , on water for public health , energy and economic prosperity .
It is hoped that Arab delegates to this important conference will stress to the international community that while Israel 's land grabbing and colonisation practices in the West Bank are egregious enough by themselves , robbery of Palestinian water from the two main aquifers there is even more so , leaving a devastating trail of poverty , destitution and misery behind it for ordinary Palestinians under occupation .
The figures speak for themselves .
In a report released last year , the World Bank found large disparities in water used between Israelis and Palestinians .
Although both Palestinians and Israeli colonists share the same aquifer that runs the length of the West Bank , Palestinians have access to only a fifth of the water supply , the report said , while Israelis take the rest .
In some areas of the West Bank , Palestinians survive on as little as 15 litres a person a day , which is at , or below , humanitarian disaster response levels recommended to avoid epidemic .
( In Gaza , where Palestinians rely on an aquifer that has become increasingly saline and polluted , the situation is worse , for only 5 to 10 per cent of the available water is clean enough to drink . )
In prosperous countries , say in this case the US , the average American uses 100 gallons of water a day at home for cooking , drinking , bathing and washing .
In Palestine , the average Israeli uses 92.5 gallons of water a day , whereas his Palestinian counterpart gets a mere 18 gallons .
Worse than that � and this according to Beitseleem , the Israeli human rights group � when water is scarce , the Israeli water company Mekorot shuts the valves of the main pipelines supplying Palestinian towns and villages with water so that Israeli supplies remain unaffected .
Human face to the tragedy
Let 's dispense with these abstract figures and give a human face to this tragedy .
Here 's part of a report posted in August last year on the website of Voice of America : " It is Wednesday at the home of the Mahmoud family in the village of Rafat , not far from [ occupied ] Jerusalem .
This is one of the few days of the week that water flows from the taps .
Family members rush to take advantage of every precious drop before the afternoon , filling plastic bags , oil drums , and pails with water for use by the 15 people in this house .
Intifar Hassan , one of the women of the family , says she knows the taps will run dry by the afternoon and stay dry for several days ahead .
She hurries to knead dough for the bread her family will eat all week .
She says that on this day that they have water from the taps , her family bathes , does laundry , washes dishes , cooks , and flushes toilets " .
In an article that appeared recently in Nation , a progressive American weekly , Fareed Taamata evoked a bemused image of this unequal division of water in his village of Qira , for whose residents it is a daily struggle to coax water out of taps : " Across the main road from Qira , deep inside the West Bank , is the Israeli [ colony ] of Ariel , where water is supplied to irrigate gardens , wash cars , and fill swimming pools .
The water in Ariel , and other Israeli [ colonies ] , is never cut off .
Ironically , we feel lucky because we look out onto beautiful homes [ in these colonies ] , with green yards , while Israeli [ colonists ] view the gloomy scene of our poor , parched community " .
Water , as the very trigger for the rise and fall of civilisations in human history , has long been recognised by historians , most notably Karl August Wittfogel , whose seminal work on what he called " hydraulic cultures " , along great rivers like the Nile , the Yangtze and the Ganges , continues to be read today , well over six decades after its publication .
Wittfogel 's thesis may appear pedestrian at first glance , but it is relevant to a consideration of the fate that can await Palestine and the Palestinians in the not too distant future : a people with abundant access to water will prosper and move on civilisationally , whereas a people with limited access to it will wither � or emigrate .
Maybe by robbing Palestinians of their land , and then of the very water resources that God had endowed them with since time immemorial , Israel intends to do just that � see to it that Palestinians will wither away , or emigrate , into oblivion .
Damn this Zionist entity with its latter day colonial designs on our homeland !
Arab delegates at The Water Matter !
Global Water Conference in Pittsburgh on June 3 should be forceful in reminding the international community of Israel 's criminal ( yes , that is the word ) water policy in Palestine .

Version 1.21r6 of October 30th , 2019
AdaControl is a free ( GMGPL ) tool that detects the use of various kinds of constructs in Ada programs .
Its first goal is to control proper usage of style or programming rules , but it can also be used as a powerful tool to search for use ( or non-use ) of various forms of programming styles or design patterns .
Searched elements range from very simple , like the occurrence of certaine entities , declarations , or statements , to very sophisticated , like verifying that certain programming patterns are being obeyed .
Which elements or constructs are searched is defined by a set of rules ; the following table gives a short summary of the 71 rules currently checked by AdaControl .
The number in parentheses after the rule name gives the number of subrules , if any .
Considering all possible rules and subrules , this makes 579 tests that can be performed currently by AdaControl !

For more details on these rules , or on the use of AdaControl in general , please refer to the user 's guide .
AdaControl is a command line tool , but it has been fully integrated into AdaCore 's GPS environment .
From GPS , you can run AdaControl , fix the violations , or edit the rules file with just a few clicks .
NEW !
AdaControl can now help you fix violations : under GPS , just click on the little wrench icon , just like with compiler messages .
You can also fix all violations at once from a menu command .
And a new command line utility is provided to fix all fixable violations automatically !
But AdaControl is more than a set of coding rules : it is a complete environment , designed to be easily extended .
If your favorite rule is not provided , you can add it yourself !
And of course , we will continue to extend the number of rules in the future .
If you want to look into how this is possible , please refer to the AdaControl programmer guide .
Initial development of AdaControl was sponsored by Eurocontrol .
Some rules were sponsored by BelgoControl , Alstom - Transport , Hitachi rail STS ( prev. Ansaldo ) , and SAGEM - DS .
It is a mature tool , routinely used to check Ada codes at Eurocontrol ( Brussels , more than 2_000_000 SLOC , Maastricht ) , BelgoControl , Alstom , Ansaldo - STS , Faiveley , SAGEM -DS ( level DO178B / A ) ...
It has also been run against all executable tests from the ACATS .
AdaControl is an ASIS application .
AdaControl is a free tool under GMGPL license .
Nonetheless , it is a commercial product from Adalog , for which we offer a support and maintenance contract .
We offer also services for the development of rules for your specific needs , or more generally assistance for the definition and usage of programming rules .
For information , please contact info@adalog.fr .
Download
AdaControl , like any ASIS application , can run only if compiled with the exact same version of the compiler that it uses itself when executing .
It is therefore provided as executable only for GNAT Community / 2019 ( Windows and Linux ) ; for use with any other version of GNAT , please download the source version and recompile ( which is quite easy to do , provided ASIS has been installed ) .
It has been tested only with GNAT , but should be easily portable to any other compiler that provides an ASIS interface .
The ZIP or TGZ versions allow you to install AdaControl as you please ; under Windows , the installers install everything automatically - provided the < GNAT > \bin directory is on your execution path .

You know , that one right in the middle of the spectrum .
Kate Harding points out a skill that often escapes even the most accomplished women : accepting compliments without self - deprecation .
So how to acknowledge your awesomeness without being an ass ?
Advertisement
Of course , taking a compliment well can be a delicate thing for men too .
But women especially are socialized not to toot our own horns , and in our unwillingness to do so , we sometimes unintentionally reinforce the idea that women should n't be proud of what they do .
Harding writes about her friend , who responded to a compliment on her music thus : " Thanks .
Yeah , I like to think I 'm good at what I do .
I could act all self - deprecating , but it is , you know … what I do . "
Harding was initially surprised , but then realized " that what just happened was unusual and very cool :
Two women had just had a conversation in which they admitted out loud that they were good at something , without feeling the need to qualify it with a bunch of stuff about how they 're not as good as they could be , or how other people are so much better , or how the things they 're good at are n't really important in the scheme of things . "
That kind of conversation should really happen more often .
I 've struggled with taking compliments gracefully — I have a tendency to respond with some joke at my own expense — but I 've been working on the issue and arrived at a few insights .
Herewith , a couple of tips :
Just say " thanks ! "
Advertisement
An enthusiastic " thank you " often needs no qualifier .
Do n't add " but it really was n't that good " — just stop with gratitude .
You 'll still sound polite and gracious .
And you 'll avoid the cycle of self - snark that can be really dangerous , especially with looks - based compliments ( ie .
" My hair does n't look great , it looks horrible . "
" No , my hair is horrible . " )
Sometimes less is more .
Say , " that means a lot to me . "
If you want to convey how touched you are by someone 's admiration , without implying that you do n't deserve it , this is a great way to go .

Breaking a habit of self - deprecation is tough , in part because women are sometimes actively punished for emphasizing their achievements .
I 've noticed , though , that it 's easier to be frank about the ways I 'm proud of myself when I 'm talking to people I 'm very close to .
So these days I make a special effort to share my accomplishments with close friends and family in a self - confident way .
If I do really well on something , I 'll go ahead and say , " I did an awesome job on this .
Take a look . "
I know that the people who care about me do n't think I 'm an arrogant narcissist — or if I were , they 'd tell me .
Speaking of which ...
Do n't be an arrogant narcissist .
Give credit where credit is due .
Acknowledge the people who help you .
Compliment others on their achievements .
Be open to criticism , and work hard on the areas where you need to improve .
Listen .
If you do all these things , it 's pretty hard to be an asshole .
And if you consistently display non-asshole behavior in your daily life , people wo n't think you 're a dick if you accept credit when credit is due .

Or maybe they will .
The sad fact is that eschewing self - deprecation is sometimes a risk , especially for women — we 're more likely to be branded as uppity or conceited for behavior that in men would simply be confident .
But the more we accept compliments without self - snark , the more we make it acceptable for other women to do so , and the more we make it okay for women own their successes as well as their failures .
Which is , in itself , worth a compliment .

Slightly Pre-Friday Sorta - Fluff : I 'm Kate Fucking Harding [ Shapely Prose ]

Editor ’s note : Alex Jones and Infowars.com would like to thank all who called the authorities concerning the arrest of Aaron Dykes .
Since this article was posted last night , Aaron has been released from police custody .
He was charged with “ disrupting a meeting or precession , ” not resisting arrest as previously stated .
Compare the incident in Austin to one in California .
Obama was interrupted numerous times by “ gay rights ” activists on Monday as he gave a speech at a fundraiser for California Sen. Barbara Boxer .
The protesters were not arrested .
In fact they were allowed to remain and continue heckling Obama .
The activists in California were demanding action on “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” while Dykes was drawing attention to war crimes committed by the Bush administration .
Obviously , one is permissible while the other is not .
Infowars reporter Aaron Dykes was arrested today during a Karl Rove appearance at the University of Texas in Austin .
The former Bush deputy chief of staff and notorious dirty trickster Rove was invited to the university where he was asked to talk about “ his time at the White House as former President George W. Bush ’s top political adviser , ” according to News 8 Austin .
“ Rove will also share his analysis of key issues the nation currently faces , including health care , the economy and the protection of individual liberties . ”
News 8 ’s description of Rove ’s discussion covering “ protection of individual liberties ” is particularly ironic .
Dykes was arrested during a question and answer session after he asked Rove about the Downing Street memo and a record documenting a meeting between Bush and Tony Blair where the two leaders discussed painting a reconnaissance aircraft in UN colors in order to provoke Iraq .
The Downing Street memo revealed that intelligence and facts were fixed by the neocon Bush regime around the policy of illegally removing Saddam Hussein from power .
The document uncovered that intelligence on Iraq prior to the war was deliberately falsified and not simply mistaken as Bush and the neocons later claimed .
In response to the question , Rove told Dykes to “ shut up and sit down . ”
Aaron was then arrested by UT Police and placed in handcuffs .
He was charged with resisting arrest , although Dykes made a point to raise his arms and declare that he was not resisting arrest or posing a threat to the police .
He was then transferred to the Travis County Jail where he is being held by the Austin Police .
Infowars cameraman Rob Jacobson was also detained by UT Police but released .
Aaron Dykes was singled out and persecuted because he is an Infowars journalist .
This is outrageous and should not be permitted in a country that supposedly prides itself on the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment .
Dykes did not cause a disturbance and did not resist arrest as the police charge .
The harassment and arrest of journalists is something that happens in third world dictatorships and should not be allowed in Texas or anywhere else in the United States .

Zion Square in Jerusalem stood empty on Saturday night .
The plaza , normally symbolic of the protest of the extreme right , was to be the site of planned protest by a group of left - wing organizations including Peace Now , the Geneva Initiative and the National Left .
But two weeks ago , Channel 24's new glass - walled studio opened in the concourse , and the demonstration was moved to a nearby site adjoining the Russian Compound .
The protest took place under the umbrella of the National Left , founded by lawyer Eldad Yaniv and playwright Shmuel Hasfari .
Israeli flags flew , the speakers proclaimed their Zionism and the event wound up with the singing of the national anthem , ' Hatikva . "
The protesters – 1,000 of them according to police and 2,000 according to the organizers – called for the immediate dismantlement of West Bank settlements , including in East Jerusalem .
" We want to get out of the West Bank because we are Zionists , " said Gadi Taub , one of the speakers .
The Right is n't the nationalist camp , its a bi-nationalist camp .
The center of our Zionism is n't land but human liberty . "
Nino Abashidze , a journalist , said : " The time has come to choose : A state without settlements , or settlement without a state . "
Mousi Raz , a former Knesset member , described the gathering as " the biggest left - wing protest in West Jerusalem in the last decade " .
Later , from the podium , Raz offered praise for demonstrators arrested on Friday in Sheikh Jarrah , a disputed neighborhood beyond the Green Line in the eastern half of the city , being held only meters away in the Russian Compound police station .
Yariv Oppenheimer , general secretary of Peace Now , said : " Any rational Israeli leader understands that evacuating the settlements is not Obama 's problem , or Hillary Clinton's , but a matter of the Israeli national interest .
It is the only way for Israel to pull itself out of international isolation . "

Tzvia Greenfield , our Haredi Knesset member ( Meretz ) , swept the crowd when she said , " Zionism can not be subordination and land theft .
Zionsim can not be control over the weak .
Judaism is not theft and conquering the weak .
That is not Zionism .
That is not Jewish . "
Attorney Yaniv concluded the rally by saying , " We do not hate , we are crying over our beloved Israel . "
He added , " We must end the occupation with an agreement or without one , with a partner or without one , and establish a society here that sets an example . "
Members of Israel 's right wing rushed to call the protest a resounding failure .
A spokesman for the Yesha settlement council said , " The failure of the ' National Left ' protest , with the angry handful of protesters who arrived at the square - despite a performance by singer Achinoam Nini and free beer – proves once again that most of the nation understands that settlers are Zionists overall .
The failure reverberates even more after more than 10,000 people participated in celebrations on Wednesday marking the reunification of Jerusalem . "
MK Michael Ben- Ari ( National Union ) also derided the left , especially Peace Now 's Oppenheimer .
" The anti-Zionist left cloaks itself in the Israeli flag in order to cover its nakedness , " said Ben - Ari , " but the public wo n't forget that Oppenheimer and his friends in recent months attended protests in which they denigrated the Israeli flag and waved flags of the PLO . "
For one thing , Mr. Keen says , “ history has proven that the crowd is not often very wise , ” embracing unwise ideas like “ slavery , infanticide , George W. Bush ’s war in Iraq , Britney Spears . ”
The crowd created the tech bubble of the 1990s , just as it created the disastrous Tulipmania that swept the Netherlands in the 17th century .
Mr. Keen also points out that Google search results — which answer “ search queries not with what is most true or most reliable , but merely what is most popular ” — can be manipulated by “ Google bombing ” ( which “ involves simply linking a large number of sites to a certain page ” to “ raise the ranking of any given site in Google ’s search results ” ) .
And he cites a recent Wall Street Journal article reporting that hot lists on social networking Web sites are often shaped by a small number of users : that at Digg.com , which has 900,000 registered users , 30 people were responsible at one point for submitting one - third of the postings on the home page ; and at Netscape.com , a single user was behind 217 stories over a two - week period , or 13 percent of all stories that reached the most popular list in that period .
Because Web 2.0 celebrates the “ noble amateur ” over the expert , and because many search engines and Web sites tout popularity rather than reliability , Mr. Keen notes , it ’s easy for misinformation and rumors to proliferate in cyberspace .
For instance , the online encyclopedia Wikipedia ( which relies upon volunteer editors and contributors ) gets way more traffic than the Web site run by Encyclopedia Britannica ( which relies upon experts and scholars ) , even though the interactive format employed by Wikipedia opens it to postings that are inaccurate , unverified , even downright fraudulent .
This year it was revealed that a contributor using the name Essjay , who had edited thousands of Wikipedia articles and was once one of the few people given the authority to arbitrate disputes between writers , was a 24 - year - old named Ryan Jordan , not the tenured professor he claimed to be .

Since contributors to Wikipedia and YouTube are frequently anonymous , it ’s hard for users to be certain of their identity — or their agendas .
Postings about political candidates , for instance , can be made by opponents disguising their motives ; and propaganda can be passed off as news or information .
For that matter , as Mr. Keen points out , the idea of objectivity is becoming increasingly passé in the relativistic realm of the Web , where bloggers cherry - pick information and promote speculation and spin as fact .
Whereas historians and journalists traditionally strived to deliver the best available truth possible , many bloggers revel in their own subjectivity , and many Web 2.0 users simply use the Net , in Mr. Keen ’s words , to confirm their “ own partisan views and link to others with the same ideologies . ”
What ’s more , as mutually agreed upon facts become more elusive , informed debate about important social and political issues of the day becomes more difficult as well .
We may have seen somewhat of a video overload in the past month or so , though last week was surprisingly barren when it came to anything decent .
So it 's a undoubtedly a good thing that the first music video of this week is of a high standard and from a band we like .
A lot .
It 's HEALTH , with ' We Are Water ' .
I say it's of a " high - quality " but if you are gendered towards the male proportion of the population then there 's a part which may make you wince quite hard .
It involves some gooly - related pain .
It 's pretty intense from start to finish .

Watch below :
Russia and Italy have entered into an agreement to build a new fusion reactor outside Moscow that could become the first such reactor to achieve ignition , the point where a fusion reaction becomes self - sustaining instead of requiring a constant input of energy .
The design for the reactor , called Ignitor , originated with MIT physics professor Bruno Coppi , who will be the project ’s principal investigator .
The concept for the new reactor builds on decades of experience with MIT ’s Alcator fusion research program , also initiated by Coppi , which in its present version ( called Alcator C - Mod ) has the highest magnetic field and highest plasma pressure ( two of the most important measures of performance in magnetic fusion ) of any fusion reactor , and is the largest university - based fusion reactor in the world .
The key ingredient in all fusion experiments is plasma , a kind of hot gas made up of charged particles such as atomic nuclei and electrons .
In fusion reactors , atomic nuclei — usually of isotopes of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium — are forced together through a combination of heat and pressure to overcome their natural electrostatic repulsion .
When the nuclei join together , or fuse , they release prodigious amounts of energy .
Ignitor would be about twice the size of Alcator C - Mod , with a main donut - shaped chamber 1.3 meters across , and have an even stronger magnetic field .
It will be much smaller and less expensive than the major international fusion project called ITER ( with a chamber 6.2 meters across ) , currently under construction in France .
Though originally designed to achieve ignition , the ITER reactor has been scaled back and is now not expected to reach that milestone .
The Ignitor reactor , Coppi says , will be “ a very compact , inexpensive type of machine , ” and unlike the larger ITER could be ready to begin operations within a few years .
Its design is based on a particularly effective combination of factors that researchers unexpectedly discovered during the many years of running the Alcator program , and that were later confirmed in experiments at other reactors .
Together , these factors produce especially good confinement of the plasma and a high degree of purity ( impurities in the hot gases can be a major source of inefficiency ) .
The new design aims to preserve these features to produce the highest plasma current densities — the amount of electric current in a given area of plasma .
The design also has additional structures needed to produce and confine burning fusion plasmas in order to create the conditions needed for ignition , Coppi says .
A project at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , called the National Ignition Facility , uses a completely different approach to fusion , bombarding a tiny pellet of fuel with laser beams to create the heat and pressure needed for fusion .
But some physicists disagree on the exact meaning of fusion ignition , and whether the results of the planned experiments at NIF can truly be considered ignition .
” I do n’t understand how they define ignition , ” Coppi says of what is being planned at NIF .
Coppi plans to work with the Italian ministry of research and Evgeny Velikhov , president of the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow , to finalize the distribution of tasks for the machine , the core of which is to be built in Italy and then installed in Troitsk , near Moscow , on the site of that institute ’s present Triniti reactor .
Velikhov , as it happens , is also the chair of the ITER council .
Coppi says of these two different programs , “ there ’s no competition , we are complementary . ”
Although seen as a possible significant contributor to the world ’s energy needs because it would be free of greenhouse - gas emissions , practical fusion power remains at least two decades away , most scientists in the field agree .
But the initial impetus for setting up the Alcator reactor in the 1970s had more to do with pure science : “ It was set up to simulate the X - ray stars that we knew at that time , ” says Coppi , whose research work has as much to do with astrophysics as with energy .
Stars are themselves made of plasma and powered by fusion , and the only way to study their atomic - level behavior in detail is through experiments inside fusion reactors .
Once the reactor was in operation , he says , “ we found we were producing plasmas with unusual properties , ” and realized this might represent a path to the long - sought goal of fusion ignition .
Roscoe
White , a distinguished research fellow at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory , says that “ the whole point of Ignitor is to find out how a burning plasma behaves , and there could be pleasant or unpleasant results coming from it .
Whatever is learned is a gain .
Nobody knows exactly how it will perform , that is the point of the experiment . ”
But while its exact results are unknown ,
White says it is important to pursue this project in addition to other approaches to fusion .
“ With our present knowledge it is very risky to commit the program to a single track reactor development — our knowledge is still in flux , ” he says .
In addition , he says , “ the completion of ITER , the only currently projected burning plasma experiment , is decades off .
Experimental data concerning a burning plasma would be very welcome , and could lead to important results helping the cause of practical fusion power . ”
Furthermore , the Ignitor approach , if all goes well , could lead to more compact and economical future reactors :
Some recent results from existing reactors , plus new information to be gained from Ignitor , “ could lead to reactor designs much smaller and simpler than ITER , ” he says .
Coppi remains especially interested in the potential of the new reactor to make new discoveries about fundamental physics .
Quoting the late MIT physicist and Institute Professor Bruno Rossi , Coppi says , “ whenever you do experiments in an unknown regime , you will find something new . ”
The new machine ’s findings , he suggests , “ will have a strong impact on astrophysics . ”
Achieving a feeling of realism in D&D ( or any other RPG ) without making a horrible mess of gameplay
The RPG world is littered with the rotting remains of vain attempts to introduce realism .
Critical hit tables , wacky initiative schemes , progressively debilitating damage charts : these are the tools of the gamer in search of a more immersive experience .
All game systems , no matter how well designed , are simply models of reality – they take artistic license with the laws of physics in order to speed up and simplify game play .
Like any model , the simplicity achieved is generally inversely proportional to the level of realism .
The simpler the game system , the harder it is to suspend disbelief ( reference : all of the fiery blog posts regarding 4th ed D&D ’s reduced realism ) .
Luckily , there ’s an easy way out of this dilemma : a reality shift .
Instead of imagining our game world with the same laws of physics and nature as our own , with our game system as an imperfect approximation of those laws , why not imagine it with the game system as its actual laws of physics ?
Since we ’re imagining a world inhabited by magical creatures in frequent contact with a host of fictional deities , why not go one step further and change the rules of the world to match those we ’re playing with ?
If we do this , instead of seeing the game rules and mechanics as an unfortunate and imperfect attempt to approximate reality , we can look at them as vital links to an alternate and parallel reality that has its very own laws of physics , all of them conveniently laid out for us in a mildly overpriced book .
I call this mental exercise a “ reality shift ” .
While it may seem to be nothing more than semantics at first , if you think a little deeper about it , you ’ll see that it ’s a dramatic shift in the way we design and interact with our game worlds , leading to an experience that is significantly more immersive .
We all live in a world in which no one breathes fire without the aid very strong booze , no one can teleport ( yet , fingers crossed ! ) and there is , sadly , just one humanoid species around to live , love and fight with ( ah , if only we could get some half - elf strippers … ) .
We ’re used to the rules that govern our universe and generally apply them unconsciously , but its basic characteristics wield profound influence on every aspect of our daily lives .
If we were to change just one or two basic rules , the results would be staggering .
Yet most D&D campaign settings ignore the impact of magic and the power of PCs and NPCs to impact the world around them .
They just paint a thin layer of magic over an otherwise conventional world , in which major and powerful characters are anomalies that , because they do n’t plug directly into the fictional reality , remain on its surface .
But in a world in which the rules of the game are the rules of reality the truly earth shattering powers some characters and monsters wield have always been around and will have had major political , economic , and cultural effects .
Unless magic is new to a campaign setting , its presence will have influenced every aspect of society ’s development .
The basic structure of the D&D system , with character classes , levels , experience and hit points , and specific abilities with clear prerequisites and predictable effects , will make a number of our imaginary world ’s characteristics very different from this one’s .
When put that way , the notion of trying to bridge the gap between the two realities seems a little too daunting .
The possible differences are absolutely infinite .
True , our universe is one of infinite and barely understood possibilities , and that with so many potential differences , unless we do simply treat magic and the game rules as an overlay on and model of our world , we ’ll get lost in endless trivia .
But if we make the simple assumption that unless otherwise dictated by the game rules , every aspect of our imaginary world is identical to our own , we can narrow our focus to simply those differences we have in front of us in print .
This also gives us a model of how to proceed with analyzing how the game world would be different : just break out your players ’ hand book and look at the chapters .
Each of them describes a fundamental difference between the imaginary world we ’re building and the real one that will have a significant impact .
The proliferation of humanoid “ races ” is the first major difference ( I ’ll refer to them as species , since that ’s what they really are ) .
Since they do n’t exist in our world , their verified and often commonplace presence in the imaginary one will produce some differences in the way the world works .
We need to ask ourselves what not only place each has in the world , but also how each fares in the competition for resources – why , for example , has this species managed to survive in a dangerous and competitive world ?
This question is especially critical for those races not generally included in the PC races .
Since they have so many fewer classed heroes , wo n’t they be at a distinct disadvantage ?
How could goblins , for example , possibly survive the repeated bloody beat downs they receive at the hands of every low level party of adventurers that happens along ?
Each would have developed some interesting and perhaps unexpected ways of dealing with this sort of environmental pressure .
Another major category of differences comes from the existence of character classes .
These discreet groupings of individual capability would enable individuals to categorize one another to an extent not possible in our own world .
I used to resist the idea that characters would be able to tell if another character was a fighter , or a wizard , or a sorcerer , etc , and go positively out of my mind if players tried to talk to one another in character about classes , levels , and powers .
Their characters would never see things this way , I argued .
But this is a viewpoint born of treating the game system as a mere model .
If we accept it as the characters ’ reality , then we can understand that character classes are the norm of their world .
A successful professional adventurer ( or even an NPC retainer ) would need to have the ability to determine what class another character was by observing him in action as a basic survival skill .
If he were very familiar with the class , he might even be able to determine level from the powers he observed .
This opens up a whole series of possible story telling possibilities , too : imagine the bard who masquerades as a high - level wizard , or more dangerously , the high level wizard who masquerades as a bard …
Other aspects of the game have could have major impacts as well : magic items , powers and rituals of sufficient power or utility could create whole economic systems around their provision or enable widespread empires that would be otherwise impossible and the combat and healing system would have a profound impact on its practitioners .
Each of these areas is worthy of additional in depth analysis – check back here for my future posts about how to Reality Shift your campaign !

This is one of those posts that I 'm probably more excited about than you …
I finally have a working system for hanging my washing that 's not standing on the floor like my current temporary one is .
Yay !
I do n't know if you remember this post where I said we were going to get a new heating system come spring .
Well that 's not on anymore we found out the other week .
50 % of the households in our neighborhood needed sign up and in most other neighborhoods they had so our hopes were really up .
For some reason the idea was turned down and with that came that I lost the drying space for laundry I had hoped for .
I had planned on adding a dryer and have a small additional drying rack next to it but now there 's not room for both so I 've skipped the idea of the dryer and since I added the blue cabinet and took my old washing line down I needed to think of something else .
I 'm pretty happy with my solution to the problem .
It 's kind of odd and different and definitely not standard issue but it works .
Again yay !
Here 's my wacky how to :
Take a piece of wood that 's just randomly laying about in the garage .
Cut it to size and drill three pairs of holes , at the ends and in the middle .
Here the strip of wood has been primed and mounted on the wall with screws and plugs .
The holes were spackled , the wood painted and eye hooks screwed in at regular intervals .
On the opposite side where the heater is I put heavy duty magnets on the metal side of the heater .
I tried using the magnets on the blue cabinet too but because the washing line was longer there the line drooped too much so I drilled holes in the side of the cabinet and inserted eye hooks with washers and nuts instead .
The washing line was then threaded back and forth from side to side in the eye hooks and fastened at the end .
Hey presto !
It works !
The Third Generation German Jihad Colonies Sprout Up in Waziristan
A wave of Germans traveling to training camps for militant jihadists has alarmed security officials back in Europe .
The recruits are quickly becoming radicalized and , in some cases , entire families are departing to hotbeds for terrorism .
It is even believed that colonies catering to German Islamists have taken shape in the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan .

THE Democrats ' first big domestic reform , of health care , was criticised as unnecessary , distracting and partisan .
Not so the latest big piece of reform , the Senate 's bill on financial services .
No one , Republican or Democrat , thinks the financial system should be left alone .
In an era of general grumpiness with a hyperactive federal government , a Pew poll shows that 61 % of Americans nonetheless want stricter restrictions on financial firms .
A lawsuit brought against Goldman Sachs by the Securities and Exchange Commission has boosted expectations that a reform bill will pass .
A slew of big financial firms have just announced stellar results , including Citigroup ( which announced a $ 4.4 billion first - quarter profit this week ) and Goldman ( which announced a $ 3.46 billion profit ) , turning the heat up further .
President Barack Obama will make a speech in New York on Thursday outlining his case for reform .
But as Democrats bring their bill , crafted by Chris Dodd of Connecticut , to the Senate floor , their hopes for bipartisan support are dim .
Mr Dodd 's bill passed the banking committee last month without a single Republican vote .
Since then , the Republican leadership in the Senate has persuaded all of its 41 members to sign a letter criticising what they regard as the Democrats ' partisan approach to the bill thus far .
If they hold fast , the Democrats are one vote shy of breaking a filibuster .
Several aspects of the bill invite debate .
Perhaps most notable is the proposal for a $ 50 billion fund , paid for by the banks , to keep banks in trouble from becoming a systemic risk to the financial system .
The Republicans , echoing the anger of conservative populist “ Tea Party ” activists , have said that this will only encourage future bail - outs .
The Democrats respond that it is to assist orderly liquidation of failing banks , not to rescue them .
In practice , $ 50 billion might not be enough to cover the failure of even a single big bank .
Both parties keep quiet about having supported past bail - outs for systemically important banks in 2008 and 2009 .
They would rather compete to show which is the most unwilling to do so in future .
The other big point for debate is a new consumer financial - services authority .
Congress has already passed a bill reforming credit - card practices , and now wants a new body that will regulate things like mortgages and payday loans .
Republicans worry about the cost of compliance that a new , standalone authority ( with an aggressively pro-consumer slant ) will impose on banks , especially small ones .
The third sticking - point is over derivatives .
Both the banks and Republicans are opposed to the bill 's requirement that most derivatives trading be moved from dealer markets to regulated exchanges .
Meanwhile a separate bill is moving through the Senate agriculture committee which is significantly tougher on banks than Mr Dodd 's proposal : it would force them to give up their swaps desks .
For his part , Mr Obama says he will veto a bill that does not reform derivatives .
There is room for compromise on all these issues .
But so far both sides prefer to play chicken : the Republicans to filibuster , the Democrats to paint the Republicans as protecting their fat - cat friends .
The conventional wisdom is that the SEC 's case against Goldman now makes some kind of reform virtually inevitable ; but it is not yet a foregone conclusion .
Republicans do not want to be on the wrong side of this issue , but neither do they want to be rolled over as they were over health care : told to support a Democrat - only bill or get out of the way .
Nor do American voters want the Democrats to do this alone .
On such large , complicated issues they prefer reforms to come with a bipartisan stamp of approval .
The Democrats have the option of trying to peel off just one or a tiny number of Republicans .
Susan Collins of Maine , along with Olympia Snowe of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee are the names mentioned most often .
But the Republican leadership has been extraordinarily successful in keeping usually independent - minded senators on side .
One Republican defector will not be enough to brand a bill bipartisan , and so any potential 60th vote from the Republican side will face enormous pressure from the leadership not to hand the Democrats a victory they will claim as theirs alone .
So the Democrats face a risk too .
By not compromising with Republicans , they may be held in as much scorn as Republicans if a bill falls just short .
Americans are still frustrated about the way health care was handled .
Financial reform may be much more popular , but Democratic strategists will nonetheless have to remember that the way they have used their big majorities in both houses of Congress has made them extraordinarily unpopular , with just seven months to go before mid-term elections .
Mediaite caught this hilarious moment :
Today during Jim Cramer ’s segment on CNBC ’s Street Signs with Erin Burnett , guest Sylvian Raynes from R&R Consulting went after Cramer – and Cramer fired back .
After Cramer seemed to defend Goldman Sachs , or at least appear skeptical of their wrongdoing , Raynes got his chance to weigh in .
“ I ’m pleased to be on this show , since most of your previous guests were public relations officers for Goldman , ” he said .
“ Is it ok if I ’m a little critical ? ”
The American Family Association ’s Bryan Fischer is one of those Religious Right activsts who takes the Bible so literally that he actually advocates that all of our nation ’s laws should be based on and uphold Biblical values … so much so that he recently called for a whale at Sea World to be put to death for killing its trainer in accordance with Scripture .
Which is why this clip from last Friday ’s radio program is rather concerning , considering that it consists of Fischer approvingly quoting Numbers 25 in which a man named Phinehas saves Israel by killing a man and a woman with a spear for engaging in “ sexual immorality . ”
Fischer compares the “ rampant sexual immorality ” in the passage to modern day America and says that “ what God is obviously looking for is more Phinehases in our day , ” urging everyone to “ be a Phinehas in our own world , and in our own generation ” :
This review originally appeared in The TLS , whose website is www.the-tls.co.uk, and is reposted with permission .
In the ongoing suit of Secularism vs God , David Bentley Hart is the most able counsel for the defence in recent years .
Though confident in the strength of his case , he does not hesitate to abuse the plaintiff ’s attorneys , and he does so in grand style .
Richard Dawkins is guilty of “ rhetorical recklessness ” .
Christopher Hitchens ’s text “ careens drunkenly across the pages ” of a book “ that raises the wild non sequitur almost to the level of a dialectical method ” .
Daniel Dennett ’s theses are “ sustained by classifications that are entirely arbitrary and fortified by arguments that any attentive reader should notice are wholly circular ” .
Hart [ in his book “ Atheist Delusions : The Christian Revolution and Its Fashionable Enemies ” ] has the gifts of a good advocate .
He writes with clarity and force , and he drives his points home again and again .
He exposes his opponents ’ errors of fact or logic with ruthless precision .
He is generous in making concessions on his own side , provided they leave intact his overarching claims .
Above all , he has ensured that his brief is modest and manageable .
Thus , no attempt is made to plead in defence of religion as such .
“ Religion in the abstract ” , Hart says , “ does not actually exist , and almost no one ( apart from politicians ) would profess any allegiance to it ” .
This is a sound and fundamental point .
The creeds of the major religions are mutually contradictory , so that the one thing we know for certain about religion is that if any religion is true then most religions are false .
Hart ’s client is not religion in general — it is traditional Christianity .
It is this , he claims , that has been misunderstood and slandered by its cultured despisers .
Again ,
Hart concentrates on issues of history rather than philosophy .
True , he claims that Dawkins ’s philosophical arguments are ones that “ a college freshman midway through his first logic course could dismantle in a trice ” .
However , the claim that Dawkins is philosophically illiterate is based on an ontology that would be rejected by many a seasoned professor of philosophy .
Hart ’s own strengths lie elsewhere , so he is wise to concentrate on narrative and invective .
Atheist Delusions : The Christian Revolution and Its Fashionable Enemies By David Bentley Hart Yale University Press , 272 pages
The aim of the first half of the book is to demolish “ the mythology of a secularist age ” .
Secularists invite us to believe the following story .
In the medieval ages of faith , culture stagnated , science languished , wars of religion were routinely waged , witches were burned by inquisitors , and Western humanity was enslaved to superstition .
The literary remains of antiquity had been consigned to the flames , and the achievements of Greek science lay forgotten until Islam restored them to the West .
The age of faith was succeeded by an age of reason and enlightenment , which gave us the riches of scientific achievement and political liberty , and a new and revolutionary sense of human dignity .
The modern separation of Church and State has put an end to the blood - steeped intolerance of religion .
Western humanity has at last left its nonage and attained to its majority in science , politics and ethics .
“ This is ” , Hart says , “ a simple and enchanting tale … its sole defect is that it happens to be false in every identifiable detail . ”
Six chapters demolish detailed elements of this secularist myth .
Chapter Four refutes the allegations that the ancient library of Alexandria was destroyed by Christians and that the pagan philosopher Hypatia was murdered out of hatred for women and learning .
Chapter
Five shows that far from burning Classical texts , Christian monastic librarians preserved them from decay .
Chapter Six argues that Greek science had become sterile long before the Christianization of the Roman Empire .
The only innovative physicist of late antiquity , we are told , was the Christian John Philoponus .
During the four and a half centuries of its scientific pre-eminence , Islam made “ no more progress than a moderately clever undergraduate today could assimilate in less than a single academic year ” .
Paying tribute to the Oxford calculators of the fourteenth century , Hart illustrates the continuity between medieval and Renaissance science .
Pope Urban VIII ’s condemnation of Galileo , he claims , was not an index of inherent ecclesiastical hostility to science , but a clash of arrogant personalities .
The seventh and eighth chapters defend Christianity from the charges of intolerance and cruelty .
The persecution of witches , Hart points out , was an early modern rather than a medieval phenomenon , and the inquisitors of the time did their best to suppress witchhunts .
To see long excerpts from “ Atheist Delusions , ” click here .
The rise of modern science and the obsession with sorcery “ were two closely allied manifestations of the development of a new post - Christian sense of human mastery over the world ” .
In exculpation of the use of torture and the burning of heretics , it can be said that the Church was merely following a fashion which was originated by the State .
During the so - called Dark Ages , the only penalty for misbelief was excommunication , whereas in the heyday of the Holy Roman Empire heresy became a capital crime .
“ Violence ” , Hart says , “ increased in proportion to the degree of sovereignty claimed by the state , and whenever the medieval church surrendered moral authority to secular power , injustice and cruelty flourished . ”
Addressing the responsibility of the Church for warfare , Hart briskly gets the Crusades out of the way .
Admitting that they were “ holy wars ” — the only ones in Christian history , he maintains — he dismisses them as “ the last gaudy flourish of Western barbarian culture , embellished by the winsome ceremonies of chivalry ” .
The European wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are treated at greater length .
Here , we learn , “ no prince of the time waged war against another simply on account of his faith ” .
In its bloodiest days the Thirty Years War was not a war of religion , but a struggle between two Catholic houses , the Bourbons and the Habsburgs .
Hart is at his most convincing when he argues that for the sheer scale of its violence , the modern period trumps any of the ages of Christian faith .
“ The Thirty Years War , with its appalling toll of civilian casualties , was a scandal to the consciences of the nations of Europe ; but midway through the twentieth century … even liberal democracies did not scruple to bomb open cities from the air , or to use incendiary or nuclear devices to incinerate tens of thousands of civilians . ”
In the second part of the book , Hart seeks to replace the secularist myth with a positive account of what he calls “ the Christian revolution ” — ” perhaps the only true revolution in the history of the West ” .
Many of the values prized by modern secularists are inheritances from the early days of Christianity .
Pre-Christian cults involved human sacrifice , self - castration and self - mutilation .
PreChristian society despised the poor and weak and tolerated infanticide ; it enjoyed gladiatorial combat , and it was built on slavery .
Only Christianity fostered the concept of a dignity intrinsic to every human soul .
Only the Church built hospitals and almshouses , and taught that charity was the highest virtue .
Well aware that the Christianization of the Roman Empire did not wipe out the evils of pagan society , Hart is generous in concessions to the opposition .
He has no illusions about the great Christian emperors .
Constantine was “ a violent , puritanical , ponderous , late Roman brute ” .
Theodosius was a harsh persecutor of pagans and heretics .
Justinian was one “ whom nobody very much liked or likes ” .
Surprisingly , the one emperor who gets a kind word is Constantine ’s apostate nephew Julian , who tried to reintroduce paganism .
“ Of all the emperors in the Constantinian line Julian alone stands free of any suspicion of bad faith .
He was also without question the most estimable and attractive of the lot . ”
It is wrong , Hart argues , to see Christianity as invading a joyful pagan milieu of vitality and mirth , and turning the world grey with its breath .
Late antiquity was an era of fear and melancholy , and contempt for the body was a leitmotif of many of its thinkers .
Christianity provided a liberating message , in which the resurrection of Jesus offered hope of the transfiguration of the flesh and the glorification of all creation .
Christianity slowly gave greater freedom to the oppressed of the present world .
The legislation of Constantine and Theodosius II improved the status of women , whether virgins , wives or widows .
Christian husbands , unlike pagan ones , could not force their wives to submit to abortion or to expose their infants .
In the course of Christian history , the foundation of hospitals , leper asylums , almshouses and hostels palliated the lot of the most downtrodden members of society .
Hart cannot deny that the institution of slavery long outlasted Western Europe ’s conversion to Christianity .
With a shrug , he observes that it is no more surprising that some pagan moral values survived in a Christian culture than that some Christian moral values survive in our secular culture today .
He can point to imperial edicts ameliorating the lot of slaves , and he can quote a sermon of St Gregory of Nyssa as early as 379 that attacked slavery as an institution , denouncing as blasphemous the claim of any human being to own another human being .
Atheist Delusions : The Christian Revolution and Its Fashionable Enemies By David Bentley Hart Yale University Press , 272 pages
In his final plea for the defence , Hart puts to the jury the question “ When Christianity departs , what is left behind ? ” .
The highest ideals of the secular project , he proclaims , are borrowed ideals , and Nietzsche was right that any effort to cast off the Christian faith while retaining the best elements of Christian morality is doomed to defeat .
In an ultimate flourish he dons the robes of opposing counsel .
“ To use Richard Dawkins ’s justly famous metaphor ( which unfortunately he does not quite grasp is a metaphor ) , memes like “ human rights ” and “ human dignity ” may not indefinitely continue to replicate themselves once the Christian ‘ infinite value of every life ’ meme has died out . ”
Let us now abandon the forensic context , and ask how accurate is Hart ’s historical narrative .
The set - piece treatments of the iconic events of secularist propaganda — the burning of the Alexandria library , the Spanish Inquisition , the trial of Galileo and so on — are detailed and often convincing .
But the book is full of generalizations that spur the reader to look for — and often to find — counter - examples .
For instance , in expounding the significance of the gospel story of the denial and repentance of Peter , Hart claims that in a pagan world “ Peter , as a rustic could not possibly have been a worthy object of a well - bred man ’s sympathy ” .
To say this is to ignore the existence of a whole genre of classical poetry devoted to the joys and sorrows of rustics , namely pastoral elegy .
Frequently , in order to emphasize the originality of Christianity , Hart devalues the achievements of Classical antiquity .
Science as we understand it , he claims , depends on Christian underpinning .
But if science is the collaborative pursuit of truth about the world by empirical inquiries whose results are structured into a theoretical discipline , then the West ’s first centre of scientific research was Aristotle ’s Lyceum .
Hart is not at his best when discussing Aristotle .
He cannot have read The History of Animals when he calls Albert the Great “ the father of biological field research ” .
In physics he believes that Aristotle ’s prime mover was an outermost crystalline sphere , when in fact it was an incorporeal divinity outside the universe .
( How Hart would have crowed if he had come across such a howler in Hitchens ! )
Hart is right that the discoveries of Copernicus , Kepler , Galileo and Newton were not so much a liberation from religious authority as from latter - day Aristotelianism .
But the persistence of Aristotle ’s cosmology for many centuries after its sell - by date was partly due to the religious cultures in which it survived .
His works became the possession of “ peoples of the book ” — Muslims , Jews and Christians , and accordingly they were treated in the way that sacred texts are treated .
That is why many of the greatest minds of the Middle Ages , instead of following Aristotle ’s example of original investigation , wrote commentaries on his scientific works .
Hart ’s comparisons between Classical and Christian eras are all too often partisan .
In order to portray Christianity as more cheerful than paganism , he has to downplay the patristic teaching that everlasting torment awaited the majority of mankind .
To claim that the ultimate equality of all humans is an exclusively Christian doctrine he has to ignore the teaching of Stoics such as the slave Epictetus and the Emperor Marcus Aurelius .
To explain his admiration for Julian the Apostate , he has to claim that of all the emperors between Constantine and Theodosius he was the most “ genuinely Christian in sensibility ” .
The truth is surely that the institutions and values we cherish , like the works of art and architecture that we prize , are not the exclusive property of any one stage in our long history .
Some institutions , like democracy , were invented in the ancient world , and others , like universities , date from the Middle Ages .
Some values , such as philanthropy , are part of our Judaeo - Christian inheritance : others , such as freedom of speech , we owe to the Enlightenment .
Some values and institutions can be credited to more recent times , such as the abolition of slavery and the empowerment of women .
Surely , we should be grateful to our ancestors , near and distant , for the good things they handed on to us , and we should do our best to eradicate the evils we have inherited from them .
But we can also agree with Hart that to regard our own age as blest beyond all others with an overplus of good versus evil is the height of folly .

The advertising agency says the aim is to ridicule Hitler
An advert for a clothing shop that features Adolf Hitler dressed in pink has provoked outraged reactions in Italy .
The posters were put up in the city of Palermo in Sicily , with the caption : " Change your style .
Do n't follow your leader " .
The swastika on Hitler 's armband has been replaced by a heart .
But the local association of wartime resistance fighters said the adverts were offensive to those who had fought fascism .
World War II resistance fighters wrote to the mayor demanding their immediate withdrawal .
A spokesman said that the posters violated democratic principles .
The advertising agency behind the posters told Italian media the aim was to ridicule Hitler , not minimise his crimes .
" that create ACCURATE vowel sounds " ?
In what language pray tell ?
Or was the no-comments incident from earlier today the result of an intersection of realities so gizmodo is now posting from some bizarro alternate earth ?
ps. i completely agree about the terrifying part .
somehow having a nose made it even worse .
The House has passed the " Truth in Caller ID Act of 2010 " ( PDF ) , which does exactly what its name would lead you to believe .
Under the bill , it becomes illegal " to cause any caller ID service to transmit misleading or inaccurate caller ID information , with the intent to defraud or deceive . "
The bill maintains an exemption for blocking one 's own outgoing caller ID information , and law enforcement is n't affected .
The change will affect " any real time voice communications service , regardless of the technology or network utilized , " so VoIP calls are included .
In fact , the Congressional Research Service summary of the initial text makes clear that VoIP was a key target here .
The Senate has already passed its version of the bill back in February , so it should be signed into law soon .
CTIA - The Wireless Association said today that it supports " making caller identification spoofing illegal as the applications of such an activity are usually for malicious purposes . "
Russian who ' cremated ' Adolf Hitler refuses to reveal where he scattered his ashes
Exactly 65 years after Adolf Hitler perished in his Berlin bunker , the man who Moscow claims destroyed his bones today refused to reveal the exact spot in Germany where he ' cremated ' the Fuhrer .
Vladimir Gumenyuk , a 73 year old retired KGB officer , vowed to take his secret to his grave so that the location in the countryside around Magdeburg would not become the focus of pilgrimages by neo -Nazis .
The veteran is said to be the last man alive from a team of three who were secretly tasked in 1970 by Yuri Andropov - then KGB leader and later head of the Soviet Union - with digging up the bones of Hitler , his mistress Eva Braun along with the remains of Joseph Goebbels and his family .
Vladmir Gumenyuk , right , refuses to reveal where he scattered Adolf Hitler 's ashes
He told a Russian newspaper that having burned the bones of the Nazi leader and his entourage , he and two colleagues drove the ashes to the top of ' a cliff on a small unnamed stream ' before they were released to the wind .
It was a pre-determined location decided by Moscow .
' No - one was there , ' he said .
' Twenty seconds - and job was done .
It was just the last flight of the Fuhrer . '
Gumenyuk 's role was first claimed by Moscow in revelations from the secret services in 2001 .
Yesterday he gave a few additional details but said he had turned down large sums from the German media to identify the exact spot he disposed of Hitler .
' I believe that the coverage of this subject is not appropriate , ' he said .
Making clear he would go to his grave with his knowledge , he said : ' There are still too many neo -Nazis around .
There would be pilgrimages .
They would even put up a monument . '
He said that the had been haunted by a fear of ' failure ' since 1970 , concerned that knowledge of the operation might leak out before its disclosure was officially sanctioned .
' I and two other colleagues were given a secret order - due to the transfer of a Soviet military town - to burn the remains of Hitler and all his entourage , and blow them to the wind , ' said Gumenyuk , who served in a special KGB department linked to the Red Army in East Germany .
' They had been buried there after the war in a secret place .
And we were told the coordinates under conditions of such secrecy that even now I cannot tell you everything . '
The burial location at the Soviet military base was surrounded by German - built tower blocks , he said .
When they went to dig up the macabre remains , they pretended to be fishermen on a trip , and pitched a tent over the site where the bones had been hidden in the aftermath of the war .
Their initial dig failed to produce any results .
But then they realised they had counted 45 metres instead of 45 paces from a secret co-ordinate , so they moved the tent .
Five feet below the surface , they found the rotting wooden crates that the German high command had been buried in .
' The remains had been lying for a long time in the ground , and I 'm generally a squeamish person , so I took rubber gloves , boots , and a special suit of chemical protection .
' I thought the smell would be terrible , and even took the mask .
' But when they began to dig , nothing like that happened .
Sometimes when digging in the garden , you find a bone - it was the same thing here .
We shifted the bones and put the ground back . '
Their order was to burn the bones ' but in Germany the fire at night , even at the river bank is something quite unusual .
The people here are disciplined , and it was n't allowed to make fires outside in the GDR . '
So they waited until morning , he said , drove around Magdeburg making sure they were not being followed , and went to a river , a sport screened by trees , posing as fishermen .
They lit a fire to make soup - and then a second blaze to burn Hitler 's remains .
' We wasted the whole canister of gasoline on him , ' he said .
Later he collected the ashes in his rucksack and ' went to a pre-determined location ' - by the cliff - where they disposed of Hitler .
' It was over in no time at all .
I opened up the rucksack , the wind caught the ashes up in a little brown cloud , and in a second they were gone . '
He wrote a report saying they had completed the task , never talking about it , even to his wife .
Father Charlie told the girl with the cascading brown curls and frilly frocks that she was pretty .
Special .
One of his favourites .
In the small Ontario town of Pain Court , a French - Canadian community near Chatham , Father Charlie ’s attention was prized by devout Roman Catholic families like Cecilia McLauchlin’s .
His interest in their daughter meant the popular priest , once described as “ next to God , ” publicly approved of how she was being raised .
So when a gynecologist examined the girl for recurring vaginal infections , it did n’t occur to anyone that Father Charlie was the cause of her physical pain .
Cecilia McLauchlin was only 5 years old .
Now 32 , the Chatham woman is the youngest known victim of Father Charles Sylvestre , the smooth - talking priest who groomed his young prey with candies , trinkets and praise .
He was convicted in 2006 of sexually assaulting 47 girls over four decades in southwestern Ontario — despite abuse complaints from victims to police , school and church officials during that time .
McLauchlin came forward after his conviction , as did 30 more women in a movement some expect foreshadows the church ’s next crisis : a groundswell of female victims seeking justice .
From Mount Cashel to Ireland , most sex abuse scandals have involved boys as altar servers , at boarding schools or in orphanages .
The most recent trouble also surrounds boys , with allegations Pope Benedict — who celebrates his fifth anniversary this week as head of all Catholics — knew about an American priest molesting 200 deaf boys in Milwaukee but failed to act .
An American study commissioned eight years ago and paid for by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops found that boys were overwhelmingly the likeliest target of predator priests .
The John Jay College of Criminal Justice study , based on voluntary disclosure from church authorities ( some refused to comply ) , determined boys accounted for 81 per cent of sex assaults .
Most abuse for all victims occurred between 1960 and the 1980s .
But London - based lawyer Robert Talach , who represented McLauchlin and other Sylvestre victims , expects that male - female ratio to change within five to 10 years to reflect a trend that began in the 1970s when the church welcomed female altar servers .
Researchers say disclosure of abuse is typically delayed for about 30 years , which means women assaulted as children are just starting to come to terms with what happened .
“ In some of our Sylvestre cases , which are ( from ) the ‘ 70s , many of the women were victimized under the pretenses of ‘ I ’m training you to be one of these new , upcoming female altar servers , ’ " said Talach , who has represented more than 100 victims of clergy abuse , most of them male .
“ We ’ve seen priests using that to look innovative to their parishioners , but in reality it was to allow them access to women if their predilection was female . ”
Father Donald Holmes , a modern cleric who rode a motorcycle , sported a beard , played hockey and preferred street clothes to his Roman collar , also preyed on girls as they began taking bigger roles in the church .
He was convicted in 2002 of sexually abusing 12 girls around the Sudbury area between 1972 and 1984 .
In general , girls in Canada are four times more likely than boys to be victims of sexual offences , according to police figures reported to Stats Canada .
Females are more likely to be attractive to clergy because the majority of priests are heterosexual — but some are psychologically and sexually immature , says former priest - turned - lawyer Patrick Wall .
“ If they ’re going to explore sexually , they ’re going to explore with a little girl , ” said Wall , a California - based expert on Catholic clergy abuse who now works with victims .
Wall ’s perspective on the degree of female abuse is unique .
He was a Benedictine monk for 12 years , working as a “ fixer ” dispatched to tidy up messy sexual problems of priests and laymen at troubled parishes and schools .
He said when a girl required surgery after rape , the code was that she needed a “ hernia ” operation .
In a bizarre twinning , he counselled accused priests and heard confessions from traumatized victims .
He also worked on cases where priests impregnated girls then procured abortions for them .
“ That is so prevalent , it happens all the time , ” he said of the abortion runs , which in part accounts for his belief that teenaged girls are the silent majority of priest - related sexual abuse .
By age 33 , Wall deduced most , if not all , of the 195 parishes and hundreds of religious orders in the U.S. employed “ fixers ” like him to wipe down crime scenes that involved children .
He quit religious life in disgust and scoffs at the Vatican ’s pledge to better protect boys and girls from its surpliced predators .
“ This is the biggest company in the world , they are not going to shift and move , ” Wall said .
“ They ’re going to keep building the Ford Pinto , they ’re going to take their lumps ( from public opinion ) and move on . ”

“ It does n’t matter what the law is , whether it ’s the Canadian police or the U.S. police .
They ’re not going to tell anybody ( about criminal behaviour ) , ” he added .
Santa Clara University psychology professor Thomas Plante has treated and evaluated about 60 clergy sex offenders , including Catholic priests .
He said most exhibited a variety of psychiatric troubles , such as personality and impulse control disorders , even brain damage as comorbidity factors complicating their sexual behaviours .
Plante said differing degrees of disorders means “ these guys are n’t all alike ” and range from ruthless serial offenders like Sylvestre to those who commit one act .
If mentally unhealthy priests are attacking children , it does n’t prevent the church from using its formidable financial and legal resources to defend their accused , said Wall .
The former priest said the church is particularly vicious with women , deploying its “ whore defence ” to paint schoolgirls as harlots and intimidate them from pursuing criminal and civil complaints .
McLauchlin , now working and married , said victims “ need to outlast ” the church as she did during a three - year civil case against the London archdiocese .
It was settled last September for an undisclosed amount .
During her case , the diocese demanded McLauchlin submit to a psychological assessment in Toronto .
She said she was “ interrogated ” for 10 hours by a clinician and made to relive Sylvestre ’s assaults in graphic detail — even though her mother had kept the “ horrific ” gynecologist ’s report from 27 years ago .
“ ( The assessment ) was very demeaning and at certain times , it was crude and it did n’t need to be , ” said McLauchlin , whose abuse began when she was about 4 and ended at 6 when her unsuspecting family moved to Chatham .
“ Ultimately , I stood my ground , ” she said .
“ It ’s a game of survivor ( and church officials ) just want to wear you down . ”
McLauchlin kept Sylvestre ’s abuse a secret from her family until the priest was arrested .
By the time she approached Crown prosecutors , a deal had been struck with Sylvestre — then 84 years old , feeble and brain - addled with dementia — to plead guilty to all counts .
The priest who duped her parents with friendship to gain their trust — and access to their daughter — died three months into his three - year sentence in 2007 .
Though McLauchlin feels resolving her court case has given her a fresh start in life , she is haunted by why , despite 1962 police reports from girls he abused , the church shielded Sylvestre .
“ I wish every single day of my life they had done something , ” said McLauchlin of high - ranking officials in the London diocese , including archbishops who reigned during Sylvestre ’s tenure .
“ The last place he was a priest was Pain Court ( and ) this would never have happened to me . ”

Overflowing garbage in the North End could be a common sight across the city if BFI workers can’t resolve their labour dispute .
It could be a long , hot -- and stinky -- summer in Winnipeg this year .
That 's because the BFI workers who pick up all of the residential garbage in the city have voted overwhelmingly to go on strike .
TYLER ANDERSON / CANWEST NEWS SERVICE ARCHIVES
The garbage collectors ’ strike in Toronto last year was n’t a pretty sight .
It would be the city 's first - ever garbage strike and , if the experience in Toronto last summer is any indication , expect mountains of garbage , flies and a fetid odour .
On Thursday night , the 115 members of Teamsters Local No. 979 voted 94 per cent in favour of going on strike after talks with BFI broke off earlier this month .
The workers , who also pick up about half of the city 's commercial waste in bins , as well as garbage and recyclables at apartment buildings , have been working without a contract since last November .
The workers also provide services that would be impacted in Selkirk , East St. Paul and Portage la Prairie .
Eric Jorgensen , the union 's business manager , said no date for a strike has been set and a conciliation meeting has been scheduled for next week .
" We hope for the best and plan for the worst , " Jorgensen said on Friday .
" If we 're on strike , there will be extra residential refuse sitting on the street ... there are other issues than wages , but wages are a factor .
" We have some hurdles to get over .
It will be difficult . "
More than 24,000 of Toronto's 30,000 civic workforce went on strike for six weeks last summer .
However , it was the garbage collectors that raised the biggest stink .
As the refuse piled up , the city was forced to spray chemicals on temporary dump sites to reduce the smell and keep away rodents .
For years in Winnipeg , civic crews picked up garbage in some areas while private contractors covered other parts .
But in 2005 , the city privatized all garbage collection against the protests of the civic union .
Since then , the city has granted garbage - collecting contracts only to BFI .
The strike vote also comes in the wake of Mayor Sam Katz and a majority of councillors coming under fire for the controversial rollout of rolling garbage carts in northwest Winnipeg in February .
Just three weeks after the city replaced garbage cans with BFI 's rolling garbage carts , the chairman of the public works committee was saying the plan may have been a mistake and elected officials were making changes to the collection system adding more than $ 700,000 in costs to the $ 1.9 - million contract .
" We have to say , 'we told you so , ' " said Mike Davidson , president of CUPE 500 , which represents city workers , including former civic garbage collectors .
" We 've lost public control over residential garbage pickup .
They could go on strike and the politicians can't do anything .
" Why we would give that all up is beyond me . "
Davidson said civic garbage workers never went on strike .
" We were always willing to work with the employer to provide the very best of service , " he said .
" The losers ultimately will be the citizens of Winnipeg -- they had a reliable garbage service .
" And we 're coming into an election this year , too .
Will that come into this ? "
A city spokeswoman said in an email response , " BFI has their own strike contingency plan and would still be required to fulfil their contract obligations .
" They would draw on their resources elsewhere in Canada and the U.S .
The city 's manager of solid waste services and his staff would be in close contact with BFI to ensure collection service is maintained . "
When asked whether the city would support BFI 's use of replacement workers , the spokeswoman replied : " The city has many contracts with BFI and it is our expectation that they will manage themselves accordingly to honour those contracts . "
Jorgensen said if the company tries to collect garbage using its 60 trucks per day " there are only a couple of places where that waste can go to here .
" Would there be picket lines there ?
There might be . "
Coun .
Dan Vandal said he 's concerned about the possibility of a strike .
" I and other councillors have made it clear that giving a 100 per cent monopoly to one firm creates risks and this is one of them , " Vandal said .
" What do we do now ?
My prime concern right now is to make sure the residents we represent do n't have to suffer through a prolonged garbage strike . "
BFI Canada spokeswoman Chaya Cooperberg said the company is looking forward to next week 's meeting .
" We are optimistic we can reach a resolution that 's agreeable to both parties , " she said .

Fans have long suspected the game was rigged against them when it came to buying the best seats to big concerts and ball games .
They just did n’t know how .
Tickets to Yankees playoff games , the Rose Bowl and rock concerts vanished within seconds of going on sale only to turn up on websites like StubHub and eBay , where fans must pay double or triple the original value .
The U.S. Attorney 's office in Newark unveiled a 43 - count indictment today that said , basically , the fans were right all along .
The document outlines a massive ticket - buying conspiracy run by four computer savvy officials of a Nevada company , Wiseguy Tickets Inc .
Using software to create an army of online drones , the firm allegedly muscled out legions of fans trying to buy tickets for shows including Bruce Springsteen , Barbra Streisand and Miley Cyrus .
It all happened at lightning speed .
And it brought millions in profit to Wiseguys , authorities said .
" These defendants tried to put themselves at the head of the line to get as many premium seats as possible , " U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman said .
Entertainment industry officials said they were astounded by the scope and audacity of the alleged fraud .
Between 2002 and 2009 , Wiseguys sold more than 1.5 million tickets nationwide , earning upwards of $ 25 million in profits , authorities said .
The venues stretched from East Rutherford to Los Angeles .
And the tickets were always for the best seats in the house : including Broadway productions of " The Producers " and " Wicked , " and tapings of the television show " Dancing with the Stars . "
For fans , it meant having to pay handsomely for good seats , authorities said .
Wiseguys allegedly sold their tickets at a steep mark - up to brokers , who in turn sold them at an even steeper price to fans , according to the 60 - page indictment .
" Ultimately , we think this crime was committed out of greed , " said Erez Liebermann , an assistant U.S. attorney .
A lawyer for one of the men , Wiseguys founder and co-owner Kenneth Lowson , said the company offered a service that is the modern - day equivalent of sleeping out all night outside box offices to buy tickets for a hot concert .
" And the feds have decided to criminalize that , " said the attorney , Mark Rush .

Today ’s indictment follows a series of state and federal investigations sparked , in part , by frustrated fans .
U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell ( D - N.J. ) has introduced legislation to tighten regulations for online ticket sales and said he was pleased that Wiseguys was charged .
But the congressman said he doubted the firm acted alone .
" There ’s a much bigger conspiracy here . "
Pascrell said .
" The regular fan does n’t have a chance . "
Fans have long blamed Ticketmaster — now called Live Nation Entertainment — for online ticket - buying headaches .
But Fishman today said the company had logged formal legal complaints about Wiseguys ’ tactics and was essentially a victim of the alleged scheme .
Company officials did not return calls seeking comment .
To execute their alleged scheme , authorities say Wiseguys cracked the security systems that ticket sellers use to block online attacks .
The backbone of those systems is often a series of misshapen letters and numbers that ticket buyers must retype before making a purchase .
Those distorted characters — called " captchas " — essentially force attackers to decipher images readable by humans , but supposedly not computers .
But with help from a computer programmer in Bulgaria , Wiseguys created a far - flung computer network that could read and retype those squiggly letters , authorities said .
The instant tickets went on sale , Wiseguys flooded the websites of Ticketmaster and other companies with automated programs that impersonated individual buyers and scooped up every good seat faster than the click of a mouse , authorities said .
For a July 2008 Bruce Springsteen show at Giants Stadium , Wiseguys managed to land half of the 440 floor tickets closest to the stage .
To make it appear the tickets were bought by individual fans — and not en-mass by a middleman —
Wiseguys tried to amass 100,000 Internet addresses and hundreds of fake emails .
They also collected reams of credit card numbers from brokers that later sold the tickets to fans .
Fishman declined to say today whether those brokers would face charges , too .
Three of the four California men named in the indictment surrendered to the FBI today .
Lowson was ordered held by U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Shipp pending a bail hearing .
His partner , Kristofer Kirsch , 37 , was released on $ 1 million bail .
An employee Joel Stevenson , 37 , was released on $ 500,000 bail .
Lawyers for the men said they would plead not guilty at an arraignment later this week .
They are charged with conspiracy , wire fraud and computer crimes .
If convicted , they face up to 20 years in prison , said Seth Kosto , an assistant U.S. attorney .
A fourth man , Faisal Nahdi , 36 , is in Indonesia and expected to surrendered , authorities said .
" The allegations in this indictment represent a scheme orchestrated through technology to cheat the public and circumvent fair business practices in the entertainment industry , " said Edward Kahrer , an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI ’s Newark office .

The Koranic verses are ringing out from a stereo on Hamza Myatt 's market stall on Barking 's pedestrianised high street .
The 36 - year - old ginger - haired and white - skinned Muslim convert swapped his life as a financial adviser in South Wales to proselytise for his new faith in the outer reaches of East London three weeks after the 9/11 attacks .
He now spends market days noisily selling Islamic literature .
A few feet away from Mr Myatt 's stall , at a mobile snack bar selling tea and bacon butties , where customers are trying on keffiyeh scarves and checking through DVDs on Islam for children , stands a furious Derek Carlton .
Pointing his finger towards Mr Myatt 's loudspeaker , now broadcasting an imam 's sermon , Mr Carlton , 46 , a maintenance engineer , says : " Yes , I will vote BNP and that is why .
I have no problem with other religions .
What I have a problem with is when it changes the character of your town and you 're not allowed to say anything about it .
" The BNP is saying what no one else will .
Slowly but surely , people like me are being pushed aside in favour of outsiders .
You can't tell me it 's racist to be annoyed that my children can't get a council house in the same place as their parents because they 've all been handed over to Africans and Muslims ? "
Welcome to Barking and Dagenham , the former industrial heartland of the white working classes , now a bellwether for the rising fortunes of the far right .
It is far from unthinkable that the citizens of this London borough will wake on 7 May to find the British National Party running their council .
If its confident prediction that it can more than double its contingent of 12 councillors comes true , a party whose leader , Nick Griffin , once denied the Holocaust and said " Hitler went a bit too far " will find itself in charge of services to 165,000 people and an annual budget of £ 200m .
This weekend , hundreds of BNP supporters are expected to descend on the area .
In an email , Mr Griffin appeals for as many members as possible to target the constituency over the weekend .
" A victory in Barking and Dagenham will benefit every region and branch in the country , as a breakthrough of that magnitude will cause a political earthquake and publicity frenzy , " he writes .
Margaret Hodge , the Labour minister and incumbent MP against whom Mr Griffin is standing for Parliament , is calling for supporters to come out in force to match the BNP 's canvassing effort .
Mr Carlton , one of an estimated 5,000 - 10,000 voters in Barking and Dagenham whoare BNP supporters , is the embodiment of a radical change in the far - right party 's fortunes in this area .
In the 1997 general election , the BNP mustered just 894 votes , or 2.7 per cent of the vote .
In the 2008 London Assembly elections , the BNP vote in some wards hit more than 38 per cent .
Alongside Stoke - on - Trent council , the BNP has made no secret of the fact that securing power in Barking and Dagenham is its priority .
Mr Griffin has stated that his candidacy is designed to allow him to take the " flak " from anti-BNP campaigners while his activists focus on the " real prize " of the council .
The Independent understands the party is close to fielding a candidate for each of the 51 local authority seats with the aim of securing the 14 extra councillors it needs to seize its " prize " .
It could take as little as 1,000 votes in six wards to hand power to the BNP .
The roots of this grim transformation from a protest vote to candidate for power lie in what its opponents admit has been a " perfect storm " of issues that pander to the extreme right .
Against a backdrop of deindustrialisation which has seen the powerhouse of the Ford Motor Company at Dagenham wither to less than 5 per cent of its previous workforce , the area has experienced considerable immigration with some wards going from a ethnic minority population of about 5 per cent to up to 35 per cent since 2000 .
As one opponent put it : " The BNP are like winter potholes .
They slide into a gap in our communities and wait for bad weather . "
One such political " pothole " , repeated to The Independent by a large number of residents , is the notion that the borough 's influx of migrants is politically - inspired .
A Government scheme to persuade immigrant families in inner city London to free up council housing by subsidising a move out to cheaper areas such as Barking and Dagenham resulted in 30 families moving in – seven were white , nine were Asian , nine were black and five did not specify their ethnicity .
The maximum subsidy was £ 16,000 .
Most received about £ 4,000 .
This has not stopped the BNP running a campaign it calls " Africans for Essex " , stating that the borough has been flooded with immigrants paid £ 50,000 a time to slant the electoral arithmetic of Barking and Dagenham in favour of the ruling Labour administration , which has 34 seats on the council .
It is a fallacy that the extremist party continues to peddle , taking pictures such as Mr Griffin posing by a banner advertising a Nigerian Islamic group .
Eddy Butler , the BNP national election organiser until he stepped down last week , added : " The Labour Party has deliberately transported African migrants into this part of Essex to create an electorate willing to vote Labour . "
His words appear to strike a chord on the streets of the constituency .
The lack of social housing is a major problem locally and a key electoral issue .
Margaret
Thatcher 's right - to - buy policy cut the housing stock in an area which includes the vast Becontree estate , the world 's largest public housing project .
Successive Labour governments have stymied the development of new homes , leaving a council waiting list of 11,695 .
Last month , a scheme was announced to provide 145 new homes in two years – the first new council homes in Barking for 25 years .
Such has been the inertia of central government , the local Labour Party has distanced itself from its national policies .
Phil Waker , the Labour councillor in charge of housing , said : " New Labour has been complacent – especially on housing .
We will fight any government on this issue . "
By contrast , the BNP 's response on the issue has been erratic .
It set out plans for a giant caravan park of 1,000 mobile homes sited on public land in Dagenham set aside for permanent housing .
When it was pointed out that the £ 1,000 - per- caravan budget would create a Steptoe & Son eyesore without facilities , the idea was dropped in favour of what Mr Griffin has dubbed a " sons and daughters " policy to give the offspring of current tenants first refusal on homes .
Placed alongside incidents including a local BNP vote against sending a message to congratulate the British Olympic team at the Beijing games because it included athletes such as Dame Kelly Holmes and Amir Khan , and the fact that BNP councillors occupy the bottom seven places for attendance , opponents say its record speaks for itself .
Mrs Hodge , targeted by the BNP with leaflets attacking the £ 50 m fortune she inherited from her Jewish father , said : " I have spent three years exposing the true nature of BNP councillors in Barking .
I want to turn this threat into an opportunity to destroy their credibility nationally . "
The announcement last week that the BNP 's head of publicity , Mark Collett , had been reported to police for alleged threats to kill , amid talk of a major split in the party 's higher echelons , has raised hope among opponents that its challenge could implode .
The BNP swatted aside claims that Mr Butler had stepped down , saying he was focused on Barking and Dagenham .
An unorthodox campaign may play a pivotal role in the " Battle for Barking " .
A nondescript office block on the A13 , overlooking a corner of the vast Ford plant that once employed 50,000 but now provides 2,000 jobs , is the HQ of Hope Not Hate – a coalition of activists including the Searchlight anti-fascist group , unions and community groups .
It has been building a network among women 's groups , churches and others uncomfortable with the BNP .
Its campaign will harness the full paraphernalia of modern electioneering , including an email list of 142,000 voters , telephone canvassing and targeted leafleting .
Sam Tarry , the Dagenham - born activist leading the scheme , said : " The days have gone when the BNP could be dismissed as swivel - eyed Nazis .
In the last general election , people were cagey about saying they 'd vote BNP .
That shame is no longer there .
Our job is to expose the BNP for what they are so decent people do n't vote for them .
We will be relentlessly negative about what the BNP are – their record in power , the criminal record of their leader and their damaging policies . "
Nearby lies the council ward of Goresbrook , the epicentre of BNP support in Barking and Dagenham .
Its streets are lined with terraced houses , many displaying the signs of right - to - buy ownership such as conservatories and extensions .
One , with a Union flag and a St George 's flag fluttering outside , belongs to Richard Barnbrook , the former art student with a penchant for erotica who is the BNP deputy leader on the council .
He says London will be " decimated " by immigration if the party fails to win Barking and Dagenham .
As she walks past , Beryl Ferguson , 64 , a retired shopkeeper who has lived on the estate for 42 years , begs to differ .
She said : " I voted for that lot [ the BNP ] last time but not now .
I 've got Africans a few doors down and you get used to each other .
We 've got to rub along .
The BNP do n't want that , do they ? "
Back at the market Mr Myatt is less optimistic .
" Democracy is a bit of a myth in this place , " he says .
" We will have democracy for one day and then it is back to an elected dictatorship .
" The problem is that here we 're heading for a BNP dictatorship .
For the moment , they leave me alone but what if they come to power ?
They call Islam wicked .
I 'd love to meet them face to face and put them right .
This is my country as much as theirs .
What are they going to do ?
Take away my British passport ? "

Rush Limbaugh , the man credited with popularizing the term “ feminazi , ” says he ’s a fan of the women ’s movement — “ especially when walking behind it . ”
Limbaugh made the comment to Fox News ’ Gretchen Carlson on Wednesday , when Carlson asked him about his role as a judge in the 2010 Miss America contest , and noted that some critics say Limbaugh has n’t “ been a supporter of women in the past . ”

“ I ’m a huge supporter of women , ” the talk radio host replied .
“ What I ’m not is a supporter of liberalism .
Feminism is what I oppose .
And feminism has led women astray .
I love women … I love the women ’s movement , especially when walking behind it .
This idea that I do n’t like women is absurd . ”
Earlier in the interview , Limbaugh attempted to smash through preconceptions about the intellect of beauty pageant contestants and declared , “ I ’ve talked to women here who know more about various political issues than elected people I ’ve talked to on the phone .
I ’m really impressed with all of them . ”
Limbaugh ’s history with the women ’s movement has been colorful , to say the least .
In 2008 , during the presidential primaries , Limbaugh said women were attracted to Hillary Clinton as a candidate because “ they ’ve had two or three abortions . ”
In 2005 , he raised the ire of many women when he declared that feminism was created “ so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society . ”

Highly dangerous Cryptococcus fungi love sugar and will consume it anywhere because it helps them reproduce .
In particular , they thrive on a sugar called inositol which is abundant in the human brain and spinal cord .
To borrow inositol from a person 's brain , the fungi have an expanded set of genes that encode for sugar transporter molecules .
While a typical fungus has just two such genes , Cryptococcus have almost a dozen , according to Joseph Heitman , M.D. , Ph.D. , chairman of the Duke Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology .
" Inositol is abundant in the human brain and in the fluid that bathes it ( cerebral spinal fluid ) , which may be why this fungus has a predilection to infect the brain and cause meningitis , " Heitman said .
" It has the machinery to efficiently move sugar molecules inside of its cells and thrive . "
The findings on Cryptococcus genes were published online this week in the inaugural issue of mBio , a new open access microbiology journal .
This specialized brain attack likely occurred because these fungi adapted to grow on plants in the wild , which also are abundant in inositol , said lead author Chaoyang Xue , Ph.D. , formerly a postdoctoral research associate in the Heitman lab and now an assistant professor at the Public Health Research Institute at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey ( UMDNJ ) .
" In fact , this pathogenic yeast has more inositol transporters than all other fungi we have compared it to in the fungal kingdom , based on what we know from genome research . "
The team of researchers discovered that inositol stimulates Cryptococcus to sexually reproduce .
" A connection between the high concentration of free inositol and fungal infection in the human brain is suggested by our studies , " Xue said .
" Establishing such a connection could open up a new way to control this deadly fungus . "
Cryptococcus ' love for sugar may also be a fungal Achilles Heel , Heitman said .
" Now scientists may be able to target the fungi by developing ways to put them on the fungal equivalent of an Atkin 's low - carbohydrate diet so they will stop multiplying . "
He said researchers could use the new findings to devise different types of strategies to block Cryptococcus infections .
These studies will be reported in the inaugural issue mBio , which will be launched in May by the American Society of Microbiology as an online journal that spans all areas of microbiology .

The debate over the longevity of native software continues .
Mozilla , creator of Firefox , claims that its new browser for smartphones will contribute to the death of smartphone app stores .
Scheduled to begin appearing on devices at the end of this year , the Firefox mobile browser , code - named Fennec , will be packed with features to make it the closest thing yet to a real , desktop - class browser .
( Wired.com ’s Mike Calore has a detailed look at Fennec . )
Mozilla claims it will have the fastest JavaScript engine of any mobile browser , allowing developers to produce HTML - and JavaScript - coded apps for Fennec rather than for multiple smartphone platforms , such as iPhone OS , Google Android or Windows Mobile .
“ In the interim period , apps will be very successful , ” said Jay Sullivan , vice president of Mozilla ’s mobile division , in an interview with PC Pro .
“ Over time , the web will win because it always does . ”
Web proponents such as Mozilla and Google dream that internet standards will enable any app to run on any device , just as Java proponents touted a “ write once , run anywhere ” vision in the 1990s .
Similarly , Adobe ’s Flash emerged as a cross- platform environment for creating animations , games and apps for the web .
But many consumers and developers have complained that Java and Flash exhibit bugs , performance problems and security vulnerabilities , among other issues .
And Java ’s promises of universality did n’t quite work out , because different implementations of the Java virtual machine ( not to mention wildly varying hardware capabilities ) mean that , even today , Java coders need to rework their apps for each target device .
But web proponents maintain that the wide acceptance of next - generation internet standards , particularly HTML5 , will win out where Java failed .
It ’s a tempting vision .
Currently , when deciding whether to buy a Mac or a PC , an Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3 , or an iPhone or a Droid , you need to consider which applications you ’ll be able to run on each one .
If programmers head in the direction of the web , then ideally you ’ll be able to gain access to any application regardless of the computer or smartphone you own .
Google is attempting to lead the web movement .
The search giant is pushing its web - only regime with Chrome OS , its browser - based operating system for netbooks that will run only web applications .
Also , in July , Google ’s engineering vice president and developer evangelist Vic Gundotra said in a conference that mobile app stores have no future .
“ Many , many applications can be delivered through the browser and what that does for our costs is stunning , ” Gundotra was quoted in a Financial Times report .
“ We believe the web has won and over the next several years , the browser , for economic reasons almost , will become the platform that matters and certainly that ’s where Google is investing . ”
But iPhone developers and analysts polled in July by Wired.com explained the problems with current web technologies , and some highlighted the merits of native - app architecture .
Interpet analyst Michael Gartenberg noted that many iPhone apps are a combination of native and web technologies , because many apps download or share data through the internet .
He said it ’s beneficial for the apps to be native , because they ’re programmed to take full advantage of the iPhone ’s hardware .
“ It ’s odd that Google feels the need to position as one versus the other , ” Gartenberg said in July .
“ That ’s last century thinking … .
It ’s not about web applications or desktop applications but integrating the cloud into these applications that are on both my phone and the PC .
Ultimately , it ’s about offering the best of both worlds to create the best experience for consumers — not forcing them to choose one or the other . ”
With Firefox ’s mobile browser rolling out soon , we have yet to see how consumers and developers react to Mozilla ’s attempt to spark a web - only exodus .
We ’ll continue examining this topic in the months to come .
Meanwhile , what are your thoughts about the web - versus - native debate ?

Recently , there have been a couple of questions on the Spirit mailing list asking how to parse as set of things known in advance in any sequence and any combination .
A simple example would be a list of key / value pairs with known keys but the keys may be ordered in any sequence .
This use case seems to be quite common .
Fortunately Spirit provides you with a predefined parser component designed for exactly that purpose : the permutation parser .
Spirit ’s permutation parser a ^ b matches either a , b , a >> b , or b >> a , where a and b can be arbitrary parser expressions .
Just like normal sequences this operator can be utilized to combine more than two operands .
For instance , the expression a ^ b ^ c will match a or b or c ( or an combination thereof ) in any sequence .
The attribute propagation rule for the permutation parser is
a : A , b : B --> ( a ^ b ) : tuple< optional < A > , optional < B> >
As usual , if one or more operand of the expression do not expose any attribute ( expose unused_type as their attribute , which is equivalent ) , this operand disappears from attribute handling :
a : A , b : Unused --> ( a ^ b ) : optional < A > ;
The permutation parser works out of the box whenever you do not require to match all of the elements in the input .
But what if you want strict permutation ( operands get matched exactly once ) ?
You have two possibilities , as often , one simple and less versatile and one more complex but universally applicable solution .
The simple solution is to parse the input and to check afterward whether all optionals in the resulting attribute have been filled .
I will leave that solution as an exercise for the reader .
If we assume the attribute to be a ( Fusion ) tuple of optionals , containing one optional for each of the parser components in the permutation parser we can write the following code ( thanks to Carl Barron for the initial idea ) .
This code defines a Phoenix function ( a lazy function encapsulating some custom functionality ) checking whether one or more of the optionals in a given Fusion sequence are empty .
The Fusion algorithm find_if iterates over the given sequence of optionals , invoking the option_empty : : operator ( ) for each of the elements .
fusion : : find_if stops iterating on the first invocation returning true and returns the iterator to the element it stopped on .
This is very similar to the well known std:: find_if algorithm .
namespace phoenix = boost :: phoenix ; namespace fusion = boost : : fusion ; namespace qi = boost : : spirit:: qi ; class no_empties_impl { // helper function object to be invoked by fusion : : find_if struct optional_empty { template < typename T > bool operator ( ) ( T const& val ) const { return ! val ; // return true if ' val ' is empty .
} } ; public : template < typename T > struct result { typedef bool type ; } ; //
This operator will get called from the semantic action attached // to the permutation parser .
The parameter refers to its overall // attribute : the fusion tuple of optionals .
template < typename T > bool operator ( ) ( T const& t ) const { // look for an empty optional , if any return false .
return fusion::find_if<optional_empty >( t ) == fusion : : end(t ) ; } } ; // define the Phoenix function phoenix:: function < no_empties_impl > const no_empties = no_empties_impl( ) ;
The overall Phoenix function no_empties will return false if we found at least one non-initialized optional in the passed sequence .
The following code snippet illustrates how everything fits together :
std ::string input ( " BCA " ) ; std::string::const_iterator begin = input.begin( ) ; std::string::const_iterator end = input.end ( ) ; qi::parse ( begin , end , ( qi:: char_ ( ' A ' ) ^ ' B ' ^ ' C ' ) [ qi::_pass = no_empties ( qi::_0 ) ] ) ;
We assign the result of the invocation of no_empties to Qi ’s predefined placeholder _pass .
If we assign false , then the parser the semantic action is attached to will be forced to fail in retrospective ( even if it matched the input successfully before ) .
As a result the overall parser expression will succeed as long as a ) the permutation parser matches its input and b ) the Phoenix function inside the semantic action returns true .
For more information about the permutation parser please consult its documentation here .
Overall , this example is a bit more complex than the average parser you might usually write .
It utilizes three libraries : Spirit , Phoenix , and Fusion in a seamless manner .
But for sure , once you understand the idea , it will be easier for you to come up with similar solutions .
Spirit has been designed with Phoenix and Fusion in mind , and in fact it relies on Fusion heavily itself .
As a result , the integration of those libraries is almost perfect .
' I pray lovely creature , comply ! ' 300 - year - old stash of erotica found hidden in Lake District manor house
( 1770 ) THE CRAFTY CHAMBERMAID'S GARLAND
[ Extract ]
' The Merchant he softly crept into the room .
And on the bedside he sat himself down .
Her knees through the counterpane he did embrace .
Did Bess in the pillow did hide her sweet face .
' He stript ( sic ) of his clothes and leaped into bed saying now lovely creature for thy maidenhead .
She strug led ( sic ) and strove and seemed to be shy .
He said divine beauty I pray now comply .
A secret hoard of lewd pamphlets written to titillate the common man more than 300 years ago have been discovered in a manor house .
Known as Chapbooks the bodice - ripping yarns were found hidden in the library of Townend House at Troutbeck in the Lake District .
The pamphlets had been shoved behind a collection of straightforward books , presumably to hide them .
Chapbooks - the name derives from ' chapmen ' the door - to - door peddlers who sold this type of literature - told racy tales of amorous advances , love and marriage .
The pamphlets were printed on cheap paper so thin that hardly any have survived the ravages of time .
Townend House was owned by a landowning farming family , the Brownes , whose literary collection has been passed to the National Trust .
Emma Wright , who is the Trust custodian at Townend said : ' The Browne book collection goes back through the centuries and proves that rural people had a strong interest in literature . '
' However , as we have gone slowly through the library we have found hidden away these Chapbooks .
' They contain rather saucy even rude tales which were found to be rather amusing by their 18th century readers . '
One tale is called The Crafty Chambermaid 's Garland and details the story of a young woman who tricks a man into marrying her .
The Chapbooks were found in the library of Townend House at Troutbeck in the Lake District
Written in 1770 it states : ' The Merchant he softly crept into the room .
And on the bedside he sat himself down .
Her knees through the counterpane he did embrace .
Did Bess in the pillow did hide her sweet face .
' He stript ( sic ) of his clothes and leaped into bed saying now lovely creature for thy maidenhead .
She strug led ( sic ) and strove and seemed to be shy .
He said divine beauty I pray now comply . '
The National Trust has put some of the steamy pages with their illustrations onto digital photo frames with MP3 recordings also available for visitors .
Mrs Wright added : ' The Chapbooks have really caught the imagination .
The Brownes were obviously far from straight - laced . '
Because of its dynamic nature , Ruby is very difficult to optimize ; as a result it is a slow language .
It has long been an unrequited dream of mine to write a fully static Ruby compiler , which converts Ruby into efficient , directly executable machine code .
I had given it up as infeasible , but some recent advances in the state of the art have filled in the last missing pieces and put a practical Ruby compiler within reach .
I will be talking about Ocelot , my implementation of these ideas .
Ocelot is an experimental ( meaning , unfinished ) implementation of Ruby , but my goal is that it will be able to handle all ( well , almost all ) of the hard parts of implementing Ruby while providing improved performance .

On his radio show , today Glenn Beck went off on a rant against the leaked RNC fundraising power point .
Beck told his listeners that they should be “ hacked off ” at the RNC because they are playing on people ’s fears .
Without a hint of irony in his voice , Beck was upset that the RNC was using people ’s fears to make money .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :

Speaking of the Republican fundraising memo , Beck said , “ It really , really hacks me off .
When you really start to think about it , it was a fundraising power point , and basically it was taking people through , and saying ok , this is what you , if you want to raise money for the RNC , here ’s what you need to do , basically play on their fears . ”
The Beck crew was upset because the RNC used Beck as an example of how to exploit people ’s fears .
Beck then launched into an attack on the Republican Party , “ The more you think about this .
The more hacked off you should be , because this is what America is looking for .
Someone that ’s not going to play on our fears , or on the other side , prey on our hope for change , but actually change things , so what are the Republicans saying , because what the Democrats said is they ’re just going to play on our fears , meaning that our fears are unfounded .
Are the Republicans saying that our fears are unfounded ? ”
Beck and company claimed that the Republican Party does n’t get it and they do n’t have any principles and values .
Beck said that the Republican Party did n’t even have principles and values under Reagan , “ They really did n’t even under Reagan .
Reagan had them , but very few others actually had them , because as soon as Reagan left , it all went to hell in a hand basket . ”
Some might view Beck ’s comments as a sign of his independence , but what is really going on here is that he is trying to split the Republican Party in order to advance his Tea Party movement .
Glenn
Beck wants to form a third , more conservative , political party in this country .
He has been open and upfront about his goals , and if he has to split the Republican Party to do it , then that is what will happen .
Beck was trying to openly discourage people from giving to the RNC .
He was discrediting the motives of the entire Republican Party .
The RNC was right to use Glenn Beck in their power point on how to raise money by exploiting the fears of others .
Beck has made himself a millionaire many times over by relentlessly exploiting the fears of others .
Glenn himself seems to have forgotten that he did n’t always hold the views that he has today .
It is no coincidence that his fortunes raised after he re-crafted his persona after the election of Barack Obama .
Beck is just as much of an exploitative charlatan as the RNC .
The only difference between the two is that Beck does it better .
Amid fears of plans to cut the broadcaster 's funding and Tory threats to disband the BBC 's governing body , more than 40 top performers sign a letter in bid to safeguard its future
Peter Kay , John Barrowman , Peter Capaldi and Romola Garai are among leading entertainers calling this weekend for voters to protect the BBC on polling day .
More than 40 of the best known performers in the country , including comedians Catherine Tate , Meera Syal , Stephen Merchant and Terry Jones , and the acclaimed actors Sam West , Hugh Bonneville and Harriet Walter , have signed a public letter denouncing plans to cut the licence fee and accusing opposition politicians of " a cavalier attitude towards the BBC 's independence " .
The letter , which has also been signed by directors Sir Richard Eyre and Stephen Frears and by the popular comic performers Harry Enfield , Charlie Higson , Eddie Izzard , Robert Webb , Stephen Mangan , Sanjeev Bhaskar and Jo Brand , goes on to highlight an explicit threat to disband the BBC 's governing body , the BBC Trust , by the Conservative shadow culture secretary , Jeremy Hunt , and calls the corporation the " most important cultural organisation in Britain and an indispensable part of our society " .
Roger Lloyd Pack , a well - known face from his role as Trigger in the sitcom Only Fools and Horses , is one of the signatories to the letter and says he is unsettled by the lack of discussion about the future of the BBC in the election campaigns .
" It is very sinister that no one is mentioning it , " he said .
" Everyone who goes to the rest of Europe and watches television knows what we have in the BBC , but it is often taken for granted .
If we lose it , we will never get it back . "
Lloyd Pack urges voters to consider what it would mean not to have a television channel that was free of commercial breaks .
" Opposition parties talk vaguely about ' keeping the barrier high ' and ' maintaining levels ' and they talk about public choice too , but it is no choice at all if you have lots of channels of rubbish .
We need the BBC as a standard - bearer , " added the actor , who is in Glasgow filming the second series of the sitcom The Old Guys for BBC1 .
While none of the manifestos of the main parties mentions a plan to freeze the licence fee , or to " top- slice " it for other purposes , the Conservatives have already pledged to reveal how the BBC spends its income from the fee – worth £ 3.4bn a year – by giving the National Audit Office access to its accounts for the first time .
The party has promised , if it forms the next government , " to promote and protect a strong and independent BBC " , but earlier this year the House of Commons public accounts committee , which is chaired by Tory MP Edward Leigh , complained that the corporation is " currently immune from being properly held to account for its spending of billions of pounds of public money " .
The BBC 's supporters fear this proposed close scrutiny by the NAO , which is overseen by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee , would amount to direct government control of the broadcasting network .
The PAC 's last report – Scrutiny of Value for Money at the BBC – also spoke of the licence fee as an unwelcome national tax , rather than as the established way of protecting the corporation 's independence .
The report fanned the flames of a row which has smouldered since comments made last summer by James Murdoch , the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation , who publicly criticised the BBC for being " incapable of distinguishing between what is good for it , and what is good for the country " .
He added that " the scope of its activities and ambitions is chilling " .
The Labour manifesto says the current government is determined to " maintain the independence of the BBC … the most admired and trusted broadcaster in the world " and the prime minister , Gordon Brown , recently said : " Any proposal to massively cut the fee , strip the BBC of its independence – or remove its ability to make certain programmes – is a huge mistake .
A lot the BBC does is incredibly creative , and risky . "
The Lib Dem manifesto says the party plans to keep the BBC " strong , free from interference and securely funded " .
The campaigning website 38 Degrees has also been protesting against cuts proposals and members have contacted the prospective parliamentary candidates of all parties asking for a pledge to protect the BBC .
Tomorrow , the website , named after the angle at which an avalanche begins , will post the responses so far .
By the start of the weekend , 97 Labour candidates , 65 Liberal Democrats and one Conservative had signed up .
" 38 Degrees members see this as a worrying indication of where Conservative instincts may lie , " said David Babbs , an organiser of the website .
" Many of us are questioning whether the future of public service broadcasting would be safe in Conservative hands . "
The protest letter from performers , published in the Observer today , urges voters to think about the consequences " for this cherished part of our national life " .
It concludes : " It is right that there is a national debate about the future of the BBC .
But attacking the BBC to serve the interests of its commercial rivals would be short - sighted and threatens to devalue not just the BBC itself , but our culture as a whole . "
Woman gobbles 51 of world 's hottest chillies - and rubs 25 in her eyes while Gordon Ramsay watches in horror
They 're likely to leave you gasping for water - and have even been known to kill people who eat too many .
For this woman , however , the world 's hottest chilli pepper proved nothing more than a simple snack as she chomped her way through 51 of them to claim a place in the Guinness Book of Records yesterday .
Anandita Dutta
Tamuly completed her eye - watering feat in two minutes , to the astonishment of Gordon Ramsay , who was monitoring her record attempt .
Not content with consuming them , the mother - of - one also smeared them in her eyes as Gordon Ramsay looked on
And for some inexplicable reason , 26 - year - old Mrs Tamuly then went on to smear handfuls of seeds from the fiery bhut jolokia chillies into her eyes as the crowds gasped in horror .
In 2007 Guinness acknowledged the bhut jolokia as the hottest chilli in the world , measuring more than 1 million units on the Scoville Heat Rating chart , the method of classifying heat in peppers .
A standard New Mexican green chilli has just 1,500 units .
A single seed from a bhut jolokia will cause watering eyes and a runny nose as well as a burning sensation in the mouth that can last up to five hours .
Awestruck : Anandita Dutta
Tamuly embarks on her attempt to break the world record for chilli eating
But Mrs Tamuly said coolly : ' I have been eating bhut jolokia since my childhood and never felt the hotness in my mouth .
' When I was five I had a sore tongue and my mother applied a chilli paste to cure the infection .
Since then I developed a penchant for chillies .
After that I found eating chillies was a great way to stay healthy .
Every time I have a cold or flu I just munch on some chillies and I feel better .
To be honest , I barely notice them now . '
She said she was disappointed not to have managed even more , having swallowed 60 chillies in practice runs .
Mrs Tamuly 's record - breaking munch took place in the Assam region of India where she lives and where the chilli grows in hilly areas .
Ramsay , who was in India filming for a Channel 4 programme , could manage only one before screaming for water , yelling : ' It 's too much ! '
The previous record was held by a South African woman who ate eight jalapenos in one minute in 2002 .
In September last year an aspiring chef died after eating a chilli sauce as part of an endurance competition with a friend .
Andrew Lee , 33 , from Edlington , West Yorkshire , challenged his girlfriend 's brother to a contest to see who could eat the spiciest sauce that he could create .
Mr Lee prepared a tomato sauce made with red chillies grown on his father 's allotment .
But after eating it he suffered intense discomfort and itching .
The following morning he was found dead , possibly after having a heart attack .

Die Axel Springer AG geht erstmals juristisch gegen BILDblog vor .
Sie hat uns vorletzte Woche gleich drei Abmahnungen zugestellt .
Die dadurch angeblich entstandenen Anwaltskosten will sie von uns erstattet bekommen : 2407,36 Euro .
Am 9 .
April hatten wir darüber berichtet , wie schwer sich “ Welt Online ” damit tat , eine Presserats - Rüge für einen Schleichwerbe - Artikel zu akzeptieren .
Wir behaupteten dabei auch , dass “ Welt Online ” diese Rüge immer noch nicht veröffentlicht habe .
Das war falsch .
“ Welt Online ” hat es zwar seinen Lesern schwer gemacht , den entsprechenden Hinweis ( siehe Screenshot rechts ) zu entdecken : Man findet ihn nicht , wenn man in der “ Welt Online ” - Suchfunktion zum Beispiel nach “ Presserat ” sucht , obwohl dieser Begriff im Text vorkommt .
Und die Rüge verschwindet aus dem Artikel , sobald man ihn ausdruckt .
Aber wenn man sich den Artikel auf dem Bildschirm ansieht , ist der Hinweis da .
Sobald wir unseren Irrtum ein paar Stunden später bemerkt hatten , strichen wir die beiden fehlerhaften Sätze in unserem Eintrag durch und fügten eine Korrektur hinzu , in der wir auf die Veröffentlichung hinwiesen .
Dennoch wurden wir eineinhalb Stunden später von der Geschäftsführung der “ Welt ” abgemahnt .
Deren Anwälte behaupteten , wir würden trotz unserer Korrektur noch den falschen Eindruck erwecken , “ Welt Online ” sei die Bestätigung der Rüge durch den Presserat bereits seit vier Wochen bekannt und habe sie nicht unverzüglich veröffentlicht .
Wir , das heißt : Stefan Niggemeier als Autor des Eintrags und Lukas Heinser als Verantwortlicher im Sinne des Telemediengesetzes , wurden einzeln aufgefordert , eine Unterlassungserklärung abzugeben und uns zu verpflichten , diesen Eindruck nicht mehr zu erwecken .
Unter anderem wurde dabei auch der Satz “ Das ist jetzt auch schon wieder vier Wochen her . ” abgemahnt , den wir zu diesem Zeitpunkt schon durchgestrichen hatten .
Außerdem forderte die Axel Springer AG eine Gegendarstellung .
Wir haben diese Forderungen nicht erfüllt , aber auf Anraten unseres Anwalts dem Eintrag eine weitere Korrektur hinzugefügt , die auch die Aussage von “ Welt Online ” enthält , erst am 1 .
April 2010 von der endgültigen Bestätigung der Schleichwerbe - Rüge erfahren und sie noch am selben Tag veröffentlicht zu haben .
Die Gegenseite teilte uns daraufhin mit , ihre ( vermeintlichen ) Rechtsansprüche gegen uns nicht weiter verfolgen zu wollen .
Weil wir durch unsere Meldung jedoch die Unternehmenspersönlichkeitsrechte Springers verletzt hätten , seien wir dazu verpflichtet , den Schaden zu ersetzen .
Das heißt : Wir sollen Springers Anwaltskosten zahlen .
Da wir unseren Fehler noch vor der Abmahnung von uns aus korrigiert hatten , sehen wir aber keinen Anspruch Springers auf eine kostenpflichtige Unterlassungserklärung .
Auch die geforderte Gegendarstellung hätte Springer nach Ansicht unseres Anwalts gerichtlich vermutlich nicht durchsetzen können .
Zudem sei die Berechnung der Anwaltskosten künstlich erhöht .
Wir haben uns deshalb entschieden , die Forderungen nicht zu erfüllen .
Dennoch sind uns durch die völlig unnötige juristische Auseinandersetzung bisher schon Kosten für unseren Anwalt in Höhe von über 2000 Euro entstanden .
Je nach dem weiteren Vorgehen Springers und dem Ausgang möglicher gerichtlicher Entscheidungen können die Gesamtkosten noch deutlich steigen .
Anders als für die Axel Springer AG sind solche Beträge für uns erheblich .
Wir sehen in dem Vorgehen der “ Welt ” kein ( selbstverständlich legitimes )
Bemühen , eine korrekte Darstellung der Fakten zu erreichen , sondern nur den Versuch , einem lästigen Kritiker das Leben schwer zu machen .
Wir würden uns deshalb freuen , wenn Sie uns mit einer Spende unterstützen könnten .
I find the existing software for the calculation of Electrical Installation difficult and long to use .
Sometimes , I need to make a simple calculation or verification and I do not need to create a complete network to do it
Recently I have discovered some small calculators , some of them are too much simplified , but I find the idea good .
There is for example …
voltage drop calculation from southwire
voltage drop calculation from csgnet
And also recently from Schneider for the calculation of several figures such as size motor , voltage drop , power factor correction , curve displayer , protection coordination , …
Sadly that only Schneider products are proposed
There is also Solutions Electrical , for example for the power factor calculation , but also other electrical engineering topics .
It seems correct , but it is not free , so I have not tried it .

ISRAELI EMBASSY IN NYC A RADIATION HOT SPOT
by x Saturday , Oct. 14 , 2006 at 1:05 PM
Feds surveyed NYC for radiation , found tainted park , Embassy
WASHINGTON -- Anti-terrorism officials conducted a helicopter survey of
New York City 's radiation sources in preparation for a so - called " dirty
bomb " attack - and discovered a Staten Island park with dangerously high
levels of radium , a new report found .
Federal authorities found 80 unexpected " hot spots " around New York
City , according to the Government Accountability Office , the
investigative arm of Congress .
The GAO report released Thursday details a previously undisclosed aerial
anti-terrorism program in New York City , one which may be extended to
other cities worried about the possible release of radioactive material
by terrorists .
The report does not identify which city park had the contaminated soil ,
but NYPD officials said it was in Gateway National Park in Staten
Island .
The site was closed , and New York has requested federal money to
do a citywide aerial survey every year to update the information .
By creating a map of the city 's radiation sources , city officials hope
to be able to respond more quickly in the event of a dirty bomb attack ,
know exactly which streets are contaminated and get civilians away .
New York is the first and only U.S. city to conduct a complete aerial
radiological survey , having paid the U.S. Department of Energy $ 800,000
for the 2005 study .
The helicopters picked up sources of low - level radiation from expected
places , like granite statues and medical isotopes at hospitals , but it
also found dozens of other sources of unexpected radioactivity , the GAO
report found .
" NYPD officials indicated that the survey was tremendously valuable
because it identified more than 80 locations with radiological sources
that required further investigation to determine their risk , " the report
said .
At the Staten Island park , sensors detected large quantities of radium
in the soil .
Long - term exposure to radium increases the risk of
developing lymphoma , bone cancer and leukemia .
National Park Service spokesman Brian Feeney said the area is a one - acre
piece of the 570 - acre Great Kills Park , which is part of the larger
Gateway park .
Feeney said experts assured them after the August 2005 study that the
area posed no public health risk , and said visitors do not go into that
area anyway because of dense vegetation .
He did not know if any warnings
had been placed around the site .
The radiation apparently comes from " some piece of industrial equipment ,
pieces of old rusty metal .
Whatever this equipment used to do , it picked
up radioactivity , " he said .
" We keep people out of that area .
It 's a non-accessible area of the
park , no one can get in there , " said Feeney .
" There 's no health hazard
now , there was never a health hazard to the public . "
He said the agency has applied to the Department of Energy for funding
to further survey the site .
Staten Island 's congressman , Rep. Vito Fossella , said the contamination
was a surprise to him and residents near the park , and he demanded more
information .
" It is essential for the government to act immediately to fully
understand the extent of the contamination , " said Fossella , who was
trying to arrange a meeting Friday with federal and city officials to
discuss further testing and possible removal of the contaminated soil .
One alleged radiation hot spot on Manhattan 's east side has the
potential for becoming a political hot spot : A strong radiation spike
from the area of the Israeli Embassy .
Officials would not comment on why
they thought that particular area allegedly showed such a stunning peak
in radiation .
The aerial survey is designed to help local officials react more quickly
in the event of terrorists detonating a " dirty bomb " that releases
radioactive material into the air .
With the survey , police may be able
to pinpoint the exact source of radiation by comparing new readings to
their pre-existing " radiation map " of the area .
NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said the department wanted a record of the
city 's naturally occurring and other " radiological signatures " to
compare with periodic readings it does to detect for dirty bombs or
other nuclear devices .
" It gives us a baseline so we can pick up any anomalies , " he said .
New York City is the only major city to conduct a full - scale Aerial
Background Radiation Survey to identify " hot spots , " though such work
has been done in the nation 's capitol , according to the report .
The GAO found neither the Department of Energy nor the Department of
Homeland Security believe they are required to conduct such radiation
mapping , though the investigators said there were " significant benefits "
to surveys in other urban areas .
Homeland Security officials agreed that they should study the cost and
effectiveness of expanded radiation mapping in additional cities .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , called the report further proof the
federal government is not doing enough to help cities guard against
terrorism .
The hot spot mapping initiative " should also be shared with cities
across the country , not mothballed because the Homeland Security
Department does n't want to put up the money , " Schumer said .
The GAO report also found the Department of Energy may need to beef up
security at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada and Andrews Air Force Base
in Maryland because those sites hold key national assets for responding
to a radiological or nuclear attack .
Specialized quick - response teams and equipment are concentrated at those
two sites , and a successful attack against either could leave one
section of the country with limited capacity to respond to a subsequent
strike with radioactive weapons , the GAO said .
The agency 's associate administrator , Michael C. Kane , was adamant the
sites are safe .
" We categorically reject the contention that physical security at two of
our facilities may not be sufficient for protecting against terrorist
attacks , " Kane wrote . >>
hmmm ?

This is the blackmail nuke
by Frank J Monday , Feb. 05 , 2007 at 6:10 AM
These Israeli nukes are threats to the US if Bush leaves Iraq .
Not only has Bush elevated Iraq and Afghanistan , he placed Israeli interest ahead of US interest by proxy ( possibly due to Israel threatening nukes on Iran and US , if we condemn them ) .
Only Israel benefits from these endless Middle East wars .
Iraq is the beginning .
As we commit war - crimes in Baghdad , the US gov't commits treason at home by opening mail , eliminating habeas corpus , using the judiciary to steal private lands , banning books like " America Deceived " from Amazon and Wikipedia , conducting warrantless wiretaps and engaging in illegal wars on behalf of AIPAC .
Soon , another US false - flag operation will occur ( sinking of an Aircraft Carrier by Mossad ) and the US will invade Iran , ( on behalf of Israel ) .
Then we 'll invade Syria , then Saudi Arabia , then Lebanon ( again ) then .... OR else Mossad will set off a nuke in NY .

It makes little sense that Israel would set off a nuke in New York city , the most Jewish city in the world .
That is unless you subscribe to the theory that zionists have always used jews as pawns and ultimately want to see the complete elimination of the Jewish people .
Some say that the zionists refused to rescue the Jews in WWII so that they would make conditions in Europe so bad that it would make Palestine look good in comparison .
I only know that the zionist state has a genocide going against the Palestinian people and it needs to stop .
Source ?
by Bison Boy Monday , Feb. 05 , 2007 at 9:04 AM
I 'd like to see the source of this ( presumably reposted ) article .
Anyone have a link to the original ?
Source found ?
by Bison Boy Monday , Feb. 05 , 2007 at 9:54 AM
I 've googled a bit for the sources of this article .
I found some interesting things .
The GAO report in question was issued on September 21 , several weeks before the Indymedia article .
Within two days of the original GAO report , a local Congressman posted an article which claimed , among other things , that the " [...] area initially flagged by the inspection , amounting to a 1 - foot - square patch of dirt , emitted about one millirem of radioactivity per hour . "
Not exactly a high hazard .
Plus , the seemed to be quite clear that the list of actual radiation sites was likely to remain unreleased to even the congressman .
( I sure have n't found it . )
So where did the allegation involving a location near the Israeli embassy originate ?
Googling for " alleged radiation hot spot on Manhattan 's east side " gives only one other result , which is an October 10 article at http://p4.forumforfree.com/-vp3878-mindscapes.html which on casual inspection seems to be a verbatim source for the CIMC article .
This page includes a ( dead ) source link to http://www.halturnershow.com/RadiationHotSpotsInNYC.html.
This in turn seems to be a reference to Hal Turner , who has an interesting and very up - to - date wikipedia entry .
Apparently he 's a white supremacist .
An amusing ( alleged ) quote from his website is listed here :
< blockquote > RUMOR : CARDINALS MAY SELECT AN AFRICAN OR LATIN AS NEXT PONTIFF TO REACH OUT TO THE THIRD WORLD
If they do , it will rightly mean the total destruction of the Catholic Church .
Non-Whites can never be Pope because they are not of God 's Chosen ; Jews have been trying to steal the title of " God 's Chosen " for centuries , but those of us who understand the Bible know that only whites constitute God 's Chosen .
It says so in the Bible , Book of Genesis </ blockquote >
I wonder if he might have an axe to grind in regards to Israel ? :-)
So anyway , I could n't find any other mentions of the Israeli embassy allegation .
It looks like this article is based on a mostly legitimate story , into which Hal Turner ( or some source upstream from him ) has inserted a bit of clever propaganda .
Not quite clever enough , IMHO , because the inserted paragraph regarding the embassy breaks the writing style of the rest of the article .
It 's a good effort , but not good enough .
NUCLEAR FALSE FLAG ATTACK
by PISSEDOFFPATRIOT Monday , Feb. 05 , 2007 at 12:20 PM
Since we have not been driven to attack Iran yet the Zionists are preparing the next false flag attack with a ' dirty bomb ' that has been touted as the ' next terrorist attack ' for a while in order to scare us all into total submission .
Mossad KNEW about 9/11 in advance , even filmed it happening ; they KNEW about the London bombings in advance and I bet there will be the telltale signs of Zionist foreknowledge with the next attack .
By that I mean follow the Israelis and the money .
The thing is since we supplied Israel with nuclear material and ' helped ' them with their program they have to be sure to get material that will be traced back to Iran so the blame can be pointed there .

Great Kills Contamination

Perhaps a boy scout is old enough to get a merit badge for solving this not so difficult problem of contamination at Great Kills Park .
The Park was chosen for the temporary storage of the steel from the WTC buildings collapsed on 911 .
There is great potential that the WTC buildings were collapsed with nuclear and non-nuclear demolitions .
The only way to determine the validity of such a potential is to gather the necessary equipment and have an independent survey of the area in question .
Reluctance on the part of any official for such testing will also be telling !

Dirty bombs are not a threat
by rfugger Monday , Feb. 05 , 2007 at 3:56 PM
Not mentioned in the article is the fact that the small amount of radiation a dirty bomb would create is hardly a threat to human health :
" A test explosion and subsequent calculations done by the United States Department of Energy found that assuming nothing is done to clean up the affected area and everyone stays in the affected area for one year , the radiation exposure would be " fairly high " , but not fatal . "
( source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_bomb)
As such , evacuation plans in case of a dirty bomb attack are misguided at best .
aerial surveillance

earthlady@hotmail.com 8037901302 Columbia SC
In Columbia SC we have aerial surveillance that has been going on for almost two years .
It would be sad to know we have been flown over and flown over but not searched for radiation .
It would be sad to know they fly aircraft to monitor our behavior or intimidate us but not really establish hot spots or potential problems .
There are days when I am buzzed by aircraft every 10 minutes .
They fly at less than 100 feet in downtown Columbia SC - the capital of the state .
Many of these aircraft are without numbers and letters and the FAA states they do not know who it is , and the local airfield cannot contact these small planes the government sends up to fly around our city all day every day .
How much does it cost and who is paying and what are they doing up there .
According to your article , they are not monitoring radiation , why not ?

You know , a link to the GAO , or an off - gov't copy of the report , would be very helpful & increase credibility ... because its a horrifying thought ... just sickening ...
There is a good reason religion & politics should be kept separate ... because Israel , Zionism , Jewish religion & spirituality are all SEPARATE concepts & entities .
Many people will be confused by this , as some of the previous comments suggest .
Its heartbreaking that this could be deeply misunderstood by the Public as the information only TRICKLES into the miasma of hatred that permeates ' International ' current events ...

Here is the part your looking for BlueBerryPick'n .
" First , NYPD officials said that in the course of conducting the survey , they identified over 80 locations with unexplained radiological sources .
Teams of NYPD officers accompanied by DOE scientists and technicians investigated each of these hot spots and determined whether they posed a danger to the public .
While most of these were medical isotopes located at medical facilities and hospitals , according to NYPD officials , awareness of these locations will allow them to distinguish false alarms from real radiological threats and locate a radiological device more quickly .
Second , NYPD officers are now trained in investigating hot spots and they have real - life experience in locating radiological sources .
Third , NYPD officials now have a baseline radiological survey of the city to assist with cleanup efforts in the event of a radiological release . "
From the report here : http://cryptome.org/gao-06-1015.htm
Not a word about Israel Embassy as you can see .
Although this statement is interesting from a different link :
" The Hill , an area of the Fresh Kills landfill connected to the recovery effort , is soon to shut down .
The operation , " created in the genius of desperation , has sorted through 1.6 million tons of material removed from the World Trade Center disaster site .
That work has uncovered more than 4,100 body parts , helping to identify more than 150 victims .
Now , there are only 25,000 tons to be carted to the landfill from Lower Manhattan , a small fraction of what was .
In the next few weeks their mission will be completed , their future certain only to the extent that it will be nothing like what they have just gone through . " ( New York Times ) "

Sorry I did n't qualify why I thought the above statement was interesting .
Because it also states in the GAO Report :
" One of the over 80 locations with a radiological signature was a local park that was once the site of an industrial plant .
According to NYPD officials , the survey disclosed that the soil there was contaminated by large quantities of radium .
9
Brush fires in the area posed an imminent threat to public health because traditional fire mitigation tactics of pushing flammable debris into the middle of the park could release radiological contamination into the air .
Investigating locations with unexplained radiological sources identified by the aerial background radiation survey alerted NYPD officials to this threat , and they were able to prevent public exposure to the material . "
The Park - see above .

If a dirty bomb attack happens , be sure to re-survey that radiation spike .
It may suddenly be gone .
it endangers so much more
by fever Sunday , Feb. 11 , 2007 at 6:47 PM
Would n't it be something if the klan or Arean Nations were to raid the embassie and got thier hands on a nuke ?
What ?
If the Zionists detonated the nuke , the klan / AN would loose a few dozen men , but what they call Jew York City would be gone , the American economy would no longer be able to aid Zionist offenses , and noone would know that it was the klan / AN that attacked the embassie or that the embassie was even attacked .
All that would be known is that the nuke explosion had its ground zero at the embassie .
Or even a palestinian group .
They would have even less to loose , and so much more to gain .
Another forgery , indymedia style

Any guess as to the paragraph that was recently inserted ?
To their credit , this has been deleted by most of the IMC 's that originally published it .
Cleveland - its your turn !
One clue of the forged nature of this paragraph is the lack of compliance to standard rules of grammar :
" One alleged radiation hot spot on Manhattan 's east side has the potential for becoming a political hot spot : A strong radiation spike from the area of the Israeli Embassy .
Officials would not comment on why
they thought that particular area allegedly showed such a stunning peak in radiation "

The Jewish group has thrived on oppression and on the antagonism it has forever met in the world ... the root cause is their
use of enemies they create in order to keep solidarity ... "
Its no surprise that this end up on places like " whitefreespeech.com " , rense , etc .
What Einstein really said was " The formation of groups has an invigorating effect in all spheres of human striving , perhaps mostly due to the struggle between the convictions and aims represented by different groups .
The Jews
too form such a group with a definite character of its own , and anti-semitism is nothing but the antagonistic attitude produced in the non-Jews by the Jewish group "
He goes on to say what unites the Jewish people :
" The bond that unites the Jews for thousands of years and unites them today is , above all , the democractic ideal of social justice , coupled with the
idea of mutual aid and tolerance among all men . ... "
You are n't going to find that on whitespeech , or stormfront .
Rapping for Religion Pentecostal Church Lures Latin Americans Away From Catholicism
Pentecostal ministers in Latin America are luring increasing numbers of Roman Catholics away from their faith with modern marketing tactics , including caps and logo T - shirts .
The range of religious " services " on offer even extends to exorcisms .
In recent years , the issue of Asian American youth gangs has gotten a lot of attention from the media and law enforcement .
This phenomenon shares many similarities with other " gang problems " in the Black and Latino communities .
However , certain ethnic and cultural aspects come into play with Asian gangs that make their situation and consequences of their actions unique .
The More Things Change . . .
The origins of Asian youth gangs are not unique .
In fact , the phenomenon of Chinatown gangs around the country ( most famously in New York City ) has been the subject of much attention and academic research starting from their initial appearance in the late 1800s and continuing through modern times .
Like their Italian , Irish , and Jewish counterparts who came to the U.S. back in the 1800s and early 1900s , many Asians struggle to adapt to a new country and social environment and challenges of making a living , whether they are immigrants themselves , U.S. - born children of immigrants , or whose families have been in the U.S. for several generations .
Many Asians feel overwhelmed , frustrated , depressed , and even angry as they try to adjust to living in the U.S.
Many times they do n't have enough job skills or English fluency to find steady and meaningful work .
This can be especially common among Vietnamese , Amerasian Vietnamese , Cambodian , and Laotian immigrants , who tend to have lower levels of socioeconomic attainment and therefore are at greater risk for experiencing difficulty in adjusting to American society .
Many younger Asian Americans may also feel alienated from their parents , family , schools , and ethnic community .
They may feel misunderstood , underappreciated , or are asserting their new sense of American - style individualism and personal independence .
They may also feel that they are victims of prejudice and discrimination .
As a result , they may fatalistically accept that despite their best efforts , there are too many barriers that prevent them from achieving the " American dream " -- at least through conventional methods .
In this situation , it 's many Asian youth try to find some kind of social group that includes others in the same situation , that will give him / her mutual support and understanding , and that contain alternative methods of earning status and respect among one 's peers .
In other words , s/he may find an alternative form of " family " where s/he feels accepted and comfortable .
Unfortunately , many of these groups are based on the belief that the only way for them to achieve " success " in American society is to accomplish those goals through " unconventional " methods -- i.e. , crime .
Staying Close to Home
Many Asian youth gangs may start out as just a social group of friends and acquaintances .
But more commonly , larger and more established gangs actively recruit new members into the gang .
Once the new member finds a sense of belonging and acceptance , not to mention sex , drugs , and other " perks " of gang life , it 's often very hard for him / her to give it up .
Some ( although not all )
Asian youth gangs may also have connections to , or even be controlled by larger and more formal Asian organized crime groups who themselves manage elaborate prostitution , gambling , smuggling ( including illegal aliens ) , extortion , and other gang activities around the world ( i.e. , Chinese " triads " or " tongs " ) .
In addition to these conventional gang activities , it 's also common for Asian gangs to compete with Black and Latino gangs for turf .
But their specialty , for which they 've received a lot of media and law enforcement attention , is a type of robbery called a " home invasion . "
Home invasions occur when the gang breaks into family 's home or small business , tie up all the family members , and terrorize them until the family produces valuables or money .
Common tactics include beatings , torture , and the raping of female family members .
Asian youth gangs almost always target Asian families for home invasions because these families are less likely to report such crimes to the police .
This is because many recent Asian immigrants come from countries where the police were seen either as completely corrupt , woefully ineffective , or even working in conjunction with gangs .
Such publicity would also bring " shame " to their community , which goes against the families ' social conditioning .
The family may also fear retaliation from the gang if they report the home invasion to the authorities .
Victims who are in the U.S. illegally also worry that they may be deported if they report crimes committed against them .
In fact , a recent study by the Department of Justice found that among all the major racial / ethnic groups , Asian Americans are the least likely to report violent crimes committed against themselves to the police .
Further , recent Asian immigrants are more likely to keep their valuables and money hidden somewhere inside their house or business instead of keeping them in a bank .
Again , they may not be knowledgeable about the concept of banking and trusting one 's money to strangers or because of past experiences with corrupt financial institutions in their home country .
Either way , Asian gangs exploit these cultural elements to victimize their own community .
Other crimes favored by Asian youth gangs may include prostitution , laundering counterfeit money ( i.e. , printing phony currency , going out to buy something , then returning that item to get real cash in return ) , selling drugs , and those based on using modern high - tech methods , such as identity theft and credit card fraud .
The Responses of Law Enforcement
In response to these crimes , law enforcement authorities have implemented some very effective and ineffective strategies .
Many police departments in cities that have large Asian populations have actively recruited more bilingual police officers from the community and have stepped up their efforts to educate the community about American law enforcement and the legal system .
This greater understanding can lead to less fear of enlisting the help of the police and makes it easier for the police to get leads and tips from the Asian community about gang activities .
Nonetheless , many in law enforcement are still rather ignorant about Asian youth gangs and the Asian American community .
For example , many police stereotypically believe that " all Asians are the same " and that Asian gangs are especially viscous and have absolutely no respect for life .
While Asian gangs can indeed be very violent , it is very easy for these extreme beliefs about Asian youth gangs to be transferred onto the entire Asian community .
For example , for a while in the mid-1990s , many police departments in southern California set up special " Gang Task Forces " that specifically targeted Asian youth gangs .
Their tactics included harassing any group of young Asian Americans who they thought might be affiliated with gangs .
The police also took " mugshot " photographs of these Asian Americans , without their consent and as if they were in a police lineup , and kept the photos on file as " possible " gang members .
The police justified these actions by claiming that it was very hard to differentiate and distinguish between Asians -- an assertion that caused significant outrage among the Asian American community .
Many saw these tactics as blatant racial profiling and completely dehumanizing and humiliating for the young Asian Americans who were being harassed .
Asian activists argued that the actions of a few individuals were again being projected onto an entire community and innocent Asian Americans were again being judged and discriminated against just because they happened to be Asian .
These tactics led to a storm of protest , several lawsuits , and criminal investigations for civil rights violations against these police departments .
Such methods were eventually ruled unconstitutional and were stopped .
Nonetheless , the profiling of suspected Asian gang members continues along with severe prosecution of those charged with gang - related activity , which many argue are unjustifiably harsh and discriminatory , even if the alleged crimes do not involve violent felonies .
In addition , many argue that this type of racial profiling has become even more common since the September 11 terrorist attacks .
In the name of " homeland security , " many law enforcement agencies are now aggressively pursuing , harassing , and arresting any Asian who they might perceive as a potential criminal .
Further , for many Asians who they detain but cannot charge with a crime , they are instead deporting them if they do n't have proper documents .
The Asian American Community Responds
Asian community leaders note that there needs to be a balance in regard to dealing with Asian youth gangs .
In terms of prevention , there needs to be much more outreach to young Asian Americans who may be inclined to join a gang .
These efforts need to be culturally competent -- that is , they need to recognize the unique ethnic and cultural issues that these Asian Americans face , not just subject them to the usual regiment of programs that were designed for another group entirely .
There also needs to be efforts to help Asian families interact more effectively with their children to bridge the generation gap that can lead to feelings of alienation .
While much Asian youth gang activity has involved those from immigrant and / or less well - off families , in recent years , many have noted that Asian gang members can also come from second and later generation families , from affluent backgrounds , and who may initially appear to be comfortably assimilated into American ( or Canadian ) society .
Regarding intervention and law enforcement , authorities have been urged to work with the Asian community , not against it .
This involves having a better understanding of Asian culture and history in order to gain the trust and respect of Asian families and for the legal system to rehabilitate young offenders using understanding and compassion , rather than punitively placing them in institutions where their physical safety and self - esteem take a further beating and where they learn the skills to become hardened career criminals .

Posted by John , April 8th , 2010 - under Immigration , Population , Racism .
I am just a simple man .
So I have some simple ideas about the population policies of the three major parties , Labor , the Liberals and the Greens .
Let me if I may share them with you .
Half of Australia ’s population growth comes from immigration .
So any debate about population is also about immigration .
Leaving aside 33,000 immigrants from New Zealand who are not counted in the figures , only 30,000 immigrants last year came from predominantly ‘ white ’ regions out of 158,000 arrivals .
So any debate about immigration is necessarily about race too .
For that reason the comment of Greens ’ leader Bob Brown that Australia could not support 35.9 million people by 2050 is in reality a call to cut immigration , including the skilled intake and is of necessity about keeping non-whites out of the country .
One explanation for this could be that Brown is following Nick McKim ’s lead in Tasmania and shifting to the Centre to gain more support for the Greens nationally .
After all it seemingly worked in Tasmania where the vote for the Greens at the election there a few weeks ago was over 21 percent .
Another explanation could be that Greens ’ environmentalism is based on the view that humans are a parasite that needs to be controlled or some softer version of this anti-human view and so keeping immigrants out of Australia is the logical result of their philosophy .
There is no proof for this , but there is a big audience out there for the nonsensical idea that Australia is full , and Brown is appealing directly to it .
He may be marrying his Malthusian madness with political expediency to attack immigrants in the hope he can attract right winger , including right wing environmentalists back , or to , the Greens .
This is the racism that dare not speak its name .
It is the racism of fact if not of intention .
The Liberals went down in the polls the other day quite a bit .
So they reached for the old favourite – refugee bashing and tacked that on to the back of the immigration debate .
Suddenly they did n’t want so many immigrants and would … yes , well what would they do ?
They zigged and zagged in response to the business fury directed at them for suggesting they would cut immigration .
Now they do n’t have a policy , just one they are working on for release before the election .
Reaction that ca n’t make up its mind .
That should win them lots of votes .
Of course Abbott has shown himself prepared in the past to adopt what he thinks are populist measures ( like taxing big business to pay for a maternity leave scheme ) so attacking immigration in the face of business opposition is n’t necessarily a fatal political error , especially if Abbott can steer the debate to boat people .
That would be perfect for the Liberals .
They could huff and puff about a few thousand ‘ foreigners ’ , act tough , win redneck votes and not have to do anything to cut immigration ( and so keep the bosses happy ) .
So their real aim in this debate will be to shift the focus to boat people .
At first Labor welcomed the Intergenerational Report which predicted a population of 35.9 million by 2050 .
Then they began to get worried as the Greens and Liberals positioned themselves in opposition to this .
This re-positioning seems to have resonated with many Australians for reasons ranging from racism to misguided concerns about the environment .
As I have argued elsewhere on this site it is the way we organise production for profit that is the problem , not people .
Labor appointed a Minister for Population as a response to the backlash against Rudd ’s support for a big Australia .
( Let ’s get handle on this .
36 million in a country the size of Australia is big ?
What laughable rubbish ) .
The Minister ’s task is to appeal to the racists and big business on population policy in a way that is less crude than the Liberals .
for a start Rudd wo n’t be professing support for a big Australia any more .
And Labor will still bash boat people but pretend to be humane about it .
( By the way a survey mentioned by a colleague shows that 25 % of Green voters believe Rudd is soft on asylum seekers . )
Labor have dirty hands in this debate too .
They have already cut skilled immigration numbers by 20 percent since March last year .
They just do n’t brag about it or proclaim they will cut more .
Given the resurgence of the Australian economy the need of capital is for more skilled immigrants not less .
I suspect Burke will find a way of squaring the circle and producing a policy that appeals to different constituencies .
My money is on some sort of regional growth strategy .
More people in regional centres where public transport , health and education re already grossly underfunded .
That should really solve our infrastructure problems .
It is no accident the Nazis have organised a rally against immigrants in Melbourne on the back of the support of the major parties for attacks on immigration .
The fascists see an opportunity to spread their filth and grow under the cover of respectability provided by the anti-immigration positioning of the three major parties .
I have a novel suggestion .
Instead of attacking immigrants and asylum seekers , why not tax big business and squeeze their profits to pay for decent public transport , decent public housing , decent hospitals and decent schools and universities ?
After all business benefits most from a fit , educated and well supported population .
April 6 , 2010
Iraq war veteran Phil Aliff describes the grim economic circumstances that U.S. soldiers face back at home when they return from Iraq and Afghanistan .
DURING THE early morning hours of March 13 , President Barack Obama 's war strategy for Afghanistan was officially implemented , with waves of U.S. Marines assaulting the southern Afghan village of Marja .
Though initially lauded as a success by the administration , the cost of Obama 's strategy has been dear .
During the first three months of 2010 , 83 service members died in combat -- twice the number who perished in the first three months of 2009 .
The high body count is also a sign of things to come as U.S. soldiers begin a series of offensives that are supposed to drive the Taliban out of Afghanistan 's southern frontier .
But when U.S. service members leave behind the intense fighting overseas , they come home to face another war .
This week , as Obama was visiting Afghanistan to meet with Afghan President Hamid Karzai , derisively known by most Afghans as the " mayor of Kabul , " shocking statistics were released regarding unemployment for veterans .
According to the Labor Department , the jobless rate for veterans between the ages of 18 and 24 rose to 21.4 percent , up from 14 percent in 2008 and significantly higher than the 16.6 percent unemployment rate for civilians in the same age range .
An unemployed veteran asks for money from motorists in Los Angeles ( Mark Ralston | AFP )
Employers are legally obligated to provide job security for members of the National Guard and Reserves , holding their jobs until they return from overseas .
But with these soldiers increasingly facing repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan , employers are simply deciding not to hire them at all - - turning them down even if they have the appropriate skills out of fear that they wo n't unable to replace a deployed employee .
Veterans ' groups say the high unemployment figures are also due to the fact that the young people who join the military lack job training , job experience and education .
Of course , these are precisely the reasons that recruiters tell young people that joining the military will benefit them -- that it will give them a leg up when it comes to finding a job when they return to civilian life .
The military has never provided the kind of job training that employers are really looking for .
That 's all the more so today as more and more people flock to recruiting stations in the hopes of a source of income that will meet basic living standards , or perhaps help them pay for an increasingly expensive education now that state budget cuts have slashed education funding and raised tuition .
As far as the Defense Department is concerned , however , diminished job prospects for young people are n't a problem .
They 're an opportunity , providing the military with a gigantic pool of potential recruits just desperate to risk losing their lives in exchange for that elusive " job training . "
As former Under Secretary of Defense David Chu put it , " What difficult economic times give us , I think , is an opening to make our case to people we might not otherwise have , and if we make our case , I think we can be successful . "
It is n't just recruitment numbers that are up for the Pentagon .
So are retention rates .
Reenlistment rose 14 percent in 2009 , with service members facing rising unemployment and a lower standard of living once out of the military .
FOR MANY veterans coming home from war , there are few options available to restart a life that , in many cases , has been shattered by the physical and mental wounds of warfare .
According to Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Secretary Eric Shinseki , disability claims backlogged because of bureaucracy will rise tenfold by 2015 to about 2.6 million if there is n't a significant overhaul in the claims process .
Those with service - connected claims already have a waiting time of approximately five months before their claim is processed , and that would grow significantly as the Great Recession continues to unfold .
But with bailouts for the rich being prioritized over social spending and an end to two unpopular wars , the message to veterans from the Obama administration is clear :
Once you come home , the billionaires are more important than you .
Veterans are n't the only ones facing this economic warfare , though perhaps they are among the most severely affected .
By his actions , Obama has made it clear that the economic recovery will come on the backs of working people .
And it seems that the best way to fix this crisis for veterans is n't even on the president 's desk .
Ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and diverting the resources used for occupation toward social spending would be the most obvious first step .
In contrast to the claim that the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan are in the interests of all Americans , the truth is that they are actually barriers to developing a higher standard of living in this country , especially for veterans .
This is most clear when you compare the funding for the wars to spending on veteran services at home .
According to the White House 's Office of Management and Budget , the government will spend $ 55.9 billion on the VA in 2010 .
While this is an 11 percent increase in funding , it is far short of the $ 155 billion expected to be spent on the occupations in fiscal year 2011 .
This is striking when considering how that money could be used if it were diverted toward workers ' and veterans ' needs .
The VA budget also includes funding for the post - 9/11 GI Bill , which encountered bureaucratic snafus that delayed its implementation for months last fall , forcing thousands of veterans to go without money for books and other necessities while the VA scrambled to process all of the claims .
Instead of funding endless occupation and bailouts for billionaires , Obama should be listening to the American public when considering how to spend our tax money .
Take , for instance , a March 26 CNN poll that showed 49 percent of Americans opposing the war in Afghanistan .
As casualties continue to mount during what is certain to be the bloodiest year of the war , that opposition will grow .
We need to demand that the money being spent on war be used to fund a better VA , education here at home and jobs programs .
This would offer concrete alternatives to young people who join the military not as enthusiastic " volunteers , " but as a consequence of the economic draft -- forced to sign away their best years to the military in a gamble to get an education .
It 's time that veterans and civilians join together to demand that the Obama administration spend our money on jobs and education , not war and occupation .

It 's here - Market turmoil - live coverage - click across now to see the latest action .
Thanks for reading and commenting .

6.27 am : The pound 's still falling - just hit $ 1.4641 .
6.23 am : The pound just hit a 12 - month low against the dollar at $ 1.4670 , as traders quickly digest those forecasts of heavy selling on the European exchanges .
You have to go back to the end of April 2009 to find a time when sterling was weaker against the greenback .
There have also been some interesting moves against the euro , which has been steadily weakened by the Greek crisis .
The pound hit a high of € 1.2735 ( that 's 84.4 p ) shortly after 4 am , but has been slipping since .
Currently € 1.2679 ( 86.2 p )
6.05 am : We 're just getting the latest projections from the City forecasters , and they predict that shares are going to tumble again when trading begins at 8 am .
The FTSE 100 is being called down up to 2.1 % at the start .
That 's a fall of over 100 points , following yesterday 's 80 - point tumble .
The picture is just as grim across Europe - with Germany 's DAX tipped to fall 2.3 % and the French CAC down a whopping 2.9 % .
That can't be blamed on the British electorate , of course - it's a reflection of the heavy losses on Wall Street overnight , and the ongoing turmoil in Greece .
5.53 am : Morning all .
Graeme Wearden here .
And what a morning - as I type the Conservative Party are on track to claim the most seats in a hung parliament , but with 120 constituencies still to declare the future of British politics is skin- tinglingly unclear .
As Patrick Wintour has written - Gordon Brown and David Cameron are locked in a constitutional standoff .
So let 's run around the state of the financial markets .
Sterling is DOWN , at $ 1.4754 against the dollar .
It hit $ 1.4731 around 3.15 am , when the glut of declarations started coming in .
UK government bonds are also coming under heavy pressure .
Gilt futures soared overnight , pushing up the cost of borrowing .
4.22 am : Markets are braced for a rocky start to trading today as overnight confusion in the polls comes amid continued heavy selling on international markets due to the Greek debt crisis .
Prices quoted by IG Index suggest the FTSE - 100 could fall over a 100 points after a volatile night of trading in London follows panicked selling late yesterday in New York .
Investors are struggling to digest the implications of this tightly - fought general election , but for the moment , the fight is overshadowed by broader worries about whether the next phase of the credit crunch is underway .
I 'm going to head off now to get some sleep , but Graeme Wearden will be taking over from me shortly to chart what promises to be an interesting morning .
Dealing room reaction : Elena Moya
3.23 am : OK , so now the City reckons it 's going to be a hung parliament .
So much for all that collective wisdom ( or not ) .
The bankers are as confused as the rest of the country .
Elena Moya , our tireless reporter in the Square Mile , reports :
After a short euphoria from those who believed a Tory victory was coming - despite the hung parliament announced by the exit polls - sentiment turned to reflect what the market has been discounting for weeks : there 's no clear winner .
" The market is resigning itself to a hung parliament - we would need a massive surprise not to see hung parliament , and we have n't had one yet , " said David Jones , Chief Market Strategist at IG Index in London .
" Current aggregate swing on results in is just above 4 % , which is not enough for a Conservative majority , " addded Mike Amey , Pimco 's man in London .
" As a result the Gilt market is coming down a little .
The gilt market had rallied by just over 1 point , or 1 % at the open .
That is now more like half a point .
Similarly the Pound is a touch lower ( 1.4840 from 1.49 ) .
The markets are starting to think seriously about a hung parliament . "
2.53 am : Glancing away from this gripping election race for a second , the markets have just opened in Hong Kong and it looks like the panic that hit Europe and the US yesterday has rippled all around the world .
HSBC shares have opened down 5.1 % .
Whatever the result of this election , I think we should brace for a rocky Friday on the markets .
2.25 am : The markets have gone quiet as everyone tries to work out what all these contradictory results add up to .
The pound and gilt markets remain firm , but the prospect of a hung parliament is looming again and I woud n't be surprised to see prices begin to fall once more .
This really has been a roller - coaster night .
Dealing room reaction : Elena Moya
1.33 am : Definite signs of a rally in the UK bond markets , but our credit market expert Elena Moya ( who is in the London dealing room of the world 's biggest bond investor , Pimco ) cautions that this is not all about the Tories .
This is a reaction to a rally in US treasury bills , which rallied after a trading error sent equities diving and investors seeked refuge in the - in principle - safer world of bonds .
" The gilt reaction is very similar to the German bonds , so it s a catch up with the US market , it 's not saying the results are good or bad , just saying they do n't know , " said Mike Amey , head of UK fixed income at Pimco , the world 's biggest bond investor .
Trading at the London Financial Futures Exchange , Liffe , was about 1000 contracts in the first 15 minutes since the market opened at 1 am .
" It 's very small , if something big had happened , there would be 15,000 contracts traded , " Amey said .
He 's covering the markets alone in London , liaising with his colleagues at the much bigger trading room in southern California .
Communication is through Bloomberg screens , but there 's little chance the firm will jump on UK gilts , after founder Bill Gross said they were resting on a bed of nitroglycerine .
For those interested in the detail , gilt futures are up £ 117.7 [ to buy £ 100 worth of gilts ] , from £ 117.3 , pushing down 10 year gilt yields down to 3.8 % , from 3.9 % .
This means the cost of borrowing money is falling for the UK government .
1.09 am : Government bond markets rallying judging from early prices .
Those two Tory gains likely to be reassuring investors about majority government .
IG Index say June Long Gilts now open and up around 0.6 % - driven by New York uncertainty and City feeling it will get a definite winner tonight .
1.00 am : Trading in the City has now started .
We 're getting prices with a 10 minute delay unfortunately , but I 'll give you a flavour of the action once the seats start coming in .
We 've been getting currency trades through the night already ( sterling now back up to $ 1.49 ) but the opening of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange ( Liffe ) , will give the first indication of how investors think the election result will effect interest rates , government bonds and the FTSE - 100 .
Meanwhile , our reporter Elena Moya has filed this after speaking to traders in the US :
Investors are betting sterling volatility will continue to the weekend , until clear results come out .
" This wo n't be figured out quicky , the pound will be trading all over the map over the next two sessions , " said Dave Leaver , a senior trader at forex.com in New York .
Then , the pound will be a good buying opportunity , he said .
" Sooner or later , problems in Europe will be a lot worse than the UK , so the pound will appear as a safe heaven .
Britain and the US have taken good steps to handle the crisis .
The ball will be in the European central bank 's court , and we do n't see what can be done : a debt problem is being sorted with more debt , one country is worse than the other .
It s a complete mess . " .
I would have never thought that I would ever report a trader saying that the currency of a country with debts of more than 10 % of the size of its economy would appear as a safe heaven .
It 's all relative , Einstein already said .
Currency markets - Sterling
12.34am : The pound has recovered most of its early losses after the exit polls .
Now trading at $ 1.48 .
This feels like the calm before the storm though .
Everyone wants to see some results from marginal seats before making up their minds .
Trading on Liffe begins in half an hour , which should give us some more sense of what investors think will happen .
Dealing room reaction : Elena Moya
Our reporter in the City , Elena Moya , says the mood is turning ( predictably ) toward the Tories in London 's dealing rooms .
Armed with computer and television screens , investors are convinced the exit poll is wrong and the tories will win a majority - the City 's preferred outcome , given the conservatives ' outright commitment to budget cuts .
IG Index has been handling an investor bet every 10 or 15 seconds since the exit poll came out at 10 pm .
She 's in a cab now heading for the dealing room at Pimco , the world 's largest bond trader , which famously warned the UK was resting on a " bed of nitrogylcerine " .
Here 's her recent interview with the boss of Pimco warning ' clients do n't pay me to feel sorry ' .
Live blog : Nils Pratley
11.40 pm : My colleague Nils Pratley points out that the City is digesting these big swings against Labour in Sunderland .
Spread betting sites have Tory seats at 330-335 , enough for a small overall majority .
Meanwhile , the pound has recovered some of its earlier losses .
Dealing room reaction : Elena Moya
11.18 pm : Our reporter Elena Moya is at one of the many City dealing rooms to have opened especially for the election night and has just filed this dispatch :
At 10 pm , as the exit poll came out , the screens of spread betting company IG Index were flashing orders from some of its more than 50,000 clients worldwide .
In the usually quiet headquarters on Blackfriars Rd. , about 15 staff monitored the company 's risk exposure , as clients mostly placed bets against sterling , and on a rally of the FTSE - 100 Index .
" A hung parliament is bad for the pound , but investors may be speculating that the fall of the FTSE might have been overdone - FTSE companies get much of their revenues from overseas , so a hung parliament here might not have such big impact , " said David Jones , Chief Markets Strategist at IG Index .
Before the exit poll was announced , investors bet that the FTSE would fall 150 points from its closing price on Thursday .
The bet moved to a smaller drop of 120 points by 10.20 pm .
The pound lost 200 points against the dollar , from $ 1.49 , from $ 1.47 , after the exit poll .
" In 20 minutes , 200 points is quite a big move , " Jones said .
It was his first day in the office at night , he said , adding that he planned to work through the night and until 2 pm on Friday .
Thursday was IG Index ' busiest day in the company 's 30 - year history , with 420,000 transactions from around the world , or about five trades per second .
The Greek crisis , a mis-placed trade in the US , and the uncertain outcome of the UK election , pushed volatility , the favorite element of punters .
" It 's great for our clients , " Jones said .
" It 's quite exciting , for a change .
Markets had been open in the past , but the market reaction was negligible because the result was expected . "
10.41 pm : Barclays Capital has just released its snap verdict on the exit poll data , of which they are rightly sceptical .
The main point is that a minority Tory government is actually a big worry for the City , rather contrary to Ken Clarke 's dire warnings before the election .
The emergence of a minority government would leave some residual uncertainty about the outlook for economic policy as the passage of any necessary legislation may be more difficult to navigate than if the government had an outright majority .
As such , this outcome seems likely to lead to some volatility in asset prices unless and until the ability of the new government to operate effectively is established .
10.30 pm : Our reporter Elena Moya is on a trading floor in the City following events this evening .
She says investors are still most concerned about wider market turmoil :
The exit poll suggests that it will be a hung parliament with no party having a strong mandate .
If this turns out to be correct then the UK market might be slightly volatile tomorrow .
However the fact of the matter is that in the capital market , the UK election is being totally overshadowed by events in the European government bond market
Meanwile , others are picking up on the sliding currency markets we mentioned earlier .
Telegraph economics columnist Ed Conway tweets : " Pound down against euro - big sign of market concern .
near 86 p a euro .
took traders a sec to realise what polls mean .
now they 're worried "
Currency markets - Sterling
10.24 pm : Sterling continuing to slide , now down exactly a cent against the dollar having fallen three cents earlier in the day .
The fear seems to be that a result that mirrored the exit poll would make it hard even for a coalition government to be formed .
Currency markets - Sterling
10.17 pm : Sterling has fallen almost half a cent against the dollar since exit poll data came out at 10 pm pointing to a hung parliament .
The pound has already had a battering today after the Greek debt crisis raised fears of contagion .
Prices quoted by spread - betting agency IG Index are also pointing to a 123 point fall in the FTSE 100 index on Friday morning .
" With Conservatives 19 seats short , that 's getting close to the most awkward result you can get , " said David Lea , western europe analyst at Control Risks .
Dow Jones at 3.20 pm US eastern daily time Photograph : Graphic
8.59 pm : Here is a graphic of the frightening plunge on the Dow Jones earlier this evening .
It looks like the panic may have been triggered by one or more rogue trades .
CNBC is reporting that one of the big banks may have been responsible but the New York Stock Exchange is investigating .
Either way , the Dow has just closed down 354 points , or more than 3 % , with almost all of the gains this year now reversed .
Rogue trades are not what we need on days like this .
8.46 pm : New York may be calming down ( a bit ) but this could be a long night because traders in London are coming in especially to trade through the results of the UK election .
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange is opening at 1 am to allow trading in derivatives that track UK interest rates and the FTSE 100 index .
Given what a rollercoaster day we have already had on international markets , it goes without saying that traders will be watching the results closely to see what it may mean for the UK economy .
Putting party allegiances to one side ( and most of the City would love to see a Tory win ) , the main issue will be stability .
If the new government looks like it will command a clear majority or can form a stable coalition , things may calm down .
A hung parliament may add to the international jitters .
They could all fall asleep , of course .
If you need reminind how volatile things are have a look at this piece from our banking correspondent Jill Treanor about how the crisis in Greece is already hitting British banks .
8.26 pm : Dan Roberts here taking over the live blog to see us through what could be an interesting evening on the international markets .
Following the shock 900 point plunge in the Dow , the New York Stock Exchange is looking into the trading data to see whether a rogue trade may have sparked the panic selling .
The Dow Jones index has recovered to trade ' just ' 4.5 % down , but it 's undeniable that markets are extremely jittery right now .
It feels , in fact , just like it did during the banking crisis .
8.20 pm : Some of the City 's dealing rooms will be opening up very early in the morning to trade on the result of the general election .
With Wall Street seeming to have a major case of the jitters , by far the worst outcome - for the markets - would be a hung parliament .
If there is no clear winner , expect a rout in London tomorrow .
The foreign exchange markets are , of course , open all night , with the centre of trading switching during the day .
The pound has taken a battering today , while the euro has continued its slide against the dollar .
It 's going to get worse , according to BNP Paribas .
The bank expects the euro to be at parity - ie worth exactlty the same as - the dollar by the first quarter of NEXT YEAR .
The euro hit a 14 month low against the greenback - dropping under $ 1.26 - but parity still suggests a major revision .
Until today , BNP had been forecasting the euro at $ 1.22 .
In its early days as a currency , of course , the euro was at around 80 cents so it is not unchartered territory ( as Larry Elliott , our economics editor , pointed out to me as he wandered past my desk ) .
But since then the eurozone has expanded and - its supporters would maintain - strengthened as an economic bloc .
Cobblers , its detractors would of course point out , the problems in Greece highlight the fundamental flaw in having monetary union without fiscal / political union .
Anyway , back to the BNP note .
This from Reuters :
" European bond markets are no longer a homogenous entity , which has reduced their attractiveness to foreign investors , " strategists at BNP wrote in a note .
" The inner ( European Monetary Union ) bond spread divergence and its impact on capital flows has been more severe than had been initially anticipated . "
BNP said over the past year the net inflow into European sovereign debt markets has " collapsed . "
Official accounts , which had been steady euro buyers and bond investors for years , have " disappeared . "
" While we have had one of the most euro bearish forecasts in the market , these previous projections now appear too moderate given current developments , " the firm said .
" Now that the fiscal option has been used without much success it will be down to the European Central Bank to come to the rescue of the euro , " BNP said .
" But , ECB President ( Jean - Claude ) Trichet did not leave the impression that this rescue comes at speed . "
8.01 pm : Wall Street has gone into meltdown .
At one point in the last half an hour the index of America 's leading stocks - the DJIA - was down more than 900 points .
That 's a 10 % fall .
The vote in favour of Greece 's austerity package has done absolutely nothing to convince traders on the other side of the Atlantic that Europe 's heavily indebted economies are going to be able to pull themselves out of the mire .
At 8 PM the DJIA is down 530 points , which still counts as a rout .
Investors are as jittery as they were in the days following the collapse of Lehman Brothers .
7.45 pm : Stephen Moss , our man on the ground in Athens , has sent a couple of choice missives via micro-blogging site Twitter about the situation in Athens , where protestors appear to be getting increasingly agitated .
A few minutes ago he tweeted :
Police breaking up athens parl demo with gas and advance from several sides
Obviously things appear to have gone rather downhill since then .
While there has not yet been another flare - up quite as violent as the scenes witnessed on Wednesday , which resulted in three deaths in an Athens bank , local residents are apparently taking few chances .
Even hoteliers are apparently scared , according to Stephen 's latest tweet .
Tried to take refuge in posh hotel but the concierge closed the shutters on me
Some bastions of capitalism , however , will stand regardless of what the mob might be able to throw at them .
Although Stephen does question the wiseness of keeping one particular outpost of American colonialism open during such times of unrest .
Is it really wise for mcdonalds in syntagma square to be open ?
Almost certainly not judging by the pictures now running on the television .
There appear to be running battles going on between protesters and police .
7.20 pm : Despite the success of George Papandreou in getting his package of austerity measure through parliament there is still a papable sense of panic in the financial markets about the state of the Greek economy and the ' contagion ' spreading to other eurozone countries .
The recent violence on the streets of Athens - and the protestors have been out in force again today and are currently massing in the streets surrounding the parliament building - has reminded investors , especially on the other side of the Atlantic , that voting in a law is not the same as implementing it .
The vote took place against a backdrop of angry Greeks outside shouting " Take to the streets !
Say ' No ' to the measures ! " and it looks as though there are likely to be further mass demonstrations tonight .
Financial markets are far from convinced that the vote - which paves the way for the eurozone / IMF € 110bn bailout - marks the beginning of the recovery for Greece .
On Wall Street the Dow Jones is down almost 250 points .
Earlier , European stock markets closed lower , with banking stocks taking a pasting .
And of course it should not be forgotten that at a time when the financial markets are desperate for proof that decisive political action can be taken to deal with Europe 's heavily indebted countries the last thing any economy needs is political indecision .
What a great time to hold a general election that could result in a hung partliament ..!
On that point , some dealing rooms will be opening up very early tomorrow morning ( and I mean early , 1 AM in some cases ) in order to react to the election results as they come in .
Foreign exchange trading , of course , carries on all night .
The pound has already taken a battering today , down 1 % at under $ 1.50 .
6.40 pm : To a back drop of chanting by demonstrators outside the parliament building , Greece 's politicians have approved prime minister George Papandreou 's austerity package , paving the way for a € 110bn bailout by the eurozone countries and the IMF .
The package of measures , which opposition leader Andonis Samaras characterised as a dose of medicine which " is in danger of killing the patient " , includes the overhaul of Greece 's pensions system , tax increases and the abolition of the 13th and 14th monthly wages paid annually to public sector workers on low salaries .
Its passage was not smooth , with leaders on both sides of the parliament having to chuck out dissenters .
" We have done what was necessary , not what was easy , " Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said after the vote .
" Without these measures , we'd be thrown into the deepest recession this country has ever known . "
Elsewhere on the site , our banking expert Jill Treanor has explored the potential impact of the crisis on the European banking sector .
6.18 pm : The Greek government has approved the austerity bill .
More will follow on that in a moment .
But first , here 's some more on the earlier preliminary vote in the Greek parliament .
The bill passed its first hurdle with a vote of 172 in favour and 121 against .
The € 110bn bailout from the euroxome / IMF is contingent on the passing of the so - called austerity measures , which have lead to violent protests in the streets of Athens .
With such a contentious piece of legislation its passage was never going to be smooth , and it has not been .
Papandreou was forced to expel three of his deputies who abstained from voting ( he still has 157 of the 300 seats in the Greek parliament which still gives him the sort of comfortable majority that David Cameron is praying he will have tomorrow )
His Conservative opposite number Andonis Samaras also had to remove one of his supporters - former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyiannis - after he voted in favor of the bill .
The main Greek opposition party now has 90 seats .
Samaras blated the government saying " The dose of the medicine you are administering is in danger of killing the patient " and claiming Papandreou had caused " a social explosion . "
Papandreou was suitably frank about the choice facing deputies in the parliament :
" Today things are simple .
Either we vote and implement the deal , or we condemn Greece to bankruptcy , " he said .
" Some people want that , and are speculating ( on it ) , and hope that it will happen ...
We , I , will not allow that .
We will not allow speculation against our country , and bankruptcy to happen . "
5.33 pm : Europe 's stock markets have ended on a 10 - week closing low on fears about the contagion spreading from Greece .
From Nick Fletcher 's closing market forces blog
Overall it was another day of volatile trading , with the FTSE 100 finishing down 80.94 points at 5260.99 after hitting a low of 5251 and a high of 5371 .
The index has dropped around 360 points since last Friday morning .
Ratings agencies Fitch and Moody's , meanwhile , are both keeping their stable outlook on Italy despite the Italian government increasing its forecast for the ratio of its debt to GDP .
Cheekily the rating agencies have stated that the revision merely brings the government 's projections into line with their own .
Who needs politicians and their economists when you have unelected ratings agencies ?
Perhaps we should hand over the reins of power now ( actually , I think this crisis may show we already have ) .
Incidentally , there 's an excellent discussion of how spreads in the credit default swap market ( that 's bets on which banks will be hardest hit by the sovereign debt crisis ) have now widened beyond the last three spikes : the collapse of Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers and March last year , behind the FT paywall on FT Alphaville but you can sneak in through Google - just search for " CDS Report :
It 's getting worse " and click on news .
5.05 pm : The Greek parliament has voted to approve Papandreou 's austerity measures , needed in order to get the € 110bn EU / IMF bail - out cash .
But the markets are not going to break out the bunting just yet .
This first vote was a preliminary non-binding vote .
In order for the package , which has lead to such violent protests in recent days , to actually become law it must pass a second vote later today .
As investors look for safe havens among all this talk of contagion and a sovereign debt crisis , gold has gained almost 2 % , rising to a five month high of $ 1,195.35 an ounze .
Silver prices are slightly weaker , but platinum is also soaring , quoted at over $ 1659 an ounce , up more than 30 cents .
Live blog - Portugal flag
4.56 pm : Things are tough for Portugal as the P in PIGS looks to raise anywhere between €300 m and € 1bn next week .
Spreads on its existing 10 year bonds have ballooned today on fears that the country will be the next to fall into the sovereign debt crisis hole that has enveloped Greece .
The premium demanded by investors in Portugese bonds , compared with German bonds - which investors see as a far safer bet - has grown to 349 basis points compared with 307 basis points on Wednesday .
That means it costs Portugal 3.49 percentage points MORE than Germany to raise funds .
Portugal has roughly € 5.9bn worth of bonds falling due this month and while officials maintain that the country will not have any problems with these redemptions , the situation has not been helped by comments earlier from ECB president Jean - Claude Trichet that the bank 's monthly rate setting meeting did not include any discussion of the bank buying government bonds .
In Portugal the PSI20 has closed down 2 % .
In Spain the IBEX 35 is down 2.2 % .
In Italy the FTSE MIB has closed down 4.3 %
The euro is down 1 % against the dollar today taking its losses against the greenback to 4.8 % for the week .
So far the euro has lost 11 % in 2010 ( thanks to Reuters for the figures ) .
The FTSE 100 , meanwhile , closed down 80.94 points at 5260.99 points , further unsettled by an 80 point slide on the DJIA in New York .
4.02 pm : The markets are wobbling again , and sterling is down below $ 1.50 as new fears spread that Greece 's bailout may not be a done deal after all .
The FTSE 100 has turned negative again , down 63 points at 5279 .
The catalyst appears to be a statement from the German opposition leader saying he will oppose the bill that is going through the German parliament .
Rick Wray will be bringing you more details ....
( Cheers Graeme , now go and get some sleep .
I hear you 'll be back in the office at some unGodly hour to cover the market 's reaction to the election )
Rick here : as the denizens of Westminster canvas the electrorate this side of the Channel , in Germany there is some political grandstanding going on in parliament .
Chancellor Angela Merkel does not need the support of opposition parties to get the country 's involvement in the Greek bailout into law , it would help to soothe an increasingly disgruntled public .
But the main German opposition party - the SPD - appears to have failed to reach an agreement with merkel on a joint resolution that was to be attached to the bill approving the deal for Greece .
Investor disquiet about the Greek situation - and potential contagion into other countries - is playing havoc with the markets .
Financial data from Thomson Reuters
Through the wonders of technology ( and the office 's Thomson Reuters screen ) here 's the day 's sterling / dollar trading chart .
3.07 pm : Time to look back at Greece .
Prime minister George Papandreou has given a passionate speech to parliament as it continues to debate the € 110bn bailout - and the austerity measures the country must adopt .
Papandreou told MPs that there was no time to lose :
" This is the time for change .
There is not a single day or hour to lose .
I take responsibility as prime minister for making the decisions I believe are necessary for my country and its citizens ...
I do n't care if this will be the only time I serve as
prime minister . "
Papandreou also touched on yesterday 's tragic scenes :
Neither stones , nor violence will remove us from ( EU ) supervision .
Instead they will throw us into even deeper crisis and disrepute .
2.35 pm : Trichet 's work is done , and the euro has clambered back to € 1.2726 .
The top line from this press conference seems to be the ECB 's refusal to indulge in quantitative easing .
Will the markets see that as a sign of confidence , or will it disappoint those who were hoping for firmer action to prevent the Athens crisis spreading ?
Gary Jenkins of Evolution does n't sound too convinced :
Well Mr. Trichet is going for the " crisis , what crisis ? " approach in the Q&A session of the ECB meeting .
I am not convinced that this denial of the problems facing European sovereigns is healthy .
It is also difficult to believe that they didnt even discuss the possibility of buying government bonds , but that is what Mr Trichet claimed .
However , if recent track record is anything to go by , that does n't mean that they wo n't be buying government bonds pretty soon .
I worry that Mr. Trichets performance today could well lead to a further sell off in government bonds , certainly the Euro is already suffering .
2.25 pm : Would n't we be better without the euro , asks one journalist .
Trichet looks a bit shocked at this kind of talk .
I do n't think there is any such sentiment in the Governing Council .
We , and the presidents and prime ministers I speak to , think that belonging to the euro has brought about an enormous amount of advantages .
But it also calls for responsible attitudes .
2.19 pm : The euro just fell through $ 1.27 .
We 're hearing that the bonds issued by weaker members of the eurozone are also coming under pressure following Trichet 's insistance that quantitative easing was not discussed by the ECB .
Geman Bunds look safer than ever .
2.10 pm : Does Trichet think there should be a European ratings agency ?
Some people have been calling for this in recent days , after America 's Standard & Poor 's agency sparked panic by cutting its ratings on Greece , Portugal and Spain .
Trichet sits on the fence ( something not tolerated at this UK polling station today )
I would say it is an open question , not only at the European level but at the global level , whether or not we have the optimum configeration , or constallation , of rating agencies .
As with many things , the more you have competition the better .
But , but I have no position of the governing council on whether or not we are calling for an European rating agency .
He also wins some points from his audience by insisting that Greece and Portugal are " not in the same boat .
That is obvious if you look at the facts and figures . "
2.06 pm : Another journalist asks whether the decision to tear up the collateral rules for Greek debt last weekend was unanimous .
Trichet does n't want to say no , but ca n't say yes .
Here 's his answer ( as I jotted it down ) :
We were unanimous in asking Greece to embark on a recovery programme .
We were unanimous in judging positively the recovery programme created with the EU and IMF
We were unanimous that there was a case for activating the loan that would , with the IMF , finance the programme .
Unanimity , Unanimity , Unanimity .
There was an overwhelming majority that we had to take the decision that was taken on Sunday , as a matter of consistency .
So not unanimous , then .
Trichet has also insisted that Greece will not default on its loans .
2.02 pm : David Tweed of Bloomberg wants to know why the ECB did n't consider buying government bonds .
Is it not going to take a decision , or has it already taken the decision ?
And what 's Trichet 's personal view on the need ( or otherwise ) for an orderly default mechanism .
Trichet says that " I think default , for me , is out of the question . "
And on quantitative easing , he is not budging .
" It was not discussed .
I have nothing more to say than that . "
1.50 pm : Question time .
A Bloomberg reporter hits Trichet with three questions : did the ECB discussed buying up government bonds to try and reassure the markets ; does the eurozone need a proper method to allow its members to default on its loans , and why did the ECB only relax the rules on accepting Greek bonds as collateral , rather than on all EU government bonds ?
Trichet responds that the ECB did not consider engaging in quantitative easing ( despite analysts suggesting some days ago that it should take the QE plunge ) , and that it certainly did not talk about mechanisms for allowing member states to default .
On the third question , Trichet says that the ECB was fully consulted and informed on Greece 's " very ambitious " recovery programme , and that the rest of Europe had asked the ECB whether it was right to activate Greece 's loans .
As such , it felt confident that it could break the rule book for Greece .
Another questioner wants to know whether " saving the eurozone " is now the ECB 's prime objective , rather than keeping inflation under control ( not a question you can easily imagine being asked a few years ago ) .
Trichet 's reply focuses on the ECB 's record to this date :
We are inflexibly attached to price stability .
It is our primary mandate .
It is what the people of europe have asked of us and we are credible in this respect .
We will post average inflation over the first 12 years of the euro , at below or close to 2 % .
Exactly in line with what we said 12 years ago .
This is a remarkable result .
Looking at my Reuters screen , the euro is falling again and threatening to go through the $ 1.27 mark .
1.42 pm : The ECB press conference is just starting in Lisbon - a chance for Europe 's top bankers to reassure the markets about the Greek crisis .
It looks pretty packed - photographers falling over each other to get a good shot of Jean - Claude Trichet and his colleagues .
Trichet starts reading out a prepared statement , saying that it is " appropriate " to leave rates at 1 % , with low economic growth helping to keep inflation in check .
He also says that :
Overall we expect price stablility to be maintained in the medium term .... inflation expectations remain anchored with the ECB 's aim of keeping rates below , but close to , 2 % .
Monetary policy will do all necessary to control price pressure in the medium term .
Trichet seems confident that the overall European economy is still recovering from the recession , but he admits that the Greek debt crisis is going to inhibit growth :
While adverse weather conditions dampened growth earlier this year , some strengthening took palce in the spring .
The governing council expects real GDP to expand at an encouraging pace ..... But the financial crisis will have a dampening effect on economic growth .
Trichet also said that the ECB continues to see the risks facing the economic outlook as " broadly balanced in an environment of high uncertainty " .
I 've heard more reassuring forecasts .
Trichet rounds up by urging Europe 's governments to get to grips with their burgeoning fiscal deficits as soon as possible , saying that the ECB does not believe that enough is being done .
He warns that putting " decisive action " off will only make the eventual task even harder .
1.20 pm : This video shows
Greece mourning the dead bank workers ( see above - you may have to refresh .....)
1.08 pm : The uncertainty over Europe 's debt crisis has sent some investors flocking to put their money into gold and the dollar .
This has helped to weaken other currencies , meaning that gold priced in sterling has hit a new all - time high .
GoldCore , a group of bullion dealers , have more information :
The euro has again come under severe pressure as contagion risks increase .
While all the focus is on Europe right now , similar risks face the UK and US economies and this is leading to significant safe haven demand for gold internationally .
Prices have risen close to a new nominal record against the British pound and the highest level in yen since February 1983 .
Gold is slightly higher in most currencies this morning and significantly stronger in British pounds and euros - trading at $ 1,185.00 , £ 786.03 and € 925.72 per ounce this morning .
Goldcore added that European nations must raise almost € 2 trillion ( $ 2.6 trillion ) within the next three years to refinance maturing bonds and fund deficits - which may prove a stretch too far :
The real risk is that the massive debts in various OECD countries are simply too big to bail out and neither the German government , individual governments or even the IMF itself can afford to bail out Greece , Spain , Portugal , Italy , Ireland or other debt ridden countries .
As the Greek debt crisis spreads to other European nations there is a real risk of the crisis creating an international monetary and financial crisis .
The Asian monetary crisis of 1998 looks quite tame and management compared with the risks today .
12.56 pm : Right , we 're had the ECB 's decision - it has left interest rates unchanged at 1 % ( so that rumour going round the trading floors this morning was bogus ) .
This has hit the euro , which dropped to a new 14 - month low of $ 1.2717 against the dollar .
It also nudged 84.32 p against the pound ( lowest since June 2009 ) .
We 'll get the good stuff after 1.30 pm when the press conference with ECB head Jean - Claude Trichet kicks off .
12.42 pm : While we wait for the ECB 's decision on interest rates , let 's flag up this topical image going round the City today .
( via FT Alphaville ) :
Live blog - Alphaville chart Photograph : guardian.co.uk
Generally , though , the feeling is that traders are still sitting tight before we get the results of today 's general election ( with bond markets opening at 1 am )
11.49 am : While we 're waiting for the European Central Bank 's decision on interest rates ( and there 's a rumour going round the City that they might announce a surprise cut ) , here 's some more info from Moody 's report on banking contagion .
On Ireland :
Ireland was one of the first countries to be affected by the abrupt bursting of the real estate bubble .
But it has also been among the first to take decisive actions , first by guaranteeing banks ' debt , and then by implementing the restructuring and recapitalisation plan , combined with very severe austerity packages imposed by the government .
The government and the banks now have to execute the plans and hope that the decisiveness and large acceptance of the austerity measures by the population will see them emerging stronger , albeit smaller , at the end of this process .
The UK :
With the economy facing challenges , the banking sector remains vulnerable : the highly leveraged economy is benefiting greatly from the benign interest rate environment , but the threat of a doubledip recession ( in case of a fiscal tightening that is too harsh ) or increased funding costs for the banks and the sovereign ( in the opposite case ) remain .
Many banks and building societies are also still vulnerable to the downside scenarios , especially in their domestic retail and real estate exposures .
Moreover , a deterioration in unemployment or higher interest rates are likely to further impact asset quality .
11.13 am : Some reassuring ( ish ) news from Spain in the last few minutes .
It successfully auctioned off € 2.3bn of government debt .
It had to pay a higher yield than in a similar sales in March - 3.6 % , up from 2.8 % - indicating that investors demanded greater rewards for holding Spanish debt until 2015 .
But the auction also attracted almost two - and - a - half as many bids as required , indicating that investors were n't too bothered by the downgrading of Spain 's credit rating last week .
The markets have taken this news well , with the FTSE 100 now up 19 points at 5361 .
Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities said the result was " a classic example of there being a price for everything " .
10.51 am : More action from Greece , where finance minister George Papaconstantinou has just given a speech urging parliament to adopt the austerity measures at the vote later today .
He warned that the only alternative was a complete financial collapse :
The only way for the country to avoid default and bankruptcy is to take the money from our European partners and the IMF .
It is very simple .
In order to get this money we have to agree on this 3 - year economic programme .
Papaconstantinou also acknowledged that other members of the eurozone face their own problems :
We are asking for money from countries which themselves have deficits , which themselves are the target of speculative attacks .
We have to convince them that we are putting our house in order .
10.37 am : Right , we 've got more information on those headlines from Moody's .
It has published a research piece called " Sovereign Contagion Risk -- Part I : Assessing the Impact on Banking Systems of Southern Europe , Ireland and the UK " .
The report looks at banks in three of the weakest members of the eurozone , Portugal , Spain , Italy and Ireland * , as well as Britain .
* who some analysts controversially group with Greece as the " PIIGS "
There 's a link to the report here , but I 'm afraid you have to have registered .
So here 's the highlights ....
• Each of these countries ' banking systems faces different challenges of different magnitudes " .... but contagion risk could dilute these differences and impose very real , common threats on all of them "
• Despite facing a fundamentally different situation compared with Greece , Portugal is now under heightened investor scrutiny , resulting in this week 's review for possible downgrade on the ratings of all Portuguese banks .
A key factor determining whether contagion risk continues in this case will be the market 's view of the likely success or otherwise of the recently agreed IMF and European Union support package for Greece .
Italy is another country where the banking system had been relatively robust so far , but where the major risk to its banking system could also be challenged by contagion risk should the market pressures on the sovereign increase .
• Contagion could potentially also spread to banking systems that have weakened from within , often due to excessive loan growth ( mostly Spain and Ireland and to a lesser extent the UK ) .
UK bank shares are down today , with RBS , Barclays and Lloyds all down by around 1.7 % .
Despite this , the FTSE has clawed back its early losses and is up 1 point .
10.13am : We 're seeing some alarming quotes from ratings agency Moody's on the Reuters screen , warning that the Greek crisis could hit weaker members of the eurozone - and even hit Britain 's banking sector .
Here 's the snaps :
MOODY'S ASSESSES RISK OF SOVEREIGN CONTAGION ON CERTAIN EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEMS
MOODY'S SAYS SOVEREIGN RISK CONTAGION COULD SPREAD TO BANKING SYSTEMS IN PORTUGAL , SPAIN , ITALY , IRELAND AND THE UK
More as we get it ...
10.00 am : Athens is in clean - up mode this morning after yesterday 's rioting .
Parliament continues to debate the highly unpopular austerity measures today , and we are expecting a vote on a draft bill to take place Thursday night .
As I mentioned at 7.59 am , many bank workers are on strike in protest at the three deaths yesterday , although some major branches in the centre of the capital are reported to be still open .
Today 's Greek newspapers show the extent of the shock over yesterday 's fatalities .
Here 's a flavour :
Kathimerini , a centre - right paper , warned that Greece could be " on the road to distruction " in a sombre , hard - hitting editorial :
Can a society self - destruct ?
Yes , it most definitely can and the way Greece is headed right now it is a very real possibility that it will .
Here we have a state and a society that allow a handful of nihilistic hooligans to torch the city and cause the deaths of three citizens .
We have the leadership of the country 's second biggest political party opting for a populist line of rhetoric and failing to answer a simple question on whether or not it will support the government 's economic recovery plan .
We see a society that is mad , and justifiably so , and we see it going down an ill - advised path .
Then we see the government , caught in the grips of panic , contributing to the populist fever and pouring more oil over the fire .
Greece is at the most crucial point of its post - 1974 history and whether we destroy ourselves or not , whether we go bankrupt or not , depends not just on our political leadership , but also on every single one of us individually and collectively .
Eleftheros Typos , a right - wing newspaper , said that the Greek government had left the capital " at the mercy of murderers " :
Three innocent , working Athenians lost their lives by brutal murderers .
In democratic regimes there is also the right to work .
This time again , police did not manage to disperse the hoodlums .
According to eyewitnesses , they were walking unchecked on both sidewalks of Stadiou street and they were left free to impose their own law , the law of the jungle .
Really , apart from condolences , what else will authorities utter ?
And Ta Nea , a centre - left paper , wrote that :
The glory of democracy is that it assures everyone 's right to express ideas , without limits .
Put simply , in democratic regimes freedom of speech prevails .
Yesterday 's tragedy in the centre of Athens took place because democratic rights were trampled on .
A protest march was subjected to violence .
Where Greece finds itself today , no government can reject the demands imposed by its lenders .
It could perhaps make the criterion of social justice more evident .
This is what protesters were demanding yesterday but the gruesome acts overshadowed this .
In Britain , the front page of the Daily Mail shows a Greek policeman in flames after being hit by a petrol bomb .
It calls the Athens protests an " election wake - up call for Britain " .
9.17 am : Some breaking news in from Germany , where politicians continue to debate the € 110bn rescue package for Greece ahead of tomorrow 's crucial parliamentary vote .
Frank - Walter Steinmeier , the head of the opposition Social Democrats party , has told reporters in Berlin that Angela Merkel 's government has opened talks about " increasing the financial sector 's participation " in the bailout .
That could help to ease the unpopular plan through the German Bundestag .....
8.45 am : The City seem to be taking today cautiously while it waits to see how the general election unfolds .
Interestingly , there 's been good demand for UK government debt this morning - despite predictions that the UK deficit will overtake Greece 's this year .
Andrew Roberts , head of European rates strategy at RBS , told Reuters there 's little sign of a ' gilt strike ' hitting Britain :
The massive flight to quality is ongoing : European bonds have n't really done much this morning and the UK has shown over the past two weeks that there 's a willingness to buy at these yield levels .
I still think gilts are very good value here and they will continue to rally .
Good news for whoever occupies Number 11 Downing Street next week .
8.10 am : The London stock market has opened , and once again shares are falling .
After dropping over 1 % at the very start of trading , the FTSE 100 is currently down 34 points at 5307 , a 0.6 % fall .
Germany 's DAX is down 0.4 % , while the French CAC has lost almost 1 % and Spain 's major market fell 1.3 % .
Those falls are bigger than expected , and it appears that traders got the wobbles as the markets were about to open .
David Buik , an experienced City analyst , explains :
A minute before the off the FTSE was scheduled to open up 22 points down at 5319 .
Then it was like a torrent - a burst dam with sellers falling over themselves to get short .
I have not seen that for some months .
It opened down 60 points !
but has now steadied down 34 at 5307 at 8.07am
7.59 am : Greek bank workers have halted work for 24 - hours in protest at the deaths yesterday of three people in the fire at a branch of the Marfin Egnatia Bank , during the general strike that brought Athens to a standstill .
The Greek labor union of bank employees , OTOE , called the strike to protest at the tragedy .
One 32 - year - old pregnant woman and two other people , a man and a woman between 30 to 40 years old , died from asphyxiation after petrol bombs were thrown into the branch .
Our Greece correspondent , Helena Smith , filed this report from the scene of the bank fire yesterday .
7.50 am : Looking at the foreign exchange markets , and the euro is taking another battering .
In the last few hours it has fallen another cent against the dollar , and just touched a lowpoint of $ 1.2752 - a fresh 14 - month low , I reckon .
Euro against the dollar .

It appears that Far East investors are becoming more concerned about the stability of the single currency .
As Clarence Chu , a trader with market maker Hudson Capital Energy in Singapore , told the Associated Press :
The market is realising the problem in Europe is not easy to fix .
The euro has also lost ground against sterling , to 84.7 p ( that means one pound is worth € 1.18 ) .
7.41 am : Europe 's major stock markets open in about 20 minutes .
Shares have fallen for the last two days , and the word in the City is that there 's little chance of a rally this morning .
Asian markets have dropped sharply overnight , with Japan 's Nikkei index just closing 3.3 % lower at a two - month low .
Japanese investors have n't had much chance to react to events in Europe this week as markets have been closed due to public holidays .
This just in from Ben Potter , research analyst at IG Markets :
There 's no let - up in concerns that the Eurozone debt crisis could continue to worsen and as a result equity markets across the globe remain under pressure .
The bull market always had to end somewhere and it looks like this could be the trigger with Gold and the US $ being big winners whilst even oil prices tumble - although the foray below $ 80 / barrel is looking to be short lived .
The ECB rate verdict will prove interesting later in the day as presumably Trichet and his team will look to calm the nerves of investors whilst the weekly jobless claims from the US will be scrutinised ahead of tomorrow 's non-farm payrolls .
I 've also got a note from Gary Jenkins of Evolution Securities .
Here 's a highlight :
All eyes and ears will be on the ECB today .
Not so much on their decision regarding interest rate policy but on Trichet 's statement and then the following press conference .
Will he claim that the markets are irrational and that is no need for any extraordinary measures to be taken by the ECB , or will he try and manipulate the markets by suggesting that they would be prepared to use all powers at their discretion to ensure solvency for sovereigns and the banking sector alike ?
The very fact that Bundesbank President Axel Weber stated yesterday that the Greece crisis does not merit " using every means " suggests that they are indeed at least considering every option .
7.29 am : The key scheduled event today is the European Central Bank 's monthly meeting to set interest rates across the eurozone .
We 'll get its decision on rates at 12.45 pm BST , but the real interest will be in Jean - Claude Trichet 's press conference shortly afterwards .
Expect Trichet to get a grilling about the Greek crisis , and whether the ECB is doing enough .
It has already dropped the minimum credit rating requirement for Greek government bonds used in its liquidity operations .
Now , though , some analysts speculate that the ECB may have to start buying government bonds in an effort to prevent confidence in the eurozone disintegrating further .
This is one of those occasions when the ECB goes ' on the road ' and holds its meeting in a European capital , in this case Lisbon .
That 's an interesting choice , given that Standard & Poor 's has already downgraded Portugal 's credit rating , and yesterday Moody 's threatened to follow .
7.15 am : Morning all , on a day when Europe 's financial crisis continues to dominate events in the world financial markets .
I 'll be blogging the latest events here for the next few hours .
We 're expecting interesting developments in Greece ( after yesterday 's riots ) , Germany ( where the Greek bailout continues to divide politicians ) , and here in London ( where traders expect another nervous day as Britain goes to the polls ) .
But on current form , this drama could flare up pretty much anywhere ....
Miriam Nelson , one of the leading U.S. exercise researchers , walks along the Charles River Esplanade in Boston .
She has written a new book T he Strong Women 's Guide to Total Health .
WHY EXERCISE ?
WHY EXERCISE ? •
Even a little physical activity is better than none at all .
•
More physical activity equals greater health benefits .
• Physical activity improves health regardless of body weight .
• Both aerobic exercise and strength training improve health .
•
Almost everyone benefits from physical activity , from children to older adults , pregnant and post - partum women , people with disabilities and members of every racial and ethnic group .
Source : The Strong Women 's Guide to Total Health by Miriam Nelson and Jennifer Ackerman COUNT YOUR STEPS COUNT YOUR STEPS
To increase your steps :
Take 100 steps around your office or home about every hour .
Program your computer to remind you when it 's time to take a break .
At the office , do n't e-mail or call anyone within 400 feet of you .
Instead , walk to that person and give him or her the message .
Take the long way to the restroom .
Take a couple of quick laps around the mall before you start shopping .
Walk one city block , about 200 steps .
Take a brisk walk during your lunch break for about 20 minutes or so , about 2,000 steps .
Walk four laps around the track at a high school , 2,000 steps .
Play basketball game for 30 minutes , more than 4,300 steps .
Low - impact aerobic dancing for 20 minutes , more than 2,500 steps .
Play soccer for 1 hour , 8,000 to 10,000 steps .
Benefits of a pedometer
Just because you 're busy does n't mean you 're active .
For the real test of your physical activity , get a pedometer .
Clip it to your waistband and wear it from the time you get out of bed until you go to sleep at night .
Keep track for two or three days , then use these " steps per day " numbers to figure out where you are : Fewer than 4,500 :
You 're very sedentary
4,500 - 5,500 : You 're sedentary
5,500 to 7,500 : You 're headed in the right direction but need to step it up
8,500 and up :
You 're active , stick with it A recent study found that people who wear a pedometer walk about 2,000 more steps a day or about another mile than those who do n't .
That burns about 100 extra calories a day .
If your goal is to lose weight , you probably need to work up to 12,000 or more steps a day .
Source : USA TODAY research Ladies , go take a hike .
Or at least a brisk walk .
Seriously .
It may lower your risk of stroke and prevent the dreaded middle - age weight gain , new research shows .
These findings join a long list of reasons why you should remain physically active .
TO IMPROVE HEALTH : How much activity is needed ?
WALKING : An hour a day keeps the weight away CUSTOMIZE A PLAN : Quiz yourself to find the right walking routine
And almost no one knows those reasons better than Miriam Nelson , 49 , director of the John Hancock Research Center on Physical Activity , Nutrition and Obesity Prevention at Tufts University in Boston and co-author of a new book , The Strong Women 's Guide to Total Health , with Jennifer Ackerman .
Nelson is one of the country 's leading researchers on exercise for women , and she co-chaired the committee that created the government 's 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans .
Many women complain about gaining weight during and after menopause , but a recent study found that some normal - weight women were able to prevent weight gain by doing an hour a day of moderate - intensity physical activity such as brisk walking .
Say what ?
An hour a day ?
That amount is doable for most women , Nelson says , but it takes effort to do more activity all day long , including while traveling to and from work , socializing and playing with your kids or grandkids .
Almost nothing is easier and cheaper than walking , but that means you need to get the lead out and put some spring into your step .
It 's not window shopping or taking a stroll in the park .
" Brisk means that you get warm while walking and that , while you can carry on a conversation , you can't just gab forever — you need to speak in shorter sentences , " she says .
" You should feel that your heart rate is elevated .
But it is not so intense that you are sweating a lot , unless , of course , it is hot outside .
And remember that exercise intensity is relative .
A brisk walk for one lady may be a stroll for another . "
Many women do less exercise as they age when they need to be doing as much or more , Nelson says .
" It may be that we are exercising the same number of times a week , but the actual energy used during that time may be less because we are n't working out at the same intensity or speed .
Also , we may be doing slightly less activity around the house with chores and gardening . "
Plus , many women do n't strength - train , which means they are losing muscle mass , says Nelson , who has done numerous studies and books on the benefits .
Lean tissue is what is metabolically active , she says .
Loss of this tissue contributes to slowing metabolism .
Weight training benefits the body in numerous ways , including improving bone , joint and muscle health ; boosting the immune system ; reducing depressive symptoms ; and improving sleep .
You can do as little as two sessions a week at a local fitness center or lift weights at home , she says , but make sure you 're challenging yourself and lifting enough weight .
Another great option : sit-ups , lunges , squats , push - ups and pull - ups , she says .
You can do them on your living room floor while watching the news or playing with the kids .
And now is certainly not the time to ignore your diet .
One of the major keys to avoiding middle - age spread : closely monitoring your caloric intake , Nelson says .
By far the biggest culprit of weight gain as people age is eating too much , she says , especially foods high in sugar and added fat .
OK , counting calories does n't take much time , but all that physical activity may sound like a lot to some women .
Yet Nelson , a busy working mom , practices what she preaches .
Most days she commutes by train to work and walks from the station to her office , which is about 25 minutes each way .
She runs for an hour every Wednesday , Saturday and Sunday and rock - climbs once or twice a week , either at the gym or outside depending on the time of year .
When the weather is nice , she swims and bikes once a week .
And she squeezes in a five - minute routine every other day that includes sit-ups , push - ups and pull - ups .
" I usually do these while I am watching the Red Sox play . "
Exercise is fun for her , she says .
" I am lucky ... in that I love to be active .
I find that because I sit most of the day , I really need to find the time to be active before and after work and on the weekends . "

The Kumbh Mela derives from Hindu mythology , which holds that gods and demons struggled over a pitcher , or kumbh , containing the drink of immortality .
As the gods raced toward heaven , drops of the sacred nectar spilled out onto four locations on the river : Allahabad , Ujjaink , Nashik and Haridwar .
Today , the Kumbh Mela is held every three years , rotating among the four cities , meaning that each hosts every 12 years .
Tucked in the foothills of the Himalayas , Haridwar is a challenging place to host tens of millions of people .
The Kumbh Mela is conducted in the middle of the city , and many pilgrims insist on taking their dip in the holiest spot , known as Har Ki Pauri , which is roughly the size of three Olympic swimming pools .
Authorities estimated that roughly 100,000 people an hour entered the water at Har Ki Pauri on Tuesday and Wednesday .
Many pilgrims believe that a dip in this spot on the appointed day will allow them to break the cycle of reincarnation .
“ This is Mother Ganga ! ” said Ramesh Varma , 23 , dripping wet in his underwear after a dip .
He traveled 10 hours by bus and then walked five hours to reach Har Ki Pauri .
“ The idea is that whatever sins you have are washed away .
This is a new beginning of your life .
This is what I feel . ”
Based on the position of the sun , the moon and Jupiter , Wednesday was judged the most auspicious day for the bath .
For days , pilgrims had poured into Har Ki Pauri until Wednesday morning , when the police cordoned it off to prepare for the arrival of the holy men .
Prahbu Nath Ohja , the officer appointed as liaison to the various sects , said authorities had hoped to avoid the problems that occurred in 1998 when the Kumbh Mela was last held in Haridwar : an angry scuffle broke out between the Juna and the Niranjani schools not long before the dip .
To protest , both groups boycotted the bathing .

This year , Officer Ohja organized meetings with the 13 different religious schools , or akharas , mediated talks between the Juna and Niranjani and got leaders from all groups to agree on a strict bathing schedule at Har Ki Pauri .

Your editor , like many LWN readers , deals in large quantities of electronic mail .
As a result , tools which can help with the mail flood are always of interest .
One tool which has been on the radar for some time is Archiveopteryx , a database - backed mail store which is meant to deal with high mail volumes .
Archiveopteryx does not seem to have a hugely high profile , but it does have a dedicated user base and a steady development pace ; Archiveopteryx 3.1.3 was released on March 10 .
The idea behind Archiveopteryx is simple enough : build a mail store around the PostgreSQL database , then provide access to it through the usual protocols .
Installation is relatively easy for a site which already has PostgreSQL in place ; a simple " make install " does the bulk of the work .
A straightforward configuration file allows for control over protocols , ports , etc. , and there is an administrative program which can be used to set up users within the mail store .
On the protocol side , Archiveopteryx supports POP and IMAP for access to email .
It can handle mail receipt directly through SMTP , but that is not normally how one would do things ; there is still value in having a real mail transfer agent in the process .
The preferred mode is to use the LTMP LMTP protocol to accept mail from the MTA ; there is also a command - line utility which can be used for that purpose if need be .
The installation instructions include straightforward recipes for configuring Archiveopteryx to work with a number of MTAs .
Archiveopteryx also supports the Sieve filtering standard and the associated protocol for managing scripts .
Those who set up a large - scale mail store can be expected to have some archived mail sitting around .
Archiveopteryx provides an aoximport tool for importing this email into the system .
Your editor found it to be overly simple and inflexible , though .
It is unable to create subfolders when importing an entire folder tree ( they must already be in place or the import fails ) , and it failed to import the bulk of the messages when working with a Dovecot - managed maildir mailbox .
The importer , perhaps , is like the Debian installer : users tend to only need it once , so it gets relatively little work once the basic functionality is in place .
Archiveopteryx works well as an IMAP server , and it is indeed fast when dealing with folders containing many messages .
Operations like deleting or refiling groups of messages go notably faster than with Dovecot on the same server .
On the other hand , your editor was unable to get the Sieve script functionality to work at all ; this is probably more a matter of incomplete configuration than fundamental problems with Archiveopteryx itself , but it was still a discouraging development .
That ties into the biggest disappointment with Archiveopteryx , though , which is probably totally unjustified : your editor would like this tool to be something that it is not .
If one is going to go to the trouble of storing all of one 's email into a complex database , it would be nice to be able to do fast , complex searches on that email .
That way , the next time it becomes necessary to , say , collect linux - kernel zombie posts , a quick search will do .
Archiveopteryx seems to have a search feature built into it , but actually using that feature appears to be limited to exporting messages with the aoxexport tool .
The IMAP protocol is not particularly friendly toward the implementation of fast , server - side searching , but it still seems like something better should be possible .
All that should not detract from what Archiveopteryx does well : store and serve email in large volumes using standard protocols .
As a tool for ISPs and for others needing to make email available to lots of users , it seems highly useful ; it is clearly meant to scale in ways that servers like Dovecot are not .
There is one remaining problem , though : the future of Archiveopteryx is not entirely assured .
For years , this program has been developed by a company called Oryx , which offered commercial support for it .
In June , 2009 , though , the developers behind Oryx announced that the company was shutting down , with the final closure expected in October of this year .
They say :
So we 're gradually closing down Oryx , BUT NOT ARCHIVEOPTERYX .
We 'll relicense it using either the BSD or Apache 2 licenses and continue making new releases for years to come .
We both feel obliged to keep the existing archives viable .
( The code is currently licensed under OSLv3 ) .
A sense of obligation may keep Archiveopteryx going for a while , but if it 's going to be something that people can count on for years into the future , it will have to develop a more active development community .
Archiveopteryx has the look of a solidly company - controlled project - the project 's git repository is overwhelmingly dominated by commits from the two principal developers .
Such projects are always at a bit of risk if the backing company runs into trouble .
But Archiveopteryx is free software , and highly useful free software at that ; it seems like its user community should be able to carry it forward .
History shows that America , when choosing between frugality and security , almost always selects the latter .
To paraphrase President John F. Kennedy , we ’ll pay any price and bear any burden to protect ourselves .
No doubt this was why the economic case against the Iraq invasion failed .
To many , the war debate seemed to pose a binary question : debt or mushroom clouds ?
And when it ’s a scuffle between money arguments and security arguments ( even dishonest security arguments ) , security wins every time .
Call this the Pay - Any - Price Principle — an axiom that has impacted all of America ’s wars , and now , most poignantly , its war on drugs .
When faced with criticism of budget - busting prosecution and incarceration costs , law enforcement agencies and private prison interests have successfully depicted their cause as a willingness to pay any price to imprison dealers of hard narcotics .
Of course , data undermine that story line .
In 2008 , the FBI reported that 82 percent of drug arrests were for possession — not sales or manufacturing — and almost half of those arrests were for marijuana , not hard drugs .
Fortunately , these numbers are seeping into the public consciousness .
Gallup ’s latest survey shows record support for marijuana legalization , as more Americans see the drug war for what it really is : an ideological and profit - making crusade by the Arrest - and - Incarceration Complex against a substance that is , according to most physicians , less toxic than alcohol .
Considering both the public opinion shift and the facts about marijuana , this should be the moment that drug policy reformers drop their budget attacks and flip the security argument on their opponents — specifically , by pointing out how safety is actually compromised by the status quo .
The good news is that some activists are making this very case .
Last week , students at 80 colleges asked their schools to reduce penalties for marijuana possession so that they are no greater than penalties for alcohol possession .
It ’s a request with safety in mind : According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , alcohol use by college kids contributes to roughly 1,700 deaths , 600,000 injuries and 97,000 sexual assaults every year .
By contrast , “ The use of marijuana itself has not been found to contribute to any deaths , there has never been a single fatal marijuana overdose in history ( and ) all objective research on marijuana has also concluded that it does not contribute to injuries , assaults , sexual abuse , or violent or aggressive behavior , ” as the group Safer Alternative For Enjoyable Recreation notes .
“ It ’s time we stop driving students to drink and let them make the rational , safer choice to use marijuana , ” said one student .
Now the bad news :
Not every reformer is on message .
In California , where polls show most citizens support cannabis legalization , The New York Times reports that backers of a legalization ballot measure “ will not dwell on assertions of marijuana ’s harmlessness ” but “ rather on [ the ] cold cash ” that pot can generate for depleted state coffers .
The problem is not these advocates ’ facts — California officials confirm that legal marijuana could generate more than $ 1 billion in tax revenue .
The problem goes back to the Pay - Any - Price Principle .
By downplaying the argument about giving society a safer alternative to alcohol , California ’s legalization advocates are letting drug warriors reclaim the language of security , to the point where even liberal Democratic Sen.
Barbara
Boxer ’s campaign now trumpets her opposition to the initiative on the grounds that “ she shares the [ safety ] concerns of police chiefs , sheriffs and other law enforcement officials . ”
A career politician , Boxer understands that if this battle reverts to the old tax - revenue - versus - safety fight , voters will choose safety .
In other words , she gets the Pay - Any - Price Principle .
To maximize this opportune moment for drug policy changes , every reformer must appreciate that principle , too — and finally confront it head on .

The March jobs report came out today , and showed weaker growth in U.S. employment numbers than hoped for .
American Observer has an excellent video presentation of America 's unemployment numbers from before the financial crisis up to January 2010 .
Darker colors represent much worse unemployment numbers .
George Alan Rekers , a founding member of the Family Research Council with James Dobson and Amandi Nicholi Jr. , was caught returning home from a European vacation in mid-April with a young man he hired on rentboy.com , the Miami New Times reports :
" On April 13 , the " rent boy " ( whom we 'll call Lucien ) arrived at Miami International Airport on Iberian Airlines Flight 6123 , after a ten - day , fully subsidized trip to Europe .
He was soon followed out of customs by an old man with an atavistic mustache and a desperate blond comb-over , pushing an overburdened baggage cart .
That man was George Alan Rekers , of North Miami — the callboy 's client and , as it happens , one of America 's most prominent anti-gay activists .
Rekers , a Baptist minister who is a leading scholar for the Christian right , left the terminal with his gay escort , looking a bit discomfited when a picture of the two was snapped with a hot - pink digital camera .
Reached by New Times before a trip to Bermuda , Rekers said he learned Lucien was a prostitute only midway through their vacation .
" I had surgery , " Rekers said , " and I ca n't lift luggage .
That 's why I hired him . "
( Though medical problems did n't stop him from pushing the tottering baggage cart through MIA . )
Yet Rekers would n't deny he met his slender , blond escort at Rentboy.com — which features homepage images of men in bondage and grainy videos of crotch - rubbing twinks — and Lucien confirmed it .
The paper adds :
" Rekers is a board member of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality ( NARTH ) , an organization that systematically attempts to turn gay people straight .
And the Huffington Post recently singled out Rekers as a member of the American College of Pediatricians — an official - sounding outfit in Gainesville that purveys lurid , youth - directed literature accusing gays of en masse coprophilia .
( In an email , the college 's Lisa Hawkins wrote , ' ACPeds feels privileged to have a scholar of Dr. Rekers ' stature affiliated with our organization .
I am sure you will find Prof .
Rekers to be an immaculate clinician / scholar , and a warm human being . ')
Rekers lectures worldwide , from Europe to the Middle East , on teen sexuality .
Yet during his ten - day sojourn with Lucien to London and Madrid , he had no lectures scheduled .
Both men deny having sex on the trip , and emails exchanged between the two before their jaunt are cautiously worded . "

UPDATE : Rekers responds to Joe Jervis on Facebook .
And here 's the rentboy .
Right - wing talker Glenn Beck took to his Fox News TV program last Monday night to deliver a rant about how President Obama has compiled something " almost like an enemies list " and how Obama is into " silencing opponents . "
The president 's tool of choice for this censorship ?
Network neutrality — the principle that ISPs cannot interfere with content .
" We are dealing with people who think they should rebel until they get their little kingdom like Satan did , " said Beck .
" You know what ?
Thanks , Mr. President , but I think we 're going to keep the Internet the way it is right now .
You know — or at least until people who are worshipping Satan , you know , are n't in office . "
The mechanism by which net neutrality will silence Beck and those like him remains murky , but the matter is clearly of great concern .
" The FCC also says they are marching forward , marching with a boot on your throat to — announcing plans to make Internet companies a public utility , " he said .
" Net neutrality — the court shot that one down , but they are going to make it a public utility now . "
Or again : " So now , the president wants to regulate the Internet , to help control all the misinformation out there .
He is going to do it with net neutrality .
Well , the court said no ...
So , now what they 're doing is the FCC is just going to — they 're going to make it a public utility .
The Internet .
Where are you , America , without the Internet ? "
The entire segment was driven by a recent Obama speech to graduates in which the president described the challenges of " coming of age in a 24/ 7 media environment that bombards us with all kind of content and exposes us to all kind of arguments , some of which do n't always rank that high on the truth meter . "
( Beck interjected , " Oh no , let 's ban that ! " when replaying the clip . )
" With iPods and iPads and Xboxes and Playstations — none of which I know how to work — information becomes a distraction , a diversion , " continued Obama .
Obama 's particular remark here might sound noncontroversial , but Beck has always claimed to see the secret truth lying beneath the banal words — in this case , that Obama will use the FCC to shut him down .
It 's not often that you hear about the inner workings of the FCC on cable news , especially coming from one of TV 's most popular talkers .
But Beck has mounted a one - man war on the FCC for the last 18 months , and he is determined to keep the " Marxists " from silencing him .
The Marxists are coming for me
Back in April , Beck railed against net neutrality , saying that " it 's about eliminating traditional , constitutional points of view from the public arena .
But that 's not the way it 's being billed .
It is about stopping debate .
But nobody will tell you that .
It 's about ending free speech .
It is about Marxism . "
Julius Genachowski , a former tech executive who worked with startups and media mogul Barry Diller , is pushing unfettered Marxism ?
The idea is risible , but Beck seems to believe that the FCC has been infiltrated by radical groups who will help to implement Obama 's secret censorship agenda .
Chief among these groups is Free Press , the nonprofit that pushed the FCC to censure Comcast for its P2P blocking .
( Genachowski 's press secretary previously worked for the group . )
" The FCC is being inundated by a special interest group ironically named Free Press , whose goal it is to limit America 's free press and freedom of speech , " said Beck in April .
" But you see , Free Press is n't about free speech .
It 's about Marxism .
It 's about silencing dissent .
Free Press is an oxymoron started by an oxy - Marxist .
His name is Robert McChesney .
In addition to cofounding Free Press , he 's also the former editor of The Monthly Review .
This is a self - proclaimed , independent socialist magazine — I do n't want to call names — an openly Marxist publication .
It sounds like a free press advocate so far , does n't it ? "
McChesney , a professor at the University of Illinois , certainly has no kind words for the current media system .
He 's been writing on the subject for decades , and sees US media outlets as " hype- commercialized " entities that distort the news .
Here 's how he described the problem of a corporate viewpoint in a 2009 interview :
One example of the way this prejudice influences the news is the way that the story of prisons in the United States is ignored in the press and other media .
The United States has a huge prisoner population .
Twenty - five percent of all prisoners in the world are incarcerated in the United States .
The only countries that have ever topped us in this are nations like Nazi Germany , Stalin 's Soviet Union and South Africa under apartheid .
But for our papers and TV , this is a nonstory , because the prisoners and their families are all poor , in the bottom 15 - 20 percent of the economic hierarchy .
They no more exist for the media corporations than the untouchables in India .
If the prisoners consisted of half the graduating class of Yale University , it would be the most important in history .
This kind of noncoverage undermines the most fundamental tenets of journalism .
Another classic example is the way trade issues are covered in the US press : trade agreements almost always are portrayed as tremendously beneficial .
Anyone who covers this story in a different way is considered an absolute fool or primitive .
In actuality , trade deals , negotiated under the direct guidance of monopolistic firms , are tremendously complicated , with thousands of specific exceptions tailored to corporate needs .
What you get in the press is corporate propaganda 101 .
If you read the news media , you think that the business world is run by genius entrepreneurs .
These sound like legitimate points of media criticism , but Beck picks up more colorful statements like this one from 2009 : " Advertising is commercial propaganda ; or , as the great critic James Rorty put it in the 1930s : ' advertising is our master ’s voice . '
Advertising is the voice of capital .
We need to do whatever we can to limit capitalist propaganda , regulate it , minimize it , and perhaps even eliminate it . "
McChesney makes such statements on a regular basis .
In the same interview , he railed against the telcos and cable companies .
They are not any good at the actual business of telecommunications service provisioning .
In the realm of Internet service provision , the telephone and cable companies play a parasitic and negative role .
They do nothing positive .
Their future is predicated on their ability to privatize the Internet and force people to use their version of it and pay exorbitant highway robbery prices for that use .
This applies to cell phones companies as well .
All of these firms rank in the bottom five of the most hated industries in the country , with the banks and other predatory lenders ...
At the moment , the battle over network neutrality is not to completely eliminate the telephone and cable companies .
We are not at that point yet .
But the ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phone and cable companies and to divest them from control .
McChesney favors much more public financing of media , which he sees as essential to democracy .
He also wants the Internet to become " a public utility , " which is apparently where Beck got the idea that he now ascribes to the FCC .
( The current push to apply a handful of " Title II " rules to the ISP industry has nothing to do with making them into some sort of public utility . )
" We want an Internet where you do n’t have to have a password and that you do n’t pay a penny to use , " said McChesney .
" It is your right to use the Internet .
The benefits of a public Internet are numerous .
It would end the digital divide , which remains a very serious problem in the US and worldwide . "

Formula 1 teams have admitted they are just a few days away from facing difficulties getting ready for the Spanish Grand Prix if the travel chaos caused by the Iceland volcano eruption does not ease .
With flying restrictions having been imposed across much of Europe as Eyjafjallajoekull continues to push ash into the atmosphere , F1 personnel face major problems getting back home after today 's Chinese Grand Prix .
Many flights out of Shanghai over the next 48 hours have been cancelled - and early indications from airlines have warned that they may even have to wait until early May for a next available seat .
If that is the case , then it could prove difficult to get personnel and equipment to Barcelona in time for the Spanish Grand Prix - but more worrying for the teams is getting their cars back after this race .
Although there are three weeks until the next race on the calendar , F1 teams think that any lengthy delay in shipping the freight back to the Europe could cause them trouble in getting the cars turned around in time for the next race .
It is also particularly troublesome for those teams - like Mercedes GP and Virgin Racing - that are planning on major upgrades for their cars for the next race which require extra work .
McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh admitted that if there was a delay of only a few days in the cars arriving back at the factory then it could cause complications for the Barcelona event .
" It has n't created the chaos yet - it 's caused a lot of speculation , " said Whitmarsh .
" There are lots of people trying to book Trans - Siberian train tickets , and other ways to get home , but I think we will all have a bit of fun getting home - one way or another .
" But we are not so much worried about the people because we will find a way home , but we have got to get the cars back , and we have n't had any word yet from the freight .
" These cars have been away and we 've been rotating chassis in fact , but the cars and equipment have been away for some time .
We are looking forward to getting that equipment back in the factory as quickly as we can , and make sure we service all the cars properly .
" We have a range of upgrades that we hope to put on for Barcelona so that could be a bit chaotic if we do n't get the freight back .
As for the people , we have demonstrated that we have incredibly resourceful people in F1 in general , just as everyone in this room will get home - it just might be a slightly more tortuous route than normal . "
When asked to clarify the timeframe by which it would start getting hard for his team , he said : " If it is a week or so , then clearly we have less than two weeks until the start of the next grand prix in Europe and it will become an issue .
" I think if we lose three or four days we can live with it , if we lose it for a week or beyond then it becomes challenging .
Again , we will find a way but that is a bigger concern than getting people home - we will get there . "
Virgin Racing 's technical director Nick Wirth said that any delay in getting his team 's cars back to England could mean his outfit will not have enough time to get two new fuel tanks ready for the Spanish GP .
" We do n't know when the freight is coming back , " Wirth told AUTOSPORT .
" We plan to convert the cars to the new specification for Barcelona , but we are very well advanced with one of them because we do n't have the spare chassis here as that is being converted back in the UK .
" But we 've got the issue of how the freight gets back from here and a very short amount of timescale . "
He added : " I have n't got the schedule in front of me , but I know everyone is very worried about it .
It is going to be a big push to get it done - we have the crash tests and extra things to do next week .
We have the bits in the UK , so that is not affected , but it is getting the second car done which is going to be the issue . "
With Spanish airports not currently affected by the volcano ash , should the delays start to look extensive then it is likely that F1 cars and freight would be shipped directly to Barcelona - with personnel travelling straight there rather than back home - to ensure the Spanish GP goes ahead .
The Cornell Daily Sun spoke to a source at UCLA , " John , " who deals weed on campus , about the upcoming November vote in California to legalize marijuana .
As a stoner , he likes it .
As a businessman , it 's bad news .
He 's worried that a saturated , legal market will kill his business , and that the heady days of being the cool guy on campus will soon be over .
He might even have to get a job .
Reporter Lucy
Li has the story :
John , a junior at UCLA , is worried .
For the past three years , he has been earning extra cash at school by dealing marijuana , and an if a new legislation passes in November , he might have to get a less lucrative job , such as filing books at the library .
" It 's time that the government legalized pot , " John , who declined to give his last name , said .
" I probably need to find something else to do , but in terms of pot itself , everyone already does it .
There 's no point in keeping it restricted . "
Some of the faculty at Cornell are into the idea and want guys like John put out of business :
To the extent that legalization would mean that the person selling you marijuana would no longer necessarily know where you can find heroin , this would be a very good thing , " Prof.
Emily Owens , PAM , who teaches a course on the economics of drugs and gangs , said .
But the nerds at Cornell have much bigger worries when it comes to getting high .
How on earth can they pass on that joint when they know for sure that their grades will suffer ?
Others have pointed to studies , such as one conducted by the RAND corporation , which show that smoking marijuana reduces math standardized test scores by 15 percent .
15 percent !
Eh , whatever .
You can worry about getting good grades and looking for those non-existent , post - college jobs later , Mr. College Weed Dealer .
There are far more pressing issues at hand .
Just ask John .

What a fascinating game !
I have to admit that , though this game has very simple rules , it can be quite challenging at times .
On top of that , the various units add some very interesting twists to an already interesting experience .
For example , the missile frigate 's ability to shoot around corners proved to be a unique advantage when playing as a Human , and the fact that the Klosian ion cannon can literally shoot all the way across the board forced me to keep my eyes open for possibilities .
Also , the first time a ring of the board failed to rotate when playing against the Sodinar , my jaw almost dropped !
( It was especially annoying because it left a repair platform fixed in place next to the Sodinar warp gate . )
I considered dropping my rating to 4.5 stars for the buggy AI , but then I figured that if the AI was always so smart , it would be a much more difficult game .
Since this perhaps the fourth - to - the - last space shuttle flight , right now is a great opportunity to see the marvelous sights of International Space Station and space shuttle Discovery flying close in tandem .
Depending on where you live , Tuesday evening or early Wednesday morning should provide a wonderful opportunity to see the two as the shuttle prepares to dock at 7:44 GMT ( 3:44 a.m EDT ) on April 7 , 2010 .
Before docking , the two spacecraft will be seen as separate but closely - spaced points of light .
The ISS is bigger , so will appear as the brighter object leading the smaller Discovery as they move across the sky .
After docking , the ISS will be brighter yet with the additional surface area provided by the docked shuttle .
Of course , your viewing ability will depend on cloud cover .
To find out if you ’ll be able to see spaceships in your area , there are a few different sites to check out :
NASA has a Skywatch page where you can find your specific city to look for satellite sighting info .
Spaceweather.com , has a Satellite Tracker Tool .
Just put in your zip code ( good for the US and Canada ) to find out what satellites will be flying over your house .
Heaven ’s
Above also has a city search , but also you can input your exact latitude and longitude for exact sighting information , helpful if you live out in the country .
Seeing the two spacecraft flying closely in tandem is a very unique and thrilling sight .
Good luck !
Americans Turn to Al - Jazeera for Raw Images of War , UA Study FInds
The author , a journalism professor , says U.S. media outlets may want to amend their ethical codes to allow more graphic art in order to provide a more comprehensive view of war .
By Jeff Harrison , University Communications
Sometimes gruesome war - time images of death and destruction are necessary for getting the whole story , even if you have to go to non-U.S. media to find them , according to a study by an associate professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Arizona .
Shahira Fahmy reported in a study published this month in Media , War and Conflict that visitors to the English - language Al - Jazeera website overwhelmingly support the network 's decision to run graphic images of war that are important pieces of information missing from Western media .
Fahmy , along with researcher Thomas Johnson of Texas Tech University , conducted two online surveys of Al - Jazeera Web users during November and December 2004 .
They found that most of those who use the Al - Jazeera English - language website are from the U.S. , Canada , the U.K and Australia .
Respondents indicated that they appreciate the graphic pictures of war they find on the site that they do n't see in mainstream media .
As one user explained :
" It ( Al - Jazeera site ) gives me a sense of what the grueling reality is on the ground .
U.S. media only reports strength of their troops and gives reports of deaths just in terms ofÂ numbers .
Whereas the pictures on ( Al - Jazeera ) presents the other side of the war ... the people impacted .
It presents the real human disaster that is happening . "
Findings suggested nine out of 10 of those surveyed support the broadcasting of graphic visuals , including that of the Iraq War and Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
Also , nine out of 10 said the news site provides visual information that cannot be found on CNN or other Western media , and half said the information is missing from Arab media .
One user said :
" CNN and other Western media have abdicated their journalistic responsibility to provide balanced , objective news and have instead become a voice of the government â not controlled by the government but controlled by the big multinational multimedia conglomerates that own them and by their own self censorship . "
Another respondent went further , claiming that American media is " controlled and censored by Bush and his cronies . "
Fahmy said the dilemma that photo editors face of whether a graphic photo of war and conflict would be too shocking to view gathered around the breakfast table might no longer hold true in the current media environment .
" Younger audiences , especially the âYouTube ' generation , seek graphic visual images in a far different way than audiences did before the World Wide Web , " Fahmy said .
" This has serious implications for the news media .
I think it 's time for media organizations to amend their ethical codes to allow for more graphic visuals in an effort to provide a more comprehensive and realistic view of war and conflict to U.S. audiences . "
The study is titled " When Blood Becomes Cheaper than a Bottle of Water : How Viewers of the English Version of Al - Jazeera Website Judge Graphic Images of Conflict . "

From Zach Fox at SNL Financial : Credit Suisse : $ 1 trillion worth of ARMs still face resets
Most of the resets are expected to occur through 2012 .
Between 2010 and 2012 , the chart indicates that $ 253.25 billion of option ARMs will adjust , while Alt - A loans totaling $ 163.71 billion will reset over that time .
Altogether , $ 1.010 trillion worth of ARMs will reset or recast during the three - year period .
...
" Option ARM resets are still pending .
…
Nothing much has happened yet because rates were so low that resets were pushed back , " Chandrajit Bhattacharya , head of non-agency RMBS and ABS strategy at Credit Suisse , told SNL .
...
[ Greg McBride , senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com ] was cool to the idea that option ARMs could flood the foreclosure rolls .
Option ARMs are less concerning , he said , because so many have defaulted already .
Indeed , the September 2009 Fitch Ratings report showed that 30 - day delinquencies on option ARMs sat at 46 % even though just 12 % had recast .
Further , option ARM foreclosure rates already match the sky - high subprime foreclosure rates .
Instead , McBride is worried about the prime ARMs posted in the Credit Suisse chart [ if interest rates rise - see article for discussion ] .
excerpts with permission

It is a little confusing .
You can't just look at a chart of coming recasts and know when borrowers will default .
The real problem for Option ARMs is negative equity , and the surge in defaults is happening before the loans recast .
But the recasts will matter too , since many of these borrowers used these mortgages as " affordability products " , and bought the most expensive homes they could " afford " ( based on monthly payments only ) .
When the recasts arrive , these borrowers will have few options .
Source : SNL Financial .
This graph shows the amount of ARMs resetting and recasting over the next few year .
Resets are not a huge worry right now - because interest rates are so low - but if interest rates rise , this could lead to more defaults in the future .
Recasts - when the loans reamortize - are a concern , although it is unclear how large the payment shock will be .
For borrowers with negative equity , any payment shock might be lead to default .
As I wrote last year in A comment on Option ARMs
" I do n't think the libertarians have it right when it comes to what the Constitution is all about . . . or when it comes to our history , " Santorum said at the Pennsylvania Press Club .
" When there are clear wrongs in society , injustice in society - sure , you handle it at the local level if you can - but when the local and state governments are in cahoots with the injustice , then the federal government has to step in and do something . "

CIL [ 1 ] is an OCaml library that parses and compiles C down to a simplified subset to ease different forms of static analysis .
Frama - C [ 2 ] augments CIL with a property specification language ( ACSL ) , which can capture design contracts for C functions .
Frama - C's Jessie plugin uses the Why [ 3 ] software verification platform , which itself uses several different SMT solvers and proof assistances to verify ACSL function contracts -- a very cool platform , I encourage anyone interested in the verification of C programs to check it out .
This Hackage library [ 4 ] is an interface to the Frama - C environment .
Specifically , it provides equivalent CIL and ACSL data types , allowing CIL and ACSL based analyzers to be written in Haskell .
The library installs a Frama-C / OCaml plugin , which dumps the CIL database into Haskell .
Internally , both the OCaml and Haskell sides of the interface are generated by a script ( GenCIL.hs ) that parses the contents of the CIL type definitions ( cil_types.mli ) .
Currently it only works for the most basic C programs .

Video : Elephant warning
Keeping out of the way of bees ( Image : OU / Lucy King )
Entire elephant families bolt when they hear recordings of trumpetings made by other elephants fleeing from bees .
This is the first demonstration that elephants may make specific sounds to warn of particular threats , although they have also been observed “ roaring ” when threatened by lions .
“ Six out of 10 elephant families fled from the loudspeaker when we played the ‘ bee rumble ’ compared to just two when we played a control rumble and one with the same call shifted to a different frequency , ” says Lucy King of the University of Oxford , who heads a team in Kenya investigating the meanings of elephant vocalisations .
The fleeing elephants also shook their heads violently , as if trying to deflect bees .

In 2007 , King and her colleagues demonstrated that elephants flee in terror from bees and from recordings of bees .
Last year , in follow - up trials , they successfully protected human settlements from encroachment by elephants by wiring beehives together as a fence .
Bee rumble
The latest findings open up the possibility of using recordings of the “ bee rumble ” as a deterrent as well , helping to prevent potential conflict between humans and elephants .
Elephants are terrified of bees because they can crawl into their trunk and sting them from inside it .
They also sting around the animals ’ eyes , leaving painful welts that take weeks to disappear .
The researchers believe that the rumbles alert both the elephant ’s family and neighbouring herds to the threat , and may teach young elephants that bees are dangerous .
Monkeys and birds are known to produce slightly different sounds to warn of different types of threat .
Putty - nosed monkeys native to Nigeria , for example , make different sounds to warn of leopards or eagles .
Journal reference : report to appear in PLoS ONE
When a boss goes undercover for CBS , he does n’t choose where he is going to work or who is going to train him .
In fact , in most instances , the nudge to participate in a reality TV show actually comes from the public relations department .
But what about the personal interactions between the “ Undercover Boss ” and his unsuspecting working - class employees ?
When Waste Management ’s president and chief operations officer , Larry O’Donnell , took the time to learn how an office manager balanced her four different positions , was that for real ?
“ Some people win the lottery ; I won Larry , ” said Jaclyn Pilgrim , 30 , of Rochester , N.Y , who was promoted as a result of the day she spent training O’Donnell on the four jobs she was juggling when he appeared at the High Acres landfill in Fairport , N.Y , pretending to be a first - day trainee being followed by cameras for a documentary .
“ That ’s better than anything for me because who gets to have a relationship where he calls me and asks me how I am , or I call him and say , ‘ I sold this today . ’
Who gets to have that kind of relationship with a COO ? ”

CBS also has won big with this wish - fulfillment reality show , which is averaging 18.7 million viewers and , as the season ’s most - watched new series , was renewed on March 9 for a second cycle .
Its timely premise is about enlightenment for corporate bosses , but it ’s striking a chord more because the little people seem to be benefiting .
Whether it ’s a well - deserved promotion or an all - expense - paid vacation , “ Undercover Boss ” is recognizing unsung heroes who probably would have gone unnoticed otherwise .
“ We wanted the show to be transformational for the company , the boss , and for the people the boss worked alongside , ” said executive producer Stephen Lambert .
“ On the one hand , trying to see how the company could be better by viewing it from the front line without people realizing that they were the boss .
But the second part of the mission was always to identify the people who were doing a particularly good job and maybe sometimes in difficult circumstances . ”
In separate interviews , Pilgrim , White Castle employee Jose Gonzalez , 17 , and 7 - Eleven night driver Igor Finkler , 48 , said they were approached by producers about appearing in a documentary about their company and then were observed working for a day before the chief executive appeared for duty .
When the production company asked Gonzalez ’s parents for permission to film their son , he said , his mother was skeptical and wondered what he would get out of it .
“ I told her , ‘ It does n’t matter if I get anything or not .
If they need help or they want me to do something like this , I ’ll do it , ’ ” Gonzalez said .

As Gonzalez and White Castle owner David Rife spent a day together , cleaning the restaurant , stocking supplies , taking out orders and removing trash , the boy shared his dreams of being a chef and related that he was already enrolled in culinary classes .
After Rife revealed himself as the big boss , he gave Gonzalez a $ 20,000 scholarship , making the teen the first in his family to go to college .
Although he was pleased with the way he was portrayed on TV , Gonzalez has been dealing with the fallout since the episode aired .
“ A lot of my friends and my uncle have been saying things like , ‘ Hey , cry baby , how much money did you get ? ’ ” he said and laughed .
“ I ca n’t believe I cried on TV . ”
Similarly , 7 - Eleven ’s chief executive and president , Joseph M. DePinto , saw promise in Finkler , a Russian immigrant who earned a master ’s degree in his country and served as a manager there but has been working as a night shift driver at 7 - Eleven for 11 years .
After they filmed their episode , DePinto brought Finkler to L.A. to attend a presentation and tour some stores .

“ I realize now that he asked me a lot of questions to see if I have the potential or not , ” Finkler said .
The answer came later , when Oprah Winfrey handed Finkler keys to his own 7 - Eleven franchise on her show .
The store in Dallas is scheduled to open May 10 .

The Digital Millennium Copyright
Act serves many purposes , some of which are good , but certain parts of it are ripe for abuse .
The infamous DMCA takedown notice is at the top of anyone 's list of most - abused parts of the act .
These notices are meant to make it easy for content owners to have violations removed , and they do .
But the notices also make it easy for anyone to try and silence criticism or stifle angles they simply do n't like , even if the party in question is working perfectly within the confines of fair use .
Over the course of our coverage here at Ars , we 've seen a number of DMCA takedown cases that were just plain lame .
And , although there are plenty more lame cases that have happened in the world , we thought we would highlight some of our " favorite " ones to show how the DMCA takedown system can be used in an attempt to control content instead of merely enforcing copyrights .
Plus , these examples just make us chuckle at the absurdity .
Psychic versus paranormal unbelievers
" Paranormalist " Uri Geller has always been somewhat of an eccentric dude — and how could he not be , having made claims that aliens gave him psychic powers and the ability to bend spoons with his mind ?
But when someone uploaded a clip to YouTube of a 1993 PBS piece showing how Geller 's tricks could be easily produced , Geller was unable to use his mind to make the criticism disappear .
So , he resorted to the next best thing : DMCA takedowns .
YouTube not only removed the video , it also suspended the account of the person who uploaded it for two weeks before the counter - notice was processed .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation eventually got involved by filing a lawsuit against Geller — the magician was not the copyright owner to the video and was not otherwise authorized to act on behalf of the owner ( PBS ) .
Additionally , Geller could only lay claim to three seconds of the video , which the EFF argued qualified as fair use for criticism purposes .
Geller tried to sue back , but eventually the two parties settled their dispute .
Part of the settlement involved Geller 's company agreeing to license the disputed footage under a non-commercial Creative Commons license .
Cowboys versus animal rights activists
Since 2006 , the animal rights group SHARK , or SHowing Animals Respect and Kindness , has filmed rodeos in an effort to show the ways in which they feel rodeo animals are routinely " brutalized , maimed , and shocked . "
The group began making use of YouTube to help spread its message about cruelty to animals , but that did n't sit well with the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association .
As it turns out , the PRCA had sanctioned several of the events caught on camera and was unhappy with the bad publicity it was receiving thanks to SHARK 's YouTube uploads .
The cowboys began filing takedown notices with YouTube , claiming that the material was copyrighted .
This was a tenuous argument at best — although PRCA was involved in setting up some of the events , the footage itself was taken by SHARK and was therefore copyrighted by the animal rights group , not PRCA .
In fact , SHARK filed a lawsuit against PRCA for its own violations of the DMCA .
The group said the cowboys ran afoul of the provisions , stating that anyone who " knowingly materially misrepresents " a case of supposed infringement would be liable for damages to the alleged infringer .
The two groups eventually settled their differences , however , with PRCA agreeing to fork over $ 25,000 to make the case go away .
PRCA also agreed to take any future copyright claims directly to SHARK and that it would enforce any " no taping " policies at its events consistently — meaning they can't claim critics have violated the " contract " printed on rodeo tickets while allowing other attendees to record video .
NFL versus law school professor
Brooklyn Law School professor Wendy Seltzer is no stranger to the DMCA and copyright law — she teaches students about the ins and outs of such laws on a regular basis .
That 's why , when Seltzer received a DMCA takedown notice from the National Football League over a YouTube video she made of a class presentation , she was not amused .
The clip she was using was the ( infamous ) copyright notice that the NFL displays at the beginning of its broadcasts , warning viewers not to misuse content from the game they 're about to watch .
Seltzer took exception to this claim — as it clearly makes no concession for fair use — and wanted to show her students how content owners are beginning to exaggerate their rights .
In a fit of irony , the NFL sent a takedown notice to YouTube over the clip , to which she responded with a counter - notification explaining that the clip qualified as fair use for education purposes .
A bit of back and forth later and the NFL found itself stuck between a rock and a hard place — because it had sent yet another takedown over the same video without acknowledging fair use , Seltzer argued that the NFL had violated a part of the DMCA that bars " knowingly materially misrepresent[ing ] that material or activity is infringing .

According to Seltzer , the proper response would have been for the NFL to obtain a court order against her to keep the video offline , not send another takedown .
The video was finally restored once and for all , though the excuses provided by the NFL's PR team for not obtaining a court order were not enough to fully satisfy Seltzer .
Warner Music versus copyright reform advocate
Copyright reform advocate and political activist Larry Lessig has long been a heavy critic of DMCA abuse .
That 's why , when Warner Music issued a takedown over one of Lessig 's own presentations , the world was left saying " oh no you di'int !
This takedown , however , did not seem to fall under the same circumstances as some of the others we have discussed here .
Unlike Uri Geller or the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association , there was no criticizing of Warner Music going on .
Instead , Lessig 's presentation likely ended up being taken down thanks to the music label 's sweeping efforts to send takedowns over everything after YouTube licensing negotiations failed in late 2008 .
( The companies have since struck a new agreement . )
Lessig 's presentation did use clips of Warner Music 's songs , though he clearly believed they fell under Fair Use .
Since then , Lessig 's presentations have been subject to numerous other DMCA takedown notices — often at the hands of Warner Music — which he diligently continues to fight with counter - notifications to get his videos back online .
Music label versus dancing baby
Dancing babies are n't just reserved for ' 90s Internet meme nostalgia — they 're part of new millennium YouTube lore as well .
What parent would n't want to put a ( to them ) hilarious video of their kid bouncing around to a Prince song on the Internet for all to see ?
That 's exactly what Stephanie Lenz did , only to find herself on the wrong side of Universal Music Group .
The music label took issue with Lenz 's video of her 18 - month - old son dancing to a the Prince song " Let 's Go Crazy , " which blasted from a stereo in the background ; so they sent a DMCA takedown notice over it .
In some parts of the video , the song ware barely even recognizable , but that did n't stop UMG from targeting the toddler .
The video disappeared from YouTube , but the EFF got on the case with Lenz to push back .
Lenz not only responded with her own counter - notification , but she also sued UMG , arguing that the clip was " self - evident noninfringing fair use " and that UMG sent the notice in bad faith .
Universal argued that , even if the clip was fair use , the notice was still sent in good faith .
After plenty of back - and - forths , Lenz eventually won a summary judgment in the case and her video is back online .
That 's not all , folks
There are plenty of other examples of individuals or companies abusing the DMCA to quash criticism , fair use , or just plain random uses of content , which is not what the law was meant for .
Even the examples we highlighted here are relatively common .
Do you know of any more absurdities that we can add to the roster ?
WASHINGTON —
When the last swords in the great health care clash finally clatter to the ground , and Congressional Democrats head home to savor their victory , a question that may still nag at them — and the party ’s liberal base — is whether they missed a last , best chance to create the government - run insurance plan known as the public option .
For many Democrats , the public option was the be-all and end - all of the health care debate for much of the past year .
Even after President Obama , in a speech to a joint session of Congress in September , said he could live without it , Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats battled to keep it in the legislation .
But Wednesday night , as the Senate stood on the verge of approving the budget reconciliation bill with the final health care revisions , Democrats resisted a late , last round of pressure from liberal advocates to include the public option in the legislation , saying they were willing to take their winnings and call it a day .
In a show of self - restraint , the Democrats said they had agreed among themselves to resist the temptation to make any amendments and would work to approve the bill without any changes that would require it to be sent back to the House for another vote .
The public option , they said , could wait for another day , another vote , another fight — even though the parliamentary process playing out on the Senate floor gave them a rare chance to enact it with a simple majority , a chance unlikely to come around again soon .

Hey folks , you can stop sending me the “ boobquake ” alert .
Consider me apprised .
What ’s a “ boobquake ” ?
A reaction to some dude ’s proclamation that saucy women showing cleavage are responsible for the recent catastrophic earthquakes , “ Boobquake ” is blogger Jen McCreight ’s idea of “ a boob joke . ”
Damn , those are always hilarious !
McCreight ’s boob joke was this : since that fundamentalist dude has a misogynist fantasy idea about the power of mammary glands over global seismic activity , let ’s show him he ’s wrong !
McCreight calls for all women to wear their most cleavagey outfit at an appointed hour , then sit back and wait for the Big Quake .
When it does n’t come , we can all have a big laugh at the fundamentalist dude ’s expense !
McCreight was surprised when about 47.876 million people joined her boob joke on Facebook , largely in the shape of helpful dudes offering to photograph the event .
Says McCreight , wishing to deflect feminist fury :
“ I just want to apologize if this comes off as demeaning toward women .
To be honest , it started as silly joke that I hurriedly fired off since I was about to miss the beginning of House .
I never thought it would get the attention it did .
If I would have known , I would have spent more time being careful about my wording . ”
We ’ve all said stupid things on the Internet .
But when you say stupid things about encouraging women to protest oppression by capitulating to Dude Nation ’s fondest desire , and then blame it on a compulsion to watch a stupid misogynist TV show , all I can say is , ewww .
Naturally , because it involves a woman urging other women to show us their tits , McCreight is being interviewed by national and global media .
Ewww .
I conclude that McCreight omitted , in her haste to watch the beginning of , perhaps , “ American Idol , ” to proof - read her statement , forgetting to change the spine - wrenching “ if I would have known ” to the economical and correct “ had I known . ”
Double - ewww .

What a week it has been for the Republican hopefuls backed by the ultimate Republican hopeful hereself , Sarah Palin .
Palin 's endorsement is seen as something of great value among Republicans .
But the string of unfortunate events that occurred not long after Palin has given her support makes one wonder if there is n't a " reverse Midas touch " effect : that rather than turning things to gold , Palin instead turns everything she touches into ... well , the opposite of gold .
In the last seven days we 've had Rand Paul , endorsed by Palin when other party elders were backing his rival .
Paul won but his subsequent implosion in a TV interview put the party in a bad light .
Then there 's Nikki Haley in South Carolina , publically backed by Palin , who now has a local blogger claiming they had a " physical relationship " .
And just last Friday Palin stopped off in beautiful Idaho to voice her support for red-meat Republican congressional hopeful Vaughn Ward .
And guess what ?
Now we discover that not only is Ward remarkably stupid – he does n't appear to know that Puerto Rico is part of the United States – but he 's also being accused of plagiarism , with good reason .
Which is a great combination .
How stupid ?
Dumb enough to appear to plagiarise the most famous speech in US politics in the last decade : Barack Obama 's 2004 Democratic convention speech , the one that made his name and started him on the path to the White House .
Steal from the best is an old motto , but try not to make it so obvious :
Here 's what Obama said in 2004 : " As we stand at the crossroads of history , we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us .
If you feel the same urgency that I do , if you feel the same passion that I do , then I have no doubt the people will rise up in November and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness , a brighter day will come . "
And here 's what Ward said in January : " As we stand on the crossroads of history , I know we can make the right choice and meet the challenges that lay before us .
If you feel the same urgency and the same passion that I do , then I have no doubt that our voices will be heard in November .
And our country will reclaim its promise and out of this darkness , a better day is on the horizon . "
At stake is the Republican nomination to take on the Democratic incumbent Walt Minnick , who is facing a tough fight to hold on to his congressional seat in a strongly Republican state .
Local newspaper the Spokesman - Review had earlier revealed that Ward 's website had large sections cut and pasted from other Republican candidates ' policies , such as :
Half of his statement on health care matches a Jan 7 , 2009 Wall Street Journal article by US Rep .
Tom Price , R - Georgia .
And his entire statement on " Definition of Marriage / Family Issues " matches a statement posted on the website of US Sen Jim DeMint , R- SC , with such minor changes as substituting " I believe " for " Sen Jim DeMint believes . "
In response Ward fired his campaign manager and denied knowledge of his website content .
More recently , Ward found himself confused about the status of Puerto Rico , where his opponent Raul Labrador was born .
During a debate between the two , Ward appeared to describe the territory – part of the US – as a " foreign nation " .
Anyway , it 's primary day in Idaho today , so we wo n't have long to wait to see if Ward is the Republican nominee .
is about the love for dancing , traveling and writing , and what better way to share those experiences than showing you around ?

The Brazilian rancher accused of ordering the murder of an American missionary has been sentenced to 30 years in prison , reports the Associated Press ( AP ) .
Vitalmiro Bastos de Moura on Monday received the maximum sentence for the killing of Dorothy Stang , a 73 - year - old nun who was gunned down in 2005 while fighting for the rights of small farmers .
Jurors in Belem , the capital of the Amazon state of Pará , reached the decision after 15 hours of deliberations .
Dorothy Stang , 1931 – 2005
It was the third trial for Moura for the crime .
He was initially found guilty but was then acquitted in an automatic retrial .
The acquittal was overturned last year on a technicality , according to the AP .
The trial was widely seen as a test of the perceived impunity of powerful landowners in the Brazilian Amazon .
More than 1,200 people have been killed in land conflicts in Brazil over the past 20 years yet none of the organizers of the killings had gone to prison until now .
Stang , a nun from Ohio who spent more than 30 years fighting for land rights for poor settlers in the Amazon , was murdered by a contract killer in February 2005 in the Brazilian state of Para .
Stang , 73 , was shot six times with a revolver as she read from the Bible .
Stang was working with the Pastoral Land Commission , a Catholic Church group that lobbies for land reform in Brazil and fights for land rights for the poor , when she was gunned down .
Stang ’s murder was a tipping point in the heated battle between the rural poor and large landowners in the state of Para .
The federal government responded to her killing by sending two thousand armed troops into the state .
Later Brazil established several protected areas in contested forests and proposed a land - use permit system for selling concessions to loggers who agreed to set side land for settlers and indigenous groups .

20 years ago the Amazon lost its strongest advocate

Twenty years ago ago today , Chico Mendes , an Amazon rubber tapper , was shot and killed in front of his family at his home .
He was 44 .
His assassination in Xapuri , a remote town in the Brazilian state of Acre , would serve as a catalyst that led to the birth of the movement to protect the Amazon rainforest from loggers , ranchers , and developers .
But the movement has stalled .
Some would even say it has failed : since 1988 more than 348,000 square kilometers ( 134,000 square miles ) of Amazon rainforest have been leveled .

Wildcat strike of brick workers in Turkey wins pay increase .
Brick workers in several factories in Diyarbakır ( the biggest city in the southeast Kurdish region of Turkey ) went on a wildcat strike in a dispute over wages .
Working for a fixed wage for 4 years ( around 350 euros and 16 hours of work in a day ) without any pay rise , workers of the 11 brick factories in the city went on an unofficial strike on 16 April .
It seems that the strike expanded " spontaeously " .
Negotiations between workers ' delegates and bosses under the supervision of jandarme general ended when the bosses proposed a 7.5 % wage increase .
The workers threatened to march towards the governorship 19 April if their demands were not met .
Apparently after getting a 28 % increase workers went back to work on April 21 .
FOR a moment it seemed as though a mortal threat to businesses in Zimbabwe had been lifted .
Now the usual lack of clarity has been restored .
Would - be foreign investors and local businessmen alike do not know what to do next , except to hold their breath .
Two months ago Zanu - PF , the party of Robert Mugabe , who marked 30 years in power on April 18th , unilaterally announced regulations to put into effect an “ Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act ” .
The law , passed two years ago but not previously enforced , required all firms worth more than $ 500,000 to be majority - owned by “ indigenous Zimbabweans ” — and to show plans within six weeks for compliance within five years .
Under Mr Mugabe 's bluntly racist conception of nationality , white Zimbabweans are excluded , since the law defines “ indigenous ” as those “ disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on the grounds of his or her race ” before independence in 1980 , plus their descendants .
So any white Zimbabwean , let alone a foreign firm , is liable to be prevented from wholly owning any smallish enterprise or farm .
Whites are barred altogether from some sectors , including bakeries and beauty parlours .
Among the foreign firms that would be hit are Barclays Bank and Standard Chartered , two British banks that are big in the region , as well as Nestlé , the Swiss - based food giant , and Impala Platinum Holdings ( Implats ) , one of the world 's biggest producers of platinum , which is headquartered in South Africa but is one of Zimbabwe 's prime mining companies .
Just ahead of a deadline for companies to submit their plans for compliance , the Movement for Democratic Change , the former opposition party that is locked in an unhappy national unity government with Mr Mugabe 's lot , said that the cabinet had pronounced the regulations “ null and void ” .
Rubbish , said Saviour Kasukuwere , a Zanu - PF man who is the minister in charge .
He insisted that there would merely be further “ consultation ” before the law is put into action .
Even the delay gave foreign and local white business people a glimmer of hope that they could go on running their own shows .
Zanu - PF would be loth to admit publicly that it was backing down over anything , least of all in the face of foreigners and whites .
Mr Mugabe says that indigenisation “ recognises our sovereign right of ownership ” .
Ultimately , he says , his law will prevail .
The next step is for a parliamentary committee to consider the regulations , so far without a deadline .
But the MDC 's slim majority in the lower house , which it won in a general election two years ago despite rigging and intimidation , is steadily being whittled away by deaths , arrests and criminal convictions which mean that a growing number of the party 's MPs can not vote in parliament .
And even if the indigenisation rules were suspended or scrapped , that would be no guarantee of security .
Earlier this month a South African - owned game ranch was invaded , even though a new bilateral investment - protection treaty between the two neighbouring countries ' governments had just come into force .
In any event , the indigenisation debate and Zanu - PF 's capriciousness hardly encourage foreigners — let alone white citizens — to invest .
Despite Zimbabwe 's mineral riches , most big mining firms have stalled future plans .
And the uncertainty is spiking the efforts of Tendai Biti , the MDC man who is the unity government 's finance minister , to secure the foreign cash the country sorely needs to recover from Mr Mugabe 's ruination of the economy .
Some say this is part of Zanu - PF 's plan to fight the next election , perhaps as early as next year , on its usual populist platform , blaming the West for all Zimbabwe 's ills .
It is certainly wary of letting the MDC take the credit for a recovery .
Peter Molyneux is known for being incredibly enthusiastic about his games , often to the point of hyperbole .
Still , when he boldly claims that Fable III will have " the greatest cast that any computer game has ever had , " it 's hard not to be intrigued .
Molyneux was talking up the Fable III voice cast in an interview with IGN , and while his statement may be extreme , there 's no doubt that the game is carrying some star power .
John Cleese will play the hero's butler , and Stephen Fry is returning to his role as Reaver .
Apparently , it is n't just the big names that make the cast great .
" How we 're using these characters is very much dependent on how you play the game , " Molyneux said .
" This is not like traditional dialogue – we went into a studio with John Cleese and I think he'd never done anything like this ever before , because we had to say ' if the player is like this , how are you going to react ' .
It was a very interesting process . "
Unfortunately , gamers will still need to wait until late 2010 to get their hands on Fable III and judge the truth of Molyneux 's claims for themselves .
AMERICANS are an optimistic lot .
If there is one thing they believe in above all , it is the ability to move ahead .
In poll after poll , a majority reject the notion that success is determined by forces beyond their control .
In early 2009 , hardly a sunny period , 71 % still agreed that hard work and personal skill are the main ingredients for success .
A high degree of social mobility has always defined American culture , from the work of Alexis de Tocqueville and Horatio Alger to the remarkable story of Barack Obama himself .
But the reality for most Americans is becoming more complicated .
The recession came at the end of a period marked by record levels of inequality .
Many Americans , lacking true upward mobility , bought its trappings , such as a bigger house or better car .
Disaster duly followed .
As a result , American optimism has been pierced by doubt .
In a new poll for The Economist by YouGov , 36 % of respondents said they had less opportunity than their parents did , compared with 39 % who thought they had more .
Half thought the next generation would have a lower standard of living , double the share that thought living standards would rise .
As the country recovers , two problems cloud its future .
Rates of social mobility are unlikely to grow .
Inequality , however , may widen even further .
These trends have been building up for years .
In 1963 John Kennedy declared that a rising tide lifts all boats .
Indeed , in 1963 this was true .
Between 1947 and 1973 , the typical American family 's income roughly doubled in real terms .
Between 1973 and 2007 , however , it grew by only 22 % — and this thanks to the rise of two - worker households .
In 2004 men in their 30s earned 12 % less in real terms than their fathers did at a similar age , according to Pew 's Economic Mobility Project .
This has been blamed on everything from immigration to trade to declining rates of unionisation .
But the driving factor , most economists agree , has been technological change and the consequent lowering of demand for middle - skilled workers .
The most highly skilled , meanwhile , have stuffed their pockets happily .
Between 1970 and 2008 the Gini coefficient , a measure of income inequality , grew from 0.39 to 0.47 .
In mid-2008 the typical family 's income was lower than it had been in 2000 .
The richest 10 % earned nearly half of all income , surpassing even their share in 1928 , the year before the Great Crash .
Compared with people in other rich countries , Americans tend to accept relatively high levels of income inequality because they believe they may move up over time .
The evidence is that America does offer opportunity ; but not nearly as much as its citizens believe .
Parental income is a better predictor of a child 's future in America than in much of Europe , implying that social mobility is less powerful .
Different groups of Americans have different levels of opportunity .
Those born to the middle class have about an equal chance of moving up or down the income ladder , according to the Economic Mobility Project .
But those born to black middle - class families are much more likely than their white counterparts to fall in rank .
The children of the rich and poor , meanwhile , are less mobile than the middle class's .
More than 40 % of those Americans born in the bottom quintile remain stuck there as adults .
Family background is not insurmountable , explain Isabel Sawhill and Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution .
In particular , earning a degree and marrying before having children can help someone climb to a higher rung .
However , family background influences the likelihood of education and marriage ( see article ) .
How rising inequality affects social mobility is still unclear .
Those born since inequality started to rise sharply are only just now becoming adults .
However there are some troubling signs according to two papers to be presented at the Tobin Project , an alliance of scholars , this month .
Christopher Jencks of Harvard University finds that income inequality has been accompanied by a widening gap in college attendance .
Ms Sawhill argues that a rising correlation between income levels , likelihood of marriage and level of education will make society more stagnant .
The recession , meanwhile , may have exacerbated trends in inequality .
The capital markets , points out Timothy Smeeding of the University of Wisconsin , have recovered more quickly than the housing or labour markets .
This is troubling for the poor and the middle class , since homes represent a greater share of their wealth .
Unemployment has been concentrated in America 's lower ranks .
As the rich recover , poor and middle - class people may lag behind .
Young workers may fare badly , too .
Those who graduate in recessions have lower incomes in the long term , according to Lisa Kahn of Yale University .
What can government do to help ?
Few politicians dare favour too much income redistribution .
During his campaign Mr Obama told an Ohio voter that he wanted to “ spread the wealth ” ; outrage duly followed .
Conservatives now argue , however , that Mr Obama has carried this creed into office .
The health bill expands care for the poor by taxing the rich , and George Bush 's tax cuts for the rich are due to expire at the end of the year , while Mr Obama has extended those for people of lesser means .
Policies that help equalise opportunity are more popular , and it is here that Mr Obama may have the greater impact .
In February his “ middle - class task - force ” touted measures such as expanded child care and , less encouragingly , support for unionisation .
Most promising is his plan to overhaul education .
This includes raising standards and expanding the role of charter schools and merit pay for teachers .
Last month Mr Obama succeeded in passing reforms for college loans , part of a bid to raise stagnant graduation rates .
Paying for such investments will be difficult , however .
Democrats wanted the student - loan bill to include provisions for early education and community colleges .
In the end , spending for community colleges was lowered from $ 10 billion to $ 2 billion .
The allocation for early education was scrapped entirely .
Ms Sawhill and Mr Haskins argue for a drastic shift in federal priorities : rather than pay for the consumption of the old , America should invest in the productivity of the young .
Reducing entitlement programmes will be tricky , to say the least .
But stagnant rates of mobility risk turning the American dream to delusion .

In 1942 Warsaw , a Polish prostitute is murdered in a sadistic way .
Major Grau ( Omar Sharif ) , an Agent from German Intelligence who believes in justice , is in charge of the investigation .
An eyewitness saw a German General leaving the building after a scream of the victim .
A further investigation shows that three Generals do not have any alibi for that night : General Tanz ( Peter O'Toole ) , Major General Klaus Kahlenberge ( Donald Pleasence ) , and General von Seidlitz - Gabler ( Charles Gray ) .
The three avoid direct contact with Major Grau and become potential suspects .
As Major Grau gets close to them , he is promoted and sent to Paris .
In 1944 Paris , this quartet is reunited , and Major Grau continues his investigation .

Viking Helmet from Gjermundbu , Norway
Contrary to a widespread delusion , Viking helmets did not have horns .
The only helmet that may be unmistakeably attributed to the Viking armor was found in 1943 in a burial mound near Gjermundbu , Norway .
The mound contained many other artifacts of the Viking Age , such as swords , sheath fittings , chain mail and several tools .
The Gjermundbu helmet , which dates to ca. 970 AD , is now displayed in the Museum of National Antiquities ( Oldsaksamlinga ) in Oslo .
This Viking helmet was found in nine separate fragments that allow us to study its construction .
The helmet consists of a framework in the form of a horizontal rim and two vertical metal strips , one of which goes from the back of the head to the forehead , and the other from ear to ear .
Four plates are fastened to this framework with rivets , thus forming the helmet ’s skullpiece .
The ocularia , which provided facial and nasal protection , are fastened to the horizontal rim as well .
One may suggest that the back and sides of the neck were protected by a chain mail ( called aventail or camail ) .
The Viking helmet from Gjermundby also probably had a pike at the apex and a leather chin strap .
The ocularia had inlaid decoration .
Earlier Scandinavian helmets , such as those which were found in Valsgärde and Vendel , had a more complex construction .
Among the Central European helmets traditionally associated with the Viking Age a few specimens have to be mentioned : helmet of St Wenceslas ( St Vaclav ) from Prague ; helmet from Olomouc , Czechia ; helmet from Ostrów Lednicki , Poland .
All these were made of one piece of metal .

Sad news out of Georgia this morning , Dr. Ed Roberts , pioneer of personal computing , has died of pneumonia at the age of 68 .
Roberts founded Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems ( MITS ) in 1970 .
In 1974 his company released the $ 395 Altair 8800 .
It was based on Intel 's revolutionary 8080 processor and , after being featured on the cover of Popular Electronics ( included after the break ) , would become the world 's first truly popular personal computer .
It would be on this machine that the former Micro - Soft would get its start , with Bill Gates and Paul Allen being contracted by Roberts to write Altair BASIC , a version of the simple programming language that Allen delivered by hand on paper tape to the MITS office in Albuquerque .
Those two are remembering him today with the following statement :
Ed was willing to take a chance on us -- two young guys interested in computers long before they were commonplace -- and we have always been grateful to him ...
The day our first untested software worked on his Altair was the start of a lot of great things .
We will always have many fond memories of working with Ed in Albuquerque , in the MITS office right on Route 66 -- where so many exciting things happened that none of us could have imagined back then .
Our thoughts go out to the Roberts family this morning .
Charlotte , North Carolina ( CNN ) -- President Obama and his GOP critics engaged in a war of spin Friday over news that the economy had added 162,000 jobs in March .
The president claimed credit for a nascent economic recovery , while Republicans argued the administration has stifled stronger potential growth .
March was only the third month with job gains since the recession began three years ago , according to the U.S. Labor Department .
Last month 's national unemployment rate , however , held steady at 9.7 percent .
The country has successfully " turned the corner , " Obama told an audience at a lithium battery company in North Carolina .
" This has been a harrowing time for our country " but " the worst of the storm is over . "
" This month more Americans woke up , got dressed and headed to work in an office or factory or storefront , " he said .
" More folks are feeling the sense of pride and satisfaction that comes with a hard - earned and well - deserved paycheck at the end of a long week of work . "
The president acknowledged that some of his administration 's economic policies have not been popular , but he insisted the country cannot return to the more conservative hands - off regulatory philosophy traditionally favored by the GOP .
" [ We ca n't forget ] the failed economic policies that got us into this mess , " Obama warned .
In turn , Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele blasted the president , dismissing dismissed much of March 's job growth as a product of the U.S. Census Bureau 's addition of 48,000 jobs for its once - in - a - decade head count of the U.S. population .
" It is unacceptable for President Obama to declare economic success when unemployment remains at 9.7 percent and a large portion of the job growth came from temporary boost in government employment , " Steele said .
" As Democrats grow big government , Americans grow weary of the strain on family budgets , job security and peace of mind .
As America 's employers announce the frightening and immediate impact of the Democrat government - run health care experiment on their balance sheets , American workers wonder why the only place exempt from increasingly painful belt - tightening seems to be Washington , D.C. "
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia , the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives , conceded that " any report showing that the economy added jobs is clearly a better alternative to one showing that it lost more jobs . "
But he said that Americans " must set our sights higher , our goals larger and our actions bolder . "
U.S. Rep. Tom Price , R - Georgia , a leading House conservative , argued that while the job growth was welcome news , the country is " yet to see the robust private - sector job creation the Obama administration promised would come " from its stimulus plan .
Price said employers , " particularly small businesses , are staring at a litany of tax increases , new government mandates and onerous regulations , all of which threaten to derail their plans for the future . "
In a statement , Christina Romer of the White House Council of Economic Advisers acknowledged that the U.S. labor market " remains severely distressed . "
But she said the March jobs figures show " continued signs of gradual labor market healing . "
" Even after adjusting for the 48,000 temporary census workers hired and a rebound effect from the February snowstorms , this number suggests an increase in underlying payroll employment , " Romer said .
" While this is the most positive jobs report we have had in three years , there will likely be bumps in the road ahead .
...
It is important not to read too much into any one monthly report , positive or negative .
It is essential that we continue our efforts to move in the right direction and generate steady , strong job gains . "
The U.S. economy has suffered a net loss of 8.2 million jobs since the start of 2008 , a month after the official beginning of the recession .
The White House and congressional Democrats passed a sweeping $ 862 billion economic stimulus program last year to help spark a recovery .
There are 15 million people counted as unemployed , down 607,000 since the record high hit in October .
The average time those unemployed have been out of a job stands at just under eight months , a record - long duration .

( CNN ) -- Authorities in several Midwestern states were flooded Wednesday night with reports of a gigantic fireball lighting up the sky , the National Weather Service said .
The fireball was visible for about 15 minutes beginning about 10 p.m. , said the National Weather Service in Sullivan , Wisconsin , just west of Milwaukee .
" The fireball was seen over the northern sky , moving from west to east , " said the NWS in the Quad Cities area , which includes parts of Iowa and Illinois .
" Well before it reached the horizon , it broke up into smaller pieces and was lost from sight , " the service said .
" Several reports of a prolonged sonic boom were received from areas north of Highway 20 , along with shaking of homes , trees and various other objects including wind chimes , " it said .
It said the fireball was seen across parts of Missouri , Illinois , Indiana and Wisconsin .
CNN affiliate WISN - TV said that people in Ohio also saw it .
Video from WISN showed a massive ball of light exploding across the sky .
The Doppler Radar from the Quad Cities weather service appeared to capture a portion of the smoke trail from the fireball at just after 10 p.m. , the NWS said .
It appears as a thin line extending across portions of Grant and Iowa Counties in Wisconsin .
There has been no official determination as to what caused the fireball , the NWS in Sullivan said .
However , it said there is a meteor shower called Gamma Virginids that occurs from April 4 to April 21 , with peak activity expected on Wednesday and Thursday .
" A large meteorite could have caused the brilliant fireball that has been reported , " the National Weather Service said .
The NWS in Quad Cities said that it was unknown if any part of a meteorite hit the ground .
According to NASA , a meteor appears when a meteoroid -- a particle , chunk of metal or stony matter -- enters the Earth 's atmosphere from outer space .
" Air friction heats the meteoroid so that it glows and creates a shining trail of gases and melted meteoroid particles , " it said .
" People sometimes call the brightest meteors fireballs . "
Canadians are ahead of their federal politicians on the issue of liberalizing marijuana laws , according to two high - profile lawmakers from B.C .
With Californians heading to the polls in November to decide whether possession of a small amount of marijuana should be legal , a similar law in Canada is not likely on the horizon , Liberal Keith Martin and New Democrat Libby Davies told The Province .
Davies , who represents the voters of Vancouver East , favours legalization of marijuana , while Martin , the MP for Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , has been calling for decriminalizing the controversial drug since 2001 .
“ I think the public is ahead of where the politicians are , ” said Davies .
“ Prohibition has failed .
It has created a lot more harm in terms of violence . ”
Davies said prohibition brings organized crime into the equation .
“ For marijuana , it ’s much better to have a rules - based , evidence - based approach that focuses on health and education . ”
Davies ’s position goes further than the federal NDP position , which calls for decriminalization .
“ The first step should be legalization for personal use , ” she added .
“ Beyond that , there ’s a lot of debate that has to happen . ”
Martin has introduced a private member ’s bill to decriminalize marijuana in every parliamentary session since 2001 .
Under his proposal , “ You would receive a fine and you would n’t receive a criminal record , ” he said .
Martin added he does n’t support people smoking marijuana “ because it ’s harmful .
“ But the harm [ caused by ] our current drug laws is greater than the harm inflicted by [ the law ] because it ’s so punitive and destroys a person ’s future .
“ From a medical perspective , alcohol does far more damage and costs more to Canadian society than marijuana does , ” said Martin , a medical doctor who has worked in emergency wards .
“ I had a lot of people who came to emergency who had been drinking and had beaten each other up or drove their cars into other cars and killed themselves or killed other people , ” he said .
“ But I never had anybody who had smoked marijuana and committed those horrible acts of violence . ”
Martin said he hopes to reintroduce his private member ’s bill in the next month , but he does n’t expect it will pass .
“ Parliament has become more small - c conservative than I ’ve ever seen it .
It ’s moving in the opposite direction to the Canadian public on these issues . ”
Earlier this week , a report issued by the B.C. Centre of Excellence in HIV / AIDS argued that studies going back 20 years have shown that drug crackdowns usually lead to increased violence .
Lead researcher Dr. Evan Wood , a University of B.C. medical professor , argued that a better approach to law enforcement and longer prison terms would be to change the legal status of illicit drugs and make them available to adults under strict regulations to minimize their use .

The three - day tour will include Hillary Clinton 's first trip to Saudi Arabia US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the US would welcome peaceful engagement with Iran but not " while they are building their bomb " .
She spoke at the US - Islamic World forum in Qatar during a trip to rally Arab support for tougher sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme .
She said the West was " encouraging Iran to reconsider its dangerous policy decisions . "
The three - day Gulf tour will include her first trip to Saudi Arabia .
The Obama administration is stepping up pressure on Iran by launching a diplomatic offensive in the Gulf .
Iran says its nuclear programme is to generate electricity so it can export more of its valuable oil and gas , but the West suspects it of trying to develop atomic weapons .
" The evidence is accumulating that that 's exactly what they are trying to do , " Mrs Clinton said .
" I would like to figure out a way to handle it in as peaceful an approach possible , and I certainly welcome any meaningful engagement , but ... we do n't want to be engaging while they are building their bomb . "
Washington wants the UN Security Council to impose a fourth round of sanctions on Tehran .
Mrs Clinton is due to meet Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , whose country opposes such sanctions .
We would expect [ the Saudis ] to use their relationships [ with China ] in ways that can help increase the pressure that Iran would feel
Jeffrey Feltman
Assistant secretary of state
More sanctions on way for Iran ?
The Big Picture : Rally Efforts to revive the Arab - Israeli peace process are also expected to be on the agenda during Mrs Clinton 's tour .
The secretary of state delayed her trip by one day after her husband , former President Bill Clinton , underwent a heart procedure at a New York hospital .
In Qatar , she will hold talks with Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim al - Thani .
And in Saudi Arabia , Mrs Clinton will meet King Abdullah , as well as foreign minister Prince Saud al - Faisal .
A state department official travelling with Mrs Clinton said the US expected Saudi Arabia , which has growing trade relations with China , to persuade Beijing to abandon opposition to tougher sanctions against Iran .
" We would expect them [ the Saudis ] to use these visits , to use their relationships in ways that can help increase the pressure that Iran would feel , " Jeffrey Feltman , assistant secretary of state , told reporters as Mrs Clinton began her trip .
Loss of revenue China , which wields a veto on the UN Security Council , is still opposed to a fourth round of sanctions .
The BBC's Kim Ghattas , who is travelling with Mrs Clinton , says Beijing fears major loss of revenue from investments in Iran and disruption in oil supplies from the country .
The secretary of state is expected to press the Saudis to reassure the Chinese that the kingdom can offset any disruption .
Missile defence is also expected to be on the agenda - the US is beefing up the missile deterrent of its Arab allies to assure them that their security is key to Washington .
Mrs Clinton 's two deputies will head to the region in the coming days , travelling to Israel , Jordan and Egypt .
And on Monday , William Burns , the under - secretary for political affairs , will travel to Lebanon and Syria .
Our correspondent says Washington is still hoping it can loosen the links between Damascus and Tehran .
She adds Lebanon currently holds a seat on the Security Council and its ties with Iran may prevent it from backing new sanctions .

The second World War had a profound effect on the course of the 20th century , and unfortunately , its horrors , including “ ethnic cleansing , ” terrorism , despotism , invasions , the curtailment of civil rights , and rampant nationalism , are still concerns of the modern day .
The documentary series The World at War is outstanding in its ability to unfold the complex issues of WWII in a clear , objective , and gripping manner .
Each of the 26 episodes of this five - DVD set , narrated by Laurence Olivier , focuses on a particular , specific aspect of the war , starting at the beginning with Hitler ’s rise to power in Germany and progressing through the end of the war .
Because of this focus , each episode examines its subject in detail , going beyond the names - and - dates style of history that I remember being subjected to in high school , to delve into the much more interesting and important issues of “ how and why . ”
I learned something new from every single episode , starting with the very first one .
The episodes proceed overall on a regular timeline from the beginning to the end of the war , but since a great deal often happened over a short period of time , the series backtracks at several points to fill in what was happening in different places .
For instance , after we are taken through the events from Hitler ’s rise to power in Germany in the late 1930s to the Battle of Britain and Hitler ’s attacks on Russia .
For the second time in two weeks , an investigation has found that there was neither a conspiracy to deceive the public nor any scientific misconduct present in the scientific research of the scientists of the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) .
These scientists were at the center of the controversy created by the Climategate email theft .
The House of Commons Science and Technology Committee tasked itself with investigating what the MPs considered critical points , namely whether the scientific work of the CRU scientists was transparent and open , whether CRU had committed scientific misconduct , and whether the CRU committed any breaches of the UK ’s Freedom of Information ( FOI ) law .
In order to address each of these key concerns , the Committee collected a significant number of statements as evidence and looked into the various specific accusations made in those statements .
What the Committee found was that there were a few problems and a widespread disregard for FOI in the wider University culture , CRU ’s research was reasonably transparent and free of obvious scientific malpractice .
Some critics of CRU had claimed that CRU did n’t publish their source code .
Others had complained that the raw data was unavailable and thus CRU ’s analyses could n’t be verified .
Still others rejected CRU ’s claims that they were restricted from releasing raw data due to legal agreements .
And there were other claims of a lack of transparency at CRU as well .
The Committee found all of the claims to be incorrect for one reason or another .
All the raw data was available to anyone who chose to buy it from the national meteorological organizations even thought it was n’t necessarily available via CRU .
The complete list of surface stations used by CRU in their global temperature datasets were available as of 2008 .
CRU was legally restricted from distributing raw meteorological data and is still prevented from distributing raw data for six different countries including Russia and Canada .
legally restricted from distributing raw meteorological data and is still prevented from distributing raw data for six different countries including Russia and Canada .
The adjustments that CRU makes to the raw data in order to generate the global temperature datasets have been published and in the public domain since 1985 .
The refusal by CRU to publish source code had no bearing on whether other researcher could check CRU ’s work :
[ S ] cience is more than individual researchers or research groups .
One should put research in context and ask the question : what would one hope to find by double checking the processing of the raw data ?
If this were the only dataset in existence , and Professor Jones ’s team had been the only team in the world to analyse it , then it might make sense to double check independently the processing of the raw data and the methods .
But there are other datasets and other analyses that have been carried out …
The results of those other analyses show that the NCDC / NOAA and GISS / NASA data sets measuring temperature changes on land and at sea have arrived at similar conclusions using similar data to that used by CRU , but using independently devised methodologies .
We have further identified that there are two other data sets ( University of Alabama and Remote Sensing Systems ) , using satellite observations that use entirely different data than that used by CRU .
These also confirm the findings of the CRU work .
The Committee ’s main complaint with regard to CRU ’s research transparency was that they seemed stuck in a 25 year old publishing paradigm instead of adapting to the Internet - era .
And so the Committee said that “ CRU should have been more open with its raw data and followed the more open approach of NASA [ which made all code and data open source years ago ] to making data available . ”
The key conclusion of the Committee with regard to research transparency was this :
Even if the data that CRU used were not publicly available – which they mostly are – or the methods not published – which they have been – its published results would still be credible : the results from CRU agree with those drawn from other international data sets ; in other words , the analyses have been repeated and the conclusions have been verified .
( emphasis added )
The Committee also looked closely at several specific emails from the CRU email archives .
Deniers have claimed that the “ trick ” and “ hide the decline ” emails reveal intent to defraud the public .
Deniers have also claimed that an email by Phil Jones where he claimed that he would “ redefine what the peer - reviewed literature ” reveals a conspiracy to restrict the IPCC process to just pro-anthropogenic climate disruption views .
While the third , as yet incomplete Independent Climate Change Email Review will look at these emails in greater detail , the Committee concluded that these three complaints against Jones and CRU were without merit .
Specifically , the Committee found that
“ Trick ” was used colloquially and did n’t indicated an attempt by Jones to deceive anyone .
“ The balance of evidence patently fails to support this view .
It appears to be a colloquialism for a ‘ neat ’ method of handling data . ”
“ Hide the decline ” was “ used as shorthand for the practice of discarding data known to be erroneous ” and that at least one paper , published in the journal Nature , had specifically pointed out the decline and attempted to explain why it had happened .
The Committee felt that a published paper in one of the most prestigious science journals in the world specifically addressing the decline “ clearly refut[ed ] this allegation . ”
However , while the Committee also concluded that Jones and CRU did not pervert the peer review process , this conclusion is the least well supported .
Whether this was due to a lack of time ( the Committee was working quickly in order to complete the review before Parliament was dissolved prior to new elections ) or because the Committee was deferring to the Independent Climate Change Email Review is not clear from the Committee ’s report .
Finally , the Committee investigated claims that CRU had failed to release information as required under the UK FOI law .
The Committee found that there was a culture of insufficient data sharing and openness at CRU in particular and at the UEA in general .
However , the Committee also found that CRU had been overwhelmed in July 2009 by 61 individual FOI requests , each of which takes a minimum of 18 hours of work just to deny as “ vexatious ” , never mind the time that the requests might take to complete .
In addition , all FOI requests are required to be answered in no less than 20 work days .
It would have taken at least seven full time staff to meet the FOI requests that came into CRU in July 2009 alone .
It ’s instructive to note that Steve McIntyre of the denier website Climate Audit asked his many readers to submit as many FOI requests to CRU in July 2009 as possible .
It ’s also interesting to note that Lord Lawson , Chairman of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , a group that denies that anthropogenic climate disruption is occurring , blamed CRU for inviting the flood of FOI requests by refusing prior requests from McIntyre : “ The 2009 flood , if you look at the sequence of events , was a response to the refusal to give disclosure of various things before .
That was what came first . ”
All in all , the Committee generally found Phil Jones and CRU to be innocent of the accusations that had been leveled against them :
[ I ] nsofar as we have been able to consider accusations of dishonesty — for example , Professor Jones ’s alleged attempt to “ hide the decline ” – we consider that there is no case to answer .
Within our limited inquiry and the evidence we took , the scientific reputation of Professor Jones and CRU remains intact .
The second investigation was a seven member panel chaired by Lord Oxburgh of Liverpool , a fellow of the Royal Society ( the UK equivalent of the US National Academy of Sciences ) .
The panel was tasked by the UEA and the Royal Society with examining the research performed by CRU and verifying that the scientific conclusions had been supported by the data .
If the conclusions were not , then that would qualify as evidence of research misconduct .
In the process of doing this , the panel read 11 papers that had been recommended by the Royal Society and that spanned 25 years of CRU publications .
The panel also interviewed CRU scientists twice , and the panel requested and reviewed additional information to help the panel understand the CRU ’s research .
The panel investigated two main research areas , namely the use of tree rings for climate purposes ( dendroclimatology ) and the use of global weather station data to create a global temperature record over the last 130 or more years .
With respect to the dendroclimatology , the panel found that none of the papers they examined used inappropriate methods .
Some used non-optimal methods , but the panel said
it is not clear , however , that better methods would have produce significantly different results .
The panel also found that all the papers contained the requisite caveats about the limitations and applicability of the analyses and data presented in the papers .
They also found that the CRU tree ring data was disorganized and not very well documented .
As anyone who ’s ever worked in industry or academia knows , documentation takes time and money and so is almost always minimized in favor of pushing out the latest product or paper .
The panel ’s conclusion found that
after reading publications and interviewing the senior staff of CRU in depth , we are satisfied that the CRU tree - ring work has been carried out with integrity , and that allegations of deliberate misrepresentation and unjustified selection of data are not valid .
( emphasis added )
When the panel investigated the historical temperature records produced by CRU , the panel again found that the methods used were “ fair and satisfactory ” even though other methods might have proven superior .
In fact , the panel pointed out specifically something that the House of Commons Committee report also found :
There have been various analyses of similar publicly available data sets by different international groups .
Although there are some differences in fine detail that reflect the differences in the analytical methods used , the results are very similar .
And again , the panel found that the CRU papers regarding global temperature records and the researchers themselves all provided “ detailed descriptions of uncertainties ” in the data , methods , and conclusions of the research .
The panel ’s only major complaint with CRU ’s work was that they did n’t have sufficient interaction with professional statisticians .
However , the panel found no evidence that better statistical methods would have changed the results – NASA , NCDC , and now multiple different amateur reconstructions have all replicated the basic results of CRU using the same raw data CRU used .
Taken together , the two independent reviews have largely exonerated Phil Jones and the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia .
Yes , both reviews found that there were some problems in the culture or in the specific statistical methods chosen , but on the central questions relating to the accuracy of climate science and data produced by CRU , both reviews were completely in agreement : CRU ’s work was accurate and had been neither manipulated nor misrepresented to scientists , critics , or the public in general .
The release of the CRU emails and documents was an explosion when they burst upon the scene in November 2009 .
Since then , however , three of five investigations ( two of three UK inquiries , one of two Penn State inquiries ) have found that the accusations of misconduct and conspiracy are no more than a raisin drying up in the sun .
If the last two reviews turn out like the first three have , what could have been a runny sore for climatologists worldwide may well turn into a sagging , heavy load for the climate disruption deniers who erroneously touted “ Climategate ” as the death of anthropogenic climate disruption .

S&R is presently in the process of reviewing all the evidence provided to the House of Commons and the evidence released to date by the last inquiry , the Independent Climate Change Email Review .
S&R will publish an analysis of the evidence provided upon completion of the review .

MILLA Jovovich and Julian McMahon are scheduled to come to Winnipeg by May 1 for a scheduled five - week shoot of the serial killer thriller Faces in the Crowd .
Best known for her Resident Evil movies , Jovovich ( pictured ) recently starred in A Perfect Getaway and recently wrapped production of Resident Evil : Afterlife .
She will play a woman afflicted with " face blindness " after surviving an attack by a maniac .
McMahon will play a cop on the trail of the killer .
Winnipeg production company Frantic Films will be co-producing with Minds Eye Entertainment , Radar Films and Forecast Pictures .
It will be McMahon 's second film shoot in Winnipeg .
The Nip / Tuck star shot the Shannen Doherty TV movie Another Day here in 2001 .
In 2007 , the Sydney - born actor hilariously referred to Winnipeg as " the weirdest place on Earth , " during a press junket for the Sandra Bullock movie Premonition .
" It 's a great city .
Great place .
Weird place , though .
" It 's cold for nine months of the year and nobody goes out , " he said .
" You ca n't go out .
You can't , I swear to God .
Your eyeballs freeze over !
" There 's a thing on the news : Do n't go out , your eyeballs will freeze over ! " he ranted .
" And then when it gets warm , they have those worms that drop out of the sky , " he said , evidently referring to the cankerworm blight of 2001 .
" I mean worms drop out of the sky !
It 's the weirdest thing ever .
You come out and your car is covered in worms about this big , " he said , holding his thumb and forefinger a couple of inches apart .
" And then they have mosquitoes the size of cats ! "
Welcome back to Winnipeg , Mr. McMahon .

THE beginnings of three new cities will rise out of Queensland 's booming southeast by the end of next year under radical plans by the Bligh Government to manage population growth by accelerating key housing developments .
The Government 's powerful land development body will take control of three greenfield areas in the region 's west and southwest to quickly deliver new masterplanned communities set to be home to an extra 250,000 people .
Construction is likely to start in the three areas at Ripley Valley , west of Springfield , and Greater Flagstone and Yarrabilba , in Logan 's south near Jimboomba , before the end of next year .
Premier Anna Bligh said the new " model cities " would " work better than anything we have seen in Queensland before " .
She said the model cities would allow children to walk to school , workers to catch public transport and families to enjoy ample green open space .
But fast tracking development of these areas may add to the region 's urban sprawl , with the new satellite cities located up to 40 km away from the centre of Brisbane .
They will require the Government to expand its much - vaunted urban footprint and may add pressure to existing transport links while new infrastructure , such as the Springfield rail line , due to be completed in 2015 , is built .
The move also contrasts with the spirit of the Southeast Queensland Regional Plan , which dictates that most of the forecast 750,000 new homes the region needs over the next 20 years should be built in existing suburbs .
Fast tracking development of these areas on the region 's urban fringe means that at least one in every four homes on greenfield sites in southeast Queensland would be built there .
The Urban Land Development Authority 's takeover of these development areas is the centrepiece of the Government 's response to its growth management summit , which highlights the challenges of dealing with the region 's predicted rampant population growth .
The ULDA will now take planning control for the identified areas from the Ipswich and Logan councils to assess their capacity to deliver more than 100,000 new homes .
The authority will have about four months to put forward the sites as Urban Development Areas , and another 12 months to bring the first housing lots to market – a timetable that could lead to construction before the end of 2011 .
The ULDA now controls nine significant development sites throughout Queensland , including key parcels of land in Mackay , Townsville and Gladstone as well as large landholdings at Bowen Hills , Hamilton and Fitzgibbon in Brisbane 's north .
The Government is hoping the authority will allow development of affordable and medium density housing to keep pace with population growth .
An extra two million people are expected to call southeast Queensland home over the next 20 years , bringing its population to 4.4 million by 2031 .

The 2010 Winners
For the past few years I have begun these writeups with some prefatory remarks about what this contest is not : it 's not about puns , it 's not about gross - out humor or whimsical wackiness , etc .
But this year I think I can dispense with the introduction , because the winner perfectly encapsulates what the contest is about .
So let 's get right to it — the winner of the 2010 Lyttle Lytton Contest is :  I shouldnt be saying this , but I think Ill love you always , baby , always ,  Adam cried into the email .
I got this one back in August and am still awestruck every time I see the phrase " cried into the email . "
There 's just so much wrongness packed into those four little words :
The ambiguity of the word " cried . "
We 're so used to any piece of dialogue that 's the least bit emphatic getting tagged with a " he cried " or " she cried " that initially it looks innocuous .
But this quotation has enough of a blubbering tone to it to make us think it must mean the regular sort of crying .
Who can say ?
The " cried " / " email " pair .
Again , it looks innocuous , because we 're used to seeing the word " cried " affixed to pieces of written text , but you can't actually " cry " in an email , which can neither transmit volume should " cry out " be what 's meant , nor convey the sobs that would accompany the other meaning .
The verb / preposition pair " cried into . "
This looks like it 's just an idiom error and that the author meant " in " ... but when you think about it , you can " cry into " things as well !
Like , you could cry into an Erlenmeyer flask .
Put it all together and you end up with an image of this dude bawling the line above , the tears streaming down his face and splashing onto the screen of his Blackberry , where they magically resolve themselves into the letters that make up his abject missive .
Throw in the suggestion that the entire novel will be about this guy 's post - breakup groveling and we have a winner .
( The entrant added a note that the selection of the character 's name was " purely coincidental . "
I should certainly hope so . )
No single runner - up this year .
There were a lot of good entries , and here you can insert the standard language about " on a different day the list of honorable mentions might have looked slightly different . "
But here are the ones that stood out this time around , in no particular order :
Splashy the whale smiled secretively , flapping his flappers and swimming .
I think Herman Melville 's corpse just screamed .
That 's some awesome mastery of marine mammal anatomy on display there .
( Also , could n't you append " and swimming " to any description of a cetacean 's activities ?
" Tillikum the orca pulled his trainer into the water , violently drowning her and swimming . " )
The meteor formed a crater , vampires crawling out of the crater .
Always nice to get an entry from a past master .
A worthy effort !
You 've got the surpassingly dull " formed a crater " to describe a cataclysmic impact , the repetition of the word " crater , " the so - very - clichéd appearance of vampires ( from space !! ) ... but I think my favorite element is what appears to be an attempt to deploy the ablative absolute .
Seriously , I think half the sentences I translated back in Latin 2 ended up looking like this .
This is a story about a racist hero who dies at the end , probably painfully since hell get shot in the face .
The phrase " shot in the face " does a lot of the heavy comedic lifting here ( much as it did during the Cheney years ) and the " probably " does its part as well .
But do n't overlook the switch from the present of " dies , " with the author looking down onto the entirety of the timeline , to the in - timeline future of " he'll . "
Also do n't overlook that the narrator is clearly noisily chewing gum while relating this information .
 You are the greatest human in the world ,  the dragon told the boy who desperately wanted to be a dragon , too .
I like this because it 's so close to the " you 're great just the way you are " message common to children 's stories , yet goes that one extra step too far .
Not sure it works as a first line , but I had to include it .
Then there 's this one , which is probably too good to qualify — I can see several ways to make it work — but is also too irresistible to leave out :
This is a mystery about a murder I committed .
Which brings us to :  Murder is the most terrible crime of them all ,  the police commissioner thought to himself as he loitered purposefully near the deli counter .
While I 'm glad the police commissioner has calmed down a bit since 2007 , let 's not overlook 21 U.S.C. §603 regarding the sale of tainted meat .
Once upon a time , there was a talking lamp whose lightbulb fell out and hit a person and the person got shocked and destroyed everything .
This is such an uncanny recreation of the way five - year - olds tell stories that I assume that the Axe Cop audience would buy up the entire first printing .
Zandor stood in the doorway , raking the onlooking crowd with the hot coals of his eyes .
I like this because I can totally see my ninth - grade English teacher giving it a green checkmark with a note saying " Powerful imagery ! "
Like a lot of the best entries , it seems like it should work : " hot coals of his eyes " seems all right , and " coals " goes with " raking , " and " raking a crowd " is , um , well , and " raking with eyes " is , oh dear ...
The general , one might have said , had a sly , sneering - smile expression upon his face .
The scary thing is that I 've had altogether too many of those " dammit , what is the word for that ? " moments lately .
I can totally feel for this author .
" Rrrgh , what 's it called when your face is like — you know , and your mouth is like this , and you 're all , like ...
I 'm pretty sure there 's a word for it ... "
There was only one man salubrious enough to assuage my hunger for love — senator Saxby Chambliss ( R - GA ) .
This is a gimmick that could only work once , and the " salubrious " part almost wrecks it , but I 'm a sucker for those little party - and - state tags .
A number of other entries dealt with the timeless subject of love .
A sampling :  You are in pain ; both physical and emotional ,  my heart informed me .
My amygdala is informing me that I have been there , pal .
Empathy subroutines activated .
Also note the skillful deployment of the incorrectly used semicolon .
When John left me he took with him my heart , my soul , my everything — which included my happiness , my appetite , my energy , and even my tears !!
Not to mention my stereo .
 Great Caesars Ghost !
Amy sputtered .
 What glorious lovemaking ! 
One does one 's humble best .
Let 's conclude this section with a grab bag of other honorable mentions :  OMG  texted Sue - Anne to her compatriot Ellen , MY OWN PARENTS R DED !
It looked like the Mystery Girls had a new mystery !
The IM - speak gag has been done before , but I could n't read all that Bad Machinery and not let this one sneak in .
 Approach ramming speed ! commanded Commander Klamsky , as her frigate plowed through the celestial ocean at erupting speeds .
I wonder whether it plowed east 'ard .
Bookended with firecrackers , her birth was an auspicious occasion , festooned with all the ornaments of her birth , and solemn .
The mention of " firecrackers " and concern with whether the birth was " auspicious " makes me think this is supposed to be taking place in China ... but a female fetus actually being permitted to come to term ?
I 've seen the Chinese M/F ratio figures .
This might stretch suspension of disbelief a bit too far .
As someone who has menstruated , I thought , I could tell you its no picnic .
If you liked Judy Blume 's classic Are You There , God ?
It 's Me , Margaret , you 'll love the long - awaited sequel Margaret : First Blood Part II .
 Hearken ,  he spake , drawing thither , and alight thine eyes on yon comely maiden betwixt such knaves as they . 
That 's nice , but you 're due back at the " Steak on a Stake " booth in five minutes .
The battlefield stank thick with writhing  progressives .
I was surprised to find that this was an original , since I assumed that there would be a source citation and that it would be from something released by Regnery Publishing .
A matter of time , I guess .
Tuesday .
Africa .
Lion oclock .
And here my watch says it 's only half past zebra .
All right !
On to the Found category .
This year 's winner is :
Some things are so small , so miniscule , so atomically insignificant , they can be seen only from three feet away using the Hubble telescope .
This is a tour de force !
Maybe not quite as abominable as the Straczynski sentence in ' 08 , but it's in the same ballpark .
The most obvious malfunction here is that Reilly seems completely unaware of the distinction between a microscope and a telescope .
( Hint : which one looks at small things ?
... No ?
Okay , hint : the Hubble Space Telescope looks at galaxies and nebulae and things .
Are those small ? )
He also misspells " minuscule . "
But what makes this a winner is that it'd be hard to find a better example of a certain formulaic type of sportswriting , the type that relies on ostensibly humorous comparisons featuring references ripped from the headlines , by which I mean the headlines sitting at the bottom of your recycling bin .
" Their playoff chances are as dead as Michael Jackson with a case of swine flu ! "
" He makes enough in endorsements that Bill Gates hits him up for walking - around money !
You could n't fit his wallet into Twitter ! "
Etc. Now , you might well object that this may be bad , but it does n't exactly sound like the beginning of a story .
That 's because you have n't seen the follow - up sentence , which brought the entry to just over the limit at 33 words .
So while officially only the first sentence gets the award , let 's enjoy the entry in its entirety now :
Some things are so small , so miniscule , so atomically insignificant , they can be seen only from three feet away using the Hubble telescope .
The heart of Jean Musgjerd is one of these things .
So as you can see , it 's really a character study .
This actually saw print .
When I first established the Found category , I anticipated that it'd be filled with these sorts of repurposings .
And I did get a number of good entries that were n't from fictional sources .
Here 's another one from the sports world : Nine - year - old Kyle Graddy looked out across a minor league baseball diamond for the first time in his life and pondered the possibility of his own death .
From " the Guardian Angel guide to safe living " circa 1982 : Street punks live in a fantasy world of invincibility , and our fear turns their dreams into reality .
From the ever- reliable Wikipedia : Andy Hallett was an only child who grew to stand 62 .
The saying  I have got your back  almost never has the literal meaning of receipt or possession of anothers spine .
Here 's one that juuust missed last year 's deadline :
At the peak of a golden career Liu Yan lost control of the very limbs that experts say made her dances so magical .
The very limbs !
Those selfsame ones !
This is the kind of stretching for irony we saw in last year 's winner with Dan Brown 's president — he 's powerful , you see , but average in height !!
But hey , if that 's what you 're after , why not go to the source ?
Here 's Scott Silverstein again with another gem from the Dan Brown oeuvre : David Becker had never held a gun , but he was holding one now .
When I looked this one up , I found it was from Chapter 101 .
That 's not binary !
But again , I did n't really think that this section of the contest would wind up with too many actual fictional works .
Sure , I figured people would send in lines from books they hated , or fanfic that was poorly written but not in an especially funny way .
But some of you have found stuff that 's so eye - poppingly appalling that it makes the " vampires crawling out of the crater " entry look pretty solid .
This is mostly vanity - press stuff by people with seemingly no concept of what constitutes basic competence in storytelling ... and sometimes no concept of what constitutes human communication .
Samples : THIS STORY BEGINS on a Beautiful sunny day in Daytona Beach Florida With a man by the name of David Braymer .
A 45 - year - old Single man that works at the local High school as a science teacher and astrology in the 12 - grade level .
Knuckles resembles a human , but with differences .
Knuckles is neither male nor female , though referred to as a " he . "
Three - quarter - inch - thick dark - violet - colored ( FFA000E0 ) fur covers his entire body .
He is only 25 1/ 3 inches tall , 4 inches wide , and 2.5 inches deep .
As you can see , these are both a little too long , and with good reason : the effect comes from the way the authors just keep going on like that , rather than from any particular sentence .
This means they may not be right for this contest .
Here 's another that comes closer , though it 's still a touch too long : " By the whirling rings of Saturn , " he growled as he gazed disconsolately at his paper - strewn desk .
" I 'd like to have those directors of ITA here on Mercury for just one Earth - month . "
This one 's sort of interesting in that , today , it could only be a spoof ; before that , it could have just been clichéd ; but it 's from 1932 , when this sort of thing was relatively fresh .
So , philosophically speaking ... was this as bad then as it is now , or did it only become this bad in retrospect ?
( Also , because this and the " Jean Musgjerd " lines really should have been allowed , for 2011 I am upping the word limit to 33 words .
But I think that 's about as far as I can go before losing the distinction between this contest and the Bulwer - Lytton . )
Anyway , let 's wrap up with a couple more short and snappy ones .
Here 's a real sentence from a real story that comes awfully close to the Lyttle Lytton ur - sentence : Jennifer stood there imagining how good that pear would be .
And then finally one that I was sure would appear in my inbox at some point , but did n't .
So here 's my own contribution for this year .
You know how these are supposed to be the first sentences of imaginary novels ?
Well , here 's someone who 's unequivocal on that point : *(( Gotta put First Things First ) ) *
And that wraps it up for this , the tenth edition of the Lyttle Lytton Contest .
I think this was one of the better years for it , joining 2001 , 2004 , and 2007 ...
I guess that means I should probably wait until 2013 to run it again , but I 'll take my chances on 2011 .
Thanks to everyone who has entered , posted about , or simply enjoyed the contest over the past decade .
You are the greatest humans in the world !

There ’s nothing up the sleeves of the Cassini imaging team in this image ; it is real !
Is the moon Titan being cut in half by Saturn ’s rings ?
What is actually happening here is that the middle part of the rings are made dark as Saturn casts its shadow across them .
Cassini was just in the right place at the right time , making it appear as though Titan is being sliced in half !
The night side of the planet is to the left , out of the frame of the image .
Illuminated Titan can be seen above , below and through gaps in the rings .
Click the image for a larger version .
As an added benefit in this shot , Mimas ( 396 kilometers , 246 miles across ) is near the bottom of the image , and Atlas ( 30 kilometers , 19 miles across ) can barely be detected near the thin F ring just above the center right of the image .
Lit terrain seen here is the area between the leading hemisphere and Saturn - facing side of Titan ( 5,150 kilometers , 3,200 miles across ) .
This view looks toward the northern , sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane .
Below are a few more magical images from Cassini :
Here the moon Enceladus appears strung along a wispy ring of Saturn , likely the G ring .
Look close and Enceladus ’ plumes are visible , too .
Two of Saturn ’s small moons appear to be sitting on Satun ’s thin F ring in this image .
From the CICLOPS website :
Pandora ( 81 kilometers , 50 miles across ) is on the left , and Epimetheus ( 113 kilometers , 70 miles across ) is on the right .
This view looks toward the northern , sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane .
Both moons are closer to Cassini than the rings are .
Pandora is slightly closer to Cassini than Epimetheus here .
The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow - angle camera on Nov. 23 , 2009 .
The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers ( 808,000 miles ) from Pandora and Epimetheus .
Image scale is 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) per pixel .
For more great images from Cassini ( which I contend is actually an artist and not a magician ! ) go to the CICLOPS website and NASA ’s Cassini website .
Merritt has dominated the 400 m in recent years
Olympic and world 400 m champion LaShawn Merritt failed three drugs tests between October 2009 and January 2010 .
His lawyer Howard Jacobs claimed in a statement that the positive tests were caused by Merritt 's " use of an over - the - counter male enhancement product " .
Jacobs said : " LaShawn Merritt has accepted a provisional suspension as a result of [ the ] positive drug tests . "
The American , 23 , faces a two - year ban and admitted he had made a " foolish , immature and egotistical mistake " .
Merritt claimed he had not been aware that the product he used contained the banned steroid Dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) .
He said in a statement : " To know I have tested positive as a result of a product I used for personal reasons is extremely difficult .
Thanks to his selfish actions , he has done damage to our efforts to fight the plague of performance - enhancing drugs in our sport
UST&F chief executive Doug Logan " I hope my sponsors , family , friends and the sport itself will forgive me .
Any penalty I may receive for my action will not overshadow the embarrassment and humiliation I feel . ''
In the statement , Merritt admitted he had not read the " fine print " on the product he purchased .
The Los Angeles Times quoted Doug Logan , the chief executive of USA Track & Field , as saying that Merritt had " sullied his career " .
" He has put an unfortunate stigma on himself he is going to be living down the rest of his life . "
Logan said Merritt 's actions " indicate an extraordinary lack of maturity and an absence of the responsibility necessary to be a world - class athlete " .
He added : " Thanks to his selfish actions , he has done damage to our efforts to fight the plague of performance - enhancing drugs in our sport . "
The runner 's claim that he was unaware the product contained DHEA is unlikely to help him avoid a ban as anti-doping rules state athletes must take ultimate responsibility for what is found in their bodies .
Merritt , who upset favourite Jeremy Wariner to win the Olympic 400 m title in Beijing two years ago , was not notified of the positive tests until March .
As well as winning individual gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and Worlds in Berlin a year later , he also helped the US team win 4x400 m relay titles at both events .

New transfers of wealth from middle class go directly to French and German banks
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , May 10 , 2010
American taxpayers have been freshly liberated of hundreds of billions more dollars as part of the IMF ’s new bailout package which is principally going straight to European banks , in addition to the Federal Reserve program to ship U.S. dollars to Europe , in a move that represents little more than a desperate effort to save the Euro and rescue the credibility of economic global governance .
“ The Federal Reserve late Sunday opened a program to ship U.S. dollars to Europe in a move to head off a broader financial crisis on the continent , ” reports the Associated Press .
“ The Fed ’s action reopens a program put in place during the 2008 global financial crisis under which dollars are shipped overseas through the foreign central banks .
In turn , these central banks can lend the dollars out to banks in their home countries that are in need of dollar funding to prevent the European crisis from spreading further . ”
As we reported last time this program was enacted , the Federal Reserve refused to say which foreign banks had received an estimated half a trillion dollars in credit swaps .
The program is unconstitutional under Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution which states , “ No money shall be drawn from the treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law . ”
In addition to the credit swap program being re-enacted , the IMF portion of a separate European bailout package amounts to around $ 287 billion dollars .
Since American taxpayers represent around 20 per cent of IMF funding , they will fork out something in the region of $ 57 billion dollars which which primarily go straight to French and German banks , not to mention the billions more in transfers of wealth that will occur through the Fed ’s credit swap program .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Politicians everywhere applaud this most recent rape of America ’s working class , even as communism is now the global ideology , ” writes Tyler Durden .
“ Who needs The Onion.com when reality is now 10 times more surreal .
And the direct recipients of taxpayer generosity : SocGen , AXA , Dexia , CA and all other French and German banks , which right now are all up ~ 20 % . ”
But it ’s not just American taxpayers who have been looted to save the crumbling facade of the Euro single currency .
British taxpayers will be forced to underwrite an estimated £ 10 billion pounds of the bailout as part of the IMF package .
And all for what ?
The two primary reasons for the bailout are to rescue ailing confidence in the globalist Euro single currency , which was forced upon European citizens against their will when it was introduced , and to prop up the casino stock markets .
Neither of these justifications provide any benefit for the average citizen or the middle class , and yet we are the ones paying for it with our depreciated savings , our evaporating pension funds and our crumbling infrastructure and public services , which are all being forgotten in pursuit of one massive banker bailout after another .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Credibility in the agenda to impose global economic governance run by the Nazi - founded Bank for International Settlements rests in upholding confidence in the Euro .
If the Euro collapses and ceases to exist , which many financial experts are now seriously predicting , then the entire raison d’être for centralized economic planning in pursuit of global governance will be completely discredited .
The globalists must save the Euro in order to legitimize future plans for a North American Union single currency which will replace the dollar .
When the dollar sank to alarming lows against other global currencies little over two years ago , we saw none of the same concern or hand - wringing on behalf of the elite as we are seeing for the Euro .
That ’s because the survival of the dollar is not part of their framework of global economic governance .
For all the elite cares , the dollar can crash and burn but rescuing the Euro from the same fate is imperative .
Indeed , it appears as if the chaos in Greece is being deliberately provoked and hyped in order to justify the continued re-alignment and centralization of the entire financial system into fewer globalist hands .
As The Economic Collapse Blog writes today , “ Could Greece bring down the entire world economy ?
Hardly .
The truth is that you could remove Greece from the world economy tomorrow and most people would hardly notice .
The economy of Greece is only about 2 % the size of the United States economy , and it takes in less than 0.1 % of U.S. exports .
But we are being led to believe that Greece has suddenly become the epicenter of a financial crisis which is going to bring down everything .
Could it be that this Greek debt crisis is purposely being hyped and manipulated ?
Could it be that this Greek debt crisis is yet another example of the “ problem , reaction , solution ” paradigm that the global elite have employed so many times before ? ”
“ Right now almost all of the governments in the western world operate debt - based economies that rely on ever - inflating amounts of paper money in order to survive .
The elite international bankers of the world have made a killing by creating money out of nothing and loaning it to the nations of the world .
The interest on those loans is the primary method by which the wealth of the world is slowly transferred into the hands of the ultra - wealthy .
When the interest on the loans starts to become too much for a particular nation , they borrow even more money so that they can stay afloat .
It is a debt trap that is designed to continue indefinitely .
Even the most powerful nations in the world are caught in this debt trap .
In fact , most people are absolutely amazed when they learn that it is mathematically impossible to pay off the national debt of the United States .
But the United States is far from alone in that respect .
Almost all of the other major nations in the world are in the exact same boat . ”
It ’s horribly ironic that the Euro , global economic governance , and the entire European project was sold under the justification that centralization meant stability , and yet now we are being told that the chaos in Greece is contagious and could spread to Spain , Portugal and Italy unless taxpayers are looted for billions and trillions more .
Reality has proven that centralization of economies under the banner of the EU and the Euro causes economic chaos to go viral .
When nearly every country on a single continent uses the same currency , they infect one other with the disease .
This is then habitually exploited as an excuse with which to rob taxpayers whose living standards are declining as their currency devalues and their pensions wither on the vine .

Comment on this article
Although many of the Pacific Ocean 's big species are floundering , one large creature of the deep seems to be flourishing .
The Humboldt squid ( Dosidicus gigas , also known as jumbo squid , owing to its sizable nature ) has been steadily expanding its population and range : whereas sightings north of San Diego were rare 10 years ago , the squid are now found as far north as Alaska .
Many researchers attribute the squid 's recent success to the very climate , current and oxygen - level changes that have been hurting populations of other species in the diverse California Current .
" I find their adaptability and their perfection in dealing with anything nature throws at them to be a remarkable feature , " says William Gilly , a professor of biology at Stanford University whose lab has spearheaded much of the U.S. work on Humboldt squid .
" They 're able to explore and take advantage of new environments that are compromised in any way . "
And they can move quickly , says John Field , a fisheries biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Southwest Fisheries Center , adding : " They 're capable of very large migration patterns . "
Gilly 's group recorded one squid that was tagged in Monterey , Calif. , and last detected around Mexico 17 days later .
Humboldt squid are formidable predators , reaching about two meters in length and 50 kilograms , dwarfing the 30 - centimeter - long California market squid ( Loligo opalescens ) that often end up as calamari .
( Despite their outsize nickname , however , jumbo squid are not the largest cephalopod in the seas — that honor goes to the colossal squid , Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni , rare specimens of which have measured more than five times the size of most Humboldt squid . )
But their impressive size is just one of the things about these squid that keep divers , fishers and scientists fascinated .
Despite their often - unnerving abundance recently in coastal waters and commercial fisheries alike , little is known about the lives of these prodigious creatures of the deep .
Although these large squid are thought to live for only a year or two , they emerge from an egg measuring about one millimeter long .
To sustain such rapid growth they appear to have nearly endless appetites .
Hungry , hungry Humboldts
A growing mass of these hungry squid could have a large impact on some fish stocks , especially those that are already faltering .
" They can eat pretty much all they want , " Gilly says , noting that researchers have found a range of meals inside the squid , ranging from tiny krill to 40 - centimeter - long hake — and even some salmon remains .
Humboldts have even been known to eat each other .
As evidence for their impact on U.S. fisheries continues to trickle in , their effect off in Chile , where the squid have been prevalent for much longer than most parts off the U.S. coast , has been more conspicuous : " There 's very strong evidence that the squid expansion had a huge impact on the hake fisheries , " says Field , who helped organize a symposium on the animal in 2007 .
" It looks like they 're doing the same migration as hake , which concerns me . "
The squid are making it harder to measure some fish populations , such as the hake .
Humboldt are often found in and around hake schools and have a very similar sound signature as the fish , Field explains .
So researchers who survey hake populations with hydroacoustics , which uses sound waves to detect and measure marine life , often get unusable data .
The squids ' presence is also being felt in terrestrial food webs .
With expanding ranges , there has been increasing interest in these squid among sportfishers of the U.S. west coast , and commercial fisheries for the squid are growing in Mexico , Chile and Peru .
But humans are not the only land lovers that have begun sampling these squid .
Both bears and wolves have been observed dining on Humboldt , likely from carcasses that have washed ashore , an occurrence that is only likely to increase with growing squid populations .
Continued research will help scientists understand more about what these squid are eating — and what 's eating them — as well as where they are spending the majority of their time .
" There 's a lot of squid out there , and there 's no reason they would n't be having an impact " on local ecosystems and food webs , Field says .
And especially if the squids ' range continues to expand , he adds : " I would n't rule out the potential for a huge impact . "
Changing tides below
Humboldt squid 's core range used to extend from San Diego across the equator to northern Chile but now stretches from southern Alaska to Chile 's southern tip .
Off the central coast of California , where the squid were a rare visitor before the year 2002 , jumbo squid sportfishing boats now frequently depart .
One factor contributing to the squids ' expansion seems to be the eastern Pacific 's growing dead zones , where they spend much of the day .
Well - known river - mouth hypoxic zones , such as the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico , are fed by agricultural runoff and the algal blooms it encourages .
But deep - sea low - oxygen zones are naturally occurring , integral parts of larger oceanic systems , where organic matter filters down from highly productive areas only to be consumed by anaerobic bacteria that emit carbon dioxide .
In such environments , dissolved oxygen levels are so low that many ocean creatures , such as large predatory fish , have trouble staying for long .
Changes in climate , water stratification , wind patterns and currents in the Pacific might all be playing a role in expanding these hypoxic zones , Gilly explains .
Despite their dreary name , these growing dead zones are likely boosting Humboldt squid numbers .
In warmer water areas these low - oxygen zones often start 200 meters below the surface and extend in the water column down to about 1,000 meters .
Off the coast of California , however , Gilly explains , these zones have historically started at a depth closer to 400 or 500 meters , making them much smaller .
But in recent years , " that zone is getting bigger " and low oxygen areas have been growing closer to the surface off the coast of North America .
Off Oregon , for example , many of the past summers have brought a new seasonal dead zone close to the coast .
This change has meant less livable ocean habitat for many creatures that depend on well - oxygenated water to survive .
But for Humboldt squid the expansion of these dead zones has been a lifeline to new habitats .
Gilly and his lab have discovered the squid can hang out hundreds of meters down in areas that hold as little as 10 percent of standard surface oxygen levels for a whole day .
In fact , the squid do not just seem to tolerate these harsh aqueous climes , but they appear to actually " have an affinity for and favor " them , Gilly notes .
Just why Humboldt squid are thriving deep in these low - oxygen zones remains a mystery .
Scientists speculate that the squid are likely feasting on the many small animals such as krill and lantern fish that are adapted to spend the day there hiding from other predators that are not equipped to spend time in the hypoxic areas .
( The squid , along with the smaller fry , tend to surface around sunset and spend much of the evening in higher waters . )
" In a way , they 're the masters of that universe , " Gilly says about the hypoxic zones .
" They 're the top predators in that world . "
These hostile zones also likely afford refuge for Humboldt squid from many of their own predators , such as tuna , billfish and sharks , Field points out .
Other researchers have proposed that there might also be some sort of metabolic advantage to staying in those low - oxygen areas , as well .
Because low oxygen levels slow many animals down , " you can eat without a lot of effort , " Gilly explains .
Researchers have often observed Humboldts feeding in schools , a phenomenon common in many squid species but which can be scary to divers who encounter large numbers of jumbos that can be as big — or bigger — than a human .
Although disparate accounts of attacks on divers exist , many experts think the squid are probably investigating the intruders rather than trying to harm them .
Swimming in the dark
Although the squid appear to be in abundance in most areas where they are fished , their actual numbers remain unknown .
" We really do n't know what the biomass [ of Humboldt ] is in any of these places , " Gilly says .
The expanding hypoxic zones and warming waters that appear to have been a boon to these squid so far are not the only projected climatic changes , however .
And other shifts might not bring clear - cut advantages for the jumbo squid .
A 2008 study from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the projected increase in ocean acidity levels by 2100 might decrease the squids ' metabolic rate by as much as 31 percent and cut their activity rate by 45 percent , meaning that they would be not be eating as much .
Other observations have contradicted these findings , however , so the effect of ocean acidification will be " important to sort out , " Field says — especially if Humboldt squid continue to become increasingly prominent players in the ecosystems .
" It seems pretty clear to me , at least , " that climate changes on the whole " seem to be benefiting " Humboldt squid , Field says .
But until more research comes in , " the jury 's still out " on what the long - term impact on — and of — the squid will be .
" We simply do n't know , " he concludes .
Efforts to count squid and tag them are ongoing in California as well as South America .
And an international symposium in La Paz , Mexico , in October will bring experts together to discuss ongoing research in the field .
Gilly concedes it is possible that the more recent observations of the Humboldt 's proliferation could have resulted from changes in the squid 's behavior or distribution rather than an increase in overall numbers , but he thinks it is more likely there are just more of them .
So the question becomes where they might crop up next .
He has a friendly wager ( for a six pack of beer ) going with a scientist in Russia that the squid will make it to Kamchatka on Siberia 's Pacific coast before the men die .
With the growing low - oxygen zones under much of that part of the Pacific , " that pathway for them would seem to be there , " Gilly says .
" They seem to go wherever they want . "
Police force travellers to move on after convoy of 30 caravans sets up camp in a school 's playing field
A group of travellers has been ordered off a school 's playing field after setting up camp with 30 caravans , forcing hundreds of children to stay at home .
Education bosses immediately set up an exclusion zone at Smithills School , Bolton , after the extraordinary convoy moved in on Sunday evening .
Around 300
Year 8 pupils were told to work from home because their classrooms are next to the playing fields and it was feared the travellers ' presence could cause disruption to classes .

The travellers ' departure has come too late to save the school 's sports day today , which has had to be cancelled as the field is cleared up .
Headteacher Chris Roberts said : ' It has caused disruption but staff and pupils have been fantastic and responded well . '
Police spoke to the group to inform them that trespass , which is normally a civil offence , is elevated to a criminal offence when it is carried out on a school premises and causes disruption .
Washing hung up to dry in the sunshine on the fields on Monday where the school 's sports day is due to be held today
This would have given the police the power of arrest if the travellers had refused to move on .
Sgt John Nicol , of the Bolton West Neighbourhood Policing Team , said : ' We take this very seriously and are taking positive action to ensure the smooth running of the school . '
Bolton Council officers were due to visit the travellers yesterday to give them a direction to leave the land .
The travellers were given notice to leave a local park by Bolton Council after the caravans appeared near the main entrance , off Moss Bank Way , on Monday night .
The travellers ' latest move has caused concern among local residents .
One said : ' I saw all the caravans through the trees when I came in from church this morning .
I do not understand it .
The school always has football and cricket matches on .
What are they doing with all those vehicles there ?
' I know they come to Moss Bank Park quite often , but not on a school field . '

04:39 pm - Designated Driver
" Five G&T's , " I tell the bartender .
" And a coke . "
" Whoa , buddy , you gonna be okay to leave ? " he says , looking me up and down .
I 'm not big , I know .
" They 're not for me , " I reassure him .
" I 'm the designated driver . "
As he starts mixing , Jake comes in .
Looking around the bar , his eyes land on me and there 's a sudden flicker of recognition , followed by the halfway wave one gives to a familiar acquaintance whose name you suddenly realize you do n't remember .
But it 's too late ; we 've seen each other , so he has to come over .
" Hey … there … " he explores his way into the conversation .
" How 's it going ? "
" Hey , there , Jake , " I say , to establish that * I* remembered * his * name .
Kind of a dick move , I know , but I take satisfaction where I can .
I let it hang there a while before finally saying , " Andrew .
From the lab . "
" Andrew ! " he suddenly says with relief .
" The lab … !
Wow , was it that long ago ? " I nod .
" I almost forgot this place existed but I was just in the neighborhood …
Have n't been here since those days , now that I think about it .
Not since … "
His face scrunches , suddenly trying to grab the memory .
I say nothing , not yet - waiting for the others - and the silence lands on us like a brick .
Fortunately , it ends as quickly as it began as Eddie comes in .
" Whoa ! " he shouts as he comes over to us , struggling to remember who we are the whole way .
We repeat the re-introductions and marvel at what a coincidence it is that all three of us happened to just drop into the old hole - in - the - wall on the same day .
The coincidence gets eerier , of course , as Donald , then Jason , and finally Mick decide to drop in as well .
Six of us , all from the old lab days , all suddenly get an urge on the same day to drop into the corner watering hole that we have n't been to in years and years ?
The bartender sets the last of the G&Ts down behind me , plus the cola .
I hand one to each of them , keeping the soda for myself .
I raise my glass .
" To Harvir ! " I shout .
The others raise almost reflexively , then suddenly there is confusion .
" Who ? "
" Harvir ? "
" What ? "
" What 's going on ? " Jason asks , a little belligerently .
Mick is eyeing his G&T , the faintest hint of memory starting to tickle at him , I think .
" Harvir worked at the lab , too , did n't he ? "
I nod .
" He did .
Had a PhD in synaptic response time . "
Donald 's brow furrows .
" Oh … yeah , the Arab guy ? "
" No , " I say calmly .
" Harvir was n't an Arab .
He was Sikh .
It 's just that we all * thought * he was an Arab when … "
I do n't have to finish the sentence .
That September morning suddenly starts to trickle back .
Mick is still starting into his glass .
" What did we do to … "
But he does n't have to finish his sentence either .
Growing horror is showing on all their faces .
" How did I forget about … "
Jake starts , then chokes .
" How did I forget that we … "
" It was more accident than intent , " I tell them , " but it did n't change the fact that afterwards we buried the evidence in every way possible . "
I reach into my pocket and draw out the small glass bottle with five gelcaps in it .
As soon as they see them , that part comes back , too .
The lab did a lot of work in memory recovery , but along the way we learned a thing or two about memory suppression as well .
Unfortunately , the effectiveness of a safe dosage does n't last .
And so it is that every September 12th , subconsciously prompted by the memory of the date , my former teammates find themselves suddenly needing to drop back into the old haunt , the old familiar dive where we hatched about a million good laughs and exactly one terrible criminal conspiracy .
Fortunately , I 'm there with a bump for each of them every time .
Once they 're all set , I raise my own , untainted glass again .
" To Harvir , " I repeat , and they repeat , and then they drink .
" You 'd better get going , " I tell them all with a dismissive wave .
" You need to be home , or somewhere safe at least , when it kicks in a couple of hours from now .
You 're going to think tomorrow 's hangover is from all the drinking you do n't remember doing . "
Eddie looks at his empty glass .
" Nine years .
Do n't you ever want to switch out , Andrew ?
Let one of us remember for next year , while you get to forget ? "
I shrug .
" I know the formula best .
Still have connections in the lab .
No two ways around it ; I 'm the best choice . "
I start herding them actively to the door .
It 's like this every year - gotta physically push them out onto the sidewalk .
One by one , they start trickling away , each one unable to resist one last look back at me , knowing that tomorrow they 'll have once again forgotten that we used to be best buddies .
" Do n't look so glum , " I shout after them .
" See you next year ! "

Has Green ousted James from the No1 spot ?
David James may not have enjoyed the time off following the FA Cup final .
There were important saves from his rival Robert Green against Mexico and they reflected not only talent but decisiveness .
James is expected to start on Sunday in Graz in England 's final international before the World Cup and may hope for just the right degree of menace from Japan to let him show his worth .
In the past 13 months his one appearance for his country has come as a substitute .
All the same , Fabio Capello likes to stand by those who have served him well , as James did when fit .
There are few candidates of inarguable value .
Ben Foster started consecutive internationals against Brazil and Egypt in the autumn , but receded almost to vanishing point at Manchester United before being sold to Birmingham City .
Manchester City's Joe Hart is a candidate of sorts for Capello , but his two caps have come as a substitute .
Is King ready to play international football ?
Capello had sounded almost excited when detailing Ledley King 's sudden capacity to make regular appearances despite the player 's knee condition .
Even so those outings were all in the familiar environment of the Tottenham Hotspur team .
The defender was disoriented against Mexico in the early moments but he is accustomed to coping with Premier League opponents who are as good or better than Guillermo Franco .
While some allowances can be made , since King was representing his country for the first time in three years , he did not present himself as a challenger to John Terry or Rio Ferdinand .
Capello has to continue trusting that Ferdinand , removed at half - time on Monday , is fit to make the repeated appearances that eluded him with United in the Premier League .
Who can be the holding midfielder if Barry is unfit ?
James Milner fluffed the audition for central midfield , where he looked mundane .
Michael Carrick was as out of form for his country as he had been for his club .
It was even easier than usual to see why the customarily trenchant Capello has been prepared to wait and hope with regard to Gareth Barry 's injury .
The Italian , all the same , was immediately vindicated in his claim that Steven Gerrard would prosper with his country irrespective of the season of toil with Liverpool .
In fact it may been sheer relief at being in England colours that added to the brightness as verve coursed through Gerrard once more .
It will help , too , when Frank Lampard comes back into the side , but Capello badly needs a dependable holding midfielder .
With Barry in questionable condition , this is turning into the critical issue .
Is Walcott or Lennon the better bet at right wing ?
There were only 13 minutes remaining when Theo Walcott was removed .
Capello wanted to study him at length but will appreciate that the quality of his contribution can fluctuate from moment to moment .
The hat - trick in Zagreb came when the opposition were taken by surprise , as they no longer are .
Walcott was a substitute as often as a starter for Arsenal last season .
Aaron Lennon appears to have more to offer and may be asked to prove it against Japan .
Adam Johnson has caught the eye very late , but he is a different type of winger and a five - minute stint on his debut might have brought a penalty had he not insisted on staying on his feet .
Where width is concerned , England will be glad to reinstate Ashley Cole , the Chelsea left - back who has matured to such an extent that his defending and overlapping are equally assured .
Glen Johnson , on the right , was explosive when scoring against Mexico , but it is unsettling that Jamie Carragher , a 32 - year - old centre - half , seems to be the cover for him .
Which strike partner brings the best out of Rooney ?
It was understandable that Capello should turn to Peter Crouch when Emile Heskey had slid into the obscurity of the bench at Aston Villa .
The Tottenham forward had a worthwhile outing against Mexico , where he made a goal for King , scored a dubious one himself and looked uncommonly aggressive .
Those strong points were outweighed by the fact that he does not complement England 's key player all that well .
It could be that Wayne Rooney was actually undermined by injury niggles , but there was no instinctive rapport with Crouch .
The bond with Heskey , on the other hand , was beyond both explanation and the opposition 's control in the qualifiers .
Capello is too smart to take it for granted that the ploy will go on devastating opponents and , in any case , it would be irresponsible not to fret over Heskey and his unhappy form .
An alternative approach has not been found and time is running out .
[ Update :
This press release came out a few weeks ago , so it 's not exactly breaking news as I originally put in the title -- I removed that word .
Interestingly to me , I did n't see any mention of it in the usual places I haunt , which means it 's not getting the coverage it deserves .
But my conclusions in this post are still solid ; Climategate is a manufactured controversy , the mainstream media need to cover this , and denialists are still wrong . ]
Score yet another one for reality : a panel of six scientists have investigated the University of East Anglia 's Climate Research Unit -- the target of the so - called " climategate " -- and has cleared them of " any deliberate scientific malpractice " .
Moreover , they found that while the scientists at the CRU could have been better organized and could use some assistance from statistics professionals , their overall methodology is sound .
In other words , the major cries of foul from global warming deniers when it came to climategate are turning into whimpers .
As a backstory , you may wish to read two earlier posts I wrote on this topic , the first introducing climategate , and a second following up to clarify some points .
Basically , some emails from climate scientists were leaked by a still - unknown hacker , and to some people it indicated knowingly fraudulent activity by the scientists .
However , those of us familiar with the way science and scientists actually work knew from the start there was nothing nefarious going on .
When the emails were made public , a lot of noise came from the usual places .
The deniers went into overdrive .
But it turns out they were just spinning their wheels .
This is the second investigation to show nothing bad was going on ; the first was from a Parliamentary committee which also cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing .
So now we have a panel of politicians as well as a panel of scientists , both of whom have concluded that the CRU scientists are honest .
Kinda makes you wonder where Inhofe and Cuccinelli are going , does n't it ?
The specific conclusions of this new panel are pretty interesting .
Here are some choice quotes :
We saw no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research Unit and had it been there we believe that it is likely that we would have detected it .
Rather we found a small group of dedicated if slightly disorganised researchers who were ill - prepared for being the focus of public attention .
As with many small research groups their internal procedures were rather informal .
That made me smile ; that 's almost exactly what I said when this whole non-story broke .
The way scientists talk to each other uses a kind of informal shorthand that packs a lot of meaning into a few words , but to people unfamiliar with it makes it sound like the scientists are goofballs .
It 's like the way scientists use the word " theory " to mean a rock solid fact , while to the public it means little more than a guess .
The words used by the scientists in their hacked emails were taken grossly out of context by denialists ( and run with by the media , not so shockingly ) .
This made me happy too :
A host of important unresolved questions also arises from the application of Freedom of Information legislation in an academic context .
We agree with the CRU view that the authority for releasing unpublished raw data to third parties should stay with those who collected it .
Scientific data is not easy to understand by people unfamiliar with it , and simply releasing it will lead to politically - driven misuse .
I guarantee it , and we have plenty of evidence that will happen .
I am not saying that science should be kept secret ; I am saying that people train their whole lives to work with data , and people who are inexperienced are unlikely to understand how to interpret it .
That 's not an insult to non-scientists ; I would n't want a random passenger flying my airplane or someone off the street performing brain surgery on me either .
There 's a reason why some professions take decades of training and experience .
The panel did mildly chastise the scientists in one area :
We cannot help remarking that it is very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians .
Indeed there would be mutual benefit if there were closer collaboration and interaction between CRU and a much wider scientific group outside the relatively small international circle of temperature specialists .
I have no issue with this ; it can't hurt to talk to statisticians .
I 'd welcome that sort of thing .
I expect the scientists at the CRU felt they had a handle on the stats , but I also suspect they could use some input from other professionals as well .
As far as the public understanding of this situation goes , these next two bits are critical :
The Unit has demonstrated that at a global and hemispheric scale temperature results are surprisingly insensitive to adjustments made to the data and the number of series included .
A lot of the deniers are talking about how the scientists worked with the data , introducing all sorts of errors and inaccuracies .
The panel concluded these claims are hollow .
The data are robust , and what the scientists did was fine .
And finally :
We believe that CRU did a public service of great value by carrying out much time - consuming meticulous work on temperature records at a time when it was unfashionable and attracted the interest of a rather small section of the scientific community .
OK , got that ?
This is n't a cabal of craven , greedy scientists trying to bilk the public out of grant money .
This is a group of people who , when they started this research , were bucking the establishment .
They worked incredibly hard with tedious data to try to solve what they felt was an important problem .
And when they realized that the Earth was indeed getting warmer , and the climate indeed changing , what did they get ?
From scientists they got skepticism and healthy attacks on their data , as any scientist expects and in fact should hope to see .
But from the deniers they got hit with charges of fraud , of impropriety , of falsifying results , and of any other mud they hoped would stick .
That mud is looking awfully thin now .
There is still one more investigation underway , but that one is more about the procedure the climate scientists used rather than their results or methods of working with data .
With this second investigation 's conclusion , climategate is deservedly dying its last gasp .
The bottom line : the climate scientists at East Anglia 's Climate Research Unit worked honestly , and their results are robust .
And one final thing : I challenge the mainstream media to give this even a fraction of the attention they gave to the story when it broke .
I wo n't hold my breath .
Tip o' the thermometer to Slashdot .
I think swap is a widely accepted name for the function .
There is only the question of strictness .
I suggest swap for the lazy version and swap ' for the strict version
swap ~ ( a , b ) = ( b, a )
swap ' ( a , b ) = ( b , a )

The Bilderberg group will conduct its annual meeting June 3 - 6 in Sitges , Spain ( a small , exclusive resort town about 20 miles from Barcelona ) behind a wall of armed guards who will seal off the resort in a futile attempt to keep the event secret .
Bilderberg ’s meeting will follow that of its brother group , the Trilateral Commission , which will gather at the Four Seasons Resort in Dublin , Ireland May 6 - 10 .
Leaders of Bilderberg also attend the Trilateralists ’ meeting to map their common agenda .
About 300 attend Trilateral Commission meetings , which are conducted behind sealed - off , guarded floors of their hotel .
About 100 will attend Bilderberg , which seals off the entire resort behind platoons of uniformed police and private security .
Bilderberg hopes to keep the global recession going for at least a year , according to an international financial consultant who deals personally with many of them .
This is because , among several reasons , Bilderberg still hopes to create a global “ treasury department ” under the United Nations .
Bilderberg first undertook this mission at its meeting last spring in Greece , but the effort was blocked by nationalists in Europe and the United States .
“ Nationalists ” ( a dirty word in Bilderberg ) objected to surrendering sovereignty to the UN .
AFP ’s source pointed to the words of French President Nicolas Sarkozy in a March 29 speech at notoriously left - wing Columbia University , where he said , “ We should invent a new global monetary order . ”
He was clearly referring to the recently proposed world “ treasury department . ”
Bilderberg ’s ultimate goal remains unchanged :
Turn the UN into a world government with “ nation - states ” becoming merely geographic references .
The European Union is to become a single political entity , followed by the “ American Union ” and , finally , the “ Asian - Pacific Union . ”
The “ American Union ” is to include the entire Western Hemisphere , including Cuba and other offshore islands .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Like the EU , the “ AU ” will have a legislature , executive commission and head of state which can impose laws on member nations .
There is to be an EU - like common currency , removing each member state ’s symbol of sovereignty .
The “ Asian - Pacific Union , ” or “ APU , ” is to follow a similar path .
But growing public awareness of the evil agenda of Bilderberg and the Trilateralists has emerged as a significant barrier .
For decades , until 1975 when The Spotlight emerged , the blackout was 100 percent complete worldwide .
( The Spotlight is AFP ’s lineal ancestor . )
Today , in Europe , major metropolitan newspapers and broadcast outlets give both groups heavy , front - page attention .
In the United States , independent newspapers and broadcast stations give Bilderberg extensive coverage .
But the major newspapers and network broadcasters maintain a complete blackout in the United States .
That ’s because their executives have attended these meetings on lifetime promises of secrecy .
The hypocritical owners of The Washington Post have attended since 1954 .
The Post ’s chairman , Donald Graham , and associate editor , Jimmy Lee Hoagland , have attended each meeting for years .
But as public awareness grows , so does patriotic resistance .
There is strong resistance throughout Europe to increasing the powers of the EU at the cost of national sovereignty .
In the United States , there is growing resistance to the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement , which would eliminate borders between the United States , Mexico and Canada .
NAFTA is to expand , under Bilderberg - Trilateral plans , to include the entire hemisphere and evolve into the “ American Union . ”
In the 1990s , Bilderberg was confident that the “ American Union ” would be established by the year 2000 .
A decade later , they are still fighting — and losing — the battle .

Comment on this article
I blogged about Burton and Sierra briefly yesterday morning trying to keep it as unbiased as possible ; keeping with that spirit I wanted to get my economics on .
Let ’s get some details out of the way , first .
People get bent out of shape because Sierra is allegedly using discounts trying to superwin , but Burton at one time tried to claim intellectual property on the entire idea of “ snowboarding ” , essentially trying to take royalties on every snowboard ever made by anyone , anywhere , ever .
They ’re just looking out for their own bottom - line , too .
Burton is flexing their muscles more because they recently entered the retail game , with their own direct - to - consumer sales on the interhighway and flagship stores .
But you know what ?
They ’re only doing this to make more money and take more market share .
Double - standard , anyone ?
The fact of the matter is that even with the discounts , the internet only accounts for ~ 18 % of snowboards and ~ 25 % of softgoods sales , so they ’re hardly “ ruining ” the industry ( via Transworld Business ) .
Consider the Spin
If the retailers were banding together to keep prices high , people would raise hell over price - gouging , collusion , and cartelization .
This is not different , it ’s just being spun differently .
When some retailers break stride with the industry and buck trends , ( of course they ’re just trying to make money , but that ’s not a freaking crime , yet ) , the competition ’s spin-factories start working over time , pumping out the “ RUINZ TEH INDUSTRY ” arguments , and you take it hook , line , and sinker .
Unbelievable .
Plus , I kinda thought everyone liked low prices ?
Remember when CD players cost like $ 700 ?
Or when a 128 kb mp3 player cost like $ 150 ?
They give those things away now for about $ 20 .
The companies are still making money , and we ’re all happier for it .
Do Discounts Ruin the Industry ?
One popular argument is based on the “ war chest ” myth , really an economic fallacy .
It goes like this : the big corporation has a ” war chest ” of monopoly profits which it uses to sustain itself while taking price and driving its competition out of business , after which point it will raise prices again and thus be bad for everyone in the long run .
The “ war chest ” argument is total B.S. for at least two obvious reasons :
They do n’t have a war chest of monopoly profits .
Taking price on large market share means taking losses on volume , it ’s the equivalent of doubling each losing bet while playing blackjack .
It ’s simply not a sustainable business model to sell product below cost , and nobody who uses this tactic remains in business for long .
What I said before is important , and true :
[ O] nline and discount sales has n’t killed any industry yet .
But we constantly hear about how it ’s going to destroy snowboarding or the music industry or whatever .
What it does do is to force change in the way things are done . …
It ’s the organizations which are most able to adapt to changing pressures that succeed in the long run .
The “ online ” is changing the way product is pushed to consumers , and in many ways this game is still evolving .
This is the nature of our dynamic environment , there is no stasis .
People are always going to try and find a better , faster , cheaper way to do things .
Thirty years ago the airline industry told the FAA that Southwest Airlines was going to destroy the airline industry .
Did n’t happen ( what did happen was air - travel became more accessible and affordable to more people ) .
In the long run , competition benefits all of us .
It ’s Not Fair to Small Retailers and “ Core ” Shops !
An important lesson in economics and law is that most legislation aimed at fostering “ competition ” in order to “ save the industry ” usually ends up protecting certain competitors at the expense of the consumers .
The correct response to “ it ’s not fair to the small retailers ” is that what ’s “ not fair ” is the MSRP agreement in the first place .
Of course there is inequity because Sierra has the clout to reneg on this agreement , but the root of the problem is ultimately market - power gained in an unfree market .
Keep this in mind at all times .
If the manufacturer wants to prop up the small retailers , then charge a higher price and do n’t give bulk discounts to the online megastores ; build their “ minimum acceptable price ” in to the wholesale price and discriminate against different retailers .
Certainly a brand like Burton ( Anon , AK , Foursquare , Forum , etc. ) has the market power to do this .
Unfortunately , you could probably dig up a dozen precedents in anti-trust case law which would explicitly preclude the manufacturer from offering favorable pricing terms to certain retailers and “ unfavorable ” terms to others .
The fact of the matter is that “ core ” shops are going to survive .
They ’ll go online if they have n’t already , and market nationally as well .
This flattens prices and margins everywhere .
And they ’ll still thrive on foot - traffic and personal service .
H.R. 3190 – A Legislative Solution ?
Enter government …
H.R. 3190 recently passed the House judiciary committee , it would “ effectively ban manufacturers from dictating minimum prices to dealers . ”
But MSRP agreements are always forward looking and so Resolution 3190 ultimately is n’t going to solve the problem .
For the latest updates , follow @agnarchy on Facebook :
My take is that this is typical reactionary legislation that we should expect from government which is constantly trying to fix problems of its own creation .
Otherwise , if a manufacturer wants to “ dictate ” the price , they can ask ( i.e. , require ) their retailers to adhere to certain terms , and if the manufacturer disapproves of the retailers marketing / sales tactics , pull the plug like Burton is doing to Sierra .
Summing it Up
The idea that people would still be buying all this equipment at full MSRP if it was n’t discounted is in direct contradiction to everything we know about price theory .
All else being equal , for normal goods , people will buy a larger quantity of a product when it is offered at a lower price .
If there is excess supply in the market , prices need to drop to reach equilibrium and clear out inventory .
Someone once told me that every year Ferrari takes orders for its new model .
Maybe they get 1,000 people who put down a deposit to reserve a brand new Ferrari .
So Ferrari goes ahead and manufactures exactly 999 new cars , thus ensuring that they ’re not overproducing , in order to maintain command over a super - premium price .
Now , obviously I ’m not proposing anything that extreme .
It could n’t be done with the snowsports goods , anyways , but you get the picture .
There are brands out there that do n’t over - saturate the market .
Never Summer comes to mind , but they only make like 13,000 boards every season .
The Lib Tech T - Rice is pretty hard to find these days , too .
No idea how many of those they made , but what matters is they made approximately the right amount to command full MSRP on all of them .
The bottom line is that when you overproduce , there is going to be a loss on unsold merchandise , or a loss on discounted merchandise .
Seems to me like Burton wants their retailers to absorb the lion ’s share of these losses , and that ’s not “ good for the industry ” , either .
Full Disclosure : I ’ve bought merchandise from Sierra in the past .
I ’ve owned a Burton board ( which I coincidentally bought from Sierra at a super - steep discount ! ) , I love my Burton Cartel bindings , and some of my softgoods are Burton , too .
I do n’t have a vested interest in either side of the argument .
The London Evening Standard reports that there have been rumors in London 's financial district that Apple may be interested in acquiring ARM Holdings .
ARM 's shares shot up today based on the strong financial results from Apple yesterday .
ARM provides the CPU designs for Apple 's iPhone , iPod Touch and iPad.
ARM , however , also provides the chips for a broad range of mobile phones including Android and Palm devices .
" A deal would make a lot of sense for Apple , " said one trader .
" That way , they could stop ARM 's technology from ending up in everyone else 's computers and gadgets . "
The Register reports that the takeover offer is rumored to be in the $ 8 billion range , which would consume almost 20 % of Apple 's $ 41.7 billion cash reserves .
While a substantial portion of Apple 's reserves , The Register accurately points out that this would " send shockwaves " throughout the industry , as Apple would be able to withhold such chips from its competitors .
Money can't buy you love , but has helped United 's on - field success
Manchester United is still the most valuable football club in the world , according to Forbes magazine .
The Premier League title holders , who came second in a list compiled by Deloitte in February , again topped the table ahead of Real Madrid .
Forbes values United at £ 1.19 bn( $ 1.84bn ) , Real at £ 859 m ( $ 1.32bn ) , and Arsenal , in third , at £ 767 m ( $ 1,181 m ) .
It uses data on income streams such as broadcast rights , sponsorship and sales of tickets and merchandise .
Barcelona is fourth in the 20 - team list which includes six clubs from the Premier League plus Newcastle United who have spent this season playing in the Championship .
Liverpool , Chelsea and AC Milan all made the top 10 , but the trio's value had each fallen by 19 % in the 2008/09 season according to the Forbes calculations .
Juventus and Olympic Marseille had the two biggest increases in value - each gaining 9 % on the previous year .
Increasing sponsorship and media revenue meant " the news continues to be good for investors " said Michael Ozanian , national editor at Forbes .
However the average worth of the clubs in the list fell 8.5 % .
Paulette 's disappearance sparked a huge publicity campaign
A four - year - old girl whose disappearance last month generated much publicity in Mexico City has been found dead in her own bedroom .
Prosecutors say the girl , Paulette Gebara Farah , died from suffocation .
They say the investigation is continuing but her mother is being treated as a suspect in the case .
Since Paulette was reported missing on 22 March , posters and flyers of her had appeared across the capital , while news of the case spread over the internet .
Paulette , who had difficulty in walking and talking , was reported missing from her family 's flat in Huixquilucan , an upmarket suburb of Mexico City , on 22 March .
Her family and their friends launched an appeal for help in finding her .
Posters appeared in the capital of the blonde , blue - eyed girl .
The story appeared in the Mexican media and news of her disappearance also spread over social networking sites and message boards .
On Wednesday , as police attempted to recreate events on the night she disappeared , Paulette 's body was found .
Her body had been stuffed inside a black plastic bag and wedged between the mattress and the bed frame .
Prosecutor Alberto Babaz said that Paulette 's mother , Lisette Farah , was being regarded as a suspect .
When asked why police had not found Paulette 's body sooner , Mr Babaz said that they had been concentrating search efforts outside the home .
You got a new hard drive and attach it to your laptop / desktop but before you can use it , you need to partition and format the hard drive .
This can be done with a series of easy steps .
This is a small and easy tutorial which will show you how to use fdisk , one of very famous utility for disk partitioning .
Fdisk is the utility which we will be using for this example .
Though there are other options also like parted / gparted and use of them depends totally on personal preference .
For Fdisk , you need to provide the device name as an argument .
For that the possible options could be :
/ dev/hda
/ dev/hdb
/ dev/sda
/ dev/sdb
Where
/ dev /hd [ a-h ] stands for IDE disks
/ dev /sd [ a - p ] stands for SCSI disks
/ dev /ed [ a-d ] stands for ESDI disks
/ dev /xd [ ab ] stands for XT disks .
Hard disks can be divided into one or more logical disks called partitions .
The partition info is stored in the partition table which is present in the first 512 bytes of the disk .
By default , a hard drive can be divided into 4 partitions but you can have much larger number of logical partitions by dividing one of the primary partition .
And only one of the partition can be sub - divided into logical partitions .
Only for USB drives :
Before attaching the hard drive to your system , tail the system logs so that you could know whether the hard drive is detected by your system and some other details which will be used later .
tail -f / var / log / messsages
This is the default location of system messages in most of the OS's .
When you will attach your hard drive then you will see new entries in the logs like this Feb 8 17:49:29 Napster - PC kernel : [ 2596897.844838 ] scsi 4:0:0:0 : Direct - Access Kingston DataTraveler 120 1.00 PQ : 0 ANSI : 2

Attached SCSI removable disk Looking at the above output one can see some details about the hard drive , like The manufacturer of the hard drive
If this is a USB drive then whether this is write protected or not
What is the device name assigned to your drive , for ex in this : sdb
Out of things given above , right now the last point is the only one in whom we should be interested .
The last point says that our drive have got “ sdb ” name in the system .
This means that when you will do into the dev directory ( / dev ) then you will find a batch file like this .
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8 , 6 2010-01-09 16:27 sdb
If you are attaching a non-USB drive to your system then after restarting your system you should run this command
# fdisk -l

This output shows that we have two hard drives :
>> /dev/sda - 160 GB
>> /dev/sdb - 80 GB
As we can see from the output that the first drive is well partitioned , but not the second one .
Before going beyond this point , please backup your important data .
A small mistake and you will be ready to kill me :)
Now start with / dev/sdb partition .
Run this command
fdisk / dev/sdb
Output :
The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 19457 .
There is nothing wrong with that , but this is larger than 1024 ,
and could in certain setups cause problems with :
1 ) software that runs at boot time ( e.g. , old versions of LILO )
2 ) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
( e.g. , DOS FDISK , OS / 2 FDISK )
Command ( m for help ) :
You can press “ m ” which will show you all the help and the commands you can run into the fdisk interface
Command ( m for help ) : m
Command action
a toggle a bootable flag
b edit bsd disklabel
c toggle the dos compatibility flag
d delete a partition

This clarifies that we do n’t have any other partition available in this disk .
This will make sure that you are not going to erase your main drive .
After this we have to create a new partition .
For this either we can create 3 primary partitions and one extended partition .
Later on we can use extended partition to create more logical partitions .
But we do n’t really need 3 primary partitions .
So i will make one primary partition and one extended partition which i will use to make further logical partitions .
Command ( m for help ) : n
Output :
Command action
e extended
p primary partition ( 1 - 4 )
Now press “ p ”
Partition number ( 1 - 4 ) :
Now give the partition number which usually should be 1 .
Partition number ( 1 - 4 ) : 1
First cylinder ( 1-9728 , default 1 ) :
Over here you need to provide the starting cylinder number for the partition .
Leaving it blank will take the default to the starting position .
I recommend leave it blank and just press “ Enter ” .
Using default value 1
Last cylinder , +cylinders or + size{K , M, G} ( 1-9728 , default 9728 ) :
This is the value for last cylinder , means how big you want your partition to be .
Over here either you can give value in cylinders , or could provide value in KB / MB / GB .
Unless you are very good in mathematics , and could calculate that exactly how many cylinders you will be needing for your partition space , I will suggest to use MB / GB .
In this example i will make a partition of 20GB .
Last cylinder , +cylinders or + size{K , M, G} ( 1-19457 , default 9728 ) : 20G
This will create a primary partition of 20 GB .
After this we will create a extended partition .
Extended partition is nothing but a way of fooling system .
A system does n’t allow you to create more than 4 partitions , so a work around for this is to create a single partition and then further break that partition at OS level to create more partition .
This is the same thing we are going to do .
Command ( m for help ) : n
Command action
e extended
p primary partition ( 1 - 4 )
select “ e ” over here
Partition number ( 1 - 4 ) :
I would recommend to give “ 4 ” to the extended partition because in future if more than one primary partition is needed then you are free to create 2 more primary partitions at number 2 and 3 .
Partition number ( 1 - 4 ) : 4
Again you need to define the size of this partition .
Over here there is one thing to note is that you have to create the extended partition with rest of all the space .
To do this , you do n’t need to provide any value to the system , Just keep pressing “ enter ” and the system will keep on taking the default values which is the rest of the complete space .
First cylinder ( 21-19457 , default 21 ) :
Using default value 21
Last cylinder , +cylinders or + size{K , M, G} ( 21-9728 , default 9728 ) :
Using default value 9728
This is not the end .
You ca n’t use the extended partition just like that .
It needs to be partitioned further to make it usable into logical partitions .
It ’s complete your choice or need that how many logical partitions you wanted to create .
Normally you can make at least of 64 logical partitions in an extended partition ( Again this thing depends how much you OS is supporting ) .
To create a logical partition follow this step
Command ( m for help ) : n
Command action
l logical ( 5 or over )
p primary partition ( 1 - 4 )
Now press “ l ” .
After that it will ask for the starting cylinder , for which use the default one and press “ enter ” .
After that it will ask for the Last cylinder , for which use the default one if you want only single logical partition or provide the required partition size .
I will take the default value and will create only one logical partition .
First cylinder ( 21-19457 , default 21 ) :
Using default value 21
Last cylinder , +cylinders or + size{K , M, G} ( 21-19457 , default 19457 ) :
Using default value 19457
Looks good .
After this the last task is to assign a file system to the partition .
This totally depends on your choice .
I will use “ Linux ” in the example .
Command ( m for help ) : t
Partition number ( 1 - 5 ) : 1
Hex code ( type L to list codes ) : 83
Do the same for other partition also .
After this just verify that the partition table is in the way you wanted .
Command ( m for help ) : p
Disk / dev/sda : 160.0 GB , 160041885696 bytes
255 heads , 63 sectors / track , 19457 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
Disk identifier : 0x7c97a33 b
Device Boot Start End Blocks
Id System
/ dev/sda1 1 20 160618 + 83 Linux
/ dev/sda4 21 19457 156127702+ 5 Extended
/ dev/sda5 21 19457 156127671 83 Linux
There is one thing to note over here .
Till this point whatever work you have done , is not really done .
It is just into the memory , so if you quit the fdisk interface without saving it , you will see that everything is gone .
So you need to save this work .
Command ( m for help ) : wq
w - save
q - quit
The partitioning is done but still your OS does n’t know anything about that .
For this you can do anyone of the following :
# partprobe
This will inform the operating system kernel of partition table changes ,
by requesting that the operating system re-read the partition table
# init 6
This will do the same thing by rebooting
That ’s it .
Now your hard drive is ready with two partitions , one 20GB and the other one of 60GB .

WASHINGTON — With a client list that reads like a roster of Fortune 500 firms , a little - known company with an odd name , the Talx Corporation , has come to dominate a thriving industry : helping employers process — and fight — unemployment claims .
Talx , which emerged from obscurity over the last eight years , says it handles more than 30 percent of the nation ’s requests for jobless benefits .
Pledging to save employers money in part by contesting claims ,
Talx helps them decide which applications to resist and how to mount effective appeals .
The work has made Talx a boom business in a bust economy , but critics say the company has undermined a crucial safety net .
Officials in a number of states have called Talx a chronic source of error and delay .
Advocates for the unemployed say the company seeks to keep jobless workers from collecting benefits .
“ Talx often files appeals regardless of merits , ” said Jonathan P. Baird , a lawyer at New Hampshire Legal Assistance .
“ It ’s sort of a war of attrition .
If you appeal a certain percentage of cases , there are going to be those workers who give up . ”

Dorgan , Grassley introduce another amendment for spending transparency
Steve Watson
Prisonplanet.com
Thursday , May 6th , 2010
The push to audit the Federal Reserve was given a fresh injection yesterday with the introduction of another bipartisan amendment to the Wall Street reform bill in the Senate that would force the central bank to reveal where $ 2 trillion in public bailout money was spent .
Sens. Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) and Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) noted that the Fed ’s continued secrecy regarding its emergency lending programs , even in the face of federal court rulings , had motivated them to introduce the measure .
“ The Fed refuses to disclose this information to the American people so we are taking Congressional action to determine how the Fed has used these trillions of dollars , ” Dorgan said in a joint press release .
“ The Fed has gone beyond was was viewed as its historical authority in the last two and a half years without any transparency or accountability , ” Grassley said .
“ Our amendment changes that by making the Fed ’s emergency loan authority subject the light of day . ”
Grassley is already a co-sponsor of the audit the Fed amendment introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt. ) .
Sanders ’ amendment is due to be voted on imminently .
If it succeeds , following the passage of a similar amendment in the House late last year sponsored by Congressman Ron Paul , The Fed may be forced to undergo a thorough audit by Congress ’ investigative arm , the Government Accountability Office .
Currently the GAO has no means of reviewing the vast majority of the Fed ’s monetary policy deliberations and decisions .
The GAO also cannot examine the Fed ’s transactions with foreign governments , foreign central banks and other global financial organizations .
“ How often do you have some of the most progressive members in Congress — and I include myself within that fold — working with some of the more conservative members ? ”
Sanders observed Wednesday .
Earlier this week it was revealed that the Fed is secretly engaged in an intense lobbying effort to stave off moves toward an audit .
It is pushing Senators to support an amendment by Sen. Jeff Merkley ( D - Ore. ) that would amount to a much more restrictive audit provision .
In addition to backlash from the Fed and the country ’s largest commercial banks , the thorough audit provisions face opposition from the White House .
Chief of staff Rahm Emanuel is reportedly working closely with the Fed to kill off the audit provisions at all costs to protect the power structure dominated by the international banking elite .
All three parties contend that an audit would politicize monetary policy decisions and threaten the independence of the Fed .
Dean Baker , renowned macroeconomist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research explains why such contentions are weak arguments :
I just do n’t see any legitimate meaning of that term , independence , that it interferes with .
We want them to make what they think are the best calls .
But after the fact , do they have to answer for it ?
Should they have to say that these are the calls we made , this is why we made them ?
Absolutely .
I do n’t understand how that is n’t independent .
So those are the two arguments , on the one hand the stigma that will be created if at some point it ’s known that banks go to the Fed , and on the other hand , that it somehow harms their independence .
I mean , the FDA has to give a full account , we reviewed this drug , we reviewed that drug , this is why we approved this drug , here ’s why we did n’t .
I do n’t understand why the fed should operate differently .
If the audit the Fed provisions survive , it may leave Obama no choice but to veto the entire financial reform bill .
The administration wants to see the creation of a large “ independent ” bureau within the Federal Reserve to police lending and other customer financial service transactions .
“ It creates one of the most important , one of the most powerful , all - powerful individuals in the entire federal government , ” Sen. Roger Wicker , R - Miss. , has commented , objecting to the autonomy the Democratic leadership would give the head of the bureau .
A veto on auditing the Fed would prove a very unpopular move , which is why the White House wants it killed off in the Senate .
A Wall Street Journal poll illustrates the overwhelming support for auditing the Fed , with almost 90 % saying a measure allowing Congress to audit the Fed should be passed .

Patricia Kaliati says men are unable to love more than one wife equally Muslims in Malawi have been angered by government plans to ban polygamy .
A spokesman for the Muslim Association of Malawi told the BBC the proposed law would discriminate against the country 's Muslim minority .
He said with about 6 % more women than men in Malawi , if polygamy were banned , many women would be left without a husband and become prostitutes .
The gender minister said the ban was necessary to prevent women from being abused in polygamous relationships .
She said problems occurred because men could not give their full attention to more than one woman .
I have only one wife , my dear wife ... but the moment they proceed with this , I will take a second wife
Imran Shareef Muhammed
Muslim Association of Malawi " When a man has two , three , four wives , they are not co-operative - one will be the loved one , " said Gender Minister Patricia Kaliati .
It had not been a hasty decision and there had been wide consultation about the matter , she said .
But Imran Shareef Muhammed - secretary general of the Muslim Association of Malawi - disputed this .
" The minister is lying - she did n't consult the Muslim community , " he told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
" We are totally rejecting it .
There are also other ethnic groups [ who practise polygamy ] and they also totally reject this , " he said .
" If these people go ahead banning polygamous marriages it means many women will go into prostitution .
" Every woman has the right to be under the shelter of a man . "
He said under Sharia law , polygamy was optional .
" I have only one wife , my dear wife ... but the moment they proceed with this , I will take a second wife , " he said .
Should the ban come into affect , those already in polygamous marriages would not be affected , but those who flout it could face imprisonment , the minister said .

In announcing his stunning decision to abandon negotiations with Fox in favor of doing a talk show on TBS starting in November , Conan O'Brien joked , " " In three months I 've gone from network television to Twitter to performing live in theaters , and now I 'm headed to basic cable .
My plan is working perfectly . "
But the best jokes all come from truth , and the truth is that the TBS move , while a shocker , is probably the smartest one Conan could have made once NBC squeezed him out of " The Tonight Show " chair .
Going to Fox would have been Conan repeating the same mistake he made in wanting " The Tonight Show " so badly , and in going through with that plan even after NBC poisoned the well for him by putting Jay Leno on at 10 .
Conan wanted " Tonight " because of what it once was - the Johnny Carson version he grew up watching in an era when the broadcast networks ruled all - rather than what it had become by the time he was due to inherit it .
Conan 's audience was not the " Tonight " audience , and at 11:30 viewers who might otherwise be on Team Coco were used to watching Stephen Colbert or Adult Swim , while viewers accustomed to 17 years of Leno - fied " Tonight " soundly rejected the new guy .
( Since Leno reclaimed the show , the overall audience has gone up , but so has the median age of that audience . )
Everyone assumed Conan would go to Fox , but that was only because Fox was the last of the Big Four networks without some kind of presence in late night from Monday to Friday .
But that kind of thinking is what led to Conan trying and failing to be accepted by the Leno crowd .
Sure , the broadcast networks are still the biggest game in town , but they 're not as big as they used to be , and success in television these days comes as often from finding and satisfying a niche - which Conan did splendidly for so many years on " Late Night " - as from trying to bring in a bigger , more diverse , less engaged crowd .
TBS does n't have the audience Fox has , but it has more money to spend .
It 's one of the biggest outfits in cable , and cable has an unfair financial advantage over the networks : where broadcasters like NBC and Fox only make money from advertising , a TBS makes money from both ads and cable subscriber fees .
So they can afford to spend more on Conan ( all reports on Monday suggested the TBS deal was much bigger than anything Fox was offering ) while also living with lower ratings , where NBC had to pull the plug on Conan 's " Tonight " ( which was getting viewership numbers much higher than he 'll likely get on TBS for a while , if ever ) after only a few months .
Fox , on the other hand , not only had to limit its financial risk , but had to battle with local affiliate stations to air a Conan show at 11 or even 11:30 , when many of those affiliates would rather air lucrative repeats of " Seinfeld , " " The Simpsons , " et al .
TBS has no affiliates to please ; when Conan 's show launches in November , it 'll be on at the same time everywhere you get TBS , which is virtually every cable supplier in the country .
( And in the process , Conan will push incumbent TBS latenight host George Lopez to midnight .
But where Conan balked at NBC 's attempt to push him back to midnight by a Leno return to 11:35 , TBS ' official party line is that Lopez asked Conan to come on board .
If true , he no doubt figured that a show at midnight with a Conan lead - in was a better long - term bet than a show at 11 with sitcom reruns as a lead - in . )
If Conan went to Fox , he'd be fighting for a slice of the same aging ( and less lucrative ) pie that still turns to the networks for late night comedy , and he'd be starting out with a show that , at best , would have aired at 11 o'clock in 70 % of the country .
Every tenth of a percentage point up or down would have been analyzed to death by the media , and chances are it still would n't have worked .
At TBS , he 's suddenly the channel 's biggest star , and yet overall expectations will be much lower than they 'd be at Fox .
He 'll also hopefully have more freedom to experiment with the form , and to focus more on the things he does best ( absurdist comedy ) and less on the traditional areas where he's not that interesting ( the promotional interviews ) .
Conan can joke about going from broadcast to basic cable , but the fact is we 're on at least our second generation of Americans to grow up with cable in the home , and for whom TBS and CBS are two equal channels in the same DVR programming guide .
In his final , moving moments as host of " The Tonight Show , " Conan asked of his viewers , " Please do n't be cynical .
I hate cynicism - it's my least favorite quality and it does n't lead anywhere .
Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get .
But if you work really hard and you 're kind , amazing things will happen . "
A cynic might suggest that Conan was settling with this decision .
But in the long run , I suspect he 's going to be much happier - and in a much better position from which to attempt amazing things - than if he'd gone to Fox just because he felt he had to stay in the broadcast network game .

In einer US - Talkshow ließ Springer - Chef Döpfner den digitalen Medienmacher heraushängen .
Die Applikation seiner Zeitung " Welt " für das iPad ist laut Medientests aber voller Fauxpas .
Ein Deutscher in einer US - Talksendung : Dienstagabend war Mathias Döpfner , Chef des Axel - Springer - Verlages im öffentlich - rechtlichen PBS bei " Charlie Rose " zu Gast und sprach über " Business " .
Heißt in diesem Fall : die Zukunft der Medien und - über das iPad.
Die Tageszeitung " Welt " aus Döpfners Verlag war das einzige deutsche Medium , das zum Verkaufsstart von Apples iPad Anfang April auf dem Tablet - Computer vertreten war .
" Jeder Verleger auf der ganzen Welt sollte sich einmal am Tag hinsetzen , beten und Steve Jobs für das iPad danken " , meint Döpfner , der erzählt , dass er vergangenes Wochenende gemeinsam mit seinem Sohn in Miami ein iPad erstanden habe .
" Das ist der Beginn einer neuen Ära . "
Es sei einfach zu handhaben , habe einen Preis für den Massenmarkt , so Döpfner .
" Und es ist cool . "
Außerdem sei es das erste " lean - back " - Medium , eines für das man sich nicht nach vorne beugen , sondern mit dem man sich entspannt zurücklehnen könne .
Dass Journalismus in der digitalen Ära nicht funktionieren werde , glaubt Döpfner nicht .
Man sollte in der Hinsicht optimistischer sein , neue Möglichkeiten , die sich erschließen , annehmen .
Derzeit können die jeweils aktuellen Ausgaben von " Welt " , " Welt kompakt " und " Welt am Sonntag " über den " App - Store " im Abonnement gekauft werden ( 29,99 Euro für " Welt " , 7,99 Euro für " Welt am Sonntag " pro Monat ) .
Der deutsche Online - Dienst netzwertig.com hat das " Welt " - Angebot getestet , meint allerdings , es sei sein Geld nicht wert :
Erst suche man im App - Store lange mit dem Stichwort " Welt " , nur um herauszufinden , dass die " Welt " unter " iKiosk " läuft - weil später auch andere Verlagstitel dort angeboten werden sollen .
Außerdem gibt es laut netzwertig.com keine Hyperlinks im Text : Will man einen
Text auf Seite 23 lesen , müsse man dorthin " blättern " .
Und : " Die Bilder sind pixelig , die Typografie viel unschärfer als sonst bei iPad - Apps , und die Bedienung ist umständlich . "
Auch technische Fehler seien unter den Fauxpas des Springer - Verlages .
Here are a few more graphs based on the employment report ...
Employment - Population Ratio
The Employment - Population ratio ticked up slightly to 58.6 % in March , after plunging since the start of the recession .
This is about the same level as in 1983 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows the employment - population ratio ; this is the ratio of employed Americans to the adult population .
Note : the graph does n't start at zero to better show the change .
The general upward trend from the early ' 60s was mostly due to women entering the workforce .
The Labor Force Participation Rate increased slightly to 64.9 % ( the percentage of the working age population in the labor force ) .
This is at the level of the early 80s .
Many of these people will return to the labor force when the employment picture improves - and that will keep the unemployment rate elevated unless net hiring picks up dramatically .
Part Time for Economic Reasons
From the BLS report :
The number of persons working part time for economic reasons ( sometimes re -
ferred to as involuntary part - time workers ) increased to 9.1 million in March .
These individuals were working part time because their hours had been cut back
or because they were unable to find a full - time job .
March Employment Report : 162K Jobs Added , 9.7 % Unemployment Rate for graphs of unemployment rate and a comparison to previous recessions .
Replay of a Q&A with BLS experts is here .
The number of workers only able to find part time jobs ( or have had their hours cut for economic reasons ) increased sharply to 9.1 million .
The all time record of 9.2 million was set in October .
This suggests the increase last month was not weather related - and is not a good sign .
The blue line is the number of workers unemployed for 27 weeks or more .
The red line is the same data as a percent of the civilian workforce .
According to the BLS , there are a record 6.55 million workers who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks ( and still want a job ) .
This is a record 4.3 % of the civilian workforce .
( note : records started in 1948 ) The number of long term unemployed is one of the key stories of this recession .
Although the headline number of 162,000 payroll jobs was a positive ( this is 114,000 after adjusting for Census 2010 hires ) , the underlying details were mixed .
The positives : the unemployment rate was steady , the employment - population ratio ticked up slightly ( after plunging sharply ) , and average hours increased ( might have been impacted by the snow in February ) .
But a near record number of part time workers ( for economic reasons ) , a record number of unemployed for more than 26 weeks , and a decline in average hourly wages are all negatives .
I 'll have even more later ... Earlier employment post today :

The governor of the US state of Texas , Rick Perry , has posthumously pardoned a man who had died in jail after being wrongly convicted of rape .
It is the first time Texas has issued a posthumous pardon .
In 1986 , Tim Cole was sentenced for the rape of a student .
He always maintained he was innocent , right up to his death .
He had spent 13 years in prison when he died of an asthma attack in 1999 .
His innocence was proved by DNA tests nearly 10 years later .

Mr Cole spurned an offer of early parole as it would have meant accepting guilt .
Years after his death , his family demanded DNA tests after they received a letter from a convicted rapist confessing to the crime .
It transpired the man had confessed earlier .
He had sent letters to court officials four years before Mr Cole died - but the admission was never followed up .
Mr Perry said he hoped it would give Mr Cole 's family a measure of peace .
Mr Cole 's mother told the BBC she was ecstatic on hearing the news - as her son had always wanted to be exonerated .
He had written in a letter that he always believed in the justice system , even if the justice system had not believed in him .
According to Variety , the “ Coraline ” director , who began his animation career at Disney in the late ’ 70s , has struck an exclusive long - term deal to make stop- motion features for Disney / Pixar .
Selcik made his directing debut with the magnificent Tim Burton produced “ The Nightmare Before Christmas ” in 1993 at Disney .
His followup , the highly underrated “ James and the Giant Peach ” disappointed at the box office and marked the end of the studio ’s involvement with the stop - motion medium , citing it as not “ a viable medium anymore . ”
With his return , Selick plans to write and direct original stop- motion pictures as well as adapted properties utilizing the technology and creativity behind Pixar , resources that Selick was first made aware of during his years at CalArts with then - fellow - classmate - turned - boss Disney / Pixar head John Lasseter .
The deal comes off of Selick ’s recent box office and artistic success with 2009 ’s “ Coraline ” which earned $ 75 million at the box office and an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Film .
Pondering on the wondrous possibilities between such brilliant forces as Henry Selick and Pixar , one of my favorite opening lines from a TV series ’ theme song plays over and over in my mind : “ With our powers combined … ”
Truly with the craftsmanship of Selick and the ridiculous hot streak Pixar has been on since the dawn of the new millennium , moviegoers are in for some wonderful films in the future .
Now if Disney / Pixar can manage to snatch Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli , then Captain Planet , despite global warming , would still have reason to cheer .
Here ’s hoping .
The members of one of Australia 's most - loved bands , Powderfinger , have this morning announced they will quit the music business .
The band , led by frontman Bernard Fanning , told a crowd of media in Sydney that they would hit the road on their biggest tour ever , before disbanding .
Fanning read a prepared statement : " The Sunsets tour will be Powderfinger 's last ever run of shows .
" We have decided , after much deliberation and agonising , that after this final tour we will call it a day as a recording and touring band .

MoJo reporter Mac McClelland is getting one hell of a chilling story in Louisiana right now .
This morning she headed down to the area where , according to online maps , oil from the BP fiasco was headed .
Wherever she turned , she found sheriff ’s deputies blocking the beach access roads — until she hit a beach at Grand Isle , and literally stepped into the mess .
( Follow Mac on Twitter here . )
Here ’s what unfolded in her tweetstream :
Has oil made landfall in port fourchon , LA ?
Ca n’t look , bc cops turned us around at bridge to beach .
about 3 hours ago Oil just hit land in grand isle .
Blobs completely covering this shore .
about 2 hours ago Governor ’s helicopters are flying overhead .
about 1 hour ago
All these spots are blobs of oil .
about 1 hour ago Crude all over my fingers .
about 1 hour ago
These vacationers say there was no oil earlier today ; this shit all just started washing up , and it ’s already everywhere .
about 1 hour ago
This was when I realized oil arrived ; when I stepped in crude .
42 minutes ago 5 sheriff ’s cars have arrived .
No pics allowed , no more access to elmer ’s island .
27 minutes ago
The gov ’s office has arrived .
10 minutes ago
Mac says the sheriff ’s deputies who arrived at Grand Isle told her she could n’t take pictures of them , but did n’t keep her away from the beach — yet .
She ’s headed back to New Orleans as we write , but will be back in Grand Isle later tonight .
( Here ’s some more background from the local media , and more pix . )
UPDATE : Mac just called and noted that there are still kids on the beach , “ splashing around in this huge sheen . ”
This begs many questions , such as :
Why is law enforcement trying to stifle coverage of this horror ?
And , as our own Kate Sheppard ( follow her on Twitter here ) asks :
Why is BP still in charge ?
Kate has also been following developments intensely , live tweeting the BP hearings , and breaking the latest news — ranging from concerns over these so - called chemical dispersants to the rig owner ’s efforts to weasel out of responsibility .
She ’s covered BP ’s fumbling containment efforts , its second Gulf rig , and its shameless attempts to downplay the problem : 5,000 barrels a day indeed !
That ’s how much BP says it is now recovering , and this thing is so far from being over .
You can keep on top of Kate ’s and Mac ’s dispatches on our home page , Facebook page , and by following their Twitter streams .

Crime and policing are major battlegrounds in the election , as Conservative claims of " broken Britain " are contrasted with Labour claims of increased police numbers , reduced crime and a robust policy on terrorism .
Since I left the Metropolitan Police in 2008 , I have called for acknowledgement by all political parties that there are grave policing issues to be addressed .
Almost 50 years since the last royal commission on the subject , it is time to approach policing in Britain in a holistic and cross -party manner .
This is not going to happen before the election , if at all .
In the meantime , I suspect we may soon discover , when all the manifestos have been scrutinised , that those charged with writing the sections on crime within them will have cast their eyes admiringly across the Atlantic .
In November 2008 , a man named Chuck Wexler gave a speech on comparisons between American and British policing .
He is a frequent visitor to Britain , but his expertise lies in having been chief executive of the Police Executive
Research Forum in Washington , DC , the nearest body in the US to the Association of Chief Police Officers here .
The audience was a mixture of police chiefs , police authority members and politicians with home affairs briefs from different national parties .
Wexler has been involved in policing for most of his life and holds an honorary MBE for services to police co-operation across the Atlantic .
His message was unequivocal : the British police were better organised , trained and led than their American counterparts , and the mechanisms for holding them to political account were incomparably better .
Dominic Grieve , the then Tory shadow home secretary , was reported to be very irritated to have been invited to hear such views .
I would hazard a guess that any shadow home team would have been both irritated and surprised because , for the past 15 years or so , it has been a mantra among politicians of almost all stripes here in Britain that US policing is muscular , democratically accountable and effective .
I beg to disagree : Wexler is right .
There are some good things about American policing - there are some good police forces and federal agencies , including the FBI , and some very fine officers - but much police work in the US is characterised by chronic underfunding , political interference , chaotic boundaries , non-existent managerial training and poor standards .
Wexler knows this well , because his organisation , a voluntary association of police chiefs who have more than 100 officers under their command , has been struggling for years to do something about it .
But in this , US policing reflects America itself , particularly the divide between federal and state activity , and the contrast between the big cities , with their celebrated forces , such as the New York , Los Angeles and Chicago Police Departments , and most of the rest of the country .
There are 17,000 separate forces , often with a handful of officers .
Martha's Vineyard , for instance - playground of the rich , holiday destination of the Obamas and smaller than the Isle of Wight - has six , which may explain something about Chappaquiddick .
The division between local forces , state troopers , sheriffs and the FBI ( aka " famous but ineffective " , according to local officers ) has to be seen to be believed .
There are more than 50 federal law - enforcement agencies , including the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , which organised events at Waco , losing officers in the process before handing over to the FBI , with even more catastrophic results .
After 11 September , the department of homeland security was created ; it seems unfortunate that this remains separate from its equivalent in both the FBI and the CIA .
Intelligence - sharing is virtually impossible , most agencies are unable to afford to exploit ­advances in DNA and other technologies , and a co-ordinated response to emergencies requires creating expensive " fusion centres " to bring agencies together .
The 2002 case of the Washington sniper is a case in point .
The investigation was led by a very small force , with others coming on board as more incidents occurred in the many jurisdictions around Washington .
There is no equivalent of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary or a Home Office to enforce standards .
So what is it about the US that has attracted home secretaries from Michael Howard to David Blunkett and Jack Straw , as well as the likes of Dominic Grieve ?
Three things : localness , simplicity of accountability and apparent success , mostly , but not only , in New York .
The Americans have got localness right .
On Martha 's Vineyard , the largest department is in Edgartown ; it consists of about 25 officers .
These are mostly local men and women , and their chief is visible and accountable .
They are not interested in much that happens elsewhere , in cross - border crime or in counterterrorism , which are all matters for someone else .
Their citizens are satisfied and proud of their local police .
In this , Britain has much to envy .
Politicians admire the simplicity of accoun­tability in America .
Police chiefs are political appointments , coming and going with , or at the behest of , the mayor .
I was the 24th commissioner of the Met ; the NYPD and the LAPD , founded decades later , have had 41 and 54 chiefs respectively , not necessarily a successful formula for leading enormous organisations .
No reason needs to be given for dismissing a chief ; Sarah Palin allegedly sacked her police chief in Anchorage , Alaska , for his refusal to fire a junior officer embroiled in a messy divorce with her sister .
And many people think that Bill Bratton , the most effective commissioner of New York City , was fired by Rudy Giuliani for having the temerity to appear on the front cover of Time magazine as the man who had saved New York from crime ; Mayor Giuliani thought the accolade should be his .
( Giuliani later made Bernard Kerik New York 's top cop , after he had served a very short career on the front line ; Kerik is now serving time in a federal penitentiary . )
Our politicians have also been mesmerised by the turnaround in crime in New York but have not been prepared to analyse properly what lay behind it .
First of all , the numbers : at its height , the NYPD had 41,000 officers ; in London the figure has never risen above 32,000 , to police a city with a similar population but twice the geographic size , and carrying out functions that , in New York , are shared with the FBI , the Secret Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration .
Second , the costs seemed attractive : the NYPD 's budget appeared to be much smaller than that of the Met - until the Met itself , stung by the comparison , discovered that the costs of NYPD buildings , vehicles , technology and pensions are covered by the budget of the city of New York .
Third , the scale of the reduction in crime seemed astonishing , until one realised how terrible the problem had become .
Bratton used to illustrate this with an apocryphal anecdote of his first morning , when he asked a cop how long it would take to walk to the headquarters from his apartment block .
" No idea , " came the reply .
" No one has ever got that far . "
Bratton inherited a force that had been very lightly managed ; with the support of the chattering classes , he drove down crime by changing that dramatically .
But it came at a price .
A dreadful death in custody was dismissed by a mayoral aide as " collateral damage " .
The much - vaunted " zero tolerance " was , in effect , " targeted intolerance " and pretty ugly .
Crime is down , New York is safer , but its murder rate is still more than three times that of London .
Pick and choose
As Britain approaches an election , much of this background has been forgotten as the parties have picked and chosen aspects of US policing to include in their manifestos .
The Tories , for instance , struck by the apparent straightforwardness of accountability in America , in contrast to the complexity and general invisibility of police authorities here , want to introduce directly elected " commissioners " to recruit and dismiss police chiefs as Palin and Giuliani could .
They are right to highlight a problem with accountability ; the solution just happens to be wrong , because it threatens the most important aspect of British policing .
It took 150 years to develop operational independence - it should not be replaced with political acquiescence .
Labour , meanwhile , is toying with introducing neighbourhood referendums about crime problems ; these would be binding on local police .
Yet the slide from democracy through populism into vigilantism might be tricky , particularly in a ward that elects the BNP .
I am certain there are many things about British policing that can be changed for the better .
Some of those ideas may come from the US .
It would not be difficult to improve local accountability here , for instance , by introducing compulsory mechanisms for consultation using new technology .
The Americans have also been clever enough not to muck about with their statistics , with the result that when crime rises or falls , their public believes in it .
By contrast , the Tories ' home affairs spokesman , Chris Grayling , has found out that no proper comparison of crime levels is possible in Britain because we have changed the basis for collecting data too often .
But if he becomes home secretary , he will also find this does not matter , because no one believes the statistics any more .
I am not being complacent about policing in Britain .
Policing is a profession that deals in disasters , some of their own making , in Britain
as in the US .
That is unlikely to change .
My concern , however , is that focusing on America wo n't fix the malaise in British policing .
Unless our politicians let go of their fixation with officer numbers and allow the service to use far more auxiliary and ­support staff to free officers to get out of police stations , policing as a public service will become unaffordable .
We need to recognise sooner rather than later the problems of living with a fraying accountability structure designed in 1964 , when the police had neither radios nor ­internet , when international terrorism played no part in domestic life , when we had a citizenry schooled in the obedience of war .
These should be matters of cross-party concern , of equal weight to decisions about who wins and who loses between the three armed services .
It seems odd to have a strategic defence review without having something similar for the police .
But perhaps too many politicians have been watching The Wire .
Ian Blair was head of the Metropolitan Police from 2005 - 2008
We 'd heard a couple times that the Nexus One was selling at a mere trickle , but what we have n't heard is whether the phones that have sold are enough to generate a profit for Google -- and on its earnings call today , the company claimed for the first time that its superphone is indeed in the black .
Speaking both of the Nexus
One specifically and of the platform as a whole , the company said that " it is a profitable business for us ... we are driving the business to be a profitable business , " some of the strongest language we 've heard that Google intends to fully convert Android from a hobby into an integral part of its financials going forward .
On a related note , the company also boasted on the call that it's " seeing more than 60 thousand devices sold and activations daily , " which -- by our rough math , anyhow -- would work out to close to 22 million Android activations annually , and they 're now up to some 38,000 apps in the Market .
Certainly seem like these guys have cemented their position as a mobile powerhouse , does n't it ?
I lift the receiver and hear : " Adar ? "
In recent weeks the voice on the other side has become familiar to millions of people in Britain and around the world .

" Nick Clegg is speaking , " he says , amused .
" I 'm so glad to renew our contact after all these years . "
A few minutes earlier I was still involved in intercontinental conversations with a dozen other graduates of the College of Europe in Bruges , Belgium , recently dubbed " the Harvard of the European elite " by the British media .
Clegg 's dizzying success has n't surprised any of us alumni .
Many of those old friends are being hounded by Britain 's tabloid press these days , as they search for small crumbs of information to shed light on - or smear - the relatively unknown Liberal Democrat leader .
Eran Katz , the other Israeli who studied with us at the time , in the early 90s , has become well known in his own right , for the books he 's written on memory theory .
On the phone , Katz recalled how he helped along Clegg 's love affair with Miriam Gonzalez Durantez , a talented and attractive fellow student : how he recommended a romantic vacation spot in the Ardennes Mountains , and how , thanks to his intervention , or so he would like to believe , they eventually married .
The Spaniard Jose - Ramon Leon Lora , today the European Commission representative in Morocco , reveled as he remembered how he overcame Clegg , the undisputed star of the exclusive university with his candidacy for head of the student council .
Canadian Millie Stanisic , now a film producer in New York , is convinced she could have written the script even back then .
She recounts a conversation she had with Clegg in the college cafeteria in which she prophetically uttered : " The day will come , Nick Clegg , when I 'll be your guest at 10 Downing Street . "
Clegg laughs loudly when he hears this .
He has made clear during the election campaign that he is going for gold , betting all he 's got , and that he wants to be Britain 's next prime minister .
But now 's the time to put things into perspective : " We 're not there yet , " he says modestly .
His glowing performance in the first televised debate shuffled the deck completely , turning him into the Susan Boyle of British politics , and the campaign 's hottest story .
He has been called " the most popular British politician since Churchill , " and " the British Barack Obama . "
He has even been compared to Che Guevara .
The kingmaker
If the surveys are right , no party will win an absolute majority in the British Parliament today , for the first time in 35 years .
Clegg , who may take second place , will be the kingmaker who decides whether Labour governs Britain for another four years , or whether there will be an upset in the Conservatives ' favor after 13 years out of power .
He is the one who will decide whether a minority or a coalition government will rule ; and whether for the first time in 90 years , the Liberal Democrats will return to a position of influence , with the implications reaching all the way to Jerusalem .
On the eve of the election , he refuses to make any predictions .
He prefers not to talk about his ministerial preferences .
It all depends on " these untypical elections , " and " the great desire of millions for change . "
Instead , he talks about " an opportunity that wo n't be repeated , the one - in - a - lifetime chance to change Britain forever . "
In his mind 's eye he sees " a quick and radical shift in the tectonic plates of politics , " but he 's also cautious .
" Our message is that this time there 's no need to return to the old patterns and alternatives .
If enough people vote for the Liberal Democrats , then we can make big changes , " he states .
Commentators say that Clegg 's popularity lies in , among other things , the fact that he managed to steal the banner of change and new ideas from David Cameron and the Conservatives .
These new ideas include a new distribution of taxes to benefit the poor , more money for education , canceling an expensive nuclear submarine project in favor of investment in the economy , the development of ecologically sound " green businesses , " granting legal status to illegal immigrants who have spent at least a decade in the country ; and above all , changing the anachronistic election system which distorts the will of voters and which allows the candidate less votes than his rivals to take office as prime minister .
No joy in Jerusalem
Though Cleggmania is rife in the U.K. , Jerusalem is sunk in a Clegg - pression .
" Clegg is bad news for Israel , " one official here said .
" His party is running on a human rights platform , and the atmosphere is hostile to Israel .
We remind the Liberal Democrats of South Africa during apartheid .
Even if Clegg decides not to take the foreign portfolio , the very fact that Liberal Democrats sit in the cabinet is likely to mean trouble for us . "
In the wake of the Second Lebanon War and Operation Cast Lead , the Liberal Democrats asked for an arms embargo on Israel , and to suspend its preferential trade status with the European Union .
The party was also behind the demand to mark Israeli products made in the West Bank .
In December , Clegg was at the head of the list of signatories of a letter attacking the Israeli government for the blockade on Gaza .
" The confinement and punishment of an entire population is no way to bring about peace for all of the people of the Middle East , " the letter read .
Most of the bad blood was created by Baroness Jenny Tonge , a former Liberal Democrat MP , who became a member of the House of Lords in 2005 .
A year earlier , Tonge announced that if she were a Palestinian living under occupation , she would herself have become a suicide bomber .
In 2006 , she said that the pro-Israel lobby exerted a " financial grip " on her party and on Britain .
In February , she went even further and called for an investigation into claims that IDF soldiers who were sent to aid Haitian earthquake victims were involved in harvesting body organs from the dead .
Her remarks caused a storm and Clegg fired her from her job as shadow health spokesperson .
" Too little , too late , " a member of the British Jewish community said .
" In light of the blood libel , he should have expelled her from the party . "
Clegg , who called Tonge 's remarks " wrong , distasteful and provocative , " says that he is " a very staunch defender of the people of Israel , of a very staunch defender of the rights of the Jewish community here in Britain , a community which is feeling quite beleaguered at the moment because of the rise in anti-Semitism and the rise in prejudice generally . "
He recently criticized the cooperation of British Conservatives in the European Parliament with extreme right - wing parties in Eastern Europe , whom he terms , " nutters , anti-Semitic , and homophobic . "
" As to the accusations that I am hostile to Israel , my actions prove the opposite .
I have always sharply opposed various efforts to impose academic and cultural sanctions on Israel .
I am also one of those who said that Britain should not have participated in the Durban 2 conference when it became clear that it would turn into an anti-Israel event . "
" I have tremendous admiration for the state of Israel and its people .
When I visited , I was once again exposed to the genius of this nation , which has managed to maintain a democratic regime and a thriving and open economy , despite its existence under a constant threat .
This is a great achievement .
But we must distinguish clearly between the Israeli and the Jewish people on the one hand , and certain actions of the Israeli government on the other .
If I have criticism it is focused solely on these actions .
I plan to continue to voice my thoughts , which stem from honest and legitimate concern , and in my estimation that the long term interests of the people of Israel are not being met properly at this time . "
Clegg rejects speaking to Hamas " as long as Hamas continues to nurture an extremist ideology of violence and terror .
I totally understand the feelings of the residents of Sderot who are under constant missile attacks that are meant to impose terror .
My condemnations of Hamas have always been clear and unequivocal , and the same is true of my attitude toward the fact that Israel has the full right to defend its inhabitants .
That is the role of every country and every government .
" However , " he adds , " I do n't understand the Israeli strategy regarding Gaza .
The imposition of the siege against 1.5 million people , many of them young people who become increasingly itter , and the disproportionate use of force .
Operation Cast Lead did of course bring about a certain neutralization of the attackers and the missile attacks ¬ but did it reduce the bitterness prevailing between the peoples , did it weaken Hamas ' position , and did it guarantee Israel 's long - term security interests ?
I 'm not at all certain . "
Clegg comes out against Israel 's " continued development of the illegal settlements , " he welcomes the approaching proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority , and as far as Hamas is concerned , he says : " The only way to deal with Hamas is to work to split the organization between the extremists who want to destroy the peace process and those who are willing over the long term to recognize Israel and to work to find a solution in a non-violent manner . "
Clegg rejects out of hand the claim that the British public is today the most " anti-Israel " in Europe .
" Operation Cast Lead and incidents like falsifying documents in Dubai do create tension , but just as I would never treat any public criticism of some activity or other of the British government as an anti-British attitude , in the same way , British criticism of the policy of the Israeli government should not be treated as ' anti- Israeli , ' " he says .
In December 2009 , 51 of the 63 members of the Liberal Democrats stood behind a draft bill in the Parliament in support of universal jurisdiction , which allows private citizens to apply for the arrest of Israeli politicians for alleged war crimes while they are on British soil .
" I 'm very happy that we should review it , but it should n't be reviewed in a sort of panic .
It needs to be reviewed in a calm and deliberate way .
I was against the Labour government 's wish to try and rush through changes before the election , I think that 's wrong .
I think there are issues of principles at stake , which I would like us all to have a look at calmly after the elections . "
Looking to Europe
As befits a graduate of the College of Europe , 43 - year - old Clegg is undoubtedly a dyed - in - the - wool " European . "
He speaks five languages .
His Dutch mother was a captive in Indonesia during the Japanese occupation during World War II .
His banker father , who is half Russian , is the scion of an aristocratic family .
His wife , a lawyer , is the daughter of a former Spanish senator .
His three sons have Spanish names .
He himself spent more than 10 years in the corridors of the European Union .
This record is already making many people nervous , both in England and abroad .
Although he supports his country 's joining the eurozone , he says that this is " a totally mistaken move now . "
He cannot say anything else , in light of the fears that Britain will become " the Greece of Northern Europe . "
Nevertheless he declares that " we have to recall that the crisis in Greece stems from the fact that past governments there were not up front regarding their financial situation .
The fault is theirs , not that of the euro bloc . "
Between the lines , we can perhaps understand that he has not really abandoned the dream of adopting the single currency .
He is proud of the fact that he was one of the first to oppose Britain 's participation in the Iraq war .
His policy is to put an end to the era of being a " poodle " of the United States .
He wants to abandon the " exaggerated dependence " on Washington and at the same time to build closer ties with Europe .
Jerusalem is afraid that Clegg , who sees Washington 's approach to Israel as overly gentle , is liable to oppose joining future U.S. war activities .
" We cannot leave pressure on the Middle East to the U.S. alone , " he declared recently at a press conference .
To Haaretz , he says , " No country is allowed to embark on war only out of loyalty to its ally .
To this day I 'm angry about the way in which Gordon Brown and [ former British prime minister ]
Tony Blair - with the support of David Cameron and the Conservatives - decided to go to war in Iraq , in order to make [ former U.S. president ]
George W. Bush and [ former U.S. vice president ]
Dick Cheney happy .
That certainly cannot be a good enough reason for an illegal invasion of another country .
We must embark on military actions only when they are in our interest .
That 's why we supported and continue to support the international effort in Afghanistan .
As opposed to Iraq , Britain has a clear interest in the war in Afghanistan , in spite of the fact that we have growing fears about the way in which the war there is being conducted . "
Clegg rejects a military option in Iran too .
" If they were to convince me that there 's a practical option , then clearly we would have to consider it .
I have not been exposed so far to any proof that we can stop the Iranian nuclear program by means of an aerial attack , while a comprehensive and all - out ground war is not an option .
Our greatest ally against [ Iranian President Mahmoud ]
Ahmadinejad and the extremists in Tehran is of course the Iranian people themselves .
The opposition in Iran is widening and it's our best chance over the long term to neutralize Iran 's nuclear capability .
We must find the proper and difficult balance between putting pressure on the Iranian regime by expanding the sanctions on the one hand and creating the conditions that will enable the Iranians themselves to confront their leaders on the other .
Talking about a military option does not contribute to that - on the contrary , it makes Ahmadinejad 's life easy and enables him to claim that he is acting as he is because of the external military threats . "
As far as relations with the U.S. , says Clegg , they should be described as " special . "
" I lived and worked there [ at the University of Minnesota ] , and I love that country .
We have a common language , history and culture - it's a unique partnership that can not be taken away from us .
All that does n't mean that our relationship should become a subservient one , in which we automatically do what they tell us to do .
At the end of the day , Britain 's foreign policy , just like that of Israel , must be conducted in accordance with British interests rather than those of the White House . "
" In any case , I think that 's the type of relationship that President Obama and his White House advisers are interested in .
What they want is for Britain to be a strong force in Europe , so that it can influence the continent in accordance with our common transatlantic interests .
There 's no contradiction between being strong within Europe and being a close ally of the U.S.
On the contrary :
One is necessary to guarantee the other . "
When Clegg talks about " common transatlantic interests " he is of course referring to the Middle East as well .
" I tend to say that the European Union must stop being an economic giant and a political pygmy , " he says .
" Since it is Israel 's largest trade partner and one of the largest providers of assistance , infrastructure and money to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza - it must use its influence to bring about the goal to which we all aspire - a peaceful solution of old and bloody conflict , to bring about a situation where the two nations will live in peace alongside one another .
That has always been my perspective . "
Clegg 's attitude indicates that his recent stardom has not gone to his head .
" What goes up can come down too , " he says .
" The higher they lift you , the more painful the fall .
Those are the laws of gravity . "
But whatever the results , nobody in Britain today will question the fact that the election campaign that has already been described as " the most important since 1918 " ¬ when women were given the vote - will be remembered as such mainly because of one man .
His name is Nick Clegg .

Advertisement Rescuers are searching for survivors in the Rio de Janiero area of Brazil after landslides and floods left at least 110 people dead .
Officials said the toll could rise as many people are missing in the wake of the heaviest downpours in four decades .
The mayor of Rio has urged people in high - risk areas to evacuate their homes as officials warned that 10,000 houses remained at risk from landslides .
Forecasters say the rain will continue , but with less intensity than before .
" The city is starting to return to normal , but the rains are still intense , " Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes told reporters early on Wednesday .
He said 4,000 families had been made homeless and that 10,000 houses remained at risk , mostly in the slums where about a fifth of Rio 's people live .
Aid packages
All the major streets are closed because of the floods ...
Each and every person who attempts to enter them will be at enormous risk

Most of those who died over the past two days were people who lived in favelas ( shanty towns ) , where many houses were buried under mudslides .
The authorities on Wednesday raised the death toll to at least 110 people .
They said at least 43 were killed in Rio de Janeiro city after 28 cm ( 11 in ) of rain fell in 24 hours , but the neighbouring city of Niteroi was the hardest hit , with 60 deaths .
Health workers will distribute 70,000 aid packages to the victims of the floods , which have caused widespread devastation in the state of Rio de Janeiro , officials said .

The kits will contain food , clothes and medical supplies for those left homeless or cut off from the outside world because of flooding and mudslides .
The Brazilian government has also announced an emergency programme to re-build homes for families who lost their houses .
Mayor Paes said road conditions had improved , but he urged people not to travel .
" All the major streets of the city are closed because of the floods , " said Mr Paes .
" Each and every person who attempts to enter them will be at enormous risk . "
The flooding disrupted most international flights in and out of Rio's main airport and forced the cancellation of many domestic services .
All schools and many businesses were closed on Wednesday , but several government offices have re-opened .
Rains easing Brazil 's national weather service , Inmet , said Tuesday 's rainfall was the heaviest in 48 years .
ANALYSIS Paulo Cabral
BBC News , Rio de Janeiro
The rain is not so intense but the risk of new landslides remains high , as the soil of the hillsides is extremely wet .
Most of those who died were people in the hillside slums where waves of mud came down destroying everything in their way .
The topography in Rio exacerbates these types of problems .
It 's one of the most beautiful cities in the world because of the mountains in the middle of the town , but it can get nasty when it rains .
Ten years ago a census found 12,000 people lived in high - risk areas , but there have been new developments since then so the number is probably much higher .
Weather forecasters are predicting that the rain will continue for the next few days , but with less intensity than that seen in the past 48 hours , the BBC's Paulo Cabral reports from Brazil 's second - largest city .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , who was visiting the city on Tuesday , said little could be done until the rain let up .
" All we can do is pray to God to hold back the rains a little , so that Rio can return to normal , and so that we can set about fixing the things in the city that need fixing , " he told local radio .
A period of three days official mourning has been declared by the governor of Rio de Janeiro state and a state of emergency has been declared in the region .
The area has experienced a particularly hot and rainy summer this year , and meteorologists have forecast more rain in the coming days .
However , correspondents say heavy rain is more common in January than in April .
In January , at least 39 people were killed by mudslides in the resort area of Angra dos Reis , half way between Rio de Janeiro and Santos .
Are you affected by the flooding in Rio de Janeiro ?

After an intense day of play and exploration and question - asking , some conclusions on the iPad I bought :
1 . I will carry it with me on the trip I 'm about to take to California .
2. I will also bring my netbook .
When I watch movies on the airplane , it 'll be on the netbook .
I 'm right now working my way through an excellent series about World War II , produced in 1974 .
I have AVI files .
It is n't worth the trouble to re-process the files so I can watch them on the iPad .
( I may buy a movie in the iTunes store to see what it 's like .
Thinking of getting Fantastic Mr. Fox , which I saw in theaters , three times .
It 's one of those movies , like Fargo and The Big Lebowski that gets better as you watch it more times . )
3 . I love the way maps work on the iPad .
Much better than on the iPhone .
In some ways not as good as on the Droid ( after all that 's a Google product and the maps are from Google ) .
3a . I could have loved the way news works on this thing , if the NY Times and been willing to ship a beautiful reverse - chronologic view of their whole news stream .
They chickened out with a little mini - dip - into the stream .
It 's like sipping the news from an espresso cup when I want to be inundated by Niagara Falls .
( I said to Derek Gottfried this evening that the motto of the Times is " All the news ... " not " A teentsy taste of news ... "
A company whose mission was news and who was clear on that mission could never have shipped so little news .
But then Apple is supposed to be a company that loves computers .
See the next section on iTunes . )
4. iTunes is a crazy way to connect something as powerful as this device to local resources .
A nightmare .
Whoever thought up this way of doing things hates users .
It 's as mean as anything Microsoft ever foisted on its customers .
5 . As explained in the excellent Engadget review , I am one of those people who use a few apps in my work .
They all run on my Asus , most of them do n't run on the iPad .
And even if they did , they can't run at the same time on the iPad , so for my work , the machine is n't a fit .
The usual fanboy rebuttal is that it is not designed for what I do .
Absolutely correct .
6 . However , I have a mind and a lot of experience using computers , and designing software for them , and helping people use them .
I also work with people who are not very deeply skilled in computer technology , exactly the kind of people this product is supposedly for .
It wo n't work for them , because they need to multi-task too .
We learned a long time ago that inexpert users do n't use less resources , they just use them differently .
The argument that the Mac was n't a serious computer was nonsense .
I was there when all these arguments were fresh .
This is not a replay .
Keep dreaming if you want , but if you give the iPad to your mother expect the light to go on for you .
At that exact moment you will realize how poorly prepared it is for that .
7 . I 'm going to demo it for my mother tomorrow .
I expect to wow her with the map application .
But in so many ways it could not replace her Mac , although her Mac is terribly inadequate and confusing , with so many layers of contradictions .
Too bad this product is so far from being able to replace it for her .
I am , however , going to keep trying to get her to try an iPhone .
8 . I promised a verdict , so here it is .
With the caveat that it's after one day and I reserve the right to change it at any time : Today 's iPad , the one that I just bought , is just a demo of something that could be very nice and useful at some point in the future .
Today it 's something to play with , not something to use .
That 's the kind way to say it .
The direct way :
It 's a toy .
Writing Testable Code
Isa Goksu , ThoughtWorks Inc , http://www.thoughtworks.com
Every domain has its own best practices and disciplines .
Let 's think about an English teacher .
He has to follow certain practices and adopt certain disciplines to be successful in his job and write testable code .
He cannot sing a song , or use the sign language to give his lecture at its best .
There are certain methods and certain practices to follow .
These practices come from different experiences , people and time .
I 'm not going to explain how an English teacher should teach , I 'm sure there are many books about that .
My point was about " the existence " of different methodologies , practices and disciplines to follow .
These practices tell you not only how , they also tell you what , when , where and whom .
This does n't mean that you cannot create your own methodology .
However , it 's a fact that many people who tried to create new methodologies have failed .
I think programming is the art of translating business requirements into a computer language .
And just like teaching , programming has its own practices to follow and disciplines to adopt .
Test driven design , pair - programming , code - reviewing are just couple of them .
There are many books that explain all these practices / disciplines .
However , in this article , I would like to focus on programming from a different aspect : " Writing Testable Code " .
To me , this little concept is not getting enough attention .
And I think it definitely needs more attention .
Problems of Dirty Code Base
Developing new software is n't just about to accomplish the business requirements within the given time frame .
You have to think about the maintenance and support of the created software as well .
So what happens when we write dirty code ?
Basically you end up with a mess .
A mess which adding a new feature , changing the behavior of a component , replacing UI elements with the new ones , or any maintenance / upgrades that you could think of would be very hard .
Please notice that this problem has nothing to do with you being agile or your design skills .
This is about whether someone else can understand your code after development or not .
It 's about making yourself indispensable or replaceable within the team , or how easy it is to introduce someone new into the team .
Is n't Unit Testing Enough ?
Short answer is " No " .
Unfortunately we tend to think that if we have unit tests , it solves all the problems .
Well , this is obviously not true .
Unit tests are tools that help you to test your code whether it behaves the way you want or not .
It does nothing else .
In our case , yes unit tests might help understanding the code base .
However , the quality of the tests and the total test coverage in the code base is often case not good enough .
It is very likely to end up having only 45 - 55 % test coverage and 65 - 70 % quality in the unit tests .
Besides , having unit tests does n't prove that you followed TDD ( Test Driven Design ) practices .
So by looking at this picture , we can presume that " Unit Testing " is actually not enough .
Unit Testing vs. Test Driven Design
Unfortunately many developers still do n't know or do n't think about the difference .
The definition of testing methodologies differ greatly between these two designs .
As I mentioned earlier , " Unit Testing " is the practice of testing your own code to understand whether it behaves the way you want or not .
On the other hand Test Driven Design is the discipline of using " Unit Testing " when you design the software .
This small difference actually makes big impact on your software design .
Let me explain why :
If your development team is using " Unit Testing " ; creating the code base first ( even a single unit ) and write the tests after creating the code base , it actually means that you 're hanging yourself with " Unit Testing " rope .
The reason is every time you need a change in the design that affects your unit ; you will have to fix the existing unit tests too .
In the beginning it seems like a small problem , but it will be a real big problem later in the development phase since you will have lots of unit / integration tests depend on certain design assumptions .
And when this design changes , your tests will all have to be changed .
After some time you will also notice that your development team is spending more time on fixing tests than developing the software itself .
Moreover , it is very hard to identify " what to test " for an already written code than a code that you are about to write .
This is also why many developers that follow " Unit Testing " start testing the methods in the unit than the unit behaviors .
However , if your development team is adopting the TDD discipline , you will notice all these design changes will be identified in the early phase [ 1 ] by developers .
Writing tests first will allow you to discover the spots where new design is crucial , just by showing how hard / easy to write the test for that particular behavior .
On top of this , TDD will ensure that your unit / integration tests will be based on behaviors rather than methods .
As we all know , most design changes are just the separation of concerns within the unit / module .
Another way of saying this is , your responsibilities will shift to some other unit / module , but the behavior will still exist in your system .
As you can see , instead of maintaining the existing unit / integration tests , you will be just moving them to the new unit .
I guess this difference is a subject for another article .
What Problem Exactly Are We Talking About ?
Robert C. Martin has a really nice book about " Clean Code " .
This book covers lots of hints about agile software development .
I strongly recommend you to read it .
I want to quote something from the book :
" You are reading this book for two reasons .
First , you are a programmer .
Second , you want to be a better programmer .
Good .
We need better programmers . " [ 2 ]
What is better programmer ?
I believe Uncle Bob is not talking about the programmers who can write one - liners ( one line that does the whole behavior ) .
Once you read the book , you will understand that he is actually talking about the programmers that can write clean , easy to understand code .
I want to add one more thing to this , which was not in the book .
Better programmers are always replaceable in the team .
So how do we ensure that our development team consists of better programmers ?
Well , this is a topic for a book unfortunately .
However , I believe those are the programmers who can manage to write the simplest thing that could possibly work [ 3 ] , and they are replaceable anytime within the team .
Let 's look at the possible problems within a development team that are the symptoms of dirty code base :
When you introduce a new team member , it takes more than a day for him to start coding
When your team members are becoming more indispensable every new day
When you want to change the behavior of newly written code piece , it requires original developer to do it
When your team members are spending too much time on testing
When nobody could understand certain code pieces without rewriting them
When your team members do n't want to work on certain are a
When senior team members having hard time to mentor new team members
Yes , all these are the symptoms of dirty code base .
Why is this dirty code ?
It is a dirty code because all these problems are the results of some concessions while coding .
Concessions that make your code hard to understand , follow , change or replace .
And when you make some concessions , next developer makes his own concession on top yours .
So what are these concessions then ?
Adding too many dependencies ( create big object graphs )
Hiding dependencies ( i.e. within constructor , private / static methods , etc ) Making objects hard to initialize Creating so many execution paths from a single point Using train wrecks ( trying to use / access a method / property by chaining so many other objects )
Using too many arguments for a single method Creating longer methods / classes Breaking SOLID [ 4 ] rules Repeating yourself Over - designing / thinking And many more ...
In the next chapter , I will try to address some of these problems and solution proposals .
I believe if we try to make our code testable , we can take a good big step towards being a " Better Programmer " and having a clean code base .
And I do n't think these are really hard things to do .
Most of them are pretty simple and easy to accomplish by just paying a little more attention to details .
Testability
I would like to mention that this part of the article is not about software design .
This is all about paying more attention to details and focusing on testability .
All these items can be controlled while doing a code review .
Working with new code base and existing code base has different problems when it comes to testability .
For new code base , you can pretty much apply all agile and XP ( Extreme Programming ) practices .
On the other hand applying these practices to existing code base is not always possible .
In this article I would like to focus on new code base only .
However , I would like to write a separate article for existing code base and testability .
New code base is always fun to work with .
As I mentioned earlier , you can pretty much apply all agile and XP practices .
I will assume that you are already familiar with these practices .
If you are not , you can still continue reading .
However , I would definitely recommend you to look at these practices [ 5 ] in no time .
Too Many Dependencies
First rule of writing testable code to me is having a good dependency management within the code base , or at least having the least possible dependencies in your object / module relations .
Basically , when you refer another object within your object , you depend on that object .
When these object dependencies reach to a certain level , you would have unbreakable code pieces .
Or in other terms , it would be impossible to understand this particular code piece without understanding lots of other code pieces .
And sometimes this goes to deep and you would have transitive dependencies ; you depend on a unit , and that unit depends on some other units .
And this big chain of dependencies brings so much information overhead that nobody can easily understand the unit / module after a while .
Every dependency ties your unit to another unit / module .
It means without having that unit / module , you can not use your unit anywhere in the system .
However , having no dependency is very theoretical situation .
When you use database access , you would probably depend on the database layer in the application .
When you modify the customer details , you would probably depend on the customer service in the application .
So is this a problem ?
In fact , it is not a problem .
Having a centralized database layer or a customer service is always a good idea .
However , if your unit has more than 3 - 4 of these dependencies , then it is a big problem .
It means that , you are introducing more possible change reasons to your code .
According to " Single Responsibility Principle " [ 6 ] , your unit cannot have more than one reason to change .
Another aspect of this problem is the unit tests .
When you have too many dependencies , you will find yourself trying very hard to instantiate your unit while writing the unit tests .
Because you have too many dependencies , it will be very hard to instantiate the unit under test .
Let me try to explain this with some code snippets :
class CreditCard {
PaymentService paymentService ;
CustomerService customerService ;
OrderService orderService ;
EmailService emailService ;
// more dependencies ...
void charge ( amount ) { /* use these services ... */ }
}
And a possible unit test for charging :
testChargeNothingWhenNegativeAmountIsGiven ( ) {
CreditCard card = new CreditCard ( ) ;
PaymentGateway paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway ( ) ;
PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService ( ) ;
paymentService.setPaymentGateway( paymentGateway ) ;
CustomerService customerService = new CustomerService ( ) ;
OrderService orderService = new OrderService ( ) ;
EmailService emailService = new EmailService ( ) ; card.setPaymentService(paymentService ) ;
card.setCustomerService(customerService ) ;
card.setOrderService(orderService ) ;
card.setEmailService(emailService ) ;
// many more setups // and your test case
}
As you see , after 3 - 4 dependencies your code starts becoming unreadable .
So how do we solve this problem ?
Actually it 's very simple .
Keep the dependent units that have same reason to change together , and the rest separate .
In above example , Email Service has definitely different reasons to change than our unit .
On the other hand Payment Service , Order Service and Customer Service have more likely to have same reason to change .
So separating different concerns out of our unit would make it cleaner , and easier to understand .
And more importantly , it will reduce the dependencies of our unit .
To solidify above example , creating an asynchronous Email Job that uses the Email Service to take care of the emailing part will reduce the dependencies .
And / or replacing the logic that uses Customer / Order Service to find out some information about the Customer / Order with the information itself that Credit Card unit needs , will definitely reduce the dependencies .
If we can pay a little more attention to this little dependency chain , our code will be clearer to understand .
Hidden Dependencies
Another problem that comes with dependencies is hidden dependencies .
Hidden dependency is a dependency that you cannot see the dependency through the code easily and it is generally noticed in the run-time only .
Let me give you an example of it :
// .. some code
creditCard.charge ( ) ;
// .. some other code
When we run above code , we get an exception in the run-time that says : " Payment Service is null / not assigned " .
Then we realize that we forgot to set the payment service .
And we set it :
// .. some code
PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService ( ) ;
creditCard.setPaymentService(paymentService ) ;
creditCard.charge ( ) ;
// .. some other code
When we try second time running above code , we get another exception in the run-time that says : " Payment Gateway is null / not assigned " .
Then again , we realize that we forgot to set the Payment Gateway for the Payment Service .
And we set it too :
// .. some code
PaymentGateway paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway ( ) ;
PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService ( ) ;
paymentService.setPaymentGateway( paymentGateway ) ;
creditCard.setPaymentService(paymentService ) ;
creditCard.charge ( ) ;
// .. some other code
When we try one last time running above code , we get some other exception in the run-time that says : " PayPal Web Service is null / not assigned " .
After figuring out all the dependencies and set them properly , we can run our code without a problem :
// .. some code
PayPalWebService paypalWebService = new PayPalWebService ( ) ;
PaymentGateway paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway ( ) ;
paymentGateway.setClearingHouse(paypalWebService ) ;
PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService ( ) ;
paymentService.setPaymentGateway( paymentGateway ) ;
creditCard.setPaymentService(paymentService ) ;
creditCard.charge ( ) ;
// .. some other code
As you see , it takes 2 - 3 tries to find out all the minimum dependency settings for our unit .
And the process of identifying these dependencies wo n't make a big change for even an experienced developer .
You can think that having a dependency injection framework solves all these problems .
Yes , it will indeed solve our problem here .
However , it wo n't make your code testable .
When you try to test above piece of code , you will still need your dependency injection framework which is itself another dependency .
Isolating your unit will be almost impossible .
Besides , understanding the code is still another aspect of this problem .
Even though you have a dependency injection framework , it does n't mean that you code is easy to understand .
So how do we solve this problem ?
Well , making your dependencies obvious .
To do so , we can use one of several alternative methods .
My favorite is using Constructor Injection .
Constructor Injection is a method of injecting your dependencies to your unit in the construction time .
Let 's see in an example :
class CreditCard {
private PaymentService paymentService ;
public CreditCard( PaymentService paymentService ) {
this.paymentService = paymentService ;
}
// more code ..
}
If we try to use this unit anywhere in the system , it is very obvious that this unit requires a Payment Service to work with .
And when you try to test the unit , it is now very easy to inject a fake / stub / mock Payment Service which does n't require any initialization .
Another possible solution to this problem is , using method level injection .
Again , the idea stays same : make your dependencies obvious .
// some code ..
public void charge ( PaymentService paymentService ) {
// use this service
}
// more code ..
Dependency Lookups
Another dependency related problem is Dependency Lookups .
Dependency Lookup is a technique that comes from several patterns like Service Locator Pattern , Repository Pattern , etc .
The idea is very simple : Instead of instantiating the dependencies by yourself , keeping all dependencies in a central repository where every unit can ask their dependencies from this repository .
Although it sounds very good , it brings some complexity to your system later in the development phase .
One of the major concerns about Dependency Lookup is they are not testable .
Let 's see in the example :
// some code ..
Reader reader = Repository.load( Reader.class ) ; // this part may vary
// more code ..
So as you can see from above code , there is no dependency injection or hard - coded instantiation of the dependency in the code .
However , when you try to test this code snippet , you will find yourself in need of using this very same repository .
This is exact same problem with static method usages .
Any static / global access in the code is always hard to test .
Another problem with Dependency Lookups is you cannot easily see which implementation of this dependency is coming from the repository .
In above example , if you ask yourself : " Is this a FileReader , or StringReader or SocketReader ? " you will see that it is hard to answer this question when all of these implementations implements the same Reader interface .
Possible solution to this problem is extracting this snippet as a separate method .
And when you test this unit , overriding this extracted method and returning a stub / mock will do the magic .
Let 's see in an example :
// some code ..
Reader reader = getSocketReader ( ) ; // extract method
protected Reader getSocketReader ( ) {
return Repository.load( Reader.class ) ;
}
// more code ..
And when you want to stub this Reader in the test , all you need to do is overriding this method and returning a stub / mock equivalent .
class MyFakeUnit extends MyUnit {
@ Override protected Reader getSocketReader ( ) {
return new MyStubbedSocketReader ( ) ;
}
}
Now you can use MyFakeUnit in the test instead of MyUnit to isolate this dependency from the test .
Ideally you try to avoid using Dependency Lookups .
However , if it is there because of some framework usage , above solution will do the trick .
Object Initializer Blocks
Object initialization has two aspects .
First one is about the constructor / initialization block , and second one is about the usage of this object .
There are certain things that we should avoid while coding the constructor like hidden dependencies , switch cases , if clauses , loops , etc .
However , the most major thing that you should be aware of , to me is avoiding Singleton dependency ( one instance in entire system ) , and static method usage .
Developers mostly tend to load some configuration or a socket connection ( database , HTTP , remote , etc ) in the constructor :
class MyUnit {
private DBConnector db ;
private Configuration config ;
public MyUnit ( ) {
db = DBConnector.getInstance ( ) ;
config = Configuration .Load( Configurations .
SYSTEM ) ;
}
}
If you check the above code piece , you will see that db variable is using a Singleton object and config variable is using some static method to initialize itself .
So what is wrong with it ?
Well the problem is isolation of this unit .
As you see , it is impossible to inject any fake / mock DBConnector or Configuration class to this unit while we 're doing unit testing .
If your DBConnector instance is connecting to the production system , then every time you run your unit test , it will try to connect to the production system database which we do n't want it for sure .
Another problem with this type of constructors is that it's also causing the " hidden dependency " problem that we described earlier .
To solve all these problems , it is better to extract these dependencies and use the extracted methods instead :
// some code ..
db = getDatabaseConnector ( ) ;
config = getSystemConfiguration ( ) ;
// and the extracted parts would be
public DBConnector getDatabaseConnector ( ) { /* .. */ }
public Configuration getSystemConfiguration ( ) { /* .. */ }
Second problem with object initialization blocks is their usages .
It sometimes can be brutal because of the transitive dependencies .
Let 's see it in an example :
// some code ..
public CreditCard( PaymentService paymentService , CustomerService customerService ) {
// details ..
}
// and usage of this unit somewhere in the system
PayPalWebService paypalWebService = new PayPalWebService ( ) ;
PaymentGateway paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway ( ) ;
paymentGateway.setClearingHouse(paypalWebService ) ;
PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService ( ) ;
paymentService.setPaymentGateway( paymentGateway ) ;
ProfileService profileService = new ProfileService ( ) ;
CustomerService customerService = new CustomerService ( profileService ) ;
CreditCard card = new CreditCard( paymentService , customerService ) ;
As you see , all these transitive dependencies tie you up so bad that you cannot even do a simple initialization .
So how do we solve this problem ?
Well , if it would just be the matter of testing , we would inject fake / mock / stub services to the CreditCard .
However , we are talking about the real usage of this CreditCard class .
In this case , we have two options .
We either eliminate the dependencies , or we will look for a dependency injection framework .
My personal choice is focusing on the first one if possible .
If you were building an enterprise level system , then going for second option would make more sense .
Depending on the language that you are using for development , you can find lots of different frameworks that help you on injecting dependencies .
Unclear Execution Paths
Every time your program sees a conditional clause , it diverts the execution .
These diversions are called execution paths .
For instance , you would have two separate execution paths for the user who is logged in or not .
The problem is not about having different execution paths .
It is about abusing the usage of them .
Sometimes developers create 4 - 5 different execution paths from a single point .
And on top of this , they might even add some nested execution paths .
Check the following example :
// some code ..
if ( lineItem != null && ( lineItem.quantity > 0 && customer.isActive ( ) && ( card.expirityYear > 2010 || card.type == AMX ) ) || couponCode.isValid( ) ) {
// details ..
}
Can you tell how many execution paths this particular conditional case creates ?
I am not even sure if I typed correctly .
When this developer leaves the team , this business logic will be very hard to identify .
And moreover , how to test , or what to test here ?
As you see , it is really hard to decide .
" if " usages should be always under control .
If we cannot control , it means that we can not test it .
Ideally it is always wise to avoid any of if usages , if it is possible .
So I prepared a quick guideline for " if " usages :
Allow them when :
Condition can be expressed without " AND " , " OR " operators :
if ( myContainer.hasItems ( ) ) {
//...
}
Condition is about an encapsulated field :
if ( _visibility == VISIBLE ) {
//...
}
Condition is about non-float numerical comparison :
if ( items.size ( ) >
2 ) {
//...
}
Be cautious when :
There is more than one " AND " , " OR " operator :
if ( _isVisible && _isParent ) {
//...
}
// refactor it :
if ( canAddUser ( ) ) {
//...
}
There is a negative logic :
if ( ! _isParent ) {
//...
}
// change your logic and make it positive if possible ,
// positive statements are easier to understand
There is a very long condition because of variable / method names :
if ( payPalWebService.isClearingHouseAvailableForPurchasing(myLineItem ) ) {
//...
}
// extract a method and give a short name that tells
// the purpose of this condition
if ( clearingHouseReady( myLineItem ) ) {
//...
}
There is a " if/else " logic :
if ( _isParent ) {
number = generateItemNumber ( this ) ;
} else {
number = 0 ;
}
// ensure you forced everything to not have this situation .
// if you still have , try doing something like :
number = 0 ;
if ( _isParent ) {
number = generateItemNumber ( this ) ;
}
Do n't allow when :
It is just a " NULL " check :
if ( user != null ) {
//...
}
// try not having a null user in the first place .
// if you do n't know how to avoid , please refer to my other article [ 7 ]
There are more than two " AND " , " OR " operators :
if (( _isVisible && !isParent ) || iAmMaster || youCanPassIsSet ) {
//...
}
// avoid having multiple conditions in one clause .
// if you already have , extract a method out of it :
if ( isValid ( ) ) {
//...
}
There is nested " if/else " statement :
if ( isThisTrue ) {
if ( checkIfHeIsTheMaster ( ) && !hmmmThisSeemsWeird ( ) ) {
// do something ...
} else {
// do something else ...
}
} else {
// do some other thing ...
}
// you should never have this situation .
// try using well known OOP technique called POLYMORPHISM ,
// or if the operator is one of ( > , < , == ) then various possible
// design patterns like Strategy ( behavior modification ) ,
// Visitor ( context evaluation ) or Specification ( item selection ) .
// if you 're not happy , but you do n't know what to do then talk
// to someone you think he / she might know .
If you can follow above guideline , it will be really easy to test your code since identifying execution paths , and creating test coverage for them will be very obvious .
Train Wrecks
" Train Wrecks " is a term used to refer too many object messaging in one line .
For instance :
object.message ( ) ; // this is a normal call
object.someOtherObject.someService.getMeSomeInfo( ) ; // this is a train wreck
As you see , reading the second line and understanding the components of it takes some time .
It also violates " Law of Demeter " [ 8 ] which has only 3 rules to watch :
Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units : only units " closely " related to the current unit .
Each unit should only talk to its friends ; do n't talk to strangers .
Only talk to your immediate friends .
Even though having train wreck expressions seems useful , it could be a real pain when you get an exception in that particular line .
Identifying the source of that exception always takes more time than a simple expression .
Also your components become tightly coupled .
Later in the design , untying these dependencies would be really hard .
So how do we solve this problem ?
Basically , avoid the train wrecks , and just follow the 3 rules above .
Conclusion
I hope this opens your vision a bit .
It is very hard for me to cover everything here .
I 'm sure all the examples I gave might have exceptional cases depending on the context .
However , all these things are all about paying more attention .
As you can see from above examples , all of them can be easily done while doing pair programming or code reviews .
Writing clean code , making your code testable is not hard ; it is very easy indeed if you do pay a little attention to details .
And it would make you much better developer .
Although being indispensable in the team seems good to many of us , it is actually never good .
It just increases your responsibilities , your tasks , and it forces you to work more and more .
And it brings you at such a point where no one would want to work with you .
So do n't be indispensable .

Yet another site puts together a list of the “ greatest science fiction book series ” and has Asimov ’s Foundation series in the number one spot .
( I wo n’t link to the site because my anti-virus software did n’t like it . )
Sigh .
Do people honestly think that ’s the best the genre has to offer ?
A badly - dated trilogy with perfunctory world - building and cardboard characters , and written in prose which possesses all the charm of a dead badger ?
“ Best ” means “ of the highest quality ” – not something you remember enjoying when you were twelve and still believed in the tooth fairy .
Foundation plainly is n’t “ of the highest quality ” , not by any sane or accepted yardstick .
However , in the spirit in which that original list posited Asimov ’s lumpen opus as the best sf book series , I shall now present the very worst of the genre .
The following are science fiction book series whose label as science fiction embarrasses me , whose continuing popularity puzzles me , and whose fans I feel deserve a smack upside the head with a very large and nail - studded cluebat .
10 Honor Harrington , David Weber
These start well enough but , like a well - known fantasy blockbuster series currently being demolished by Adam Roberts on his blog , they soon turn obese , turgid and dull .
The title character also becomes increasingly implausible , and I would not be surprised if the final book in the series – should it ever appear – has Harrington magically transform into a goddess and create an entirely new universe using some wildly implausible authorial hand - waving .
Read the first two or three by all means , but ignore the rest unless you want your will to live to be slowly drained from you .
9 Four Lords of the Diamond , Jack Chalker
I could have chosen any Chalker series , to be honest .
They ’re all pretty much the same .
And every series feels like a novelette stretched out to fill three or four novels – with this happened and then that happened and then they all sat around and talked about it for a bit before that happened and this happened .
The rambling plot usually leads to a weak resolution , which makes you wonder why you bothered reading the books in the first place .
8 Grand Tour , Ben Bova
I like the idea of these books : a series of hard sf novels about the gradual colonisation of the Solar system .
But they ’re a real slog to read .
Bova ’s prose is not so much workmanlike as bolted - together .
If prose should be a sleek and powerful Italian sports car , then Bova ’s is a great lumbering tank powered by a million hamsters running around a million wheels .
7 Pern , Anne McCaffrey
I ’ve never understood the attraction of these books .
They have dragons in them .
But they ’re not fantasy .
Honest .
They are , however , gooey .
McCaffrey ’s writing makes your teeth rot .
Reading them is like eating a bucket of candyfloss – insubstantial , sticky , and so sweet the slightest sudden movement makes you feel nauseous .
6 Projekt Saucer , WA Harbinson
The central premise of this series is a well - documented conspiracy theory and quite loony .
It goes like this : during World War II , the Nazis invented flying saucers and they used them to flee in 1945 , and have , variously , either a base on the Moon or in Antarctica .
In Harbinson ’s series , written in the finest deathless prose , the saucers were actually invented by an American genius who went to work for the Nazis , and he is now the head of a secret scientific organisation with a hidden headquarters in the Andes .
From there , he plans to take over the world , muahaha .
Despite their cool premise , these books are painful to read .
5 Lensman , EE ‘ Doc’ Smith
I could have picked any of Smith ’s series , but the Lensman series – despite being out of print – still seems to be popular .
It was written a long time ago .
A long , long time ago .
And it shows .
Back in those days , sf was written by dirty old hacks or spotty teenagers .
Women were either alien creatures or centre - folds .
They certainly were n’t as clever or resourceful as men .
A lot of them were naked too .
These books are in no way representative of sf in the twenty - first century .
They ’re not even representative of sf as a genre .
4 Saga of the Seven Suns , Kevin J Anderson
Sadly , this series might well be representative of sf in the twenty - first century .
Kevin J Anderson is a fiction machine .
He churns out books by the metre .
And his prose has all the wit and grace of prose written by a machine .
Except he does n’t actually write his books .
He dictates them as he hikes around his backyard – otherwise known as the state of Colorado .
It shows .
These books do not contain carefully - chosen words , but the sort of words you pick as you scramble up a hill being chased by a goat .
3 Mission Earth , L Ron Hubbard
Anyone who thinks that Battlefield Earth is the greatest sf novel ever written is either a Scientologist or brain - damaged .
Or perhaps both .
But Battlefield Earth is , amazingly , better than the Mission Earth “ drekology ” .
Rumour has it Elron was dead when he wrote the Mission Earth books .
It shows .
2 Foundation , Isaac Asimov
This trilogy , while not as actually bad as some of those lower down this list , deserves its high place because it appears as number one in so many “ greatest sf book series ” lists .
It ’s not the greatest science fiction book series ever published .
It ’s not even very good .
Asimov ’s prose is like tofu – it is bland and tasteless , and when you find it in your food you ’re never entirely sure what it is .
1 Legends of Dune , Kevin J Anderson & Brian Herbert
These books get the number one spot not only because they are badly - written , were cobbled together out of sf furniture stolen from 1930s pulp magazine covers and 1950s B- movies , and feature characterisation on a par with Dan Brown …
No , they get the number one spot because they took a large dump from a very great height on a very good series of books .
Frank Herbert ’s
Dune novels are excellent ; I would happily include them in a list of the greatest science fiction series .
But the Dune books were never completed – Frank Herbert died before starting work on “ Dune 7 ” .
So KJA & Herbert Jr wrote it for him .
In order to bolt on their own ending – it was all the fault of a Giant Computer Brain , apparently – they first had to rewrite Dune ‘s back - history .
And they put brains in jars in there .
That looked stupid back in the 1930s .
It ’s even more stupid now .
There are many , many things wrong with these books – every single word in them , in fact .
Yes , there are worst books than those above – and some of those I picked are no longer in print for , one would hope , good reason .
But whenever people promote science fiction , some of the series I ’ve chosen are the ones they use .
And I find that incomprehensible .
When there ’s so much good stuff out there , why push the badly - written crap you liked once upon a time .
It may well have been your entry into the genre but you were a kid at the time .
The ten series above are , I suppose , an anti-list .
They are the books which should never appear on any “ best of ” or “ greatest ” list .
Canada 's federal regulator has come out strongly against foreign control of the country 's telecom sector , saying doing so risks turning Canada 's communications industry into a " branch plant . "
CRTC chairman Konrad von Finckenstein told a House of Commons committee that allowing foreign control of either telecoms or broadcasting risks turning Canada into a " branch - plant communications industry . "
( ( Pawel Dwulit / Canadian Press ) ) CRTC chairman Konrad von Finckenstein told a House of Commons committee Tuesday that foreigners should be restricted to a maximum 49 per cent of controlling shares in any telecommunications firm .
" The control of the communications sector should stay in Canadian hands , " he said .
" If you do n't do this … we will have a branch plant communications industry . "
The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission head was testifying on a proposal in last month 's throne speech that would see the government " open Canada 's doors further to venture capital and to foreign investment " in " satellite and telecommunications industries . "
But von Finckenstein said it was not possible to allow foreign ownership rules to relax on the telecoms without opening up Canada 's broadcasters — the culturally - sensitive content part of the sector — as well .
Currently , Ottawa limits direct and indirect foreign ownership to 46.7 per cent , and requires that voting control remain in Canadian hands .
Von Finckenstein said it would be acceptable to increase that to 49 per cent .
In a recent interview with The Canadian Press , Industry Minister Tony Clement said he wants to have consultations because of the complexity of the issues , particularly since the country 's leading telecoms , such as Rogers Communications and Quebecor Inc. , also own broadcast media .
As well , cable operator Shaw Communications has made a bid to buy Canwest Global 's stations .
Clement stressed there is no intention to change the rules governing broadcasters , which are regarded as a cultural industry .
" There 's been no change in our broadcast policy in terms of Canadian content and Canadian rules , but we 're signalling a change in the telecom side , " he said .
Industry analyst Eamon Hoey of Hoey Associates also disputed von Finckenstein 's claim that telecoms and broadcasters are inseparable .
He said it was possible to regulate Canadian content in broadcasting and still have foreign firms own the pipeline carrying the content .
Protectionism in the industry has served Canadians badly in terms of poor services and high costs , he said .
" In terms of wireless , we are about seven or eight years behind the rest of the world and we have higher rates .
In terms of broadband , Canada is a tail - ender , " he said .
" We 've protected these guys from foreign competition , and we 've protected them from competition at home . "
In Tuesday 's testimony , von Finckenstein said the sectors should be treated as one because some Canadian companies operate both as telecoms and broadcasters .
As well , new media allows programs to be viewed on the internet or hand - held devices , and to be inter-active .
He said distinctions between the so - called pipeline and content may have made sense in the past , but they no longer apply .
And with the advent of new media , he said the ability of the CRTC to regulate is diminishing .
For instance , the internet is not regulated and most programs carried on television can also be viewed through Canadians ' computers .
As a result , von Finckenstein said , it was important that " the controlling minds are Canadian " in both sectors .
" They understand Canada , they understand our bicultural our bilingual situation .
No matter what regulation you put together , you can't instill in them what Canada is all about , so they can reflect it in the program , " he said .
" If you do n't take away the ownership , [ and ] try to rule by regulation , you may not succeed and there 's no way you can go back . "
The best way of moving forward , he said , was to create uniform rules that would apply to both industries , and to keep control firmly in Canadian hands .

Did you know that insider trading is perfectly legal in the United States ?
Well , not for 99.9 % of the population .
It is actually only a very small percentage of the population that can legally indulge in insider trading – the members of the United States Congress .
In fact , a law that would ban insider trading by members of Congress has been stalled for years on Capitol Hill .
So why would n’t lawmakers in Washington D.C. want to apply the same rules to themselves that apply to the rest of us ?
After all , how are we supposed to respect the integrity of those “ serving ” in Congress when they are playing by an entirely different set of rules ?
The American people are n’t stupid .
They can see what is going on .
The truth is that there is a reason why approval ratings for Congress are at an all - time low .
The sad thing is that this issue has gotten very little attention in the mainstream media .
Nobody seems really that upset about it .
But it is a travesty that our lawmakers can legally make trades in the open market based on inside information that they have gained by being in positions of authority .
As the Wall Street Journal recently explained , they can generally make all the money they want off of insider information without any fear of prosecution because “ insider - trading laws generally do not apply to lawmakers , leaving them free to trade on nonpublic information . ”
But members of the U.S. Congress are generally in a greater position to influence the fortunes of individual companies than almost anyone else .
For example , certain members of the U.S. Congress may know that certain legislation is going to be introduced that would have a dramatic impact on the economic fortunes of a particular industry or corporation .
What would stop those members of Congress from making very profitable trades in the marketplace based on that information ?
Nothing .
Nothing at all .
So , is there any evidence that members of Congress have been involved in this sort of activity ?
Well , there is at least one study that seems to indicate that members of the U.S. Congress have been much more successful in the stock market than members of the general public ….
A 2004 study of the results of stock trading by United States Senators during the 1990s found that that senators on average beat the market by 12 % a year .
In sharp contrast , U.S. households on average underperformed the market by 1.4 % a year and even corporate insiders on average beat the market by only about 6 % a year during that period .
A reasonable inference is that some Senators had access to – and were using – material nonpublic information about the companies in whose stock they trade .
Of course Congress could stop all of this by simply passing a law that bans insider trading by our lawmakers .
But they refuse to do it .
Instead , it is likely that our “ leaders ” will continue to make millions of dollars by betting against the U.S. economy and very few people will even raise an objection .
In the upcoming Wall Street sequel , Gordon Gekko makes a statement that seems very appropriate for the world in which we now live … .
“ Someone reminded me I once said ‘ Greed is good ’ – now it seems it ’s legal ”
It ’s a bird !
It ’s a plane !
it ’s . . . dinner ?
For an experience that brings cuisine to new heights check out Dinner In The Sky .
The Belgium - based company will hoist you and 21 guests up in a dinning platform for a gourmet meal .
The hoisting is done by a giant crane !
As for the platform , diners sit in a seat that resembles one you might find in a race car .
Everyone wears a seat belt , which subtracts a bit from the formal setting but given that there ’s a 25 meters ( 82 foot ) drop to the ground it ’s doubtful any one will complain .
Dinner In The Sky ’s heaven - bound dinning experience is available where ever the company can get their crane .
The company has outfits in nearly two dozen countries and have organized meals above The Strip in Las Vegas , by Notre Dame in Paris and over the Grand Canyon .
A second crane is available to hoist a band to play music along side their captive audience .
If you are wondering what happens if some one needs the bathroom that ’s easy :
The crane lowers the platform so that person can use the regular earthbound facilities .
Dropping your fork during a meal , however , could cause some problems .

We are not against technology but mobile phone operators and government bodies do not know the effects of being exposed to such high intensity frequencies used in 5G .
In fact countries such as Switzerland have stopped the rollout until it is proven it can not cause harm .
Just like the UK Government has been proactive in putting us under lockdown for a virus that has the potential to do great harm , we feel it is prudent to be proactive and prevent the installation of devices which could cause similar harm .

KIEV , April 2 ( Reuters ) - Ukraine ’s new leadership said on Friday it was inviting Russia to join the European Union in a plan to revamp Ukraine ’s gas pipeline network , which carries crucial supplies of Russian gas to Europe .
The announcement by Prime Minister Mykola Azarov effectively reversed a March 2009 agreement , signed by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko , for the EU to overhaul its pipeline system -- a move that had angered Moscow .
“ The declaration , signed in March last year in Brussels , was not fulfilled by the Ukrainian side as required and the European Commission did not undertake realistic steps for it to be carried out , ” Azarov told journalists .
“ Now we envisage a three - sided approach to modernisation : the participation of Russia , the EC and the Ukrainian side , ” he added .
The question of which partner Ukraine would choose to help it modernise its pipeline network is politically sensitive since European consumers rely on Russian natural gas piped across Ukraine for about a fifth of their supplies .
The move by the new leadership of President Viktor Yanukovich , which says it wants to pursue a more balanced policy between Russia and the West , appeared to be a concession to Moscow , which had bristled at being shut out of discussions on the issue last year .
At the time , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin threatened to review ties with the EU and officials said the risk of gas supply disruptions would rise if Russian interests were ignored .
The spat revived fears of a repeat of a January 2009 gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine , when major EU customers were left without gas for nearly two weeks in the dead of winter .
Azarov , who met Putin in Moscow last month , said on Friday that a meeting of officials from concerned governments was planned for April 22 and Ukraine would go to Moscow with updated proposals on the issue .
[ ID: nLDE62O2H1 ]
Azarov said modernisation would cost “ billions of dollars ” but much would depend on the volumes of gas Russia intended to export over the next 10 - 15 years and the volumes the EU was prepared to buy .
Currently , Ukraine ’s pipeline system is capable of handling 140 billion cubic metres of gas per year .
In 2009 , the EU received 96 billion cubic metres of gas through the Ukrainian pipeline system .
A substance found in breast milk can kill cancer cells , reveal studies carried out by researchers at Lund University and the University of Gothenburg , Sweden .
Although the special substance , known as HAMLET ( Human Alpha- lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumour cells ) , was discovered in breast milk several years ago , it is only now that it has been possible to test it on humans .
Patients with cancer of the bladder who were treated with the substance excreted dead cancer cells in their urine after each treatment , which has given rise to hopes that it can be developed into medication for cancer care in the future .
Discovered by chance
HAMLET was discovered by chance when researchers were studying the antibacterial properties of breast milk .
Further studies showed that HAMLET comprises a protein and a fatty acid that are both found naturally in breast milk .
So far , however , it has not been proven that the HAMLET complex is spontaneously formed in the milk .
It is speculated , however , that HAMLET can form in the acidic environment of the babies´ stomachs .
Laboratory experiments have shown that HAMLET kills 40 different types of cancer , and the researchers are now going on to study its effect on skin cancer , tumours in the mucous membranes and brain tumours .
Importantly , HAMLET kills only cancer cells and does not affect healthy cells .
Studying the integration of the substance
Researchers at the University of Gothenburg are focusing on how HAMLET can be taken up into tumour cells .
The researchers , Roger Karlsson , Maja Puchades and Ingela Lanekoff , are attempting to gain an in - depth understanding of how the substance interacts with cell membranes , and their findings were recently published in the journal PLoS One .
Second tier internet service provider Internode has revealed plans to revamp its broadband offerings this month , as well as offer the newly launched FetchTV internet television service some time after that point .
As first reported by iTnews , Internode supremo Simon Hackett ( pictured ) revealed the plans on the forums of broadband forum Whirlpool on Monday night , noting he was n’t yet providing specific details , only the general service offerings which would be updated — fibre to the home plans , mobile broadband plans and data block pricing , new ‘ fast ’ plans and various changes to Internode ’s Easy Broadband offering .
“ We think the last two of the list above , in particular , will answer most ( hopefully , all ) of the requirements of those who find themselves contemplating the strange ( and temporary ) experience of seeing BigPond trialling a relatively reasonable value point for ADSL2 + plans ( as always , late and last ) , ” he said of the nation ’s largest telco .
After April at some point , Internode plans to launch the FetchTV internet television service which launched this week with iiNet as its first customer .
But Hackett said this would only happen when both FetchTV and Internode “ are ready to do so ” .
Other plans up Internode ’s sleeve include working with Optus on developing “ evolution paths ” for Internode customers using wholesale offerings from the larger telco , organising local number portability to Internode ’s internet telephony service , and releasing a new online signup environment .
Hackett also used the forum to take a stab at larger rival ( and also supplier ) Telstra , answering a question about changes in plans using Telstra ’s wholesale services by implying a recent change in Telstra ’s retail pricing strategy was followed by a change on the wholesale side .
“ Students of past changes in Telstra pricing ( over many years ) would note that when BigPond drop retail pricing below wholesale cost from [ Telstra Wholesale ] , there tends to be a corresponding change in wholesale pricing , but that this corresponding change tends to lag by days ( or weeks ) behind the BigPond retail change … because … well , because that ’s just the kind of people [ Telstra ] are , ” he wrote .
“ That is n’t a definitive statement about what has happened this time .
But it sure reads like a strong hint , does n’t it .
You just need to read between the lines . ”
In a further post , he noted that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would not act to prevent what some might see as unfair pricing behaviour from Telstra , because it had decided that the ADSL2 + broadband market was now competitive because of the influx of DSL infrastructure around the nation .
“ The ACCC remains able ( and apparently willing ) to intervene should the pricing of other speeds be the source of a wholesale / retail price squeeze , but ADSL2 + is now ‘ competitive ’ and hence entirely up to market forces , ” he wrote .
“ In particular , should Telstra go for a price squeeze in lower speeds ( up to 1500 ) in areas where it holds a geographic monopoly . ”
“ But in the cities , where competitors have DSLAM ’s , there is no ACCC enforcement on wholesale pricing any more .
Thats the gist …
We only get the world we have , not the world we want . ”

On April 14th , residents of China 's remote Yushu County , located on the Tibetan plateau , were awoken by a magnitude 6.9 earthquake .
In the sparsely populated villages and the larger town of Gyegu , thousands of wood - earth buildings collapsed and many larger structured heavily damaged or destroyed .
The region is difficult to reach for the response teams of the Chinese government outside aid groups - lying at an elevation of 3,700 m ( 12,000 ft ) and connected by few roads , most of which were damaged in the quake .
Chinese state media now says the death toll has risen to 1,144 .
Rescuers continue to search for survivors as homeless residents work to recover what they can and set up shelter from the freezing overnight temperatures .

The Archbishop of Canterbury has said the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland has lost " all credibility " over the way it had dealt with paedophile priests .
Rowan Williams said the problems , which had been a " colossal trauma " for the Church , also affected the wider public .
BBC religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott said Dr Williams ' words represented unusually damning criticism from the leader of another Church .
Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said he was " stunned " by the remarks .
He said those working to renew the church would be " immensely disheartened " by Dr Williams ' comments .
ANALYSIS Robert Pigott , BBC religious affairs correspondent Rowan Williams ' assessment of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland as having lost all credibility is unusually blunt and damning .
It should be remembered that relations between the two Churches have been strained since Pope Benedict offered disgruntled Anglicans easy conversion to Catholicism last October .
But Dr Williams ' remarks do reflect a growing sense of alarm at what is perceived to be the Catholic Church 's disastrous loss of moral authority .
His comments will strike a chord with increasing numbers of people who feel the Vatican has yet to realise , let alone accept , the seriousness of the plight it shares with the Church in Ireland .
While it is very unusual for one Church leader to make such comments about another , Dr Williams will feel the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland and the UK's Anglican Churches are fighting the same battle against secularism and the erosion of Christian influence and status .
On the most important weekend in the Christian calendar , when the Church is supposed to be talking about renewal , it faces a real crisis which Dr Williams believes needs to be sorted out .
The Church in Ireland said the issue of abuse was being taken " very seriously " .
Last month , Pope Benedict XVI apologised to all victims of child sex abuse by Catholic priests in Ireland .
He has also rebuked Irish bishops for " grave errors of judgement " in dealing with the problem .
Dr Williams ' voiced his first comments about the scandal in an interview to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week programme .
He said : " I was speaking to an Irish friend recently who was saying that it 's quite difficult in some parts of Ireland to go down the street wearing a clerical collar now .
" And an institution so deeply bound into the life of a society , suddenly becoming , suddenly losing all credibility - that 's not just a problem for the Church , it is a problem for everybody in Ireland . "
The Archbishop of Dublin , head of the biggest Catholic diocese in Ireland , said those working to renew the Catholic Church did not need the comment .
He said : " I still shudder when I think of the harm that was caused to abused children .
I recognise that their Church failed them .
" I also journey with those - especially parents and priests - who work day by day to renew the Catholic Church in this diocese and who are committed to staying with their Church and passing on the faith in wearying times .
" Archbishop Williams ' comments will be for them immensely disheartening and will challenge their faith even further , " he said .
It should be remembered that the archbishop has neither experience of Irish life nor any direct ecclesiastical authority in this country .
I hope that he will reflect on his comments , and I deeply regret the hurt that he has caused
Bishop of Meath and Kildare , Richard Clarke
Cleric 's apology to abuse victims Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin Dr John Neill - a senior figure in Ireland 's Anglican communion - said he had listened to the remarks of Dr Williams with " deep regret " .
" As one who ... acknowledges the pain and deep suffering of the victims of abuse , I also feel for the countless priests and bishops who daily live out their Christian vocation , " he added .
Fellow Anglican the Most Revd Richard Clarke , Bishop of Meath and Kildare , said Dr Williams ' remarks were " careless and reckless " and " deeply hurtful " .
" As those of us who live in this country know very well , most bishops , priests and religious of the Roman Catholic tradition minister faithfully and selflessly under very difficult conditions with the love and support of their people , " he added .
But Catherine Pepinster , editor of Catholic weekly newspaper The Tablet said Rowan Williams ' comments were " very striking " and that many Catholics would share his opinion .
Vows of silence Dr Williams ' comments came after Pope Benedict 's personal preacher , the Rev Raniero Cantalamessa , compared criticism of the pontiff and Church over child abuse to " collective violence " suffered by the Jews .
Speaking at Good Friday prayers in St Peter 's Basilica , Father Cantalamessa quoted a Jewish friend as saying the accusations reminded him of the " more shameful aspects of anti-Semitism " .
The Vatican said this was not its official position and the comments were criticised by Jewish groups and those representing abuse victims .
On Sunday , Cardinal Keith O'Brien , the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland , is expected to apologise during his Easter address in Edinburgh to the victims of paedophile priests .
The Start the Week programme will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Monday at 0900BST .

Robyn and Jesus live together in Colorado , but they also have other emotional and sexual relationships .
They are , in fact , polyamorous .
As they tell Jonathan Groubert , they feel this arrangement has deepened their sense of intimacy , but it ’s not without jealousy .
We introduce Ben who is Robyn's “ sweetie ” and Jesus ’s good friend .
Flirtation , love , romance and polyamory
Q : ... Listening to the both of you talk through most of this interview , a few words keep coming back .
" Talk it through . " " Rationalization . "
" Old paradigms , " like monogamy .
These things all keep coming through .
How important is emotional maturity here ?
( Pause . )
You 're laughing .
Robyn Trask : I 'd say its critical .
Because without it , this can all explode spectacularly and it can be very challenging .
It 's like dating for the first time when you 're a teenager , or in college , or whenever you started dating the first time .
Most of us had a lot of what we call teen angst .
Or angst over relationships , and we worried , and we fell in love , and we got hurt , and we did n't know how to deal with it .
And , the same thing happens when people start exploring multipartner relationships .
It 's like learning relationships all over again .
The difference is that oftentimes you can't go to your parents to talk about it .
Or you do n't have an aunt or somebody who 's been through it to go talk to and say , " Hey , I 'm really having trouble with my two partners , and I 'm not sure how to reconcile these feelings , " because they look at you and go like " What ?!
You 're with two partners ? ! "
---------------------
Q : ... How about at work ?
Are they aware of your relationships ?
Jesus V. Garcia :
One thing I 've found is , when you approach this with pride , and passion , and having people see you with pride and passion about what you 're doing , they can't really fault you for it .
---------------------
Q : ... But what does Ben think of Jesus ?
Ben Silver : I got to hear a lot about the building of [ Robyn's ] relationship with Jesus well before I met him .
So I sort of felt a warmth toward Jesus even before we met , and then when I did meet him I was delighted .
Q : ... Ben , is there a moment that has happened since you 've chosen to be polyamorous that has confirmed to you :
Yes , I made the right decision .
That this was the best thing to do with my life .
Ben :
When my son was much younger he was watching the live - action version of the Grinch movie , and in the backstory , there was something where the mayor of the town , as a kid , was vying for a relationship with someone that they both loved .
I was watching this with my son and he looked at me and said , " I do n't understand ?
If they both love her and she loves them , why ca n't she be with both of them ? "
And I felt this moment of delight and pride that my son understood this idea of , there are n't necessarily these limitations to love .
In fact , he not only understood that , the whole idea that you would have to not love someone because you loved someone else was foreign to him .
Q : Robyn , the same question to you :
What one moment encapsulates for you the fact that you have made the right decision to live your life this way ?
And that it really matters .
Robyn : I was actually at work one day and a girlfriend of mine was over helping my husband clean the house after this party .
So my husband called me up on the phone , he says " I just want to let you know that So - and - so and I were making out in the kitchen . "
I got this huge grin on my face , because I was really happy for him .
Because I knew he liked her , I knew that she liked him , and I felt this sense of happiness for it .
And I was with a group of people , I was sitting in a big circle of people when he called , and they go , " Well what are you so happy about ? "
And I thought , how funny it is that I really do n't know how to explain to this room , " My husband has been making out in the kitchen with one of my friends , that 's why I 'm smiling . "
In a way I relate it to children , because most people can relate to that -- watching your child take his first steps and you 're all excited .
It 's that kind of feeling .
You 're happy for them .
Q : Jesus , you know I can't leave you out of this .
What for you is your most important moment , your " Aha " moment ?
Jesus :
After I think it was the last conference , we were all in a room , Ben and Robyn were hugging and snuggling and kissing , and I walk in and they greet me with open arms , and I hug them both , and I kiss Robyn , and then Robyn goes over and kisses Ben , and then Ben reaches over and gives me a quick kiss and takes a step back and goes [ joking ]
" Oh ! -- oh my god -- I 'm sorry ! "
I felt very flattered , Ben 's a good friend , I did n't even think anything about it -- but just that one sudden shock of --
Ben : Was I that apologetic ?
I 'm sort of surprised .
Jesus :
You took a step back , you were more shocked than anything .
But it was nice , the fact that the emotions were running between the three of us , that it felt good that we were just in the moment at that time .
Q : What 's the next time you 're all going to meet up ?
Ben : September .
Q : And what 's that moment going to be like , when you see each other for the first time in months ?
Robyn : Lots of hugs and kisses .
[ Laughs . ]
And the hits keep on coming .
I just listened to one of the best radio interviews on polyamory that I can recall .
Many NPR stations in the U.S. carry " The State We 're In " ( slogan : " how we treat each other around the world " ) , produced by Radio Netherlands .
The show 's producer writes us , " I had the pleasure of interviewing Robyn Trask , Jesus Garcia and Ben Silver from Loving More for [ the May 15th ] programme .
This is broadcast in English on many NPR stations across the USA , Asia and in Australia . " From the station 's website : Listen here .
Our intrepid three start the show and go until 21:45 ( with a one - minute news break ) .
It ends with one of Ben Silver 's happy , haunting poly songs : his multi-voice , interwoven " More Love .
" Some excerpts :
Here are pictures of the three of them , and Robyn 's own comments on the interview .

Every now and then I stumble across an electric vehicle that makes my mouth fall open and my lower jaw hit the floor with a thud .
This is one of those vehicles .
The Hanebrink ATB is a pedal / electric powered bike capable of riding over any surface except liquid water , those huge tires mean that downhill mountain biking , beach cycling and snow cycling are all easily possible and the electric motor and lithium - ion phosphate battery pack means that when you get tired you can sit back and squeeze on the throttle and let the Aotema 600 Watt Electric Motor take over .
Nice .
Designed by Dan Hanebrink , the Hanebrink ATB has 14 speeds and an electric motor that can get it up to 40 mph on the road .
Dan is an engineer who has designed vehicles for NASA and multiple polar expeditions so it seems safe to say he knows what he ’s doing .
The bike has a one hour battery life on the road and up to 1.5 hours off road , which seems amazing considering the size of the battery pack .
Now for the bad news .
I for one was actually ready to whip out the plastic and place and order for one of these bad boys until I found the price tag .
$ 7,650 USD .
If it was $ 6,000 less ( which was what I was roughly expecting ) I would have one by now .
Damn carbon fibre for being so blisteringly expensive !
At that price I could pick up a Zero Dual Sport so for now I guess the Hanebrink is n’t for me .
One day when those lottery numbers come through though , it ’ll be all mine .
UPDATE
The manufacturers website Fortune Hanebrink lists the starting price as $ 5,500 USD .
Sadly , this is still a smidgen over budget for the humble writer .

WASHINGTON — Attorney General Eric Holder turned in his letter of resignation to President Barack Obama Tuesday after discovering that people willfully participate in the killing of other human beings on a routine basis .
" I am stunned , " a pale and shaking Holder said .
" That 's just horrible .
People really do that ?
My God , why ? "
Sources close to Holder said that he is seeking a position in which he will be less likely to encounter man 's inhumanity toward man , perhaps in child protective services .
Richard Candle directed my attention to his Increase Happiness self - help site , and in particular the " Increase Wealth " page .
WEALTH is anything which has value to you .
In its simplest forms , Wealth includes food and shelter .
All living things require Wealth for Physical Survival .
Wealth can sometimes be found , but more often must be created .
To create Wealth requires a transformation from CHAOS into ORDER .
A farmer transforms a Chaotic plot of earth into Orderly rows of crops .
A tailor transforms a Chaotic collection of cloth into an Orderly garment .
A homebuilder transforms a Chaotic pile of building materials into an Orderly dwelling .
The process of transforming Chaos into Order involves both technology and skill .
You can improve your skills , and knowledge of technology , through EDUCATION .
Education is the process of creating Order from Chaos in your mind .
What about money ?
To earn money , you transform Chaos into Order for others .
Employees produce Order needed by their employers .
Professionals create Order for the benefit of their clients .
A business provides an Orderly product for its customers .
When you create Order for others , you add to their Wealth .
In many cases , they offer “ Thank You ” notes for your efforts .
Those “ Thank You ” notes are called MONEY ....
The source of Wealth morality is FREEDOM .
Free people engage in VOLUNTARY transactions .
In Voluntary transactions , people only give up their Wealth when they perceive they are getting something more valuable in return ....
When you engage in Voluntary transactions with others , you help them while you help yourself – both parties get something more valuable to them .
The more transactions you desire , the more you seek to help others .
In fact , the Wealth you accumulate through Voluntary transactions can be a measure of the Happiness you have brought to others .
Why does Wealth have such a bad reputation ?
Because not everyone tries to Increase Wealth through Voluntary transactions .
Instead they use FORCE ( stealing ) or FRAUD ( lying ) .
Any transaction involving Force or Fraud is an INVOLUNTARY transaction .
Those who take your Wealth through Involuntary transactions deprive you of the Freedom to choose what you want to do with your Wealth , which is the same as depriving you of the time you spent to accumulate your Wealth .
It is as if you were enslaved for that portion of your life required to create your Wealth , and slavery is immoral .

Allison Kilkenny writes :
The free market ca n’t provide solutions to many social problems .
As Oliver Willis ( sarcastically ) put it , “ instead of boycotting [ the ] bus , rosa parks should have been an entrepreneur and started her own bus service .
let the market decide . ”
Therein lies the problem with Libertarian [ sic ] philosophy .
Social minorities are n’t in a position to start their own businesses , and they are frequently at the mercy of state and private business policies .
We ca n’t all be the CEO of BP .
Most people live on the other end of the social spectrum , like the poor fishermen , standing on the Louisiana coast , waiting for the oil to hit the shore .
First things first .
Repeat after me : Rand Paul is not a libertarian ( or a big - L Libertarian , for that matter ) .
Next , a history lesson .
Rosa Parks was standing up to state laws , not the bus company per se .
It was precisely the existence of the government ’s laws that prevented the free market from having any chance of working in this case .
It is no coincidence that there were Jim Crow laws in the pre-civil - rights South .
White racists were unwilling to rely on voluntary compliance alone to keep blacks “ in their place , ” and this reluctance on their part was a shrewd one .
The famous segregated buses in Montgomery , Alabama , were segregated by law , not by choice of the bus company .
In fact , the bus company had petitioned , unsuccessfully , to get the law repealed — not out of love ( i.e. , concern for the equal rights of blacks ) but out of greed ( i.e. , the policy was costing it customers ) .
So [ libertarians ] are quite right in thinking that racism can be undermined by a concern for the bottom line ( though it would be naive to assume that it must always be so undermined ; people do care about things other than money , and some of those things are pretty repugnant ) .
– Roderick T. Long , “ Toward a Libertarian Theory of Class ”
Perhaps Kilkenny should quote someone else , with some other example , if she wishes to demonstrate how the “ free market ca n’t provide solutions to many social problems . ”
Historical facts aside , I find it particularly interesting that Kilkenny thinks that boycotts are n’t themselves part of the free market .
She seems determined to think of the free market as only the cash nexus .
This leads her to imply that libertarian theory recommends , as the only solution , that Rosa Parks start her own bus company ( or , if not Parks , someone or some group from the affected social minority ) .
Kilkeeny is right to mention that libertarian theory does indeed point to competition ( but not only competition ) as a potential force against discrimination .
But she reminds us that , “ Social minorities are n’t in a position to start their own businesses , and they are frequently at the mercy of state and private business policies . ”
I give her credit for being honest about the state ’s involvement in creating poverty and putting up barriers against truly free competition , but I ’m not sure how that helps strengthen her point , which ultimately seems to be that she ’s in favor of state interference with free competition .
But why must we assume that the competition has to come from the social minority in question ?
One thing a good boycott or protest against harmful cooperative ventures ( such as racist businesses ) can do is act as a signal to anyone and everyone who might be in a position to start their own business :
Such cooperative ventures are easier to undermine when there is free competition , because they create a large group of excluded people who have an interest in seeing that cooperation fail , and this group constitutes an attractive market for any entrepreneur interested in defying the cooperative venture .
To be sure , pressure within a selectively cooperative venture … may be strong enough to discourage defections .
The racist , tempted by profit to hire the qualified black over the unqualified white , may think again when he realizes he will be subject to severe social sanctions from his fellow racists within the community .
The pull of the bottom line can be quite limited in the face of social ostracism by one ’s peers .
But that is precisely why I stress the importance of free competition .
The beneficent power of greed in overcoming harmful cooperative ventures lies not so much in its ability to undermine the venture from within , as in its ability to attract cooperative ventures to outcompete the bad ones .
The white racist who has lived all his life in Kluxville may prefer social conformity to profit , but if the resulting low wages for blacks in the Kluxville area serve as a cheap - labor magnet motivating Amalgamated Widgets to open a new plant in Kluxville , the folks who run Amalgamated Widgets may not care that much if the whites in Kluxville shun them ; they already have their own peer group , after all .
– Roderick T. Long , “ Toward a Libertarian Theory of Class ”
Finally , Kilkeeny sums up Paul ’s position as , “ Civil rights are a ‘ red herring ’ that should not be applied to private businesses . ”
This , however , is just another example of how easy it is to slide from the Civil Rights
Act to civil rights full stop .
Charles Johnson recently responded to a similar misattribution ( “ Rand Paul … . wo n’t approve of lunch counters being desegregated . ” ) .
I ’ll let him wrap up the post .
Take it way , Charles :
Rand Paul is a liar and a politician .
( But I repeat myself . )
However , in the interest of fairness , I watched that interview , and he did n’t say that he was against “ lunch counters being desegregated . ”
What he said is that he ’s against the use of federal antidiscrimination laws to desegregate lunch counters .
The second position implies the first only if there ’s no other way to desegregate lunch counters except for getting a federal law so you can go hire a lawyer and file a Title II lawsuit against the department store in federal court .
But of course there are other ways besides that kind of bureaucratic bullshit .
Nothing that Rand Paul said about Title II or Title VII would rule out the use of grassroots organization and nonviolent direct action , of exactly the sort that was already being used effectively to dismantle Jim Crow in towns throughout the South , when the a bunch of grandstanding white Democrats decided to rush in and take all the credit .
I think that what keeps people from needing to do sit-ins right now is n’t primarily government laws ; it ’s the radical shift in community norms since the Jim Crow era .
( Also , the fact that business owners in the South are now much more likely to be black themselves than they were in the early 1960s . )
Enforcing a law like the Civil Rights
Act is n’t free : it took a lot of hard - fought political effort to get it passed , and once it passed , it did n’t automagically erase all the segregation in the U.S. ; rather , what happened is that some places immediately desegregated and others did n’t , and got sued .
Eventually , enough businesses were sued that the rest decided it was n’t worth the fight to try to keep their racist policies .
But that happens with protests too : if direct action is successful in one campaign , it makes the next campaign easier , because fewer businesses are willing to fight it out with you , and eventually you start winning without even having to fight .
( There are plenty of actual cases where this happened — for example , that ’s how the NSM won the desegregation of all the downtown businesses in Nashville in summer 1960 , even though they had only targeted a limited subset of those businesses for sit-ins . )
So , the question is n’t how you can get social change without a struggle ( you can ’t ) ; rather , it ’s what kind of struggle is the most effective and the most productive .
But I think it ’s obvious here that the most important thing that the struggle did was to change the culture in the South , so that Jim Crow was no longer socially sustainable ; that is , black people became too pissed off to take it , and eventually not enough white people were willing to dish it out anymore .
But what creates cultural change more effectively — fighting moral battles in the streets and neighborhoods ?
Or having to hire lawyers and dickering over a bunch of legalistic mumbo- jumbo in federal court ?
I think that the change of venue to court was at best useless from the standpoint of social change , and sometimes ended up stalling a social struggle by getting it caught up in expensive , slow , and complicated legal battles .
So , setting aside my Anarchist objections to any form of legislative authority for the moment ( although I do also have those objections too , of course ) , I think that it ’s just far more valuable to concentrate efforts on maintaining a strong social movement and a culture of solidarity , than it is to fritter away energy on political lobbying and trying to work through federal bureaucracies .
… the “ mechanisms ” that Anarchists have usually envisioned are free associations that work through social sanctions and direct action , not political courts or police forces .
So if you want to make sure that businesses do n’t discriminate ( which I think is a perfectly reasonable thing to want ) , the kind of mechanisms you ’d expect to see in an Anarchistic society to would be focused on holding the creep socially accountable , rather than trying to retaliate legally or coercively .
That would be acted out through things like labor unions , community groups , grassroots campaigns of protest or direct action ( like the sit - in movement itself ) , boycotts and strikes , social ostracism of the business owner , etc .
Not statist mechanisms like threatening lawsuits or filing forms with some tax - funded bureaucracy .
Some teams will be forced to rethink their diffusers in time for the next race © Sutton Images Enlarge Related Links Race :
Bahrain Grand Prix Championship :
FIA Formula One World Championship
A number of teams , including McLaren and Renault , will use a different rear diffuser design at the next race in Australia , following a rule clarification by the FIA .
ESPNF1 understands the FIA 's ruling will prevent teams adding another layer to the diffuser by exploiting the hole where the external engine starter fits .
The cars have all passed scrutineering in Bahrain and their participation in this weekend 's grand prix will not be in question .
Under the latest clarification the teams are now clear on what will be allowed for the rest of the championship , starting in two weeks time in Melbourne .
Diffusers caused a major stir at the start of the 2009 season when Brawn , Williams and Toyota arrived in Australia with a double - decker design which is now standard on all 2010 cars .
This year 's ruling is unlikely to create the same kind of furore .
If you 've been keeping up with fast food news -- and really , who does n't ? -- then you 're no doubt aware that today marks the nationwide debut of the KFC Double Down , a bacon and cheese sandwich between not bread , but two boneless fried chicken breasts .
Before it was even released , the Double Down 's been under fire from people who see it as the biggest edible representation of excess outside of the State Fair , to the point where the actual ad campaign has been based around assuring customers that it 's actually a real product .

Marketing a ludicrous product by telling your customers that you know it 's ludicrous but want them to buy it anyway is a little sketchy .

Allegations about a charity connected to a key Fox News personality have floated across the web for years , but less than two weeks after a conservative blogger took aim , a nonpartisan watchdog group that tends to focus on liberal issues has filed a complaint .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) and Votevets.org have filed a complaint charging Sean Hannity ’s Freedom Concerts with deceptive and illegal marketing practices .
ADVERTISEMENT
The concerts , hosted by Freedom Alliance , raise funds to provide scholarships and services to disabled veterans and their families .
According to an email distributed by CREW , the complaints “ allege Lt. Col .
North ’s Freedom Alliance has violated its charitable tax status by engaging in prohibited political activities .
In addition , CREW ’s complaints charge Mr. Hannity ’s Freedom Concerts has engaged in deceptive and illegal marketing practices by suggesting that all concert ticket sale revenue goes directly to scholarships for children of killed and wounded service members . ”
Hannity has promoted the concerts on his show , making statements such as , “ Every penny , 100 percent of the donations are applied to the Freedom Alliance scholarship fund . ”
Similarly , promoting the concert on Hannity ’s program , Lt. Col .
North has said , “ There ’s no overhead .
There ’s no expenses taken out .
Every penny that ’s donated or that ’s raised through things like the Freedom Concerts goes to the scholarship fund . ”
In addition , Hannity has pledged that all the proceeds of his new book , “ Conservative Victory , ” will go to Freedom Alliance .
CREW ’s IRS complaint against Freedom Alliance asks the IRS to consider revoking its charitable tax status because the organization has engaged in prohibited political activities .
When Freedom Alliance first formed in 1999 , the IRS conditioned its charitable tax status on the organization removing politically partisan materials from its website and warned it not to intervene in political campaigns .
Despite those warnings , Freedom Alliance ’s website includes links to Lt. Col .
North ’s columns , which are largely political , rents its mailing list to a communications firm that works for organizations that “ seek to reach Republicans and conservatives across the United States , ” and hosts an annual “ Freedom Cruise ” with Republican politicians such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele .
In addition , Freedom Alliance appears to have a relationship with Team America , a PAC formed by Rep. Tom Tancredo ( R- CO ) , dedicated to anti-immigration efforts and supporting conservative candidates .
Earlier this month , columnist and blogger Debbie Schlussel claimed that Hannity is profiting from a charity that raises money for severely injured US soldiers and the children of troops killed in action , and she described the Freedom Alliance as “ a huge scam . ”
“ Less than 20 % — and in two recent years , less than 7 % and 4 % , respectively — of the money raised by Freedom Alliance went to these causes , while millions of dollars went to expenses , including consultants and apparently to ferret [ sic ] the Hannity posse of family and friends in high style , ” Schlussel writes .
“ And , despite Hannity ’s statements to the contrary on his nationally syndicated radio show , ” she continues , “ few of the children of fallen soldiers got more than $ 1,000 - $ 2,000 , with apparently none getting more than $ 6,000 , while Freedom Alliance appears to have spent tens of thousands of dollars for private planes . ”

Schlussel cites an anonymous source who she says told her that the promoter of Hannity ’s fundraising “ Freedom Concerts ” figured the cost of a Gulfstream jet , a “ fleet ” of luxury SUVs , and high - end hotel suites for Hannity ’s entourage as amounting to over $ 200,000 per event .
“ To make matters worse , ” Schlussel continues , “ Hannity deliberately lied to his radio audience about how much money was going to the kids of the fallen American soldiers .
On May 28th of last year , Hannity told his listeners , ‘ Our new sponsor , Boca Java , just pledged $ 30,000 to the Freedom Concerts .
That will provide a full one - year college scholarship for a kid of a fallen soldier . ’
In fact , Freedom Alliance ’s tax forms indicate it has never given any student more than $ 6,000 in a school year , and usually it ’s been far less . ”
In a statement , the president of Freedom Alliance responded to Schlussel ’s allegations .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Freedom Alliance has never provided planes , hotels , cars , limos , or anything else to Sean , ” the statement reads .
“ Sean gets nothing from Freedom Alliance except our gratitude for his personal generosity and for all he has done to help the troops and our organization .
We have never had to ask Sean for anything , he always generously offers his help before we have a chance to ask him .
But to be clear Sean pays for all his own transportation , hotels , and all related expenses for himself and his family and friends and staff , which over the years has added up to tens of thousands of dollars .
He does not use any Freedom Alliance Funds or Concert funds in any way , period . ”
It then goes on to cite financial figures , taken from the same tax filings analyzed by Schlussel , as evidence that roughly 80 % of its expenditures are devoted to program activities .

CREW Executive Director Melanie Sloan stated , “ There is little more despicable than preying upon the generosity of Americans by deceiving them into believing they are aiding the children of killed and wounded service members when the truth is most of the money is going to a for - profit venture . ”
Sloan continued , “ Americans deserve to know whether this high - profile charity allegedly dedicated to helping veterans and their families is really doing what it says it is . ”
Jon Soltz , the Chair of VoteVets.org said , “ If not every dime is going to those who wore the uniform , then people have the right to know that .
It really is that simple .
There are many wonderful charities to help troops and veterans that are completely transparent and truthful about where their donations go .
If Sean Hannity and Freedom Alliance are being untruthful , that hurts all those other charities , because it only causes people to hold back donations to worthy causes in the future .
We need to get to the bottom of this , quickly , and the FTC and IRS must take any corrective action that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s deemed necessary . ”

Allegations about waste committed by the charity first surfaced as early as 2007 .
A Daily Kos diarist named “ davefromqueens ” wrote , “ After weaving through voluminous amounts of carefully crafted , parsed language and following up on the reporting of news hounds and a daily kos diarist it appears that Sean Hannity and Oliver North are using the name of dead American soldiers to garner profits for a right wing organization masquerading as a charity . ”

It 'll soon be time for various gongs and trophies to be handed out and , more often than not , only the game 's finest receive the recognition they deserve .
It is with this in mind that I offer up , in consultation with some petty and vindictive pals down the Blue Bell , a few alternative first XIs for this Premier League season .
I look forward to receiving alternatives from your wise , warped brains .
Words cannot describe how bad Burnley 's season has been
The ' Call Yourself A Professional Footballer - Pull Your Blinking Finger Out ' XIThe players who could n't beat your granny in a one - on - one .
The players whose wage packets are inversely proportional to their ability .

Used to score spectacular goals when Mr Brown was in town and the future was orange .
7. Anderson :
Have never seen him look like he knows what he 's doing .
Ever .

9. Jason Scotland :
You 're a goalscorer , you 're called Scotland .
How 's that ever going to work ?
10 . Kenwynne Jones : Looks imposing ' til he lets another sitter through his legs , when he looks like a bow - legged flamingo .
11 . Michael Owen :
Not entirely his fault , but the man needs to get working on his punditry persona quick - smart .
Manager : Rafa Benitez
We were trying to think of the ' Most Irritating XI You Could Put Out on a Premier League Pitch ' and we suddenly became aware that you should do worse than name England 's starting XI : Cashley , JT , Rio , Gerrard in tumbling mode , Shaun Cul - de - Sac Wright - Phillips ... so we stopped doing that list there and then .
Just think how insufferable they 'll be if the unthinkable happens ...
P.S. You can ( at last ) follow me on Twitter .
The ladies at Skepchick have brought this bro-tastic commercial for Pepsi Max to our attention , as it features a man and his friends who fake the apocalypse in order to trick a woman into sleeping with one of them .
Classy !

Pepsi , you 'll remember , is the same company who released the charming " AMP Up Before
You Score " app earlier this year , which encouraged men to run game on various female stereotypes and then report their conquests directly to Twitter .
PepsiMax seems to be taking a similar approach , presenting itself as a super - rad diet drink for bro-dudes who just want to fake the end of the world and guilt women into having sex with them under false tragic pretenses .
That 's so refreshing , brah !
It 's like , we can watch our calories and be misogynistic assholes all at once !
High fives up top , y'all .
As Tracy King at Skepchick notes , " I am not lacking a sense of humour .
I am not known for political correctness .
But hello ?
If you make a woman think she is about to die in order to have sex with her , that is a bit rapey . "
King goes on to note that the woman clearly says no at the beginning of the commercial , but is manipulated later on by the fake apocalypse report presented by the bros , who then go on to celebrate their " clever " victory by dancing around and drinking diet soda .
Whoops !
Sorry ladies !
Your right to say no is no match for a ridiculous elaborate date rapey scheme put together by three dudes who drink low - cal pop !

It 's ridiculous enough that Pepsi feels the need to brand PepsiMax as a " manly " alternative to the likes of Diet Coke or Coke Zero , but to do so in a manner that also paints women as brainless objects to be manipulated and " won " just adds insult to injury .
There 's nothing funny about three men concocting an elaborate lie in order to get a woman to take her pants off : it 's actually just embarrassing and gross and extremely pathetic .
So what do you think , commenters ?
Effective marketing , or just another example of bro-culture and misogyny being used to push products ?

After an initial examination of the stern of the Navy corvette Cheonan on Thursday , the military tentatively concluded that the corvette had not been hit directly by a torpedo but broke in two due to a bubble jet created by an underwater explosion .
The stern was raised 20 days after the corvette sank in the West Sea on March 26 .
The military also speculates that a torpedo attack was a much more likely cause of the explosion than a mine .
" In an initial examination of the Cheonan 's stern , South Korean and U.S. investigators found no traces showing that the hull had been hit directly by a torpedo , " a senior source at the Defense Ministry said .
" Instead , they found traces proving that a powerful explosion caused possibly by a torpedo had occurred underwater .
The explosion created a bubble jet that eventually generated an enormous shock wave and caused the ship to break in two . "

Somalian pirate operations are becoming increasingly sophisticated , according to a March 10 UN Security Council report , with a funding and incentive model that could double as a business school curriculum .
Here is a handy guide to the piracy business plan , based on some of their findings .
Step 1 : Round up investors to provide start - up capital .
Step 2 : Gather between eight and twelve pirates to form the at - sea team .
They will need " a minimum of two attack skiffs , weapons , equipment , provisions , fuel and preferably a supply boat . "
Each pirate should bring his own firearm in exchange for a class A share of the profits .
If a pirate brings a skiff or a particularly heavy - duty firearm like a machine gun or , say , a rocket launcher , throw in another share .
One more share to the guy who boards the besieged ship first .
Step 3 : Assemble another team of about 12 people .
Each class A pirate can contribute a friend or relative to this team .
These are the class B investors and they 'll provide land - based protection .
The B shares are typically set at a fixed amount , currently worth about $ 15,000 .
Step 4 : Hijack ship , take hostages .
Step 5 : Find someone to front the cost of the siege -- to be repaid with interest -- while the ransom is negotiated .
No , anthroposophy is not a religion , nor is it meant to be a substitute for religion .
While its insights may support , illuminate or complement religious practice , it provides no belief system .
The Anthroposophical Society is open to persons of any faith but also those who do not adhere to a particular faith .
What is of interest in anthroposophy is the living spiritual insights of its members and the activities that flow freely from those insights .
Members are not prescribed a specific form of spiritual practice but many [ freely ] practice meditation ( contemplative thinking , visualization or imagery ) , artistic expression and study .
Anthroposophy has no profession of faith -- no oaths or vows are required for membership .
Anthroposophy has no sacred texts ; members of the Anthroposophical Society are free to work with any texts they consider to be spiritually significant .
While it is not a requirement , many members read the works of Rudolf Steiner , the founder of the Anthroposophical Society , in order to study how he arrived at his spiritual insights .
ANTHROPOSOPHY COMPARED WITH RELIGION : 1 . Anthroposophy has no dogma or creed - the Statutes of the Anthroposophical Society specifically forbid dogma .
2 . The Anthroposophical Society does not offer or prescribe any religious practices or sacraments .
3 . Anthroposophy does not claim to lead to salvation .
Anthroposophy is concerned with understanding relationship of the human being to the spiritual world .
4 . There is no one spiritual guide , teacher or master within the Anthroposophical Society whose statements are beyond questioning .
5 . Anthroposophy is not a system of beliefs .
Anthroposophy is a path to knowledge based on a spiritual understanding of humanity and our relationship to the spiritual world .
6 . The Anthroposophical Society is not organized as a church .
It is a free association of individuals and independent study groups some of whom have sought to be formally recognized by the Anthroposophical Society .
This formal recognition is not a requirement for a study group to be publicized by the Society .
7 . There are no priests , pastors , ministers or other religious functionaries .
Anthroposophy supports religion without interfering with religious practice .
Many members of the Society engage in the practice of Judaism , Christianity , Islam , Shinto , Buddhism and other faiths .
Others are not connected to a particular religious faith .
Anthroposophy honors each member 's own faith and the moral injunctions of that faith .

Scientists funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) at the University of Birmingham have discovered that a gene called DAF - 16 is strongly involved in determining the rate of ageing and average lifespan of the laboratory worm Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) and its close evolutionary cousins .
DAF - 16 is found in many other animals , including humans .
It is possible that this knowledge could open up new avenues for altering ageing , immunity and resistance to stresses in humans .
The research is published April 1 in PLoS ONE .
Dr Robin May , who led the research said : " Ageing is a process that all organisms experience , but at very different rates .
We know that , even between closely related species , average lifespans can vary enormously .
" We wanted to find out how normal ageing is being governed by genes and what effect these genes have on other traits , such as immunity .
To do that , we looked at a gene that we already knew to be involved in the ageing process , called DAF - 16 , to see how it may determine the different rates of ageing in different species . "
Dr May and colleagues compared longevity , stress resistance and immunity in four related species of worm .
They also looked for differences in the activity of DAF - 16 in each of the four species and found that they were all quite distinct in this respect .
And , importantly , the differences in DAF - 16 corresponded to differences in longevity , stress resistance and immunity between the four species -- in general higher levels of DAF - 16 activity correlated with longer life , increased stress resistance and better immunity against some infections .
Dr May continued : " DAF - 16 is part of a group of genes that drive the biological processes involved in ageing , immunity and responses to physical or environmental stresses .
The fact that subtle differences in DAF - 16 between species seem to have such an impact on ageing and health is very interesting and may explain how differences in lifespan and related traits have arisen during evolution . "
The research in Birmingham is now moving on to look at the way in which DAF - 16 coordinates a complex network of genes in order to balance the differing needs of an individual 's immune system over time .
Professor Douglas Kell said : " Research using model organisms that uncovers the biology underpinning ageing gives us the opportunity to understand some of the mechanisms that determine how humans age in a healthy , or at least normal , way .
It is very important to develop a good understanding of healthy ageing if we are to appreciate what happens to an older person 's physiology when they become unwell or experience difficulties with everyday tasks such as recalling memories or moving around .
Improving the healthspan to mirror increases in the lifespan is an important subject of BBSRC research . "
Google research head Peter Norvig says that the search giant 's hallowed PageRank link - analysis algorithm is overrated .
And always has been .
" One thing that I think is still over - hyped is PageRank , " Norvig said this morning during a question and answer keynote at the search - obsessed SMX West conference in Santa Clara , California .
" People think we just do this computation on the web graph and order all the pages and that 's it .
That computation is important , but it 's just one thing that we do .
" People [ webmasters and SEOs ] always said , ' We 're stuck if we do n't have [ a high PageRank ] . '
But we never felt that way .
We never felt that it was such a big factor . "
PageRank attempts to measure the relative importance of a website based on what other sites it 's linked to .
Named for Google co-founder Larry Page - who developed the idea while at Stanford University - the patented technology is a central pillar in the Google Mythology , receiving much of the credit for the Mountain View search engine 's rise to world dominance .
The PageRank patent actually belongs to Stanford , with Google owning exclusive license rights .
Late last year , Google added so - called " real - time search " to its engine - serving up links to fresh Tweets , news , and other recent web posts - and this morning , Norvig was asked if this was a far more difficult undertaking , considering that PageRank does n't work well with Web2.0rhea .
Norvig - the former director of search quality at Google - was quick to say " no , " explaining that even with core search , PageRank is n't as important as people think it is .
And never was .
" [ PageRank ] has a catchy name and the name recognition .
But we 've always looked at all the things that are available [ when ranking search results ] .
We look at where do things come from , what are the words used , how do they interact with each other , how do people interact with them , " he said .
" [ Real - time search ] is more similar [ to core search ] than dissimilar , in that you 're grabbing every available signal and trying to figure out the best way to combine them .
The fact that there are n't legacy links from a long time ago - we do n't think of that as that much different . "
The key to real - time search , Norvig said , is Google 's famously distributed back - end infrastructure , which is able to re-build its web index with relatively little delay .
When Norvig first joined the company , the Google web index was built once a month .
Then the company moved to once a day and then to once an hour .
Now , its distributed infrastructure - using proprietary technologies like the Google File System and MapReduce - can update its index in " 10 seconds , " according to Norvig .
When the hourly index was rolled out , Norvig remembered , Larry Page insisted on calling it the " 3600 second " index .
" If it was hourly , it was just going to stay like that , " Norvig said .
" But if you talk about it in seconds , people are going to push it down to 1000 seconds and eventually you get it down to 10 .
And that 's where we are now .
His vision has come true . "
Google is currently testing a new search indexing system known as " Caffeine , " which uses , among other things , a complete rewrite of the Google File System known at least informally as GFS2 .
In the fall , uber Googler Matt Cutts indicated that Caffeine would begin rolling out across the company 's global infrastructure after the Christmas holidays , but that has n't happened yet .
Norvig would not be drawn on the state of Caffeine , merely confirming that it is still being tested in a single data center .
The Google Research team , he said , has very little to do with the company 's infrastructure work .
" For historical reasons , that kind of systems programming stuff has not been done in Research , " he said . ®
Gazan says he was deported under new Israeli rules
Mr Sabah was deported to the Gaza Strip after he was released from jail A Palestinian prisoner has blamed a controversial new Israeli military order on deportations for his release to Gaza , not the West Bank .
Ahmad Sabah , 40 , freed on Wednesday , has a Gaza ID card , but lived in the West Bank when arrested in 2001 .
The Israeli military said in a statement that his release to the Gaza Strip was standard procedure .
The order widens the definition under which Palestinians can be deported as suspected " infiltrators " .
Palestinians fear a wave of expulsions , but Israel says the order allows better judicial review and affects few people .
When the order was brought in last week , Palestinians and human rights groups feared Israel was planning a new clampdown on Palestinians living in the West Bank but holding Gaza identity cards .
Family Israel considers those with Gaza cards , who do not have a military permit to stay in the West Bank , to be illegally present and liable to deportation if they are discovered , although under the 1993 Oslo Accords the West Bank and Gaza are considered a single entity .
Infiltrator - a person who entered the area unlawfully following the effective date , or a person who is present in the area and does not lawfully hold a permit
New IDF orders
There is confusion over how many Palestinians with Gaza ID cards are living in the West Bank - Palestinian officials says it is tens of thousands , but Israeli authorities say the numbers are small .
Mr Sabah , who was freed after finishing his prison sentence , told BBC Arabic that he had been expecting be released to the West Bank , where family members were waiting , but was instead sent to Gaza .
When he questioned the decision , he said , he was told " this is because of the recent military order " .
In a statement the Israeli military said that Mr Sabah 's release to Gaza was entirely standard procedure because the strip was his registered place of residence .
The statement went on : " The destination of his release was brought to his attention and he expressed no objection to the decision , nor did he note that he has family in Judea and Samaria [ the West Bank ] or express any desire to be released to Judea and Samaria . "
Larger wave
The wording of the military order in question , known as the Order Regarding Prevention of Infiltration , has been amended from when it was originally drawn up in 1969 .
There have been demonstrations against the new orders
The definition of " infiltrator " was then : " A person who entered the area knowingly and unlawfully after having been present in the east bank of the Jordan , Syria , Egypt or Lebanon following the effective date ( of the order being given ) . "
Under the new order this is to be changed to : " Infiltrator - a person who entered the area unlawfully following the effective date , or a person who is present in the area and does not lawfully hold a permit . "
It allows Israel to deport suspected " infiltrators " within 72 hours or imprison them for up to seven years , they can also be fined to pay the cost of their deportation .
Israel says the purpose of the change in rules was to update them to grant suspected infiltrators the right to a hearing before a military judicial panel within eight days of the issuing of the deportation order .
Israeli military sources said it only applied to people not registered with the Palestinian population registry - which is overseen by Israel - and those numbers were small .
But Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups fear it could pave the way for a much larger wave of expulsions in the future .
" The orders are worded so broadly such as theoretically allowing the military to empty the West Bank of almost all its Palestinian inhabitants , " a letter written by human rights organisation HaMoked and signed by 10 other groups to Defence Minister Ehud Barak said .

Jewish groups around the world have reacted with shock after Pope Benedict 's personal preacher compared attacks on the Church and the pope over a sexual abuse scandal to " collective violence " against Jews .
The Pope 's personal preacher , Father Raniero Cantalamessa , made the comments during a Friday sermon in St Peter 's Basilica .
Father Cantalamessa , speaking with the Pope sitting nearby , said Jews throughout history had been the victims of " collective violence " and drew comparisons between Jewish suffering and attacks on the Church .
" The use of stereotypes , the shifting of personal responsibility and guilt to a collective guilt remind me of the most shameful aspects of anti-Semitism , " he quoted from a letter he said he had received from a Jewish friend .
A former president of Italy 's Jewish communities , Amos Luzzatto , says he is finds the preacher 's comments dumbfounding .
Rome chief rabbi Riccardo Di Segni , who welcomed the Pope in the capital 's synagogue last January , also says the comments are " really in bad taste " .
Jewish leaders around the world used words like repugnant , obscene and offensive to describe the sermon , particularly , as chief rabbi Di Segni noted , it came on the day that for centuries Christians prayed for the conversion of the Jews who were once held collectively responsible for Jesus ' death .
An international Jewish rights group spokesman , Rabbi Marvin Hier , also condemned the comments .
" How can you compare the collective guilt assigned to the Jews , which caused the deaths of tens of millions of innocent people , to perpetrators who abuse their faith and their calling by sexually abusing children ? " he said .
A Vatican spokesman says the comparison " is absolutely not the line of the Vatican and of the Catholic Church " .
Victims of sexual abuse also criticised Father Cantalamessa .
" This ridiculous attempt to hide the crimes of the [ Church ] hierarchy inside of Jewish suffering shows just how far this pope seems willing to go to stop the truth from emerging , " said Peter Isely , a spokesman for the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests ( SNAP ) .
Meanwhile the Vatican 's newspaper continued its campaign against the media for its reports on alleged cover-ups of sexual abuse of children by priests , saying the Pope had become the target of " despicable campaign of defamation " .

Several readers have mentioned the strange goods that some customers received from Newegg in place of the Intel Core i7 920 processor they ordered .
Word on the problem first surfaced on TribalWar on Thursday evening .
Newegg still has n't commented on this .
It 's not known whether it happened as a result fraud by another Newegg customer , in shipping , or where .
The " processors " are made of aluminum , and the " fans " are some kind of synthetic molded material .
The " factory seal " was printed onto the box ; the holographic stickers on the boxes were also faked .
The first part of this video shows the bogus goods .
At this writing Google News lists a handful of blogs mentioning the fakes .
Black Knight : Unloved Avenger
Having armour is cool , having a sword is cool and having a flying horse is cool .
So , you would think that with all that coolness around the Black Knight would be cool too… ?
Well , nope .
Sorry about that .
For all the bits and pieces that make the Black Knight on paper look like a top notch character , for some reason he just does n’t translate to a comic world .
It might be that he ca n’t run very fast being covered in armour , or that he sounds like a set of pots and pans as he moves , or maybe he can’t hear anything in that massive helmet .
But when the world needs saving and the Avengers gather , a lot of the time the Black Knight ’s nowhere to be seen .
Maybe Captain America forgot to text him to invite him to the battle or something .

ConocoPhillips agreed to sell its stake in a Canadian oil - sands project to China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. for $ 4.65 billion , in a major North American expansion by a Chinese oil company .
The deal demonstrates China 's increasingly assertive strategy to secure energy resources around the world .
The country 's rapid growth and emerging middle class enabled it to surpass the U.S. as the world 's top automobile market last year , and its state - backed oil companies have been acquiring oil and gas reserves and storage globally .

A CV - 22 Osprey – the special operations version of the controversial MV - 22 Osprey tiltrotor – crashed last night in southern Afghanistan .
According to an International Security Assistance Force news release , the incident claimed the lives of three U.S. servicemembers and one civilian employee .
Several other military personnel were injured .
This is apparently the first loss of an Osprey on a combat mission .
The aircraft , which can take off and land like a helicopter , then transition to forward flight like a fixed - wing aircraft , had a long and controversial development history .
But the Marines rotated two Osprey squadrons through Iraq without any major incidents .
Richard Whittle , author of the newly published The Dream Machine : The Untold History of the Notorious V - 22 Osprey , told Danger Room , " No one 's ever claimed the Osprey was invulnerable , and since the war in Afghanistan began in 2001 , the U.S. has lost more than 300 rotorcraft there and in Iraq from various causes in crashes that killed nearly 500 people . "
But ,
Whittle added : " If the cause was aerodynamic – if this Osprey lost its engines for some reason and was trying to autorotate to a landing , meaning float down on the cushion of lift even unpowered rotors can provide – then the critics who warned that this was a fatal weakness in the Osprey are going to be able to say ' I told you so . ' "
The CV - 22 went down approximately seven miles west of Qalat City , in Zabul Province .
The Taliban claimed credit for downing the aircraft ( It 's also common practice for the insurgents to claim to have shot down aircraft that went down for other reasons ) .
ISAF said an investigation into the cause of the crash was still underway .

A Mediterranean diet may help people avoid the small areas of brain damage that can lead to problems with thinking and memory , according to a study that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology 's 62nd Annual Meeting in Toronto April 10 to April 17 , 2010 .
The study found that people who ate a Mediterranean - like diet were less likely to have brain infarcts , or small areas of dead tissue linked to thinking problems .
The Mediterranean diet includes high intake of vegetables , legumes , fruits , cereals , fish and monounsaturated fatty acids such as olive oil ; low intake of saturated fatty acids , dairy products , meat and poultry ; and mild to moderate amounts of alcohol .
For the study , researchers assessed the diets of 712 people in New York and divided them into three groups based on how closely they were following the Mediterranean diet .
Then they conducted MRI brain scans of the people an average of six years later .
A total of 238 people had at least one area of brain damage .
Those who were most closely following a Mediterranean - like diet were 36 percent less likely to have areas of brain damage than those who were least following the diet .
Those moderately following the diet were 21 percent less likely to have brain damage than the lowest group .
" The relationship between this type of brain damage and the Mediterranean diet was comparable with that of high blood pressure , " said study author Nikolaos Scarmeas , MD , MSc , of Columbia University Medical Center in New York and a member of the American Academy of Neurology .
" In this study , not eating a Mediterranean - like diet had about the same effect on the brain as having high blood pressure . "
Previous research by Scarmeas and his colleagues showed that a Mediterranean - like diet may be associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer 's disease and may lengthen survival in people with Alzheimer 's disease .
According to the present study , these associations may be partially explained by fewer brain infarcts .
The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health .
Certain critiques have been leveled at Western culture so often that they 've almost become truisms : plastic surgery has gone too far , children have been overly sexualized , women just do n't know what they want .
But these ( valid ) criticisms raise certain questions .
Advertisement
First and foremost , everyone wants to know just who is to blame for the hypersexualization of children and the plasticization of celebrities .
Actually , Rebecca Dana at the Daily Beast does n't much care how it happened , all she is interested in is cataloging the phenomenon , which she calls " the rise of the fembot . "
This sci - fi sounding creation is actually a sweeping generalization Dana applies to Heidi Montag , Kendra Wilkinson and ...
Kate Hudson ?
Yes , this is the new woman , and not only is she artificial , she 's also ruthless :
Modern - day Fembots are n't just debatably pretty faces .
They 're also lawyered up .
Last week , Montag announced she is suing Hills creator Adam DiVello , without whose intervention she would probably still be an anonymous aspiring fashion designer in Los Angeles .
She alleges unwanted touching .
And then , of course , there is Gloria Allred 's entire legal practice .
In the last year alone , Allred has become the first name in pre-emptive Fembot litigation .
Southwick will likely employ celebrity divorce attorney Robert Kaufman , if she goes ahead with the divorce .

Dana clumps together a group of celebrities who have had plastic surgery - and are n't afraid to talk about it - and extrapolates a dubious trend from there .
She even appears to call out Montag for suing a man who may have sexually harassed her ( a justifiable reason to " lawyer - up , " by anyone 's standards ) .
She takes a group of women with fake breasts and turns them into a caricature .
Basically , she wrote an article about Heidi Montag and inserted some other names to flesh out the paragraphs .
However , she did get one thing right : the standard of beauty has become more plastic than ever before , streamlined and falsified , more rigid and unforgiving .
I 've never felt much personal animosity towards porn ; my attitude is generally that of bemused curiosity or sustained tolerance .
But recently porn has been on my mind - partially because of the impending Fembot uprising meticulously documented by Dana .
The aesthetic of mainstream porn is that of big , fake breasts , plump , fake lips , acres of fake blonde hair and skin that has been buffed , polished , and waxed with the same rigor that goes into the upkeep of a brand new Ferrari ( and I realize there is plenty of good feminist porn , un - retouched porn , and porn featuring " real " women , but that is still the exception rather than the rule ) .
This look - the Fembot look - is becoming common outside the realm of adult videos , and as trite as it sounds , that is what scares me .
Sex appeal has become more unattainable than ever as the " hot girls " have become ever more similar .

The " pornification " of our culture is also the subject of Mary - Anne Toy 's piece in The Sydney Morning Herald .
Toy focuses primarily on the way that " raunch culture " has altered childhood , perhaps irreversibly .
She expresses her fears that the new visibility of sex will lead to a generation of vapid , insecure little girls .
Toy lists just a few of the problems she sees in modern Australian society :
On television and billboards , and in shop windows , sex is a popular way to sell everything from the obvious - men's clubs , brothels and treatments for erectile dysfunction - to an idealised , celebrity - based concept of success .
The adult classifieds are thriving in local weekly papers , there are pole and lap - dancing classes in the suburbs , and demand for labiaplasty , to make female genitals conform to a perceived porn standard , is increasing .
Our language has coarsened .
Bloody is mild .
Variations of the word f—k seem hardwired into every visiting comedian and forget '' yummy mummies ' ' and cougars , even kids know what MILFs are ( Mothers I 'd Like to F—k ) .

Kids as young as four and five are now wearing " little bras , " " and some of them think they 're sexy , " adds schoolteacher Neta Kirby .
Far more frightening are the words of Joe Tucci , chief executive of the Australian Childhood Foundation .
Tucci , who is currently campaigning to ban the sale of " soft porn " and lad mags from convenience stores and supermarkets , claims that the increasing visibility of sexual images has had a direct effect on the way children interact with each other .
As a social worker , he has seen many cases of sexual abuse , but he claims in the past decade , he has begun to see " kids who had no known sexual abuse " engaging in inappropriate , and often dangerous , behavior :
The foundation now receives more than 150 referrals a year to treat increasingly younger children who are sexually abusing other children .
'' It used to be inappropriate touching and threats … now the behaviour includes penetration , force and planning , such as waiting for opportunities to be alone with another child and in a room which can be locked . ''
Advertisement
Tucci , like researcher Anastasia Powell , places the blame directly on the " pornification " of society .
Powell argues that , instead of freeing women , the sexualization of culture has trapped young women in a double - bind : they must appear to be liberated and independent , while working daily to please their men ( Cosmo's " fun , fearless female " immediately comes to mind ) .
'' But certainly the young women I have spoken to … are n't at all confident in negotiating sex .
They still feel as though they have to meet the boyfriend 's needs first before their own , " she said .
It seems that this is what it comes down to : how are women supposed to navigate a world where sex is highly visible , but still shrouded in a certain level of unreality ?
How does one be " sexy " when the messages are so mixed ?
This confusion , however , is not new .
It 's been 50 years since Lacan stated that " the woman does not exist , " and while we 've come a long way ( baby ) since that time , as a culture , we 're still pretty damn confused as to how to handle sex , sexiness , porn , and the sexuality of children .
Things are n't that great for men either , but what men want - or what they are supposed to want - has a more straightforward answer .
Advertisement
Which is why I would argue that porn is not the problem , and in the end , neither is " raunch culture . "
Both these things have problems within ( see : streamlining the beauty aesthetic , convincing little girls they need bras ) and both contribute to the larger issue , but they are only points in the web , not the entire picture .
Toy and Dana show us one side , yet there is another : the so - called " new prudishness . "
Jessica Grose has written about this twice at Slate , and she 's not the only one .
Back in 2007 , Ada Calhoun noted the backlash against promiscuity .
Since then , the sides have been drawn with many women falling into one camp or the other .
It 's as though we 're unconsciously dividing ourselves into the old Madonna / Whore categories , leaving little room for nuance .
Instead of choosing sides , I 'd like to see a new dialogue about sex and sexualization emerge , one that saves space for sexiness without feeling the need to defend Girls Gone Wild or Jenna Jameson .
But for now , at least we can all agree on this :
There has got to be a better answer to the question what is woman ?
than what do men want ?
Rise Of The Fembots [ The Daily Beast ]
The Porn Identity [ Sydney Morning Herald ]
A researcher at North Carolina State University has developed a computer chip that can store an unprecedented amount of data -- enough to hold an entire library 's worth of information on a single chip .
The new chip stems from a breakthrough in the use of nanodots , or nanoscale magnets , and represents a significant advance in computer - memory technology .
" We have created magnetic nanodots that store one bit of information on each nanodot , allowing us to store over one billion pages of information in a chip that is one square inch , " says Dr. Jay Narayan , the John C. Fan Distinguished Chair Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at NC State and author of the research .
The breakthrough is that these nanodots are made of single , defect - free crystals , creating magnetic sensors that are integrated directly into a silicon electronic chip .
These nanodots , which can be made uniformly as small as six nanometers in diameter , are all precisely oriented in the same way -- allowing programmers to reliably read and write data to the chips .
The chips themselves can be manufactured cost - effectively , but the next step is to develop magnetic packaging that will enable users to take advantage of the chips -- using something , such as laser technology , that can effectively interact with the nanodots .
The research , which was funded by the National Science Foundation , was presented as an invited talk April 7 at the 2011 Materials Research Society Spring Meeting in San Francisco .
NC State 's Department of Materials Science and Engineering is part of the university 's College of Engineering .
The California Teachers Association spent $ 211.8 million - more than any other special interest group - over the past decade to influence state voters and politicians , according to a state report released Wednesday .
Three Indian tribes dumped another $ 200 million into the political process and big business shelled out more than $ 500 million , the California Fair Political Practices Commission said in its report , " Big Money Talks . "
" The reality in politics is that money talks .
Sometimes money shouts , " the report says .
" If it did n't , special interests simply would not spend so much money trying to influence public policy and elections .
...
This report leaves little doubt where the vortex of power lies in this state . "
In all , 15 groups - two labor unions , six corporations , three Indian tribes and four business associations - spent more than $ 1 billion over the past 10 years to sway the outcomes of elections and government decisions , the report said .
These labor unions , Indian tribes and drug , utility , oil , telecommunication and tobacco companies " have a disproportionate amount of influence on California elections and public policy , " the FPPC concludes .
The report warns that there is " no end in sight to the spending binge , " noting that more than half of the money - nearly $ 660 million - was spent on state and local ballot measures .
Often , the report says , the top - spending 15 special interest groups " win by spending money to defeat ballot measures " to maintain the status quo .
For example , the California Teachers Association , which represents 330,000 public school teachers in the state , spent $ 26 million to defeat a school voucher system in 2000 and another $ 50 million to kill three other ballot measures .
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , which represents pharmaceutical research and biotechnology companies , shelled out a whopping $ 95 million to defeat two dueling initiatives on a 2005 ballot aimed at establishing prescription drug discount programs for low - income Californians .
Both measures lost .
CTA President David Sanchez said the group is simply doing what its members expect : advocating for public education .
He said the process is working , and argued that voters agreed in 2005 , when they defeated a ballot measure that would have prohibited the use of union dues for political contributions .
" One of the reasons I joined the union was to ensure that there was a voice willing to advocate on our behalf and on behalf of students , " he said .
" We are the only advocates for our issues . "
While the powerful teachers union topped the spending list and the California State Council of Service Employees - which lobbies on behalf of public employees represented by SEIU labor chapters - came in second , at $ 107 million , business was n't far behind .
Six corporations funneled nearly $ 324 million into the political process , including $ 69.2 million spent by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. , $ 66.2 million by Chevron Corp . and $ 59.6 million by AT&T Inc .
Daniel Newman , executive director of Maplight.org , a nonpartisan nonprofit in Berkeley that tracks the impact of money on politics , said the report shows that Californians are electing the best fundraisers , not the best leaders .
" When unions and corporations are paying for politicians to get power and stay in power , that 's corruption , " he said .
Lawmakers , Newman added , " are working for two masters - the donor and the voter .
And after they are elected , we know who has the upper hand . "
Newman 's organization released its own report Wednesday showing how CTA contributed two to three times the amount of money to the campaigns of legislators who later voted against a package of education bills the union opposed .
He said publicly funded elections are the best way to avoid this " corruption , " and noted that a pilot program , Prop.
15 - which would charge lobbyists fees and use the money to fund secretary of state candidates - will appear on the June ballot .
Excerpts from SARAJEVO SURVIVAL GUIDE An Introduction
Written in Sarajevo , between April of 1992 and April of 1993 , and distributed in trade paperback by Workman Press of New York , this manuscript is part of a multifold project by FAMA , triggered during the siege of Sarajevo .
FAMA is an independent production company that , in the prewar period , worked primarily in audio / video media , buying TV time on state television .
FAMA introduced a new genre to TV audiences in Bosnia - Herzegovina -- political entertainment -- which was a shock for a public conditioned to the repressive treatment of politics under the former regime .
During the war , in the besieged city , under the fire of shells and snipers , in conditions impossible for life and work , FAMA began the conceptualization of several projects with artists and intellectuals .
SARAJEVO SURVIVAL GUIDE intends to be a version of Michelin , taking visitors through the city and instructing them on how to survive without transportation , hotels , taxis , telephones , food , shops , heating , water , information , electricity .
It is a chronicle , a part of a future archive which shows the city of Sarajevo not as a victim but as a place of experiment , where wit can still achieve victory over terror ...
CHICAGO – Rumors that a plan to privatize this city ’s drinking water is in the pipeline have residents alarmed .
“ Access to water is a human right , ” a woman who lives in the city ’s Little Village neighborhood told a gathering Monday evening .
“ It ’s a natural resource and water ownership plays out as a matter of life and death . ”
“ I ’ve seen what happens when private industry controls water , ” added former Peace Corps worker Jon Keesecker , an organizer with the Water Campaign of Food & Water Watch .
“ They can just turn off the tap . ”
The water issue takes on special urgency in this city on the shores of Lake Michigan .
Chicagoans are still fuming over the secret privatization of the municipal parking meter system last year .
They got soaked when overnight the cost of parking on public streets – often in front of ones workplace or residence – quadrupled , and the rate increases are not over yet .
Water defenders here hope that the experience of the parking meter debacle will help hold back the floodgates of privatization .
Word has leaked out that Mayor Richard Daley has met with consultants to explore selling off more public assets to for - profit corporations .
“ Everything is always on the table , ” he told the Chicago Tribune last fall .
Over 100 city residents attended the city - wide meeting April 19 held in the basement of a community theater on the city ’s near north side .
At the podium 32nd Ward Alderman Scott Waguespack was joined by representatives of several environmental organizations .
The event was publicized on 20 different web pages and through activists ’
Facebook networks .
Privatization effects percolate down to consumers
Keesecker described the dangers of privatization :
1 ) rates can go up .
Privately run systems in the state of Illinois average rates 36 percent higher than those publicly owned .
2 ) Services decline .
Privately - run systems rack up more violations of water quality standards .
3 ) Local control and transparency suffer .
A city truck driver attending the gathering added his personal experience to the list .
In a city reeling from unemployment , his job as a city truck driver was recently privatized .
He described what happened next : “ The rate paid to the drivers goes from $ 30 / hour to $ 10 .
And the contractor keeps the difference .
The new drivers with little experience are pushed to drive unsafe speeds and long hours .
And they get no pensions , no benefits and no union , ” he said bitterly .
“ The private contractors are stealing our work and selling to their friends .
The city residents pay a corruption tax . ”
Chicago model
Privatization is a global phenomenon , but “ Chicago is ground zero for a particular model that involves leasing the infrastructure , ” explained Rachel Weber , professor of Urban Planning and Policy from the University of Illinois .
In 2005 the Chicago Skyway became the first toll road in the nation to be privatized .
It had been owned and operated by the city ’s Department of Streets and Sanitation since it was built in 1958 .
The Daley administration sold it in a 99 - year concession to an Australian - Spanish consortium for a $ 1.83 billion .
Global funds thirsty for investment opportunities are driving pressure on privatization schemes .
With turmoil in other markets , publicly - owned infrastructure becomes an attractive opportunity .
Transparency and democratic control are urgently needed in this sector , said Weber .
She pointed out that financial giants like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have unregulated conflicts of interest .
After they act as financial advisers urging municipalities to sell their assets , they then collect enormous bonuses on the transactions .
Phineas Baxandall representing the Public Interest Research Group explained why privatization of water systems inevitably leads to higher consumer costs .
Investors , he said , do n’t purchase assets with upfront money .
Rather , they borrow the purchase money , and at higher rates than government agencies typically can get for financing infrastructure repairs .
Then , in order to pay back the big loans , the investors raise rates and cut services along with wages and jobs .
In the case of the toll road industry , analysts estimate that the tolls must be raised 30 percent to cover the financing costs .
Profiteering from a revenue stream
Baxandall compared the threatened water privatization to the sub - prime mortgage debacle .
The dominant business model , he said , is , “ You ’ve got a revenue stream , a private investor buys it , then wants to cash out quickly .
Then , ” he continued , “ It ’s securitized and sold to a thousand investors ” who own it but have no stake in running the system well .
“ Then who ’s looking out for the water users ? ” he asked .
The Department of Water ’s revenue stream is the $ 420 million Chicago homeowners and businesses pay in fees .
Alderman Waguespack is seeking support for a modest measure he has introduced in the City Council to slow down the drive to privatization .
The Assets Lease Ordinance would require public hearings and financial disclosure before future deals are signed .
Meeting attendees pledged to get the message out through their electronic networks and to approach their aldermen for support of Waguespack ’s ordinance .
The room that had filled up even before the scheduled meeting time of 7 p.m. quickly emptied out just before 9 p.m .
For those of us who drove , the two - hour maximum time on the parking meter was about to expire .

National aviation authorities continued to send conflicting messages to airlines and passengers on Sunday .
While some isolated airports , like Frankfurt , Berlin and Warsaw , cleared the way for a handful of flights heading away from the ash cloud , most flights in northern and central Europe remained grounded .
The British transportation secretary , Andrew Adonis , ruled out any immediate change , saying flights across northern Europe “ will not be safe ” on Monday .
But Scandinavian Airlines said it planned to operate flights Sunday night from the United States to Oslo and Stockholm .
Complicating any decisions is the continued eruption of the Icelandic volcano , Eyjafjallajokull .
As the ash cloud from the volcano has spread , it has shut down airports from the British Isles to Ukraine , disrupting the travel plans of nearly seven million travelers , according to one industry estimate .
Delta Air Lines , Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong , Qantas of Australia and China Airlines of Taiwan were among those that canceled Europe - bound flights through Monday .
Since the ash cloud first appeared over European airspace Thursday , more than 63,000 flights have been canceled .
Eurocontrol , the Brussels - based agency that coordinates air traffic management across the region , said that 20,000 flights , out of a regularly scheduled 24,000 , were canceled on Sunday .
The interruption in service , particularly across the Atlantic , comes as the industry had just started to recover from the global recession , with business and international travel picking up .
After the spike in oil prices in 2008 , several airlines went bankrupt , including Eos , an all - business - class carrier that offered flights between Kennedy International Airport in New York and Stansted Airport outside London .
Analysts said Europe ’s legacy flag carriers , including British Airways , Lufthansa and the Air France - KLM combination , would feel the most pain from the shutdown because they have high fixed costs .
Police have paid compensation and apologised to the comedian and activist Mark Thomas after they admitted unlawfully searching him for looking " over - confident " at a demonstration .
The Metropolitan police stopped and searched Thomas after he gave a speech at a rally against the arms trade in 2007 .
The police searched his shoulder bag and wallet for weapons , which they said could be used to cause criminal damage .
A police officer recorded on an official form that Thomas may have been carrying weapons as he had an " over - confident attitude " .
Nothing was found .
In January the European court of human rights ruled it was unlawful for police to use arbitrary stop - and - search powers against peace protesters and photographers under terrorism legislation .
Kent police admitted conducting unlawful searches on 11 - year - old twins and other activists at an environmental demonstration .
The Met promised to cite the unlawful search on Thomas when training officers .
Thomas , 47 , has campaigned for many years against the arms trade .
He gave the speech at a heavily policed protest against an arms fair in London Docklands in 2007 .
He was stopped by a constable from the Territorial Support Group as he entered a station to go home .
The constable said he suspected he could have weapons " intended for criminal damage " , adding that the station had already been attacked with paint .
The officer said his shoulder bag " may contain such items due to the over - confident attitude of Mr Thomas " .
He is also said to have told Thomas he " appeared to know what you were talking about " at the rally .
The officer added : " If we only stopped and searched people who looked nervous and shifty and did n't stop the ones who looked over - confident you would be able to get one past us , " according to legal papers lodged by Thomas , which were not disputed by the police .
The officer noted on the official document recording the reasons for the stop - and - search that Thomas was " believed to be an influential individual " .
The comedian 's photograph had been on a secret " spotter card " issued to officers to identify people considered to be potential troublemakers at a demonstration against the arms fair two years earlier .
The Met paid £ 1,200 for " falsely imprisoning " Thomas for 12 minutes .
He said : " £ 100 a minute is slightly more than my usual rate .
If over - confidence is a reason for a stop - and - search Jonathan Ross should never leave his house . "
Thomas said he would donate some of the money to the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation .
He will also use it to fund his next standup tour , saying advertising posters would contain a line thanking the police for their financial support .
In a letter to Thomas , Detective Chief Inspector Adrian Baxter of the Met 's professional standards department said : " I would like to express my regret for the distress that you have suffered … and offer my unreserved apologies . "
The officer who carried out the search had received " formal words of advice " .
Lucius Annaeus Seneca ( c. 4 BC – A.D. 65 ) , often known simply as Seneca , or Seneca the Younger , was a Roman Stoic philosopher , statesman , dramatist , and humorist .
He was the son of Seneca the Elder .

Letter I : On Saving Time [ edit ]
Quem mihi dabis qui aliquod pretium tempori ponat , qui diem aestimet , qui intellegat se cotidie mori ?
What man can you show me who places any value on his time , who reckons the worth of each day , who understands that he is dying daily ?
In hoc enim fallimur , quod mortem prospicimus : magna pars eius iam praeterit ; quidquid aetatis retro est mors tenet .
For we are mistaken when we look forward to death ; the major portion of death has already passed .
Whatever years be behind us are in death 's hands .
Lay hold of today ’s task , and you will not need to depend so much upon tomorrow’s .
While we are postponing , life speeds by .
Tanta stultitia mortalium est .
What fools these mortals be !
Sera parsimonia in fundo est .
It is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask .
Line 5
This quote is often directly attributed to Seneca , but he is referring to lines 368-369 of Works and Days by the Greek poet Hesiod :
Take your fill when the cask is first opened and when it is nearly spent , but midways be sparing : it is poor saving when you come to the lees .
( translated by Hugh G. Evelyn - White ) Alternate translation :
Thrift comes too late when you find it at the bottom of your purse .
( translator unknown )
Alternate translation :
It is too late to be thrifty when the bottom has been reached .
( translator unknown ) .
Letter II : On discursiveness in reading [ edit ]
The primary indication , to my thinking , of a well - ordered mind is a man ’s ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company .
Nusquam est qui ubique est .
Vitam in peregrinatione exigentibus hoc evenit , ut multa hospitia habeant , nullas amicitias .
Who is everywhere is nowhere .
When a person spends all his time in foreign travel , he ends by having many acquaintances , but no friends .
Line 2 .
Non qui parum habet , sed qui plus cupit , pauper est .
It is not the man who has too little , but the man who craves more , that is poor .
Line 6 .
Letter III : On true and false friendship [ edit ]
Nam illa tumultu gaudens non est industria sed exagitatae mentis concursatio .
For love of bustle is not industry – it is only the restlessness of a hunted mind .
Line 5 .
Letter IV : On the terrors of death [ edit ]
Nulli potest secura vita contingere qui de producenda nimis cogitat .
No man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it .
Line 4 .
Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life ; they are unwilling to live , and yet they do not know how to die .
No man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged him .
Letter V : On the Philosopher ’s Mean [ edit ]
I commend you and rejoice in the fact that you are persistent in your studies , and that , putting all else aside , you make it each day your endeavour to become a better man .
Letter VI : On precepts and exemplars [ edit ]
Plus tamen tibi et viva vox et convictus quam oratio proderit ; in rem praesentem venias oportet , primum quia homines amplius oculis quam auribus credunt , deinde quia longum iter est per praecepta , breve et efficax per exempla .
Of course , however , the living voice and the intimacy of a common life will help you more than the written word .
You must go to the scene of action , first , because men put more faith in their eyes than in their ears , and second , because the way is long if one follows precepts , but short and helpful , if one follows patterns .
Line 5 . Alternate translation : Teaching by precept is a long road , but short and beneficial is the way by example .
“ What progress , you ask , have I made ?
I have begun to be a friend to myself . ”
That was indeed agreat benefit ; such a person can never be alone .
You may be sure that such a man is a friend to all mankind .
Seneca is quoting Hecato .
Letter VII : On crowds [ edit ]
But both courses are to be avoided ; you should not copy the bad simply because they are many , nor should you hate the many because they are unlike you .
Recede in te ipse quantum potes ; cum his versare qui te meliorem facturi sunt , illos admitte quos tu potes facere meliores .
Mutuo ista fiunt , et homines dum docent discunt .
Withdraw into yourself , as far as you can .
Associate with those who will make a better man of you .
Welcome those whom you yourself can improve .
The process is mutual ; for men learn while they teach .
Line 8 .
Letter X : On living to oneself [ edit ]
sic vive cum hominibus tamquam deus videat , si loquere cum deo tamquam homines audiant .
Live among men as if God beheld you ; speak with God as if men were listening .
Line 5 .
Letter XII : On old age [ edit ]
sciant quae optima sunt esse communia .
The best ideas are common property .
Line 11 .
Letter XIII : On Groundless Fears [ edit ]
... the only contestant who can confidently enter the lists is the man who has seen his own blood , who has felt his teeth rattle beneath his opponent ’s fist , who has been tripped and felt the full force of his adversary ’s charge , who has been downed in body but not in spirit , one who , as often as he falls , rises again with greater defiance than ever .
Let another say .
“ Perhaps the worst will not happen . ”
You yourself must say .
“ Well , what if it does happen ?
Let us see who wins !
Perhaps it happens for my best interests ; it may be that such a death will shed credit upon my life . ”
Socrates was ennobled by the hemlock draught .
Wrench from Cato's hand his sword , the vindicator of liberty , and you deprive him of the greatest share of his glory .
Letter XV [ edit ]
Mos antiquis fuit , usque ad meam servatus aetatem , primis epistulae verbis adicere ' si vales bene est , ego valeo ' .
Recte nos dicimus ' si philosopharis , bene est ' .
Valere enim hoc demum est .
Sine hoc aeger est animus .
The old Romans had a custom which survived even into my lifetime .
They would add to the opening words of a letter : " If you are well , it is well ; I also am well . "
Persons like ourselves would do well to say .
" If you are studying philosophy , it is well . "
For this is just what " being well " means .
Without philosophy the mind is sickly .
Letter XVII : On Philosophy and Riches [ edit ]
There is no reason why poverty should call us away from philosophy — no , nor even actual want .
For when hastening after wisdom , we must endure even hunger .
Men have endured hunger when their towns were besieged , and what other reward for their endurance did they obtain than that they did not fall under the conqueror ’s power ?
How much greater is the promise of the prize of everlasting liberty , and the assurance that we need fear neither God nor man !
Even though we starve , we must reach that goal .
Armies have endured all manner of want , have lived on roots , and have resisted hunger by means of food too revolting to mention .
All this they have suffered to gain a kingdom , and — what is more marvellous — to gain a kingdom that will be another ’s .
Will any man hesitate to endure poverty , in order that he may free his mind from madness ?
Letter XVIII : On Festivals and Fasting [ edit ]
If you would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes , train him before it comes .
Letter XIX : On worldliness and retirement [ edit ]
Leve aes alienum debitorem facit , grave inimicum .
A trifling debt makes a man your debtor ; a large one makes him an enemy .
Line 11 .
Letter XX : On practicing what you preach [ edit ]
Prove your words by your deeds .
quid est sapienta ?
semper idem velle atque idem nolle .
What is wisdom ?
Always desiring the same things , and always refusing the same things .
Line 5
Here , Seneca uses the same observation that Sallust made regarding friendship ( in his historical account of the Catilinarian conspiracy , Bellum Catilinae [ XX.4 ] ) to define wisdom .
Press on , therefore , as you have begun ; perhaps you will be led to perfection , or to a point which you alone understand is still short of perfection .
Letter XXII : On the futility of half - way measures [ edit ]
Nemo quam bene vivat sed quam diu curat , cum omnibus possit contingere ut bene vivant , ut diu nulli .
Men do not care how nobly they live , but only how long , although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly , but within no man 's power to live long .
Line 17 .
Letter XXIV : On despising death [ edit ]
You will thus understand that what you fear is either insignificant or short - lived .
Mucius put his hand into the fire .
It is painful to be burned ; but how much more painful to inflict such suffering upon oneself !
[ Mucius ] might have accomplished something more successful in that camp , but never anything more brave .
It was a great deed to conquer Carthage , but a greater deed to conquer death .
Illud autem ante omnia memento , demere rebus tumultum ac videre quid in quaque re sit : scies nihil esse in istis terribile nisi ipsum timorem .
Remember , however , before all else , to strip things of all that disturbs and confuses , and to see what each is at bottom ; you will then comprehend that they contain nothing fearful except the actual fear .
Line 12 Alternate translation :
You will understand that there is nothing dreadful in this except fear itself .
( translator unknown ) .
Letter XXV : On Reformation [ edit ]
I may become a poor man ; I shall then be one among many .
I may be exiled ; I shall then regard myself as born in the place to which I shall be sent .
They may put me in chains .
What then ?
Am I free from bonds now ?
Behold this clogging burden of a body , to which nature has fettered me !
“ I shall die , ” you say ; you mean to say “ I shall cease to run the risk of sickness ; I shall cease to run the risk of imprisonment ; I shall cease to run the risk of death . ”
I do not know whether I shall make progress ; but I should prefer to lack success rather than to lack faith .
Letter XXVI : On Old Age and Death [ edit ]
You do not know where death awaits you ; so be ready for it everywhere .
Letter XXVII [ edit ]
' Tu me ' inquis ' mones ?
iam enim te ipse monuisti , iam correxisti ?
ideo aliorum emendationi vacas ? '
Non sum tam improbus ut curationes aeger obeam , sed , tamquam in eodem valetudinario iaceam , de communi tecum malo colloquor et remedia communico .
" What , " say you , " are you giving me advice ?
Indeed , have you already advised yourself , already corrected your own faults ?
Is this the reason why you have leisure to reform other men ? "
No , I am not so shameless as to undertake to cure my fellow - men when I am ill myself .
I am , however , discussing with you troubles which concern us both , and sharing the remedy with you , just as if we were lying ill in the same hospital .
Sola virtus praestat gaudium perpetuum , securum ; etiam si quid obstat , nubium modo intervenit , quae infra feruntur nec umquam diem vincunt .
Virtue alone affords everlasting and peace - giving joy ; even if some obstacle arise , it is but like an intervening cloud , which floats beneath the sun but never prevails against it .
Letter XXVIII : On travel as a cure for discontent [ edit ]
You need a change of soul rather than a change of climate .
You must lay aside the burdens of the mind ; until you do this , no place will satisfy you .
Nam qui peccare se nescit , corrigi non vult .
If one does n't know his mistakes , he wo n't want to correct them .
Line 9
Letter XXX : On conquering the conqueror [ edit ]
Magnus gubernator et scisso navigat velo .
A great pilot can sail even when his canvas is rent .
Line 3 .
He who does not wish to die cannot have wished to live .
Letter XXXI : On Siren Songs [ edit ]
I forbid you to be cast down or depressed .
It is not enough if you do not shrink from work ; ask for it .
Letter XXXII : On Progress [ edit ]
Would you know what makes men greedy for the future ?
It is because no one has yet found himself .
Letter XXXIII [ edit ]
Ideo pueris et sententias ediscendas damus et has quas Graeci chrias vocant , quia complecti illas puerilis animus potest , qui plus adhuc non capit .
Certi profectus viro captare flosculos turpe est et fulcire se notissimis ac paucissimis vocibus et memoria stare : sibi iam innitatur .
Dicat ista , non teneat ; turpe est enim seni aut prospicienti senectutem ex commentario sapere .
' Hoc Zenon dixit ' : tu quid ?
' Hoc Cleanthes ' : tu quid ?
Quousque sub alio moveris ?
impera et dic quod memoriae tradatur , aliquid et de tuo profer .
That is why we give to children a proverb , or that which the Greeks call Chreia , to be learned by heart ; that sort of thing can be comprehended by the young mind , which cannot as yet hold more .
For a man , however , whose progress is definite , to chase after choice extracts and to prop his weakness by the best known and the briefest sayings and to depend upon his memory , is disgraceful ; it is time for him to lean on himself .
He should make such maxims and not memorize them .
For it is disgraceful even for an old man , or one who has sighted old age , to have a note - book knowledge .
" This is what Zeno said . "
But what have you yourself said ?
" This is the opinion of Cleanthes . "
But what is your own opinion ?
How long shall you march under another man 's orders ?
Take command , and utter some word which posterity will remember .
Put forth something from your own stock .
Praeterea qui alium sequitur nihil invenit , immo nec quaerit .
Besides , he who follows another not only discovers nothing but is not even investigating .
Quid ergo ?
non ibo per priorum vestigia ?
ego vero utar via vetere , sed si propiorem planioremque invenero , hanc muniam .
Qui ante nos ista moverunt non domini nostri sed duces sunt .
Patet omnibus veritas ; nondum est occupata ; multum ex illa etiam futuris relictum est .
What then ?
Shall I not follow in the footsteps of my predecessors ?
I shall indeed use the old road , but if I find one that makes a shorter cut and is smoother to travel , I shall open the new road .
Men who have made these discoveries before us are not our masters , but our guides .
Truth lies open for all ; it has not yet been monopolized .
And there is plenty of it left even for posterity to discover .
Letter XXXV [ edit ]
Amicitia semper prodest , amor aliquando etiam nocet Friendship is always helpful , but love sometimes even does harm
Letter XXXVII : On Allegiance to Virtue [ edit ]
You must die erect and unyielding .
It is disgraceful , instead of proceeding ahead , to be carried along , and then suddenly , amid the whirlpool of events , to ask in a dazed way : “ How did I get into this condition ? ”
Letter XXXIX : On Noble Aspirations [ edit ]
It is the quality of a great soul to scorn great things and to prefer that which is ordinary rather than that which is too great .
Then it is that the height of unhappiness is reached , when men are not only attracted , but even pleased , by shameful things , and when there is no longer any room for a cure , now that those things which once were vices have become habits .
Letter XLI : On the god within us [ edit ]
Facis rem optimam et tibi salutarem , si , ut scribis , perseveras ire ad bonam mentem , quam stultum est optare , cum possis a te impetrare .
Non sunt ad caelum elevandae inarms nee exorandus aedituus , ut nos ad aurem simulacri , quasi magis exaudiri possimus , admittat ; Prope est a te deus , tecum est , intus est .
Ita dico , Lucili : sacer intra nos spiritus sedet , malorum bonorumque nostrorum observator et custos ...
You are doing an excellent thing , one which will be wholesome for you , if , as you write me , you are persisting in your effort to attain sound understanding ; it is foolish to pray for this when you can acquire it from yourself .
We do not need to uplift our hands towards heaven , or to beg the keeper of a temple to let us approach his idol 's ear , as if in this way our prayers were more likely to be heard .
A god is near you , with you , and in you .
This is what I mean , Lucilius : there sits a holy spirit within us , one who marks our good and bad deeds , and is our a guardian .
Non faciunt meliorem equum aurei freni .
If you see a man who is unterrified in the midst of dangers , untouched by desires , happy in adversity , peaceful amid the storm , who looks down upon men from a higher plane , and views the gods on a footing of equality , will not a feeling of reverence for him steal over you , will you not say : “ This quality is too great and too lofty to be regarded as resembling this petty body in which it dwells ?
A divine power has descended upon that man . ”
A golden bit does not make a better horse .
No man ought to glory except in that which is his own .
Rationale enim animal est homo .
Man is a reasoning animal .
Letter XLII : On Values [ edit ]
Very often the things that cost nothing cost us the most heavily ; I can show you many objects the quest and acquisition of which have wrested freedom from our hands .
“ You will have less money . ”
Yes , and less trouble .
“ Less influence . ”
Yes , and less envy .
He that owns himself has lost nothing .
But how few men are blessed with ownership of self !
Letter XLIII : On the relativity of fame [ edit ]
Is qui scit plurimum , rumor .
That most knowing of persons – gossip .
Line 1 .
Letter XLV : On sophistical argumentation [ edit ]
Non refert quam multos sed quam bonos habeas .
It is quality rather than quantity that matters .
Line 1
At any rate , if you wish to sift doubtful meanings of this kind , teach us that the happy man is not he whom the crowd deems happy , namely , he into whose coffers mighty sums have flowed , but he whose possessions are all in his soul , who is upright and exalted , who spurns inconstancy , who sees no man with whom he wishes to change places , who rates men only at their value as men , who takes Nature for his teacher , conforming to her laws and living as she commands , whom no violence can deprive of his possessions , who turns evil into good , is unerring in judgment , unshaken , unafraid , who may be moved by force but never moved to distraction , whom Fortune when she hurls at him with all her might the deadliest missile in her armoury , may graze , though rarely , but never wound .
Letter XLVII : On master and slave [ edit ]
“ They are slaves , ” people declare .
Nay , rather they are men .
“ Slaves ! ” No , comrades .
“ Slaves ! ” No , they are unpretentious friends .
“ Slaves ! ”
No , they are our fellow - slaves , if one reflects that Fortune has equal rights over slaves and free men alike .
Vis tu cogitare istum quem servum tuum vocas ex isdem seminibus ortum eodem frui caelo , aeque spirare , aeque vivere , aeque mori !
tam tu illum videre ingenuum potes quam ille te servum .
Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock , is smiled upon by the same skies , and on equal terms with yourself breathes , lives and dies .
It is just as possible for you to see in him a free - born man as for him to see in you a slave .
Line 10 .
sic cum inferiore vivas quemadmodum tecum superiorem velis vivere .
Treat your inferiors as you would be treated by your betters .
Line 11
This can be related to other expressions on the ethics of reciprocity , often referred to as the variants of the Golden Rule .
I propose to value them according to their character , and not according to their duties .
Each man acquires his character for himself , but accident assigns his duties .
“ He is a slave . ”
His soul , however , may be that of a freeman .
“ He is a slave . ”
But shall that stand in his way ?
Show me a man who is not a slave ; one is a slave to lust , another to greed , another to ambition , and all men are slaves to fear .
Letter XLVII : On master and slave [ edit ]
Would you really know what philosophy offers to humanity ?
Philosophy offers counsel .
Letter XLIX : On the Shortness of Life [ edit ]
It is generally agreed that no activity can be successfully pursued by an individual who is preoccupied – not rhetoric or liberal studies – since the mind when distracted absorbs nothing deeply , but rejects everything which is , so to speak , crammed into it .
Show me that the good in life does not depend upon life ’s length , but upon the use we make of it ; also , that it is possible , or rather usual , for a man who has lived long to have lived too little .
Say to me when I lie down to sleep : “ You may not wake again ! ”
And when I have waked : “ You may not go to sleep again ! ”
Say to me when I go forth from my house : “ You may not return ! ”
And when I return : “ You may never go forth again ! ”
Letter L : On Our Blindness and Its Cure [ edit ]
For what else are you busied with except improving yourself every day , laying aside some error , and coming to understand that the faults which you attribute to circumstances are in yourself ?
Letter LI : On Baiae and Morals [ edit ]
And what is freedom , you ask ?
It means not being a slave to any circumstance , to any constraint , to any chance ; it means compelling Fortune to enter the lists on equal terms .
Would not anyone who is a man have his slumbers broken by a war - trumpet rather than by a chorus of serenaders ?
Letter LII : On choosing our teachers [ edit ]
qualis quisque sit scies , si quemadmodum laudet , quemadmodum laudetur aspexeris .
You can tell the character of every man when you see how he gives and receives praise .
Line 12 .
Letter LV : On Vatia ’s Villa [ edit ]
Our luxuries have condemned us to weakness ; we have ceased to be able to do that which we have long declined to do .
Letter LVI : On quiet and study [ edit ]
numquam vacat lascivire districtis , nihilque tam certum est quam otii vitia negotio discuti .
The much occupied man has no time for wantonness , and it is an obvious commonplace that the evils of leisure can be shaken off by hard work .
Line 9 Alternate translation : Nothing is so certain as that the evils of idleness can be shaken off by hard work .
( translator unknown ) .
Letter LVIII : On Being [ edit ]
We are weak , watery beings standing in the midst of unrealities ; therefore let us turn our minds to the things that are everlasting .
Letter LIX : On Pleasure and Joy [ edit ]
But the wise man is fortified against all inroads ; he is alert ; he will not retreat before the attack of poverty , or of sorrow , or of disgrace , or of pain .
He will walk undaunted both against them and among them .
The wise man is joyful , happy and calm , unshaken , he lives on a plane with the gods .
That which Fortune has not given , she can not take away .
Letter LXI : On meeting death cheerfully [ edit ]
I am endeavouring to live every day as if it were a complete life .
Ante senectutem curavi ut bene viverem , in senectute ut bene moriar ; bene autem mori est libenter mori .
Before I became old I tried to live well ; now that I am old , I shall try to die well ; but dying well means dying gladly .
Line 2 .
Letter LXII [ edit ]
Brevissima ad divitias per contemptum divitiarum via est .
The shortest way to wealth is through the contempt of wealth .
Letter LXIII [ edit ]
Fortune has taken away , but Fortune has given .
Let us greedily enjoy our friends , because we do not know how long this privilege will be ours .
Nulla res citius in odium venit quam dolor , qui recens consolatorem invenit et aliquos ad se adducit , inveteratus vero deridetur , nec inmerito .
Translation : Nothing becomes so offensive so quickly as grief .
When fresh it finds someone to console it , but when it becomes chronic , it is ridiculed and rightly .
Line 13 .
Whatever can happen at any time can happen today .
Not lost , but gone before .

Letter LXV : On the first cause [ edit ]
Omnis ars naturae imitatio est .
All art is but imitation of nature .
Line 3 .
Letter LXVI : On Various Aspects of Virtue [ edit ]
Great also are the souls of the defenders — men who know that , as long as the path to death lies open , the blockade is not complete , men who breathe their last in the arms of liberty .
Allow me , excellent Lucilius , to utter a still bolder word : if any goods could be greater than others , I should prefer those which seem harsh to those which are mild and alluring , and should pronounce them greater .
For it is more of an accomplishment to break one ’s way through difficulties than to keep joy within bounds .
There stood Mucius , despising the enemy and despising the fire , and watched his hand as it dripped blood over the fire on his enemy ’s altar , until Porsenna , envying the fame of the hero whose punishment he was advocating , ordered the fire to be removed against the will of the victim .
I cannot help believing that Mucius was all the more lucky because he manipulated the flames as calmly as if he were holding out his hand to the manipulator .
He had wiped out all his previous mistakes ; he finished the war unarmed and maimed ; and with that stump of a hand he conquered two kings .
Letter LXVII : On Ill - Health and Endurance of Suffering [ edit ]
I should prefer to be free from torture ; but if the time comes when it must be endured , I shall desire that I may conduct myself therein with bravery , honour , and courage .
Of course I prefer that war should not occur ; but if war does occur , I shall desire that I may nobly endure the wounds , the starvation , and all that the exigency of war brings .
Nor am I so mad as to crave illness ; but if I must suffer illness , I shall desire that I may do nothing which shows lack of restraint , and nothing that is unmanly .
The conclusion is , not that hardships are desirable , but that virtue is desirable , which enables us patiently to endure hardships .
Now a life of honour includes various kinds of conduct ; it may include the chest in which Regulus was confined , or the wound of Cato which was torn open by Cato ’s own hand , or the exile of Rutilius , or the cup of poison which removed Socrates from gaol to heaven .
Clothe yourself with a hero ’s courage , and withdraw for a little space from the opinions of the common man .
Form a proper conception of the image of virtue , a thing of exceeding beauty and grandeur ; this image is not to be worshipped by us with incense or garlands , but with sweat and blood .
“ I should prefer that Fortune keep me in her camp rather than in the lap of luxury .
If I am tortured , but bear it bravely , all is well ; if I die , but die bravely , it is also well . ”
Why should I not regard this as desirable — not because the fire , burns me , but because it does not overcome me ?
Letter LXX :
On the proper time to slip the cable [ edit ]
Sapiens vivit quantum debet , non quantum potest .
The wise man will live as long as he ought , not as long as he can .
Line 4 .
Letter LXXI : On the supreme good [ edit ]
errant consilia nostra , quia non habent quo derigantur ; ignoranti quem portum petat nullus suus ventus est .
Our plans miscarry because they have no aim .
When a man does not know what harbour he is making for , no wind is the right wind .
Line 3
Alternate translation :
If one does not know to which port one is sailing , no wind is favorable .
( translator unknown ) .
These actions are not essentially difficult ; it is we ourselves that are soft and flabby .
He knows his own strength ; he knows that he was born to carry burdens .
Do you ask me whom I have conquered ?
Neither the Persians , nor the far - off Medes , nor any warlike race that lies beyond the Dahae ; not these , but greed , ambition , and the fear of death that has conquered the conquerors of the world .
Letter LXXIV : On Virtue as a Refuge From Worldly Distractions [ edit ]
But no wall can be erected against Fortune which she cannot take by storm ; let us strengthen our inner defences .
If the inner part be safe , man can be attacked , but never captured .
Letter LXXVI : On Learning Wisdom in Old Age [ edit ]
But the wise man knows that all things are in store for him .
Whatever happens , he says : “ I knew it . ”
Letter LXXVII : On Taking One ’s Own Life [ edit ]
Would you not think him an utter fool who wept because he was not alive a thousand years ago ?
And is he not just as much of a fool who weeps because he will not be alive a thousand years from now ?
It is all the same ; you will not be , and you were not .
Neither of these periods of time belongs to you .
So near at hand is freedom , and is anyone still a slave ?
What else is there which you would regret to have taken from you ?
Friends ?
But who can be a friend to you ?
Country ?
What ?
Do you think enough of your country to be late to dinner ?
The light of the sun ?
You would extinguish it , if you could ; for what have you ever done that was fit to be seen in the light ?
Letter LXXVIII : On the Healing Power of the Mind [ edit ]
Aliquando enim et vivere fortiter facere est For sometimes it is an act of bravery even to live .
Seneca , Ad Lucilium epistulae morales , transl .
Richard M. Grummere , 1920 ed. , Epistle LXXVIII , pp. 181-182
There is no sorrow in the world , when we have escaped from the fear of death .
You will die , not because you are ill , but because you are alive ; even when you have been cured , thesame end awaits you ; when you have recovered , it will be not death , but ill health , that you have escaped .
No man can suffer both severely and for a long time ; Nature , who loves us most tenderly , has so constituted us as to make pain either endurable or short .
“ It is nothing — a trifling matter at most ; keep a stout heart and it will soon cease ” ; then in thinking it slight , you will make it slight .
Everything depends on opinion ; ambition , luxury , greed , hark back to opinion .
It is according to opinion that we suffer .
Two elements must therefore be rooted out once for all — the fear of future suffering , and the recollection of past suffering ; since the latter no longer concerns me , and the former concerns me not yet .
Is it for this purpose that we are strong — that we may have light burdens to bear ?
Meanwhile , hold fast to this thought , and grip it close : yield not to adversity ; trust not to prosperity ; keep before your eyes the full scope of Fortune ’s power , as if she would surely do whatever is in her power to do .
Letter LXXXI : On benefits [ edit ]
Eo animo quidque debetur quo datur , nec quantum sit sed a quali profectum voluntate perpenditur .
Our feeling about every obligation depends in each case upon the spirit in which the benefit is conferred ; we weigh not the bulk of the gift , but the quality of the good - will which prompted it .
Line 6 Alternate translation :
The spirit in which a thing is given determines that in which the debt is acknowledged ; it 's the intention , not the face - value of the gift , that 's weighed .
( translator unknown ) .
Quemadmodum Attalus noster dicere solebat , ' malitia ipsa maximam partem veneni sui bibit ' .
Illud venenum quod serpentes in alienam perniciem proferunt , sine sua continent , non est huic simile : hoc habentibus pessimum est .
My master Attalus used to say : " Evil herself drinks the largest portion of her own poison . "
The poison which serpents carry for the destruction of others , and secrete without harm to themselves , is not like this poison ; for this sort is ruinous to the possessor .
Line 22
Letter LXXXII : On the Natural Fear of Death [ edit ]
“ You must go now , fellow - soldiers , to yonder place , whence there is no ‘ must ’ about your returning ! ” Seneca is citing [ Marcus Calpurnius Flamma , a Roman general in the First Punic War ]

Confragosa in fastigium dignitatis via est .
It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness .
Line 13
It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness .
Letter LXXXV : On Some Vain Syllogisms [ edit ]
But he has no fear ; unconquered he looks down from a lofty height upon his sufferings .
Thus no fortune , no external circumstance , can shut off the wise man from action .
For the very thing which engages his attention prevents him from attending to other things .
He is ready for either outcome : if it brings goods , he controls them ; if evils , he conquers them .
So the wise man will develop virtue , if he may , in the midst of wealth , or , if not , in poverty ; if possible , in his own country — if not , in exile ; if possible , as a commander — if not , as a common soldier ; if possible , in sound health — if not , enfeebled .
Whatever fortune he finds , he will accomplish therefrom something noteworthy .
Letter LXXXVII : Some arguments in favor of the simple life [ edit ]
quemadmodum gladius neminem occidit : occidentis telum est .
A sword by itself does not slay ; it is merely the weapon used by the slayer .
Line 30 Seneca is here describing arguments used by ' certain men , ' not stating his own opinion .
Alternate translation : A sword never kills anybody ; it is a tool in the killer 's hand .
( translator unknown ) .
Letter LXXXVIII : On liberal and vocational studies [ edit ]
Satius est supervacua scire quam nihil .
It is better , of course , to know useless things than to know nothing .
Line 45 .
Quemadmodum perniciosior est hostis fugientibus , sic omne fortuitum incommodum magis instat cedenti et averso .
Just as an enemy is more dangerous to a retreating army , so every trouble that fortune brings attacks us all the harder if we yield and turn our backs .
Letter XC : On the Part Played by Philosophy in the Progress of Man [ edit ]
A thatched roof once covered free men ; under marble and gold dwells slavery .
Letter XCI : On the Lesson to be Drawn From the Burning of Lyons [ edit ]
Alexander , king of Macedon , began to study geometry ; unhappy man , because he would thereby learn how puny was that earth of which he had seized but a fraction !
Unhappy man , I repeat , because he was bound to understand that he was bearing a false title .
For who can be “ great ” in that which is puny ?
Imagine that nature is saying to us : “ Those things of which you complain are the same for all .
I cannot give anything easier to any man , but whoever wishes will make things easier for himself . ”
In what way ?
By equanimity .
You must suffer pain , and thirst , and hunger , and old age too , if a longer stay among men shall be granted you ; you must be sick , and you must suffer loss and death .
Letter XCII : On the Happy Life [ edit ]
That man , I declare , is happy whom nothing makes less strong than he is ; he keeps to the heights , leaning upon none but himself ; for one who sustains himself by any prop may fall .
Nemo liber est qui corpori servit .
For no man is free who is a slave to his body .
Letter XCV : On the usefulness of basic principles [ edit ]
postea noli rogare quod inpetrare nolueris .
Do n't ask for what you 'll wish you had n't got .
Line 1 Seneca himself states that he is quoting a ' common saying ' here .
Alternate translation :
Do not ask for what you will wish you had not got .
( translator unknown ) .
Saepe aliud volumus , aliud optamus , et verum ne dis quidem dicimus .
We often want one thing and pray for another , not telling the truth even to the gods .
Line 2 .
Non privatim solum sed publice furimus .
Homicidia conpescimus et singulas caedes : quid bella et occisarum gentium gloriosum scelus ?
Non avaritia , non crudelitas modum novit .
Et ista quamdiu furtim et a singulis fiunt minus noxia minusque monstrosa sunt : ex senatus consultis plebisque scitis saeva exercentur et publice iubentur vetata privatim .
Quae clam commissa capite luerent , tum quia paludati fecere laudamus .
Non pudet homines , mitissimum genus , gaudere sanguine alterno et bella gerere gerendaque liberis tradere , cum inter se etiam mutis ac feris pax sit .
Adversus tam potentem explicitumque late furorem operosior philosophia facta est et tantum sibi virium sumpsit quantum iis adversus quae parabatur acceserat .
We are mad , not only individually , but nationally .
We check manslaughter and isolated murders ; but what of war and the much - vaunted crime of slaughtering whole peoples ?
There are no limits to our greed , none to our cruelty .
And as long as such crimes are committed by stealth and by individuals , they are less harmful and less portentous ; but cruelties are practised in accordance with acts of senate and popular assembly , and the public is bidden to do that which is forbidden to the individual .
Deeds that would be punished by loss of life when committed in secret , are praised by us because uniformed generals have carried them out .
Man , naturally the gentlest class of being , is not ashamed to revel in the blood of others , to wage war , and to entrust the waging of war to his sons , when even dumb beasts and wild beasts keep the peace with one another .
Against this overmastering and widespread madness philosophy has become a matter of greater effort , and has taken on strength in proportion to the strength which is gained by the opposition forces .
Lines 30 - 32 .
As our acts and our thoughts are , so will our lives be .
Letter XCVI [ edit ]
Atqui vivere , Lucili , militare est .
And yet life , Lucilius , is really a battle .
For this reason those who are tossed about at sea , who proceed uphill and downhill over toilsome crags and heights , who go on campaigns that bring the greatest danger , are heroes and front - rank fighters ; but persons who live in rotten luxury and ease while others toil , are mere turtle - doves safe only because men despise them .
Letter XCVIII : On the Fickleness of Fortune [ edit ]
“ All the Good of mortals is mortal . ”
“ Of all these experiences that seem so frightful , none is insuperable .
Separate trials have been over - come by many : fire by Mucius , crucifixion by Regulus , poison by Socrates , exile by Rutilius , and a sword - inflicted death by Cato ; therefore , let us also overcome something . ”
Pain he endures , death he awaits .
Letter XCVIX : On Consolation to the Bereaved [ edit ]
Whoever complains about the death of anyone , is complaining that he was a man .
Everyone is bound by the same terms : he who is privileged to be born , is destined to die .
Accept in an unruffled spirit that which is inevitable .
Letter CI : On the Futility of Planning Ahead [ edit ]
But how foolish it is to set out one ’s life , when one is not even owner of the morrow !
Therefore , my dear Lucilius , begin at once to live , and count each separate day as a separate life .
The point is , not how long you live , but how nobly you live .
And often this living nobly means that you cannot live long .
Letter CIV : On Care of Health and Peace of Mind [ edit ]
Socrates is reported to have replied , when a certain person complained of having received no benefit from his travels : “ It serves you right !
You travelled in your own company ! ”
What profit is there in crossing the sea and in going from one city to another ?
If you would escape your troubles , you need not another place but another personality .
Perhaps you have reached Athens , or perhaps Rhodes ; choose any state you fancy , how does it matter what its character may be ?
You will be bringing to it your own .
“ New friends , however , will not be the same . ”
No , nor will you yourself remain the same ; you change with every day and every hour .
Si sapis , alterum alteri misce : nec speraveris sine desperatione nec desperaveris sine spe .
If you are wise , mingle these two elements : do not hope without despair , or despair without hope .
Line 12 Alternate translation :
Hope not without despair , despair not without hope .
( translated by Zachariah Rush ) .
Or , if you enjoy living with Greeks also , spend your time with Socrates and with Zeno : the former will show you how to die if it be necessary ; the latter how to die before it is necessary .
Live with Chrysippus , with Posidonius : they will make you acquainted with things earthly and things heavenly ; they will bid you work hard over something more than neat turns of language and phrases mouthed forth for the entertainment of listeners ; they will bid you be stout of heart and rise superior to threats .
The only harbour safe from the seething storms of this life is scorn of the future , a firm stand , a readiness to receive Fortune ’s missiles full in the breast , neither skulking nor turning the back .
This spirit thrusts itself forward , confident of commendation and esteem .
It is superior to all , monarch of all it surveys ; hence it should be subservient to nothing , finding no task too heavy , and nothing strong enough to weigh down the shoulders of a man .
At quanto ego de illis melius existimo !
ipsi quoque haec possunt facere , sed nolunt .
Denique quem umquam ista destituere temptantem ?
cui non faciliora apparuere in actu ?
Non quia difficilia sunt non audemus , sed quia non audemus difficilia sunt .
But how much more highly do I think of these men !
They can do these things , but decline to do them .
To whom that ever tried have these tasks proved false ?
To what man did they not seem easier in the doing ?
Our lack of confidence is not the result of difficulty .
The difficulty comes from our lack of confidence .
Also translated as :
It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare , but because we do not dare , things are difficult .
Verse 26
He maintained this attitude up to the very end , and no man ever saw Socrates too much elated or too much depressed .
Amid all the disturbance of Fortune , he was undisturbed .
Do you desire another case ?
Take that of the younger Marcus Cato , with whom Fortune dealt in a more hostile and more persistent fashion .
But he withstood her , on all occasions , and in his last moments , at the point of death , showed that a brave man can live in spite of Fortune , can die in spite of her .
His whole life was passed either in civil warfare , or under a political regime which was soon to breed civil war .
No one ever saw Cato change , no matter how often the state changed : he kept himself the same in all circumstances — in the praetorship , in defeat , under accusation , in his province , on the platform , in the army , in death .
And this is the vote which [ Cato ] casts concerning them both : “ If Caesar wins , I slay myself ; if Pompey , I go into exile . ”
What was there for a man to fear who , whether in defeat or in victory , had assigned to himself a doom which might have been assigned to him by his enemies in their utmost rage ?
So he died by his own decision .
You see that man can endure toil : Cato , on foot , led an army through African deserts .
You see that thirst can be endured : he marched over sun-baked hills , dragging the remains of a beaten army and with no train of supplies , undergoing lack of water and wearing a heavy suit of armour ; always the last to drink of the few springs which they chanced to find .
You see that honour , and dishonour too , can be despised : for they report that on the very day when Cato was defeated at the elections , he played a game of ball .
You see also that man can be free from fear of those above him in rank : for Cato attacked Caesar and Pompey simultaneously , at a time when none dared fall foul of the one without endeavouring to oblige the other .
You see that death can be scorned as well as exile : Cato inflicted exile upon himself and finally death , and war all the while .
If you set a high value on liberty , you must set a low value on everything else .

Letter CVII : On Obedience to the Universal Will [ edit ]
And we cannot change this order of things ; but what we can do is to acquire stout hearts , worthy of good men , thereby courageously enduring chance and placing ourselves in harmony with Nature .
Letter CVIII : On the Approaches to Philosophy [ edit ]
They have been spoken by Plato , spoken by Zeno , spoken by Chrysippus or by Posidonius , and by a whole host of Stoics as numerous as excellent .
I shall show you how men can prove their words to be their own : it is by doing what they have been talking about .
Letter CIX : On the Fellowship of Wise Men [ edit ]
You assured me that I should be unterrified though swords were flashing round me , though the point of the blade were grazing my throat ; you assured me that I should be at ease though fires were blazing round me , or though a sudden whirlwind should snatch up my ship and carry it over all the sea .
Now make good for me such a course of treatment that I may despise pleasure and glory .
Thereafter you shall teach me to work out complicated problems , to settle doubtful points , to see through that which is not clear ; teach me now what it is necessary for me to know !
Letter CX : On True and False Riches [ edit ]
Learn to be content with little , and cry out with courage and with greatness of soul : ‘ We have water , we have porridge ; let us compete in happiness with Jupiter himself . ’
Letter CXV : On the Superficial Blessings [ edit ]
Let words proceed as they please , provided only your soul keeps its own sure order , provided your soul is great and holds unruffled to its ideals , pleased with itself on account of the very things which displease others , a soul that makes life the test of its progress , and believes that its knowledge is in exact proportion to its freedom from desire and its freedom from fear .
Letter CXVI : On Self - Control [ edit ]
And do you know why we have not the power to attain this Stoic ideal ?
It is because we refuse to believe in our power .
Nay , of a surety , there is something else which plays a part : it is because we are in love with our vices ; we uphold them and prefer to make excuses for them rather than shake them off .
We mortals have been endowed with sufficient strength by nature , if only we use this strength , if only we concentrate our powers and rouse them all to help us or at least not to hinder us .
The reason is unwillingness , the excuse , inability .
Letter CXVI : On Real Ethics as Superior to Syllogistic Subtleties [ edit ]
Tell me what to avoid , what to seek , by what studies to strengthen my tottering mind , how I may rebuff the waves that strike me abeam and drive me from my course , by what means I may be able to cope with all my evils , and by what means I can be rid of the calamities that have plunged in upon me and those into which I myself have plunged .
Teach me how to bear the burden of sorrow without a groan on my part , and how to bear prosperity without making others groan ; also , how to avoid waiting for the ultimate and inevitable end , and to beat a retreat of my own free will , when it seems proper to me to do so .
Why then do you occupy me with the words rather than with the works of wisdom ?
Make me braver , make me calmer , make me the equal of Fortune , make me her superior .
Letter CXX : More About Virtue [ edit ]
I will tell you : that perfect man , who has attained virtue , never cursed his luck , and never received the results of chance with dejection ; he believed that he was citizen and soldier of the universe , accepting his tasks as if they were his orders .
Whatever happened , he did not spurn it , as if it were evil and borne in upon him by hazard ; he accepted it as if it were assigned to be his duty .
“ Whatever this may be , ” he says , “ it is my lot ; it is rough and it is hard , but I must work diligently at the task . ”
Letter CXXIII : On the conflict between pleasure and virtue [ edit ]
Magna pars libertatis est bene moratus venter et contumeliae patiens .
A great step towards independence is a good - humored stomach , one that is willing to endure rough treatment .

He who receives a benefit with gratitude , repays the first installment of it .

Marcet sine adversario virtus .
Valor withers without adversity .
De Providentia ( On Providence ) , 2.4
Patrium deus habet adversus bonos viros animum et illos fortiter amat et " Operibus , " inquit , " doloribus , damnis exagitentur , ut verum colligant robur . "
Languent per inertiam saginata nec labore tantum sed motu et ipso sui onere deficiunt .
Non fert ullum ictum inlaesa felicitas ; at cui assidua fuit cum incommodis suis rixa , callum per iniurias duxit nec ulli malo cedit sed etiam si cecidit de genu pugnat .
Toward good men
God has the mind of a father , he cherishes for them a manly love , and he says , " Let them be harassed by toil , by suffering , by losses , in order that they may gather true strength . "
Bodies grown fat through sloth are weak , and not only labour , but even movement and their very weight cause them to break down .
Unimpaired prosperity cannot withstand a single blow ; but he who has struggled constantly with his ills becomes hardened through suffering ; and yields to no misfortune ; nay , even if he falls , he still fights upon his knees .
De Providentia ( On Providence ) , 2.6 ; translation by John W. Basore
" Licet , " inquit , " omnia in unius dicionem concesserint , custodiantur legionibus terrae , classibus maria , Caesarianus portas miles obsideat ; Cato qua exeat habet ; una manu latam libertati viam faciet .
Ferrum istud , etiam civili bello purum et innoxium , bonas tandem ac nobiles edet operas : libertatem , quam patriae non potuit , Catoni dabit .
" Although , " said he [ Cato ] , " all the world has fallen under one man 's sway , although Caesar 's legions guard the land , his fleets the sea , and Caesar 's troops beset the city gates , yet Cato has a way of escape ; with one single hand he will open a wide path to freedom .
This sword , unstained and blameless even in civil war , shall at last do good and noble service : the freedom which it could not give to his country it shall give to Cato !
De Providentia ( On Providence ) , 2.10 ; translation by John W. Basore
Quare deus optimum quemque aut mala valetudine aut luctu aut aliis incommodis adficit ?
quia in castris quoque periculosa fortissimis imperantur : dux lectissimos mittit qui nocturnis hostes adgrediantur insidiis aut explorent iter aut praesidium loco deiciant .
Nemo eorum qui exeunt dicit ' male de me imperator mervit ' , sed ' bene iudicavit ' .
Why does God afflict the best of men with ill - health , or sorrow , or other troubles ?
Because in the army the most hazardous services are assigned to the bravest soldiers : a general sends his choicest troops to attack the enemy in a midnight ambuscade , to reconnoitre his line of march , or to drive the hostile garrisons from their strong places .
No one of these men says as he begins his march , " The general has dealt hardly with me , " but " He has judged well of me . "

The cause of anger is the belief that we are injured ; this belief , therefore , should not be lightly entertained .
We ought not to fly into a rage even when the injury appears to be open and distinct : for some false things bear the semblance of truth .

On Tranquility of the Mind [ edit ]
A letter to Serenus as translated in Tranquillity of Mind and Providence ( 1900 ) by William Bell Langsdorf
We are all chained to fortune : the chain of one is made of gold , and wide , while that of another is short and rusty .
But what difference does it make ?
The same prison surrounds all of us , and even those who have bound others are bound themselves ; unless perchance you think that a chain on the left side is lighter .
Honors bind one man , wealth another ; nobility oppresses some , humility others ; some are held in subjection by an external power , while others obey the tyrant within ; banishments keep some in one place , the priesthood others .
All life is slavery .
Therefore each one must accustom himself to his own condition and complain about it as little as possible , and lay hold of whatever good is to be found near him .
Nothing is so bitter that a calm mind cannot find comfort in it .
Small tablets , because of the writer 's skill , have often served for many purposes , and a clever arrangement has often made a very narrow piece of land habitable .
Apply reason to difficulties ; harsh circumstances can be softened , narrow limits can be widened , and burdensome things can be made to press less severely on those who bear them cleverly .
That man lives badly who does not know how to die well .
Should I be surprised that dangers which have always surrounded me should at last attack me ?
A great part of mankind , when about to sail , do not think of a storm .
I shall never be ashamed of a reporter of bad news in a good cause .
Variant translation : I shall never be ashamed of citing a bad author if the line is good .
Virtue runs no risk of becoming contemptible by being exposed to view , and it is better to be despised for simplicity than to be tormented by continual hypocrisy .
Our minds must have relaxation : rested , they will rise up better and keener .
Just as we must not force fertile fields ( for uninterrupted production will quickly exhaust them ) , so continual labor will break the power of our minds .
They will recover their strength , however , after they have had a little freedom and relaxation .
Whether we believe the Greek poet , " it is sometimes even pleasant to be mad " , or Plato , " he who is master of himself has knocked in vain at the doors of poetry " ; or Aristotle , " no great genius was without a mixture of insanity " ; the mind cannot express anything lofty and above the ordinary unless inspired .
When it despises the common and the customary , and with sacred inspiration rises higher , then at length it sings something grander than that which can come from mortal lips .
It cannot attain anything sublime and lofty so long as it is sane : it must depart from the customary , swing itself aloft , take the bit in its teeth , carry away its rider and bear him to a height whither he would have feared to ascend alone .
In Latin , nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae fuit ( There is no great genius without some touch of madness ) .
This passage by Seneca is the source most often cited in crediting Aristotle with this thought , but in Problemata xxx .
1 , Aristotle says : ' Why is it that all those who have become eminent in philosophy or politics or poetry or the arts are clearly melancholic ? '
The quote by Plato is from the Dialogue Phaedrus ( 245a ) .
Other works [ edit ]
Mors dolorum omnium exsolutio est et finis ultra quem mala nostra non exeunt , quae nos in illam tranquillitatem in qua antequam nasceremur iacuimus reponit .
Si mortuorum aliquis miseretur , et non natorum misereatur .
Mors nec bonum nec malum est ; id enim potest aut bonum aut malum esse quod aliquid est ; quod uero ipsum nihil est et omnia in nihilum redigit , nulli nos fortunae tradit .
Mala enim bonaque circa aliquam uersantur materiam : non potest id fortuna tenere quod natura dimisit , nec potest miser esse qui nullus est .
Death is a release from and an end of all pains : beyond it our sufferings cannot extend : it restores us to the peaceful rest in which we lay before we were born .
If anyone pities the dead , he ought also to pity those who have not been born .
Death is neither a good nor a bad thing , for that alone which is something can be a good or a bad thing : but that which is nothing , and reduces all things to nothing , does not hand us over to either fortune , because good and bad require some material to work upon .
Fortune cannot take ahold of that which Nature has let go , nor can a man be unhappy if he is nothing .
From Ad Marciam De Consolatione ( Of Consolation , To Marcia ) , cap .
XIX , line 5 In L. Anneus Seneca : Minor Dialogues ( 1889 ) , translated by Aubrey Stewart , George Bell and Sons ( London ) , p. 190 .
What need is there to weep over parts of life ?
The whole of it calls for tears .

Nihil perpetuum , pauca diuturna sunt ; aliud alio modo fragile est , rerum exitus variantur , ceterum quicquid coepit et desinit .
Nothing lasts forever , few things even last for long : all are susceptible of decay in one way or another ; moreover all that begins also ends .

It would be some consolation for the feebleness of ourselves and our works , if all things should perish as slowly as they come into being ; but as it is , increases are of sluggish growth , but the way to ruin is rapid .

Religion is regarded by the common people as true , by the wise as false , and by rulers as useful .
As quoted in What Great Men Think About Religion ( 1945 ) by Ira D. Cardiff , p. 342 .
No original source for this has been found in the works of Seneca , or published translations .
It is likely that the quote originates with Edward Gibbon who wrote :
The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true ; by the philosopher as equally false ; and by the magistrate as equally useful .
— Edward Gibbon , The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , Vol. I , Ch. II Elbert Hubbard would claim in 1904 ( Little Journeys :
To the homes of great philosophers : Seneca ) that Gibbon was " making a free translation from Seneca " .
Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity .
Has been attributed to Seneca since the 1990s ( eg. Gregory K. Ericksen , ( 1999 ) , Women entrepreneurs only : 12 women entrepreneurs tell the stories of their success , page ix . ) .
Other books ascribe the saying to either Darrell K. Royal ( former American football player , born 1924 ) or Elmer G. Letterman ( Insurance salesman and writer , 1897 - 1982 ) .
However , it is unlikely either man originated the saying .
A version that reads " He is lucky who realizes that luck is the point where preparation meets opportunity " can be found ( unattributed ) in the 1912 The Youth 's Companion : Volume 86 .
The quote might be a distortion of the following passage by Seneca ( who makes no mention of " luck " and is in fact quoting his friend Demetrius the Cynic ) : " The best wrestler , " he would say , " is not he who has learned thoroughly all the tricks and twists of the art , which are seldom met with in actual wrestling , but he who has well and carefully trained himself in one or two of them , and watches keenly for an opportunity of practising them . " — Seneca , On Benefits , vii .

Quotes about Seneca [ edit ]
[ Seneca ] would have denounced the opinion to which most philosophers , tacitly or otherwise , have come round in the last half - century , that it is no part of the business of philosophy to turn people into better persons , as tantamount to desertion or lèse - majesté .
Robin Campbell , introduction to Seneca 's Letters
.
[ Seneca ’s ] tremendous faith in philosophy … was grounded on a belief that her end was the practical one of curing souls , of bringing peace and order to the feverish minds of men pursuing the wrong aims in life .
Robin Campbell , introduction to Seneca 's Letters
He is refreshingly undogmatic , incomplete , and at times even senile .
We cannot rightly accuse him of all the moralizing and dogmatism which spoiled the objective accuracy of medieval Science before Roger Bacon .
Nor can we blame him for assuming that imprisoned air is the main agency in earthquakes , or for not knowing that the rainbow 's colors are the result of decomposition of white light instead of a seeming color which does not really exist , or for believing that lightning melts metals and freezes wine , or that the sun is supported by exhalations from the earth .
In his assumption , however , that comets may have orbits which carry them beyond the zodiac , that there is an evolutionary process in the world , and that rings round the sun are often the result of atmospheric conditions , he is sound .
But after all , how accurate were the astronomers before Galileo , the physicists before Newton , or the biologists before Darwin ?
Seneca 's guesses are as good as those of any other speculator before the discoveries of modern Science .
Richard Mott Gummere , Seneca the Philosopher , and His Modern Message ( 1922 )
Seneca 's virtue shows forth so live and vigorous in his writings , and the defense is so clear there against some of these imputations , as that of his wealth and excessive spending , that I would not believe any testimony to the contrary .

Quelnor Profile Joined May 2010 Canada 8 Posts # 1 ZvP - Mass Hydra - Doom drop - Speedling harass - Expansionist build ( fast expo )
I just lost earlier today against a fast expo mass hydra build as a toss and seeing NonY loosing to the same kind of build is really leaving me clueless .
Early game
I guess you can put pressure with chronos boosted zealot on 2 gates but that 's not a game winning move and it delays your own tech + expansion .
Making it even more worthless if you do n't succeed at taking out your opponent 's expansion considering yours have been delayed because of all that mineral spent on zealots .
At the moment your opponent really gets his expansion , you 'll see 1 or 2 spine crawlers up and speedlings kicking in .
Denying you the opportunity to attack him except if you go in an all in attack 4 or 5 warpgate push ... and yet NonY tried that and failed .
Mid game
you should have your expansion by then and even earlier then that but still , later then your opponents ' .
The zerg have its hydras making it suicidal to push for a T1 protoss force except if you succeed at throwing down exceptionally nice force fields but even then ... hydra 's range upgrade render that useless as they can still shoot , it just exposes 'em a tad more to zealots .
You now have to choose carefully your next tech ... immortals ?
Not the best choice ...
Collosus ?
Common choice but costly and you have to reach critical mass before putting 'em to real good use + termal lance .
By then a normal zerg player will know that and have mutas or corrupters .
Templars ?
I remember a game i do n't know which players it was but the toss held at 2 base against a map wide zerg just with pure storm awesomeness against hydras ultras broodlords etc ... it is the best build in my opinion .
But here 's my point : you gotta try to expand out of your natural ... and here 's the huuuge problem as we 've seen from NonY : speedlings can just harass you , forcing you to cover your expansion while hydras can doom drop your base all day long , doing hit and run with minimal losses .
You COULD get air of course ... but to really be effective against the zerg 's mass hydra go gotta invest all the resources you can gather into hard countering that tactic which leaves you almost no window for other techs .
Plus ... the fact that you 're on the defensive means the zerg is just expanding and out macroing you .
Any ideas ?
What am I missing ?

High templar with storm demolish the 80 hp hydralisks and are not as exposed to air as collossi , you also have forcefield to get them to stay inside the storms , archon help alot with their + damage to bio , dark templars do alot of damage and are invisible .
Without roaches , zerg doesnt have any unit that functions as a tank against storm , thus high templar suddenly becomes this super viable unit that nobody thought about , as for the doom drop , well its not like zerg couldnt do that beforehand .

Honestly , i think upgraded speedlots rip through ling and hydra pretty effectively when upgraded properly .
if you had the right mix between zealots and sentries to control your opponents army , it would be very effective IMO .

Those games were awesome , can't wait for them to be up on youtube so I can take better notes on that mass hydra build
It always seems like a race is imba when a good player gets wrecked by a better player .
I think Nony tried some really great strats but just did n't have the proper execution against Idra .
When he let all those zerglings slip into his base ( 1st game ) , and could n't do anything about it cuz all the front door pressure , that was just really great play by Idra .
I do n't think there was anything Nony could have done .
Game 2 was very close it seemed , but Idra 's macro prevailed .
And Idra 's doom drops in game 3 really shook Nony 's concentration .
What I 'm trying to say is that Idra , being the pro gamer he is , created his own advantage and rode those advantages to victories .
This does not mean that Zerg is imba and Protoss are useless .
If Nony could have created his own advantages instead of letting Idra macro just a little bit too much , it would have been a different series .

Nony , this might go better in the other thread but what do you think was the biggest reason you made those mistakes ?
Were you not prepared sufficiently for the matches and Idra 's strategies , or was it just a sort of " shit happens " moment ?

Nothing more , nothing less .
The main problem with the Scrap Station game is deciding to use the Force Fields on the ramp to hold back Hydras rather than using Force Fields as a way to efficiently kill Hydras .
Also , trying to kill the Lair rather than focusing on killing his army efficiently was a bad decision .
The build I was doing needs to focus on killing his fighting units efficiently .
Both of those decisions go counter to that .
Once he has enough Hydras together , they are too strong .
The build strikes just before that and needs to kill Hydras as they come out .
The Kulas game had plenty of poor micro decisions from me as well .
The build I did was n't the best either .
My placement at my natural was n't the best .
I also tried to build a support bay and it did n't build so that was late .

Once he has enough Hydras together , they are too strong .
The build strikes just before that and needs to kill Hydras as they come out .
The Kulas game had plenty of poor micro decisions from me as well .
The build I did was n't the best either .
My placement at my natural was n't the best .
I also tried to build a support bay and it did n't build so that was late .

Nony , this might go better in the other thread but what do you think was the biggest reason you made those mistakes ?
Were you not prepared sufficiently for the matches and Idra 's strategies , or was it just a sort of " shit happens " moment ?
IdrA is much better than any Zerg I played so he put up more resistance than I was used to .
I also just made many more careless mistakes than I usually do .
Whether this is from not enough practice , not enough practice against challenging opponents , not enough familiarity with SC2 yet , or just general fatigue , I do n't know .

One thing 's for sure :
You can't just outmacro a zerg like Idra .
Idra won the last game so decisively because Nony was n't able to apply any real pressure at all .
The first 2 games were more even because Nony kept Idra 's economy better under control .
Basically you have 3 options against Zerg : cheese , all in , keeping his economy down .
If you have a good reason to disagree with the above , please tell me .
Thank you .

I see .
That does explain quite a bit , as I see you dominating Zergs on your stream without much sweat and that probably makes it a lot easier to not correct small - but significant - mistakes .
I guess Idra really is on another level compared to the Zergs we have around here .
But it 's good to know that you feel confident about your builds as I really enjoy your style of play .
Good luck against TLO .

Had that gap in the wall been protected the entire game could had looked vastly different .

Scientists have raised urgent new concerns over the latest efforts to mitigate the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the oil rig explosion on BP 's Deepwater Horizon .
Latest efforts to limit the environmental damage involve an untried deep - water technique , using a toxic dispersant that they believe may damage ocean life .
But the new method has so far only succeeded in ratcheting up the growing controversy surrounding the spill .
On Friday , Barack Obama appeared to be losing his patience with oil company executives and officials who have been trading blame since the rig exploded .
" I will not tolerate more finger - pointing or irresponsibility , " he said in the White House rose garden , flanked by members of his cabinet .
" The system failed , and it failed badly .
And for that , there is enough responsibility to go around .
And all parties should be willing to accept it . "
Approval by the US Environment Protection Agency ( EPA ) for the pumping of tens of thousands of litres of the chemical Corexit 9500 deep on to the seabed early yesterday comes despite warnings from Louisiana state health officials , scientists and fishermen that the technique is untested and potentially hazardous to marine life and the wider ecosystem .
Louisiana officials claim BP and the EPA ignored their concerns about how the chemicals may harm the sea floor .
This round of attempts to both stop the spill and deal with the oil being spewed out follow the failure to capture the leak by the lowering of a 100 - tonne metal box over the damaged seabed wellhead .
In the coming days BP will attempt a " junk shot " .
This involves pumping the damaged blow - out preventer lying on the ocean floor – which failed during the explosion that killed 11 workers – with golf balls and other material to clog it up before closing it with heavy mud .
But it is the use of the chemical dispersant in such depths that has become the increasing focus of concern .
Until now , Corexit 9500 has been approved for surface use only .
Chemical dispersants break oil into small globules , allowing it to disperse more quickly into the water or air before currents can wash it ashore .
Corexit 9500 has been identified as a " moderate " human health hazard that can cause eye , skin or respiratory irritation with prolonged exposure .
Its makers also warn that it has the tendency to " bioconcentrate " in the environment .
Louisiana health and hospitals secretary Alan Levine said federal regulators have been too quick to dismiss worries about the chemicals : " Our concerns about the use of these dispersants underwater is based on the fact that there is virtually no science that supports the use of those chemicals .
We 're trading off what we know is going to be environmental damage on the surface for environmental damage of a level we do n't know that is going to be under the surface . "
Carys Mitchelmore , an environmental chemist at the University of Maryland Centre for Environmental Science and a co-author of a 2005 US National Academies report on dispersants , told Nature : " No one will tell you using dispersants wo n't have an effect .
You 're trading one species for another .
The long - term effects are really unknown .
The dispersant has inherent toxicity .
And these oil droplets tend to be the same size as food particles for filter - feeding organisms . "
" Dispersants … are toxic to marine life , so there are trade - offs to consider , " David Pettit of the Natural Resources Defence Council told the Washington Post last week .
" And just because humans can't see oil on the surface does n't mean it 's not still in the water column , affecting marine life from plankton to whales . "
Another toxiciology expert , Dr William Sawyer , who has made a presentation to the US lawyers representing environmental and other interests after the spill has added to the concern :
" The dispersants used in the BP clean - up efforts , known as Corexit 9500 and Corexit EC9527A , are also known as deodorized kerosene , " he told the group .
" With respect to marine toxicity and potential human health risks , studies of kerosene exposures strongly indicate potential health risks to volunteers , workers , sea turtles , dolphins , breathing reptiles and all species which need to surface for air exchanges , as well as birds and all other mammals .
Additionally , I have considered marine species which surface for atmospheric inhalation such as sea turtles , dolphins and other species which are especially vulnerable to aspiration toxicity of Corexit 9500 into the lung while surfacing . "
Meanwhile , concern was mounting that substantial slicks of oil might be on the point of reaching Louisiana 's fragile marshlands .
TV footage late on Friday from a helicopter flight over Louisiana 's barrier islands showed miles of slick being washed by waves through wide passes between islands directly toward the wetlands of Terrebonne Parish .

Our old friend , the disgraced and disgraceful ACORN " Pimp " Hoax con-man Andrew Breitbart , is up to the same old tricks , according to AP .
But this time they do n't seem to be going as well for him .
In a deceptive effort to prove that Tea Baggers did not yell racial epithets at Democratic lawmakers during demonstrations against health insurance reform last month , Breitbart posted " VIDEO PROOF " from a different moment during those protests , the news service has found .
We 're shocked he'd try to pull off such a scam .
Even more shocked CNN has n't hired him as a contract player yet .
Could the media finally be catching on to Breitbart 's scams now that he 's been caught lying time and again ?
Now , as to the use of the phrase , " ACORN workers counseling actors posing as a pimp and prostitute , " in the article by AP 's Jesse Washington ... um , really ?
Still ?
Even the New York Times has backed off of that one .
Has n't the AP bothered to read the CA Attorney General 's report , much less any of our own coverage , on that point ?
Glad to see AP holding Breitbart accountable for his bullshit , finally , but it 's time for them to knock off their own lazy coverage , and start issuing corrections and apologies for their own months of misreporting on the ACORN " Pimp " Hoax .
AP 's email address for corrections is : Info@AP.org .
We 've already sent such a request ourselves , but have n't heard back .
Perhaps it will help , as it did at the New York Times , if they hear from a lot of readers .
Learning new skills the natural way ( Image : NaturalMotion )
Video : Walking monsters
Monsters and aliens that move more realistically than ever before are coming soon to a screen near you .
Thanks to “ artificial evolution ” , computer - generated humans in a number of recent Hollywood epics and video games have been able to interact with each other and their environments in a more life - like way .
Advertisement
Now NaturalMotion , whose animation technique was used in the films Troy and Poseidon , has shown its method can equally be applied to non-human body shapes – for instance , bipedal monsters ( see video , above ) .
“ A monster might have a completely different overall body mass distribution , ” or different limb proportions to a human , says Torsten Reil , the firm ’s CEO .
“ It ’s equivalent to me waking up in a child ’s body and being able to balance and look natural straightaway . ”
State - of - the - art animation for non-human film characters usually involves filming real actors wearing fluorescent motion capture sensors from several angles .
Still art work of , say a monster , is mapped onto the footage and made to move using the movement of these sensors at key points such as elbows and knees as a guide .
Computer games use this technique but realism is limited because a number of set sequences must be applied in a virtually limitless range of situations .
NaturalMotion , whose origins are in the zoology department at the University of Oxford , UK , took a radically different approach .
Virtual skeletons
Reil and colleagues began with 100 identical virtual skeletons , complete with muscles controlled by a simulated network of a few hundred motor nerves .
They then attributed random values to the strength of connections between key nerves involved in movement in each skeleton and made each perform a task – for instance , walking .
The five that managed to walk furthest without falling were labelled the “ most fit ” and used to spawn the next generation .
These were each copied 20 times to create another population of 100 , and in each individual , a subset of the connections between nerves were altered to mimic the natural variation that might be found in the next generation of a biological species .
The new population then repeats the walking task , with the best performers going on to create the next generation .
Over several generations , a skeleton with all the grace of a shambolic drunkard will ultimately give rise to a nimble walker .
On the fly
“ We ’ve used concepts from biology and physics to unshackle games , ” says Reil .
By “ evolving ” algorithms that can animate characters entirely on the fly rather than relying on a handful of pre-recorded sequences , he says game worlds will become more realistic .
Since 2001 , the animated humans NaturalMotion produces have evolved to perform a range of tasks such as balancing , walking , and interacting with their environment – for instance , by anticipating a collision and bracing themselves in readiness .
Those skills are put to use in the firm ’s American football Backbreaker computer game , due for release in June .
The company ’s latest discovery is an evolutionary shortcut of sorts – a behaviour “ evolved ” to fit a given skeleton can be applied to radically different body shapes .
“ We can add additional joints – we might give a leg two knees , ” adds Reil .
“ And recently I ’ve been looking at how a three - legged stool walks and balances .
It looks odd , and makes you realise why biology does n’t go for three legs . ”
NaturalMotion ’s approach could help to animate alien bodies in computer games , but Reil says it ’s also possible the approach could have an impact for biological research – for instance , by animating in a range of extinct animals .
Home » Health , North America , Politics , Social » Russia Reports Over 2 Million Dead In US As Mysterious Die-Off Accelerates
A most chilling report circulating in the Kremlin today prepared by the Russian Academy of Medical and Technical Science for Prime Minister Putin states that a “ mysterious die - off ” in the United States has claimed over 2,000,000 lives since 2008 and is “ more than likely ” linked to a “ crossover ” plant disease linked to genetically modified grains and foods .
According to these reports this mysterious , and as yet unidentified , lung disease responsible for this mass die - off began during the spring of 2008 in the US agricultural State of Iowa where ( very ironically ) at least 36 people attending a Lung Association event at the Governors mansion were stricken .
Important to note about Iowa is that it is one of the largest corn producing regions in the World harvesting over 2 billon bushels of this valuable grain farmed on nearly 32 million acres of its farmland , over 99 % of which are genetically modified varieties made by the US agricultural giant Monsanto and idententifeid by their trade names of Mon 863 , insecticide - producing Mon 810 , and Roundup® herbicide - absorbing NK 603 .
Not reported to the American people about these genetically modified corn varieties made by Monsanto was the study released by the International Journal of Biological Sciences warning that they were linked to organ damage .
Monsanto quickly responded to this study , stating that the research was “ based on faulty analytical methods and reasoning and do not call into question the safety findings for these products . ”
Russian scientists in these reports , however , call Monsanto ’s claim of their genetically modified Mon 863 corn as being safe for human or animal consumption “ totally without validation ” , a finding supported by the French biomolecular engineering commission , the Commission du Génie Biomoléculaire ( CGB ) who stated in their report , “ with the present data it cannot be concluded that GM corn MON 863 is a safe product . ”
Further supporting the findings of Russian scientists was Greenpeace International , who in their report titled “ MON 863 : A chronicle of systematic deception ” warned that the campaign to unearth and evaluate data about this most dangerous of genetically modified grains demonstrates , beyond all doubt , that MON863 is unfit for consumption .
Most unfortunately for the American people though , all of these warnings have been ignored by their government masters who have allowed the mass planting of these genetically modified crops to such an extent that in the United States today fully 80 % of their corn and 93 % of their soybeans are of these dangerous varieties and leading one Russian scientist in these reports to warn that our World is now on the verge of experiencing an ecological disaster of “ Biblical proportions ” .
And according to these reports this ecological disaster is well underway in the United States and supported by American death statistics showing that of the nearly 2.5 million deaths reported by them each year the number of “ sudden deaths ” has increased to 40 % equaling out to over 2 million “ mysterious and unexplained ” deaths from early 2008 to March , 2010 .
Now of these “ mysterious and unexplained ” American deaths , these reports continue , nearly all of them are lung related and being erroneously documented as being caused by influenza and pneumonia type diseases so as not to panic these peoples , but have , instead , been caused by as an yet unidentified plant virus that has successfully jumped the species barrier to human beings .
Supporting Russian scientists in these conclusions is new research being conducted by the Didier Raoult of the University of the Mediterranean in Marseilles , France , where for the first time in human history a plant virus has been found to cause problems in people .
Russian scientists further claim in these reports that the United States mass vaccination of their population this past year for the supposed H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic was instead a “ very clumsy attempt ” to stop the spreading of this mysterious lung disease by injecting into these peoples a DNA “ fix ” to this genetically modified corn , and which by all the evidence available , they state , appears to have failed .
For those wondering how the United States government could ever allow such a monstrous outrage to be committed on their citizens one only need know that over the past 10 years Monsanto has paid over $ 500 million in bribing those American officials responsible for food safety while at the same time has joined US corporate giants General Electric and Exxon Mobil in not paying any taxes despite the billions in profits they have reaped .
And for those Americans believing that President Obama will protect them from these outrages they could n’t be more mistaken , and as we can read as reported by the Huffington Post News Service in their article titled “ You ’re Appointing Who ?
Please Obama , Say It ’s Not So ! ” and which , in part , says :
“ The person who may be responsible for more food - related illness and death than anyone in history has just been made the US food safety czar .
This is no joke .
Here ’s the back story .
When FDA scientists were asked to weigh in on what was to become the most radical and potentially dangerous change in our food supply — the introduction of genetically modified ( GM ) foods — secret documents now reveal that the experts were very concerned .
Memo after memo described toxins , new diseases , nutritional deficiencies , and hard - to - detect allergens .
They were adamant that the technology carried “ serious health hazards , ” and required careful , long - term research , including human studies , before any genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) could be safely released into the food supply .
But the biotech industry had rigged the game so that neither science nor scientists would stand in their way .
They had placed their own man in charge of FDA policy and he was n’t going to be swayed by feeble arguments related to food safety .
No , he was going to do what corporations had done for decades to get past these types of pesky concerns .
He was going to lie . ”
Even worse for these American people are those believing they will be able to change their government in the upcoming National elections to be held in the United States this coming November , but which new reports are showing that Obama is also preparing for with a special military unit called the “ Consequence Management Response Force ” said ready to deploy during these elections at his command from his White House fortress the Washington Post writes has now become more like “ Soviet - era Moscow ” then the house of the people it used to be should these Americans begin to rise up against the growing corporate - run police state surrounding them .
New reports from America are also warning that Obama ’s growing police state government is further moving against its own citizens by ordering their Internet giants to turn over all emails written by every citizen in their country , an insidious move Yahoo , for one , has vowed to fight .
To the final outcome of all of these events it is not in our knowing , other than to note that in the same week that one of Obama ’s Federal Courts has outlawed all Americans from celebrating their National Prayer Day , and Obama has vowed to rid the United States of all of its nuclear weapons , President Putin , on the other hand , stated that Russia ’s internal and external security depends upon two things – “ its traditional religions and its nuclear forces ” … and leaving no doubt whatsoever that our World has , indeed , turned upside down as the US descends into tyranny and Russia moves toward freedom .
Even the CDC admits over 2 million dead in the US

I bought an e-reader for travel and was eager to begin “ Under the Dome , ” the new Stephen King novel .
Unfortunately , the electronic version was not yet available .
The publisher apparently withheld it to encourage people to buy the more expensive hardcover .
So I did , all 1,074 pages , more than three and a half pounds .
Then I found a pirated version online , downloaded it to my e-reader and took it on my trip .
I generally disapprove of illegal downloads , but was n’t this O.K.?
C.D. , BRIGHTWATERS , N.Y .
An illegal download is — to use an ugly word — illegal .
But in this case , it is not unethical .
Author and publisher are entitled to be paid for their work , and by purchasing the hardcover , you did so .
Your subsequent downloading is akin to buying a CD , then copying it to your iPod .
Buying a book or a piece of music should be regarded as a license to enjoy it on any platform .
Sadly , the anachronistic conventions of bookselling and copyright law lag the technology .
Thus you ’ve violated the publishing company ’s legal right to control the distribution of its intellectual property , but you ’ve done no harm or so little as to meet my threshold of acceptability .
Unsurprisingly , many in the book business take a harder line .
My friend Jamie Raab , the publisher of Grand Central Publishing and an executive vice president of the Hachette Book Group , says : “ Anyone who downloads a pirated e- book has , in effect , stolen the intellectual property of an author and publisher .
To condone this is to condone theft . ”

They are billed as “ healthcare professionals who spend years building expertise in their fields ” .
Using materials firmly grounded in science , they educate their peers in the risks and benefits of drugs .
This is how Pfizer , the pharmaceuticals giant , describes the experts it hires to lead educational forums in which doctors are lectured on the use of its products .
Yet New Scientist has found that some of Pfizer ’s experts have been disciplined for deficiencies in patient care , while others have been reprimanded for how they conducted drug research trials .

The findings add to a growing controversy surrounding the pharmaceutical industry ’s efforts to market drugs by influencing patterns of prescribing .
Unknown influence
Doctors paid to educate peers are a particular worry , argues Sidney Wolfe of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen in Washington DC .
“ They are doing things that may be influencing your doctor and you have no way of knowing about it , ” he says .
“ It ’s made worse by the fact that some of them have been disciplined . ”
Many drug companies sponsor educational events for doctors .
They range from informal evenings with a slide presentation to workshops at multiple venues dedicated to the use of a particular drug .
The talks may include research results , advice on identifying patients suitable for treatment and guidance on doses that should be prescribed .
New Scientist matched doctors licensed to practice in the four most populous US states – California , Texas , New York and Florida – against Pfizer ’s records of payments to doctors and medical researchers in the second half of 2009 .
These were published on 31 March as a condition of Pfizer ’s record $ 2.3 - billion settlement with the US government over charges of illegal drug marketing .
Warning signs
Our search revealed 26 doctors paid to lecture on the company ’s drugs whose records include disciplinary actions related to problems with patient care or drug prescribing .
We also cross-referenced Pfizer ’s expert lecturers against US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) records and found another four who have received warning letters over problems with how they conducted drug research .
The censured doctors we found are a small minority of the doctors paid by Pfizer to speak at educational forums – within the four largest states , about 1 in 50 of Pfizer ’s experts had disciplinary records for problems with patient care or drug prescribing .
However , campaigners for patients ’ rights say that the number could be close to zero if drug companies screened experts using medical - license verification websites provided by most US states .
Only a small proportion of doctors are disciplined by state medical boards for problems involving patient care .
Thought - leaders
Elizabeth Woeckner , president of Citizens for Responsible Care and Research , based in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , believes doctors with disciplinary records should not be educating their peers .
“ If it ’s Pfizer ’s position that these are respected thought - leaders , they should have clean records , ” she says .
Some of the 26 doctors were under probation from their state medical boards as they lectured about the company ’s products .
They include Joseph Altieri , a psychiatrist in Vero Beach , Florida , who was paid $ 1000 to speak about the anti-psychotic drug Geodon .
In 2008 , Altieri was fined $ 30,000 and ordered to take courses in prescribing controlled drugs and medical ethics , for problems that included prescribing methadone to a patient who had admitted using another narcotic bought on the street .
Psychiatrist Mark Kosins of San Clemente , California , was paid $ 2500 to lecture on Geodon while on probation .
His disciplinary action concerned a patient who was taken into intensive care after Kosins prescribed a combination of drugs that the medical board said “ significantly increased ” the chance of an adverse drug reaction .
Other Pfizer experts ran into trouble during their research .
Among them is Thomas Gazda of Scottsdale , Arizona , who was paid to lecture about Geodon after being reprimanded by the FDA over irregularities in his conduct of a trial of the same drug ’s use in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder – one of whom was given more than the maximum allowable dose for five days .
The FDA had earlier told Pfizer to exclude Gazda ’s data from the results submitted by Pfizer during its efforts to win approval to use the drug for this purpose .
Doctors ’ defence
These three Pfizer speakers deny that their records make them unsuitable to educate other doctors .
“ One learns from mistakes , ” says Gazda , who adds that he has extensive clinical experience outside of research trials .
Altieri and Kosins both argue that their disciplinary actions have no bearing on their lectures for Pfizer , because they concerned the prescription of drugs other than Geodon .
Pfizer is not alone in hiring doctors who have been disciplined over problems with patient care .
Other drug companies have released doctor - payment records , but mostly in formats that are hard to search systematically against other records .
Of the 26 we found speaking on Pfizer ’s behalf , four were also paid to speak for GlaxoSmithKline in 2009 .
Return on investment
The influence of pharmaceutical industry educational events is unclear , says Joel Lexchin of York University in Toronto , Canada , who studies doctors ’ prescribing habits .
“ But given the amount of money spent on this , it ’s clear that they must be getting a return on their investment . ”
Pfizer ’s records indicate that the company paid more than $ 9.6 million to its lecturers in the US in the second half of 2009 .
Pfizer says that it already excludes those who are debarred from US government healthcare schemes .
“ We are continually refining our review process to ensure we are selecting the most appropriate healthcare providers to partner with to educate the medical community , ” says company spokeswoman Kristen Neese .

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) -
An oil well on the ocean floor beneath a drilling rig that exploded and sank into the Gulf of Mexico began spewing oil on Saturday , the U.S. Coast Guard said .
The well , 5,000 feet beneath the ocean surface , was leaking about 1,000 barrels per day of oil , a Coast Guard spokeswoman said , in what the agency called a “ very serious spill . ”
Remote underwater vehicles detected oil leaking from the riser and drill pipe , the spokeswoman said .
“ We are classifying this as a very serious spill and we are using all our resources to help contain it , ” Coast Guard Petty Officer Connie Terrell said .
Transocean Ltd’s Deepwater Horizon sank on Thursday after burning since Tuesday following an explosion while finishing a well for BP Plc 42 miles off the Louisiana coast .
The Coast Guard on Friday suspended a search for 11 missing workers from the rig , who are presumed dead .
BP has deployed an armada of ships and aircraft to contain the oil slick , which could threaten Louisiana ’s fragile coastline if it is not contained .
Cleanup operations are currently on hold due to stormy seas , Terrell said .
So far , the spill is not comparable with the Exxon Valdez disaster , which spilled about 11 million gallons ( 50 million liters ) of oil into the Prince William Sound in Alaska when it ran aground in 1989 .
The Transocean well is spewing about 42,000 gallons ( 190,900 liters ) of oil a day into the ocean , the Coast Guard estimates .
The explosion came almost three weeks after President Barack Obama unveiled plans for a limited expansion of U.S. offshore oil and gas drilling .
The explosion did not affect U.S. oil markets .
The blast occurred about 10 p.m. CDT on Tuesday ( 0300 GMT Wednesday ) as the rig was capping a discovery well pending production , company officials said .
Some 115 of the 126 workers on board at the time of the explosion were rescued .
It was the worst oil rig disaster since 2001 , when a rig operated by Petrobras off the Brazilian coast exploded and killed 11 workers .
The Piper Alpha rig in the North Sea off Scotland exploded in 1988 , killing 167 .
More than 24 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute YouTube has accused media conglomerate Viacom of secretly uploading content to the video - sharing site whilst publicly complaining about its presence .
YouTube said it deliberately " roughed up " any uploaded videos to make them look stolen or leaked .
The accusation was made as a court prepares to rule in a $ 1bn suit brought by Viacom against Youtube for " massive intentional copyright infringement " .
Viacom said it had identified 150,000 such infringements on the site .
" YouTube was intentionally built on infringement and there are countless internal YouTube communications demonstrating that YouTube 's founders and its employees intended to profit from that infringement , " Viacom said in a statement .
" By their own admission , the site contained ' truckloads ' of infringing content . "
But Zahavah Levine , YouTube 's chief counsel , accused Viacom of covert operations to add copyright infringing content .
" For years , Viacom continuously and secretly uploaded its content to YouTube , even while publicly complaining about its presence there , " she wrote in a blog post .
Looking at the quotes , claims and counter - claims , it really reads like the stuff of soaps .

Read Maggie 's blog in full " It hired no fewer than 18 different marketing agencies to upload its content to the site .
It deliberately ' roughed up ' the videos to make them look stolen or leaked .
" It opened YouTube accounts using phony email addresses .
It even sent employees to Kinko's to upload clips from computers that could n't be traced to Viacom . "
' Evil ' Viacom 's 2007 lawsuit centres around a claim that YouTube consistently allowed unauthorised copies of popular TV shows and movies to be posted to its website and viewed tens of thousands of times .
The company said it had identified more thousands of abuses including clips from shows such as South Park , SpongeBob SquarePants and MTV Unplugged .
YouTube has always argued that it is covered by law through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , which states that publishers are not responsible for material posted by users .
YouTube boasts the biggest video sharing audience in the world Companies are required by law to remove unauthorised clips from sites when they have been notified by the owner .
YouTube has insisted it has followed that rule and a month before the lawsuit , it took down more than 100,000 clips at Viacom 's request .
But Viacom claims that YouTube founders flouted copyright and deliberately encouraged it in favour of increasing traffic to the site .
Documents revealed in court quoted a message sent on 19 June 2005 from YouTube co-founder Steve Chen to fellow co-founders Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim .
" Jawed ( Karim ) , please stop putting stolen videos on the site .
We 're going to have a tough time defending the fact that we 're not liable for the copyrighted material on the site because we did n't put it up when one of the co-founders is blatantly stealing content from other sites and trying to get everyone to see it , " said the e-mail .
Another e-mail from Mr Chen to staff in the early days of the start - up 's life said the company " should concentrate all our efforts in building up our numbers as aggressively as we can through whatever tactics , however evil " .
The documents also reveal that Viacom considered buying YouTube just months before it launched the suit .
Executives from Viacom thought it would be a " transformative acquisition " .
They were eventually beaten by Google , which bought the site for $ 1.65 bn .
' Prize fight '
Journalists and bloggers covering the story have said the whole affair smacks of a something you would see on TV .
" This looks like a reality show but the audience does n't get a vote , " Peter Kafka , senior editor of the news and technology blog AllThingsD.com told BBC News .
" The only person both sides have to win over is the judge .
This is court filing of a three year - old case and the industry has moved on and realised this stuff is hard to monetise . "
Eric Goldman , director of the High Tech Institute of Santa Clara University , told the San Jose Mercury News , that there will be no real winners in this legal battle .
" It 's like a prize fight - they are both scoring points ; they are both beating each other up .
But instead of making money from the fight , they are paying to be in it .
That 's really dumb " US District Judge Louis Stanton has given both parties until 30 April to file opposing arguments to each other 's motions .
All the arguments are expected to be completed by June .

The 7th round of ACTA [ed : The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , a secret and punishing Internet treaty under negotiation in Guadalajara ] negotiations will conclude around lunch time today in Mexico .
If past meetings are any indication , a few hours later the participating countries will issue a bland statement thanking the host Mexican government , discussing the progress on civil enforcement , border measures , and the Internet as well as noting the transparency discussions and the continued desire to address the issue .
The release will then conclude by looking forward to the next meeting in Wellington , New Zealand in April .
As this five part series demonstrates , however , there are ongoing concerns with both the process and substance of ACTA .
From a process perspective , the negotiations remain far more secretive than other international agreements .
From a substantive viewpoint , ACTA could result in dramatic reforms in many participating countries .
Countering the momentum behind ACTA will require many to speak out .
This admittedly feels like a daunting task given the powerful interests that are committed to seeing ACTA through .
That said , many have begun to speak out .
This last post starts with links to a sampling of the politicians and groups that have already made ACTA one of their issues and then identifies the other avenues to allow every individual concerned with ACTA to speak out .
Sizing :

Most costumes will fit an average size adult guinea pig , but measure your guinea pig first to be sure it will be a proper fit .
If the guinea pig is too young / small , they will walk out of the costumes .

Internal Solid State Drives ( SSDs ) , are quickly becoming a dominant standard in PC storage .
If you want faster storage inside your PC , laptop , or even gaming console , then an internal SSD may be exactly what you 're looking for .
Internal Solid State Drives Accelerate Every Workload
Hard Disk Drives , or HDDs , are the traditional storage solution .
HDDs manage data by storing it on disks inside their enclosures .
SSDs are different and manage data via electrical impulses .
There are no moving parts inside of a solid state drive , and that is where it gets the name " solid state " from .
This lack of moving parts manifests benefits in favor of solid state drives , such as being
Smaller in size
Less prone to failure from physical shock
Faster , since disk RPM is no longer a limiting factor
SATA SSDs Offer The Best Compatibility And Value
SATA SSDs are what most people think about when someone says SSD .
These drives use the same SATA standard and connector used by traditional HDDs and come in the 2.5 - inch form factor like those HDDs .
Desktop HDDs also come in 3.5 - inch enclosures , and generally have more storage and speed than their 2.5 - inch HDD counterparts .
They still are not as fast as any SSD , though .
If you want to upgrade your desktop PC , laptop , or gaming console with an SSD , chances are a 2.5 - inch SATA SSD will do the job for you .
SATA SSDs also offer the best value in price - per - gigabyte of any other form of SSD technology .
M.2 SSDs Provide The Smallest Form Factor
M.2 SSDs come in a unique form factor .
They are wafer thin and about the length of your thumb .
This is a newer standard compared to SATA and may not be present in PCs manufactured prior to 2016 .
Be sure to double - check compatibility with your system before opting for an M.2 SSD .
M.2 SSDs are also unique in the sense that they can plug into the same slots but operate at vastly different speeds .
Some M.2 SSDs use SATA bandwidth and are therefore limited to the speed of a SATA SSD .
These M.2 SATA SSDs will usually fall in line with the value proposition of their 2.5 - Inch counterparts , which makes them ideal for those who want the same value in a smaller package .
Other M.2 SSDS , meanwhile , use PCI Express bandwidth , which makes them NVMe SSDs .
PCIe and NVMe SSDs Accelerate To The Fastest Possible Speeds
To achieve the fastest possible speeds , SSDs need to be able to access PCI Express bandwidth .
You can do this in two ways :
A traditional PCI Express expansion card containing the SSD itself An M.2 NVMe SSD
NVMe SSDs look just like other M.2 SSDs but use PCI Express bandwidth .
Make sure that both the M.2 slot and the SSD itself supports NVMe speeds before buying if you want this feature .
These high - speed SSDs are most ideal for professional workloads , and wo n't show as huge gains for lighter consumer workloads .
Intel Optane Accelerates The Rest Of Your System - Even Mechanical HDDs
You can use Intel Optane SSDs as either superfast SSDs in their own right , or memory that accelerates the speed of other storage in the system .
Testing is nearly complete on the last Corsair SSD that came my way , but this morning UPS dropped off another surprise : the Corsair Force SSD .
Based on a derivative of the controller in the OCZ Vertex LE I reviewed earlier this year , the Force uses the mainstream version of SandForce 's technology .
Here 's how it breaks down .
Last year 's Vertex 2
Pro used a SF - 1500 controller , the Vertex LE uses something in between a SF - 1500 and SF - 1200 ( closer to the SF - 1500 in performance ) while the Corsair Force uses a SF - 1200 .
The SF - 1200 has all of the goodness of the SF - 1500 , just without some of the more enterprise -y features .
I have n't been able to get a straight answer from anyone as to exactly what you give up by going to the SF - 1200 but you do gain a much more affordable price .
The Vertex LE is only low in price because it is using a limited run of early controllers from SF , presumably so SandForce can raise capital .
The SF - 1200 based SSDs should be price competitive with current Indilinx offerings .
You 'll notice that like the Vertex LE there 's no supercap on the Force 's PCB .
There 's also no external DRAM cache thanks to a large amount of on - die cache and SandForce 's real time data compression / deduplication technology .
As you may remember from my Vertex 2 Pro and Vertex LE reviews , SandForce achieves higher performance by simply reducing the amount of data it has to write to NAND ( similar to lossless compression or data deduplication ) .
I 've got the Force on my SSD testbench now and I should have the first results by the end of the day today .
This one is exciting as it could give us a preview of what the performance mainstream SSD marketplace will look like for the rest of 2010 .

We 're shipping a quick update to clean up some of the confusion around the 119th Update badges .
We initially chose to calculate which badge to give players based on the beta release of TF2 , because that was the date that customers could first play TF2 .
This turns out to have been a mistake , largely because many players did the math and thought they were getting something other than what they ended up with .
So to remove that confusion , this new update moves that date forward to the official retail release of TF2 , the 10th October 2007 , and reissues updated badges to anyone who would be affected by that date shift .
We also felt it was still important to reward those who were there on the first moment TF2 went live , and helped us by beta testing prior to release .
So we 've added a new " Primeval Warrior " badge , which will replace the badge of anyone who purchased TF2 prior to the official release date .
On a quick side note , we 've been having fun watching QuickActionTF2's movies , which inspired Community Fortress 's Moments of Glory .
If you have n't seen the latest one , it 's worth it just for knoxxx 's awesome move .

An experimental demonstration of a quantum calculation has shown that a single molecule can perform operations thousands of times faster than any conventional computer .
In a paper published in the May 3 issue of Physical Review Letters , researchers in Japan describe a proof - of - principle calculation they performed with an iodine molecule .
The calculation involved that computation of a discrete Fourier transform , a common algorithm that 's particularly handy for analyzing certain types of signals .
Although the calculation was extraordinary swift , the methods for handling and manipulating the iodine molecule are complex and challenging .
In addition , it 's not entirely clear how such computational components would have to be connected to make something resembling a conventional PC .
Nevertheless , in a Viewpoint in the current edition of APS Physics , Ian Walmsley ( University of Oxford ) points out that the demonstration of such an astonishingly high - speed calculation shows that there is a great deal to be gained if physicists can overcome the difficulties in putting single - molecule computation to practical use .

A study by auto club AAA finds small sedans , like the Ford Focus , are more in demand and holding their value longer .

Hit the Road with USA TODAY 's auto writers to discover and discuss trends on wheels with them and with other readers , like you .

It 's official : Your driving costs are going up .
The average cost of owning and operating a sedan in the USA rose 4.8 % this year to 56.6 cents per mile , or $ 8,487 per year , a study out today by auto club AAA finds .
Rising gas prices are primarily responsible for the increased costs and also are lowering the resale or trade - in value of cars that do n't get good gas mileage , says John Nielsen , director of AAA 's approved auto repair and auto buying network .
The 2010 edition of AAA 's annual " Your Driving Costs " study found that small sedans are the most sought - after vehicles .
" That 's where the market is moving , " Nielsen says .
" It looks like this year people are very much preferring smaller cars . "
Small sedans — including the Chevrolet Cobalt , Ford Focus , Honda Civic , Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla — were the only category of vehicles that held their value longer than in the 2009 study .
When this year 's survey was compiled in December , the national average cost of regular unleaded gasoline was $ 2.60 per gallon , 12.7 % higher than last year .
On Wednesday , the national average was $ 2.84 .
The auto club analyzes ownership costs , including insurance , license and registration fees , taxes , depreciation and finance charges , and operational costs , including fuel , maintenance and tires .
It did not factor in the vehicle purchase price .
SUVs — including the Chevrolet TrailBlazer , Ford Explorer , Jeep Grand Cherokee , Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota 4 Runner — had the greatest yearly loss on resale or trade - in value .
Depreciation rose 10.7 % , to $ 5,003 a year , based on driving 15,000 miles annually .
Large sedans , including Buick Lucerne , Chrysler 300 , Ford Taurus , Nissan Maxima and Toyota Avalon , had a depreciation jump of 6.1 % to $ 4,828 annually .
" So many people think of the purchase price of a vehicle as the greatest factor to consider , " Nielsen says .
" But your biggest costs are depreciation , fuel , things like tires , insurance repair and maintenance . "
AAA found the average cost of full - coverage insurance on sedans rose 5.7 % over last year .
It based the average on a full - coverage policy for a married , 47 - year - old male with a good driving record , living in a small city and commuting 3 to 10 miles daily .
CARS : News , views from our Drive On community
The policy includes $ 100,000 maximum coverage for a single injury or death and $ 300,000 maximum coverage for any incident , with a $ 500 deductible for collision and a $ 100 deductible for comprehensive coverage .
Tire costs went up 8.7 % .
That analysis is based on the price of one set of replacement tires the same as the originals and includes mounting , balancing and sales tax .

Superspy in the sky could soon be patrolling over British cities to search for hidden terror cells
A Top -secret US unmanned drone used to locate Al Qaeda and Taliban hideouts in Pakistan and Afghanistan could soon be patrolling over British cities to search for hidden terror cells .
The controversial move would allow MI5 and GCHQ , the Government 's eavesdropping centre , to step up surveillance operations over the UK .
Until now , the £ 23 million Global Hawk aircraft has not been available for foreign sale .
However , US policy has been quietly changed and Britain is now negotiating to buy the drones .
America is keen to supply them for British patrols after a string of terror plots threatening the US and its citizens .
Terror Watch : The £ 23 million Global Hawk unmanned drone
These include the attempt in 2006 to detonate liquid bombs on aircraft flying to American cities from the UK .
It is not known how many drones the UK wants from manufacturer Northrop Grumman , but earlier this year a senior Ministry of Defence procurement official visited the Pentagon to begin negotiations .
Britain would not need to use the drones in Afghanistan and Pakistan because the US already provides full air coverage in the region .
Instead , it is believed they will be used mainly for domestic surveillance .
The drones are also being deployed by the US Navy in the Caribbean and off the Florida coast to combat drug smuggling .
In Britain , MI5 and GCHQ already use three planes based at RAF Northolt in North - West London to spy on citizens .
The three Britten - Norman Islander aircraft are all fitted with sophisticated surveillance equipment .
They have been used to track down terror cells and to locate former Afghan veterans who may have returned to Britain to plot terror attacks .
The aircraft are able to identify suspects using ' voice - prints ' of insurgents with British accents that were picked up by spy planes monitoring Taliban radio signals in Afghanistan .
One stumbling block is that permission from the Civil Aviation Authority would be needed to fly the drones in already congested UK airspace .
Although the CAA gave the MoD permission to fly another drone over parts of Wales earlier this month , it is understood to be against regular flights because of safety fears .
However , the Global Hawk recently became the first drone to be certified by the American Federal Aviation Authority for use in civilian air corridors with no advance notice .
The drone can stay airborne for 30 hours without refuelling .
Last night , MoD sources said the Global Hawk was being looked at for possible military use but any decision to buy the drone would depend on funding .
INDIANAPOLIS --
As Evan Turner clutched The Associated Press player of the year trophy and posed for yet another photo , he could n't escape a little ribbing .
" That going to fit at home ? " Ohio State teammate David Lighty said Friday as Turner walked past with the award .
" This is going to be a window ornament , " Turner shot back as both laughed .
It 's got to be a good feeling to receive almost every player of the year honor and have a couple of teammates make a 2 ½ - hour drive to see you get the latest one as part of the Final Four festivities .
" They have been there for me my whole career , and they are here now , " Turner said .
" They really are family , and this shows it . "
Turner , a 6 - foot - 7 junior swingman who averaged 20.3 points , 9.2 rebounds and 5.9 assists , received 54 votes from the 65 - member national media panel .
Kentucky freshman John Wall was second with nine votes .
Lighty and Dallas Lauderdale never hesitated about making the 175 - mile drive from Columbus , Ohio , to see the presentation .
" He told us he was getting this , and we said we 'd come , " said Lauderdale , who quickly added neither he nor Lighty missed class to be there .
There were n't many people who thought Turner would win national honors after he broke two bones in his back when he fell after a dunk on Dec. 5 .
He missed six games -- which the Buckeyes split -- then he returned to lead them to the Big Ten title and a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament .
" I was going to be as cautious as I possibly could to make sure he was 100 percent when he came back , " Ohio State coach Thad Matta said .
" He would sit and watch practice , dribbling the ball around his chair , between his legs .
He was diligent in his work ethic and did a great job . "
Turner said awards were the last thing on his mind during those weeks when he was forced to watch his teammates get ready for the conference season .
" I just wanted to get back to my team and be the same player I was , " said Turner , who has n't yet decided whether he will return for his senior season .
" I started understanding more that life throws you curveballs , and sometimes it builds a better person in how you deal with that . "
And his teammates rewarded him by taking the trophy back to campus in the trunk of their car .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
While Kat was writing the post Virtual Reality Video Games : Population Control we got to talking , and as of right now I have some serious unanswered questions about VR and gaming .
Lets just start out with the most open question :
If Dragon Age : Origins was virtual realty would that mean that video game developers would actually have had to create … well …
Alistair penis ?
Video Game design and development meetings certainly would take a whole different turn would n’t they ?
“ What should Leliana ’s nipple to boob ratio be ? ”
“ We need to pick a design for Morrigan ’s hair . ”
“ We did that last Thursday . ” “ No her other hair . ”
For the sake of realism all the motion capture work would have to take it to the next step .
Ca n’t you just picture it now : Man covered in full body motion capture suit .
Little white ball on the tip ‘o the tallywhacker .
Would the actors dispute the size of their motion capture ?
Would someone actually have to decide what Leliana ’s crotch smells like ?
I ’m going to go out on a limb here and assume they are n’t going to decide cinnamon and Day Lilies .
Who has to determine that ?
Nerds everywhere ( myself included ) would LOVE to be a video game tester , but not if video games go virtual .
“ Oh man , someone needs to crank down the funk on body odor for Niko .
He ’s going to make people vomit . ”
Would this make in game showering mandatory for in game interactions ?
For every smell level you increase your charisma drops one .
That would be an absolute pain in the ass .
Imagine Fable III taking the touch mechanic one step farther into the smell mechanic .
If you come home smelling like the town whore your wife bitch slaps you with a wooden spoon .
“ Why do I smell stale beer and canned fart ? ”
“ That ’s just Oghren . ”
Would you be allowed to turn smells off ?
That might be nice .
I really do n’t want to know what a sloth demon smells like .
Desire demon maybe .
Sloth demon no .
Would playing a simple game like Mario be huge stress release ?
You ’re running around , punching bricks , jumping angrily on things .
I bet getting shot out of a cannon is a rush .
I wonder where the raccoon tail attaches to my body .
Also I wonder how I wag it to fly .
Do I have to actually EAT the mushrooms to grow bigger ?
I do n’t like mushrooms , can we change it to gummy bears ?
Can I just touch the mushroom ?
For Kat , VR means population control and getting to “ experience ” Alistair .
For me , it means I have to smell the dwarf .
When I wrote Practical Common Lisp , in order to provide a semi-standard environment for people to play with Common Lisp I created Lispbox , a customized version of Matthew Danish and Mikel Evins ’s Lisp in a Box .
Like Lisp in a Box , Lispbox combined Emacs , SLIME , and a Common Lisp implementation into a single , easily installable hunk of bits .
At the time , my goal was just to make a single version that could be installed on GNU / Linux , OS X , and Windows that would contain the libraries needed to run the example code from PCL in a predictable environment .
( For instance , Lispbox removes implementation - specific packages from the CL - USER package use list so that the behavior of different Lispboxen would be more consistent . )
At the time I had dreams of continuing to work on Lispbox and make it something more than just a bike - with - training - wheels for new Lispers .
At the very least I hoped to be able to continue to build and distribute new versions of it as Lisp implementations were updated , etc .
As it turns out , I ’ve completely failed to do either of those things .
Somewhere along the line , I registered the lispbox.com domain but never did anything with it .
My registration is going to expire in about a week and since I ’m pretty obviously not going to be doing anything with Lispbox myself , I ’m not going to renew it .
But I would be happy to let someone take over the project .
All the code needed to build Lispboxen is available as a Google code project .
And people other than me have in fact succeeded in building working Lispboxen from it .
If you are interested in doing something with Lispbox , please email me .
I ’ll be happy to set you up as a contributor on the Google code project and to answer questions about how things work .
And if anyone wants to really take it over , I ’d be more than willing to officially pass the baton .

WARSAW , Poland — European anxiety over the presence of Muslims in traditionally Christian societies has arrived in Poland , where the capital has been blanketed in anti-Islamic posters and several hundred protesters recently showed up to denounce the construction of a mosque .
Demonstrators waved signs proclaiming “ Stop Islamization , ” galvanized by posters put up around Warsaw showing a woman clad in a black chador , with menacing minarets that looked like missiles peering out behind her .
Counter - demonstrators , separated by a line of police , denounced them as “ fascists ” and “ racists . ”
What makes the demonstration surprising is that unlike western European countries where there are millions of Muslims , Poland , a country of 38 million , has only about 30,000 Muslims .
But at a time when Switzerland has voted to ban the construction of new mosques , when France and Belgium are considering restrictions on women covering their faces in public , and Italy ’s nationalist Northern League wants to keep mosques at least a kilometer away from any churches , Islam as a political issue has arrived in Poland .
“ We wanted to start a public debate , ” Piotr Slusarczyk , one of the demonstrators ' leaders , told the Rzeczpospolita daily .
“ We are warning against radical Islam in Europe . ”
Samir Ismail , a Kuwaiti Palestinian doctor who has lived more than 20 years in Poland and is the leader of the newly formed Muslim League , said that for the capital 's 10,000 Muslims , the mosque would simply be a place to pray .
He pointed out that the community has been careful not to offend , opting for a 16 - yard high minaret instead of the 25 - yard one approved by the building permit .
“ We do n’t want to create misunderstandings , ” he told the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper .
“ We are aware that we have a problem with being accepted . ”
The friction around Poland ’s still tiny Muslim minority is a sign of the country ’s growing normalization and integration into the European Union .
Immigrants were almost unknown in communist times , but as Poland becomes wealthier , it is starting to attract outsiders , from Ukrainians working on construction or as domestic help , to Muslim Chechens escaping Russian repression in their homeland .
In one sense , Poland ’s growing diversity is a return to the past .
Before World War II , Poland was a multinational stew , with ethnic Poles making up only about two - thirds of the population .
The country had large numbers of Ukrainians , Jews and Germans , as well as a small Muslim minority — Tatars descended from the hordes of Genghis Khan who had terrorized Europe in the Middle Ages .
Several thousand Tatars had settled in Poland and Lithuania in the 14th century , and , despite losing their language , never lost their religion .
World War II left Poland a very different country .
The Jews had been mostly murdered by the Germans , and most of the survivors left after the war .
Germans were expelled , and by shifting Poland ’s borders hundreds of miles to the west , there were no large Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities .
After 1945 , Poland was almost completely monoethnic — one of the only minorities left were the Tatars , who have two villages in northeastern Poland , each with a small mosque .
New Muslim migrants , like Samir Ismail , have very little in common with the Tatars , who have been well integrated into Polish life for centuries — they even had their own cavalry unit before the war .
Ismail and other Muslims formed their own organization in 2003 , designed to advocate for the interests of new immigrants , including the need to build themselves a place to worship .
From that time they have been trying to build a mosque in Warsaw with the help of Saudi sponsors .
As the project has neared completion , it has begun to arouse the ire of some Polish nationalists , who fear that their country could soon have the same issues with Muslim minorities as countries in western Europe .
“ We have the example of other countries where the idea of freedom of religion is abused , ” said Slusarczyk .
But Poland ’s laws do not allow for any religious discrimination .
“ The decision permitting this investment has been taken long ago , ” said Tomasz Andryszczyk , a spokesman for the Warsaw city government .
“ What are we supposed to do ?
It would be bad if this project ran into any troubles . ”
THE number of Australian parents refusing to vaccinate their children against preventable diseases has more than doubled in the past decade .
Figures obtained by The Sunday Telegraph reveal 26,000 children are excluded from the national immunisation program because their parents have registered as " conscientious objectors " .
This compares with 12,050 children in 2000 .
Are you against vaccinating your children ?
Join our blog to tell us why .
Experts say there are likely to be at least 52,000 unvaccinated children , as many parents do not record their intentions with the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register .
Parents who register as conscientious objectors can still receive child care benefits and maternity allowances , which are normally conditional on up - to - date immunisation , but their children may be excluded from school or child care during outbreaks of disease .
Doctors across the country were ordered last week to stop giving the controversial flu vaccine to under - fives , following a spate of adverse reactions marked by high fever and seizures .
Public - health experts maintain that children who are denied routine jabs , which do not include flu , are putting themselves and others at risk .
" If your child is n't immunised , they remain at risk of diseases that have pretty much gone away for everyone else , " National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance director Professor Peter McIntyre said .
" They 're protected by other people being vaccinated but , if a disease does emerge , they 're the ones who are going to get it .
" There 's the individual risk to the child , but there 's also the risk to other kids , such as those with immune deficiency and other problems . "
Registry data shows 83 per cent of five - year - olds in NSW were fully immunised as of March 31 - slightly less than the national average .
Meryl Dorey , of the action group Australian Vaccination Network , said many parents did not realise they could get government benefits if their children were not vaccinated .
Conscientious objectors can retain benefits if they sign a one - page form saying they have a " personal , philosophical , religious or medical " objection to childhood vaccination .
A doctor 's signature is required to confirm the benefits and risks of immunisation have been explained .
Unvaccinated children were 15 to 20 times as likely to get Haemophilus influenza type b ( Hib ) meningitis , which can result in brain damage or death , compared with those who were vaccinated , Professor McIntyre said .
The official conscientious - objector figures were only part of the picture because just as many parents did not bother to register , he said .
s , he said .
" We 've always found there would be just as many , if not more , parents who did n't do n't bother to register because their children did n't go to childcare or they did n't need the benefits , " Prof McIntyre said .
Medicare said figures from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register showed 26,000 or 1.3 per cent of children were registered as conscientious objectors by March 31 , 2010 .
Regional clusters of low childhood vaccination rates have been identified in NSW 's north coast , upper Blue Mountains , eastern suburbs and Mosman .
Solving the California state budget crisis just got that much tougher .
Estimated tax revenues came in nearly $ 3 billion less than expected wiping out a steady stream of months where things seemed to be improving at least on the revenue front .
And this should come as no surprise .
California has done very little to wean itself off its dependence on real estate .
So it should come as no shock that with real estate still in the doldrums , that income is reluctant to pick up .
California takes in nearly half of its revenues through payroll taxes and with a 12.6 unemployment rate , a revenue short fall is mathematically expected .
Since California is so dependent on real estate , I wanted to track trends in construction employment and housing prices for three large metro areas .
We ’ll look at Los Angeles , San Diego , and San Francisco over 23 years .
Let us first measure the fluctuations in real estate and construction employment :
Source : Case - Shiller
From the above it is apparent that California has been here before with a previous real estate bubble back in the late 1980s .
You ’ll notice that as prices ebbed lower , construction employment contracted severely at that time .
In the 1990s , construction employment fell by 29 percent before reaching a bottom .
In our current bubble , construction employment has now fallen by 40 percent and it is unclear whether this is the actual bottom .
The recession is still in full force in California demonstrated by the weaker than expected tax revenues .
You ’ll also notice in the chart above that prices remained stagnant for almost a decade in all three of the California metro areas we are measuring .
How long will prices stay low this time ?
The chart above shows that prices have ticked up slightly .
But much of this is due to artificial stimulus through the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury .
Tax credits have also front loaded sales and have pulled future sales forward .
Even more recent micro data is showing that local housing markets are now starting to soften now that the federal tax credit has ended .
At the peak of our current housing bubble , California had 948,000 people working in the construction industry versus 648,000 back in 1990 .
Construction employment increased from peak to peak by 46 percent while the actual population increased by 20 percent over this same timeframe .
If there were true demand on the ground for new additional housing units , builders would be requesting building permits in mass .
That is not the case :
In fact , the current amount of requested building permits is at an all time record low .
Even the previous bust did not take permits to this level .
Why is this still so low ?
Because approximately 40 percent of all California home sales are foreclosure re-sales .
In other words , people are going after existing homes .
The demand for more expensive brand new homes is not strong enough to warrant builders to get out there and begin hiring more construction workers to build additional housing .
The public still is looking for more affordable options in terms of buying California housing .
This also makes it unlikely that construction will play a role in hiring large numbers of unemployed Californians .
Even with building permits , it is interesting to see that permits remained low well into the late 1990s .
So a housing bust will usher in at least 5 to 7 years near the trough in terms of prices , permits , and construction employment .
Employment has n’t picked up .
Permits are still near the bottom .
Prices slightly ticked up but as we have mentioned , much of this has to do with artificial measures that wo n’t be around in the market for a very long time .
“ If the price peak was in 2007 and we track the previous more modest bust , we can expect a trough near 2012 or 2014 but again this is n’t your ordinary housing boom and bust as we all know . ”
With all this data , many are assuming that the bottom has been reached in the state simply because prices ticked up slightly .
This is n’t all that clear by looking at the above .
Vacancy rates for rentals are still high and prices have actually fallen in many markets .
Given the current employment situation , many are choosing to rent simply because of their employment status .
With competitive rents , buying a home may not make financial sense for many .
The average budget for many just does n’t cut a mortgage payment in a still volatile market .
That is the question many are asking in California .
In some areas , homes are selling for $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 that once sold for $ 500,000 or more .
In these , areas it may make financial sense to buy .
But in more lucrative parts of Los Angeles , San Diego , and San Francisco prices are still elevated at levels that speak to bubble pricing .
Building permits and construction employment are really one in the same .
If anything , these will be the first spots to look for a recovery in housing .
But do n’t feel that once it changes , you ’ll need to jump in .
In a bust this big , most Californians will have a 5 to 7 year window if history is any guide to buy a home without worrying about prices getting away from them .
I think many have learned that lesson the hard way .

Home Owners Fighting to Keep Park Land as Private Backyards
Two families along the 1200 block of Federal Avenue East , on Capitol Hill , have lawyered up and are refusing to relinquish 2,813.3 square feet of Volunteer Park property that they 're functionally using as fenced back yards .
According to a records request filed by The Stranger with the city , last July , the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department became aware of 13 residences encroaching on public space — including a hot tub pavilion and zip line into the park — and on January 15 of this year , residents were informed they had 30 days to vacate park land .
The public records request shows that the home owners removed the zip line and dismantled the hot - tub pavilion .
But two families — Ralph and Lesley Althouse , and Charles and Kristen Wilk — have refused to comply , records indicate , still using park of the park as private yard space .
Records show that the Althouses argued to the parks department that giving back park land poses a security threat to their family , because an addition they made to their home in 1995 ( made with all the required city permits ) puts their house within 0.2 feet of the actual property line .
Their house sits on a 10,000 square foot lot , and their encroachment — their back yard , essentially — takes up 1,941 square feet of public land .
When they purchased their home ( also in 1995 ) , they were told that a chain link fence — a fence that still stands today — marked the boundary between their property and the park .
" In some cases , we wait until the property is sold before we insist on moving the property line back , " says parks spokeswoman Dewey Potter .
" But we 're talking about thousands of square feet , here .
That 's pretty significant . "
The lawyer for both families , Glenn Amster , argued on the phone today that the city has recognized the chain link fence as a boundary for fifty years , so it 's partly at fault .
" My clients used architects , engineers , consultants , they submitted plans to the city showing the fence to the city , and they were given permits , " Amster says .
But Bryan Stevens , spokesman for the Department of Planning Development , says , " The city does n’t require a survey for all development proposals , " and the city does n't have resources to investigate the property lines of every construction project .
" The idea is to keep the cost low for a simple , single family proposal .
However , that means the onus is on the property owner that any information they give the city , that information is accurate . "
Amster could n't explain why , when the Althouses met with design experts to build an addition to their house , no one thought of surveying the property boundary .
He says that both families are in negotiations with the parks department to resolve the issue , but could n't specify what an amenable resolution would be .
I have calls in to both families to see what they propose .
Meanwhile , the parks department has a temporary solution : pay to rent the land .
( Parks needs the money ! )
A Revocable Use Permit , available for $ 150 ( and good for up to three years ) would give the families plenty of time to figure out how to give back the public land they are currently enjoying as private yard space .
The permit would charge each family a fee based on the estimated value of the land ( $ 152.74 a square foot ) and its area .
For the Alhouses , it would be an estimated $ 29,646.83 fee , annually .
For the Wilks , this would equal roughly $ 13,323.51 in permit fees annually .
Their homes are appraised for $ 2,108,000 and $ 1,549,000 , respectively .
The bottom line , says Potter , is that " we can't give away park property .
Public sentiment is that park land is sacrosanct .
We can't continue to let them use it for their own private purposes . "

Standing Cat has become quite the internet phenomenon in recent days .
French internet culture journalist Aude Baron has been digging into the story behind this little guy , and writes ,
The cat 's name is Rocky .
He is 2 years old and his owners are French ( Daisy and Yann ) .
Rocky used to stand up because he could n't see the birds through the windows , and wanted to , so he stood up .
Why does he raise his leg in the middle of the video ?
Probably because there was a bird outside , according to Daisy , or maybe a dog wandering around .
Rocky hates dogs .
He does n't stand up too often any more because Daisy and Yann moved their stuff , so now Rocky can see everything without having to go bipedal .
He 's also able to sit on his bottom like a human ( this cat is crazy ) .
Basically , that 's it :-)

Doctor
Who with the children .
This is an emotionally charged time for the divorced father .
When people started tossing around phrases along the lines of " Russell T Davies has brought back family Saturday evening TV viewing " , I wonder if they appreciated the importance of what they were saying .
Like Davies - who 's almost exactly my age ( albeit with rather more achievements ) - I grew up with Doctor Who , and can remember Patrick Troughton as the Time Lord ( 1966-69 ) .
I went a bit meh about the show after Tom Baker dropped out , although I respected Peter Davidson 's cricket jumper , but by then I had other things on my mind : few girls were going to be impressed by boys who watched it .
But when I had children , I became interested in what they might like , so when Davies brought the show back I was delighted that my then nine - year - old daughter , on seeing the first teasing posters with Christopher Ecclestone and the Tardis , said they thrilled her without her exactly knowing why .
It was then that I began to suspect that what Doctor Who is about is not so much time and space travel , as modes of alternative fatherhood .
My own father , who on paper is the last person you 'd expect to like this kind of thing , was as devoted to Doctor Who as my little brother and I ( we also watched Star Trek together , and my mother , although American , would roll her eyes when the cast staggered around the set in the pretence that the Enterprise was under grave threat ) .
These roots go deep , as Davies must have intuited ( his timing in resurrecting the show could have been tailor - made for me and my children ) , and it helps immeasurably that by pure coincidence , honest , when Ecclestone was the Doctor , I too had short hair and a leather jacket ; after Tennant took over I was shoved into Converses - by the Lacanian ( not a Doctor Who fan , as far as I ever got to know ) ; and I flatter myself that my demeanour with the children has always been eccentric , other - worldly and know - all , to the point that there was a time when the younger children seriously entertained the idea that I could be , or play , a Time Lord myself .
I baulked at disillusioning them from the notion .
So we watched it religiously together , and I still recall the painful dissonance between the Doctor 's supreme forgiveness of the Master at the end of the 2007 season with my wife 's unforgiving rejection of me .
As separation encouraged juvenile battles between parents to establish which was the coolest , I was delighted to find myself , post - split , in situations where I could nab the autographs of Steven Moffat , John Simm ( the Master ) and Russell T ( not Tennant - the daughter got his after being taken to see his Hamlet ) , all addressed , by name , and with a little extra personalised note to the children ( " I AM your mummy ! " wrote Moffat - a reference for Whovians there ) .
In the case of Simm , I broke the Groucho 's golden rule of not badgering celebs for their John Hancocks , but I was drunk and desperate enough not to care , and he was an absolute sweetie about it .
And now a new Doctor .
I wonder whether he 's too young ; that is , too young for my children to mistake him for me .
They know I possess bow ties , but it has been an age since it was witty to wear one .
I think they found them in the pornography drawer .
( I recall cycling down a street in Shepherd 's Bush a few years
ago in a suit , and some urchins - there is no other word - yelling : " Fackin ell ! It 's Docteroo ! "
I 've rarely felt so chuffed . )
Do not tell me I am the only man my age who has thought this , who has felt this intimate link with the past and the future , appropriate given the show 's promise of temporal possibility .
Sometimes I wonder how different things would have been , how much less culturally connected
I would be with my children , had this show not regenerated .
I should n't have just thanked Davies for his autograph - I should have given him a big ,
fat kiss on the lips .
New York ( CNN ) -- A New York imam who pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents as they investigated an alleged terror plot was sentenced Thursday to time served and ordered to leave the United States within 90 days .
A plea agreement had recommended a sentence of up to six months in prison for Ahmad Wais Afzali .
" I take full responsibility for my actions , " Afzali told a federal judge during the sentencing hearing .
" Honest to God , it was never my intention to help those idiots for what they do in the name of Islam " he added , an apparent reference to a phone call to Najibullah Zazi that federal authorities said blew the cover on their investigation of the terror plot .
Afzali elaborated on that comment after his sentencing in front of gathered press .
Afzali said of Zazi , " Not only does he give himself a hardship and his family ; also in a certain degree he 's making it hard for every other Muslim that lives in America . "
This week , new details emerged indicating that Zazi and two suspects planned to attack trains at New York City 's Times Square and Grand Central stations , according to a law enforcement source .
Afzali was originally charged in a four - count indictment but pleaded guilty to the one charge .
He was accused of lying about whether he tipped off suspect Zazi that the FBI had been asking questions about his activities .
Zazi subsequently pleaded guilty to conspiring to detonate explosives in the United States .
Afzali , a Muslim cleric and funeral director from the New York borough of Queens , was one of the first people charged in the investigation .
During a plea hearing in March , Afzali told the court that police had asked him to help provide information about Zazi and two other suspects , Adis Medujanian and Zarein Ahmedzay .
He said he knew Zazi and Medujanian fairly well from when the men were teenagers and would attend his mosque for prayers and to play volleyball .
" The police interest in these men led me to believe that they were involved in some criminal activity , but I had no idea of its seriousness , " Afzali said after his March plea hearing , at times choking up during his statement .
He said he called Zazi on September 11 , 2009 , a day after he was contacted by authorities .
" I told him that our phone call was being monitored .
I told Zazi , ' Do n't get involved in Afghanistan garbage and Iraq garbage , that 's my advice to you . ' "
" On September 13 ... I was interrogated by FBI agents for the first time .
I believed that the FBI was angry at me for calling Zazi , " he added .
" When I was asked whether I had told Zazi about law enforcement being interested in him , I lied and said I did not .
My intention was not to protect Zazi , but to protect myself . "
He admitted to repeating the lie during another interview with prosecutors a few days later , saying , " In doing so , I failed to live up to my obligation to this country , my community , my family and my religion .
I am truly sorry . "
The Afghanistan - born Afzali walked out of the courthouse Thursday wearing an electronic monitor , a stipulation of the plea deal .
" The sad part is that I have to say goodbye to the only country that I know .
My kids are born here and my family lives here , it 's going to be a tough transition , " he said .
Asked where he was planning to go , Afzali said , " I would love to go to Canada , the closest country to America ... but it all depends on the country and its regulations . "
Before entering his plea , the 38 - year - old imam placed a scarf on the floor outside the courtroom and prayed .
He later told reporters that he " just signed his death sentence " by accepting the plea deal , saying he did n't want to leave the United States .
The two other suspects in the case , Ahmedzay and Medunjanin , pleaded not guilty in February to new charges of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against persons or property in the United States , as well as several other counts .
The two had previously faced lesser charges .
Prosecutors say the men -- 25 - year - old U.S. citizens and residents of Queens -- conspired with Zazi " to attack the New York subway system in mid-September 2009 . "
A fourth suspect in the case is in custody in Pakistan , according to a law enforcement source .
CNN 's Susan Candiotti and Miguel Susana contributed to this report .

Now , Quirk has released the final artwork .
Check out the cover art here at right ( click for larger , full view ) .
This new scifi / zombie tale , which was written by Kevin David Anderson and Sam Stall , is “ Galaxy Quest and Dawn of the Dead as hordes of undead attempt to feast upon the attendees of a Star Trek convention , but a group of Trekkies fight them off using what they learned from old Star Trek episodes .
Our Trek uniform - wearing cover model , a zombie with a sports sack , is wearing a pin that says “ No Kill I ” and holding the detached arm of his victim who obviously will not live long and prosper .
Also , it looks like these ill - fated Trekkies are attending an event called Wrath of CON .
Night of the Living Trekkies is available now for pre-order right now .
This sci - fi / zombie / comedy / adventure follows a group of rag-tag Trekkies getting together for the fifth annual GulfCon ( billed as the â€œlargest Starfleet Convention in the western Gulf Coast regionâ€ ) .
Our heroes are dressed in homemade uniforms and armed with prop phasers - but soon find themselves defending their hotel and convention center against hordes of flesh - eating undead .
Suddenly , all of their useless knowledge about particle physics and old Star Trek episodes has genuine real - world applications !
And while hotel employees and regular civilians are dying left and right , our Trekkies summon strength and courage by emulating their favorite starship - voyaging characters .
Packed with hundreds of gags referencing Star Trek , Star Wars , comic books , and fan conventions , Night of the Living Trekkies reads like the strange lovechild of Galaxy Quest and Dawn of the Dead .
Journey to the final frontier of zombie science - fiction satire !
KEVIN DAVID ANDERSON and SAM STALL are lifelong Trekkies .

The Mono team is proud to bring you a preview of C# 5.0 a few years before our friends in Building 41 do .
A snapshot of the code is available in the demo - repl.zip file .
This contains the csharp.exe C# REPL shell and the Mono .
CSharp.dll compiler - as - a- service assembly .
With Today 's code drop all those scenarios now work :
Run Mono's C# compiler on .NET
Embed Mono's Evaluator in your C# app .
Use Mono's REPL with the .NET framework runtime .
Update April 28th : I have now uploaded a new version that fixes the bug that people were getting when importing other libraries .
Thanks to Marek for the rapid fix .
Background
Although we have had a compiler - as - a - service framework since September of 2008 it has been so far limited to Mono users , which effectively means only Linux and OSX users could use our C# REPL and the compiler as a service .
The reason is that the Mono's C# compiler uses System .
Reflection .
Emit as its code generation backend .
This API was fine for implementing C# 1.0 but required a few changes to support compiling its own core library ( mscorlib , the equivalent of libc in C or rt in Java ) .
When we started to work on our C# 2.0 support , we were working on our compiler as the language was being standardized at ECMA .
Our compiler evolved faster than the underlying support for Reflection and Reflection .
Emit did and this lead to more Mono- specific extensions being added to our Reflection and Reflection .
Emit code .
The more extensions that we depended on , the fewer chances we had of running with Microsoft 's runtime .
As time went by , Microsoft did improve their System .
Reflection .
Emit , but at that point , it was too late for us to go back to it .
This had the unfortunate side effects that our compiler could not run on the Microsoft runtime .
Now , this per se is not a major problem since Windows users likely use Microsoft 's CSC compiler .
But this also meant that our awesome compiler as a service could not be used by .NET developers and it also meant that our REPL shell could not be used with .NET and most importantly , neither one would run on Silverlight .
Our compiler also relied heavily on our extended System .
Reflection and System .
Type as its own type system .
And we could not just change our APIs for Microsoft 's APIs to run on the Microsoft runtime .
Today 's commit at the coref replaces our dependency on System .
Type and introduced our own Mono .
CSharp .
TypeSpec which lifts many of the restrictions that we had on System .
Type .
All of the hard computations that we had to do for inflating generics types are done here now and we can query the types without the backward Reflection limitations .
With today 's changes , not only we became more portable , but the move from System .
Type to TypeSpec and MemberCache improved the compiler performance by 30 % and fixes dozens of bugs that were very hard to fix with the previous compiler architecture .
REPL Love
We have a small guide on using the C# REPL on Linux .
Caveat : both the Microsoft and the Mono C# compilers loads libraries from their " base directory " , never from the Global Assembly Cache .
In Mono , the csharp command happens to be in the same directory as the rest of Mono , so loading implicit libraries just works ( Loading System .
Core for example ) .
But when running our csharp command on Windows , unless you put the binary in the same location as csc.exe the REPL wont be able to load libraries using their short names .
This is particularly obnoxious because to use LINQ you need to use the full assembly name , or copy csharp.exe to the directory that contains System .
Core so you can just do :
csharp > using System .

Future work
Public API : There is still some work left to do : we need to turn 99 % of the public API in that assembly into a private API , the only class you should care about is the Mono .
CSharp .
Evaluator class , the rest you should consider internal .
The Evaluator API needs to evolve , right now it is a big singleton that exposes all of the variables defined as global variables .
They really should be tied to some kind of context so we can support multiple and independent execution contexts on the same address space .
Chances are that we want to expose some of the internals of the compiler to the world , but we first need to figure out what makes sense .
Now that the code runs on .NET , hopefully those of you that wanted to embed it can provide us some feedback on how you would like to see this API change or even better , provide patches for it .
C# as a DLR language : Someone had suggested to also provide a hook into the DLR , so you can instantiate C# eval engines with the same API that you instantiate IronPython and IronRuby eval engines .
Silverlight support : in theory this works out of the box , but we have not tested it yet .
Contributions :
Yes , we are accepting contributions to this awesome compiler .
Keybindings : Currently the csharp command line repl uses Emacs keybindings as part of my fabulous getline .cs command line editor .
We are aware that developers of different faiths might find other keybindings more appropriate .
We are taking patches .
Add support for IKVM Reflection : Jeroen has written a drop - in replacement for System .
Reflection [ .
Emit ] that will allow us to decouple the compile from the profile that it compiles code for ( Monoistas are familiar with dmcs , smcs , gmcs and mcs ;
We will be able to have a single compiler ) .
Source Code and Hacking
The source code for Mono's C# compiler , the Compiler as a Service and the interactive REPL are all available from SVN , do a checkout from our subversion repository for the module " mcs " .
Download from GitHub the " mono " module
Then open the VS2008 solution in mcs / tools / csharp .
This will build the Mono .
CSharp compiler as a service library and the csharp tool .
We do not typically provide VS Solution files for most of Mono , but we are making an exception for the compiler as a service to encourage .NET developers to play with it .
Update : Our compiler is MIT X11 licensed , so even developers at Microsoft can download this code and look at it .
It is all kosher guys !
Abstract
Abstract The Curry - Howard isomorphism states that types are propositionsand that programs are proofs .
This allows programmers to state and enforce invariants of programs by using types .
Unfortunately , the type systems of today 's functional languages cannot directly express interesting properties of programs .
To alleviate this prob-lem , we propose the addition of three new features to functional programming languages such as Haskell : Generalized AlgebraicDatatypes , Extensible Kind Systems , and the generation , propagation , and discharging of Static Propositions .
These three new fea-tures are backward compatible with existing features , and combine to enable a new programming paradigm for functional program -mers .
This paradigm makes it possible to state and enforce interesting properties of programs using the type system , and it does this inmanner that leaves intact the functional programming style , known and loved by functional programmers everywhere .

If young people feel disillusioned with politics , then it's in part because we only have a choice between two parties – and both are constantly seeking the popular vote , rather than really standing for anything .
Our current voting system is a big problem : it 's just not democratic .
A lot of young people have different views to those of the two main parties , and there is no one for them to turn to .
Proportional representation would be a much fairer system , and would engage those who are put off by the two - party system we have now .
I 'm not sure who I 'll be voting for .
Labour are better than the Tories for sure , but I 'm hesitant to vote for them as they 've moved too far towards the centre .
I 'd like there to be a viable left - wing alternative .
The issues that matter to me are things like public spending , and the taxing of the rich and the poor .
Right - wing thinkers claim that your money is your own and you deserve to spend it as you choose – which would be all well and good if everyone had equal opportunities at the beginning .
But they do n't .
If you 're born into a rich family , you have an outrageous head start over someone who is born into a poor family , and we need to create a more equal starting point .
The best way is to introduce higher taxes for the rich .
Education is hugely important .
Further cuts in university funding would be outrageous as the poor would be further discriminated against .
Universities should be free so that everyone has a chance .
I 'd also like to see initiatives to develop failing schools through partnerships with better ones , and the abolition of private education , which provides unfair advantage .
At the moment I 'm considering voting for a minority party , but I 'm not sure which one .
It 's important to vote , to put your voice in .
In this election young people wo n't have a huge voice as only one of two parties will win , but you have to try to change things .
A lot of people think it 's pointless voting for minority parties , but it 's worth starting the conversation .
You 've got to start somewhere .

My parents are from Ghana , one of the first African countries to gain independence from Britain ; they believe that if you have the means and the opportunity to vote , you should use it .
For me , deciding who to back in the general election was n't so much a case of who I like , as a case of who I do n't like – and I can't stand David " Call me Dave " Cameron .
There 's something so smug and untrustworthy about that man .
I want to believe that whoever is next in government would act in my best interest , that they 'd take on board the issues that affect me .
That 's what I think about whenever I look at the two leaders , but when I hear David Cameron talk , it 's like he is speaking to someone else .
I can't relate to him , so how could he understand who I am or where I 'm coming from ?
I 'm sceptical about politics in general .
In the past there may have been genuine choice for voters in Britain , but now the two main parties have both shifted towards the centre to the point that they 're pretty much the same , and I can't see any way to decide between them that is not based on personalities .
In my view , there are three types of young voter : the first wo n't vote , point blank , because they 're not interested ; the second understands the issues that matter to them ; and the third wants to vote for the sake of it – to be able to say , " I'm 18 now and I 've voted " – and these are the most easily impressionable .
My mum and dad have always encouraged me to think things through and make an informed , independent decision , so it scares me to see how many people my age are basing their choice for this election on sensational media stories .
The media has been harsh on Gordon Brown .
Every time you open one of the free newspapers , there 's something bad being said about the present Government , and that has a serious impact on young people who read them .
Most of my friends who are voting Labour have made up their own minds , whereas those who are going to vote Conservative are doing so based on something they 've read .
Lauren Morton , Surrey
Conservative
My older brother is involved with Conservative Future [ formerly the Young Conservatives ] , but it was my own decision to vote Tory .
Recently I applied to university and our careers adviser at school said how hard it will be to get a place with all the cut - backs due to the recession .
The Conservatives have said they 'll create 10,000 more university places if they get in power .
I 'm not sure that Labour handled the recession in the right way .
They instigated panic by saying early on that we were in a recession .
If they 'd handled it differently , they'd be in a better position now .
Among my peers there is a degree of political awareness , but there could certainly be more .
If someone has n't studied politics at school , they 'll need to have an independent interest in order to really understand how it all works , but in reality not many teenagers would sit down for an hour a week and work out what a politician has said .
Although I 'm not taking politics at A - Level , there are nine of us in my sixth form who are members of the Politics , Business and Economics Society .
We hold events based around politics , which is how I 've got my insight .
I 'm at boarding school so my experience might be slightly different , but in the evenings no one in my year sits down and watches the news ; I 'd say that 50 or even 60 per cent would n't even know how close the polls are at the moment .
If one thing 's to blame it is the off - putting way politics is sometimes presented ; it 's a case of how much information there is – or is n't – available in digestible form .
If someone turns on the news and does n't know anything about politics , they 'll hear what is being discussed and think , " What are they talking about ? " – and switch off .
In one of the glossy magazines this month they had an article which took some of the key policies and explained in a few words what each party proposed for each .
That was really helpful ; a lot of people in my year picked up on it .
If we want younger people to get involved in politics , we need to present information in a clear and palatable form .

Times have changed , and the way we engage with issues that matter to us has changed too .
Today , for a lot of people my age , political parties are an out - of - date concept , and not very useful .
Lots of young people have opinions and views but they 're not necessarily party - political ones , and they tend to express them in different ways : blogging on the internet , joining online interests groups , and communicating remotely with like - minded people around the country .
There seems to be an idea that the next generation is politically inactive or just not interested in the world , but that 's not true .
There are those who are only interested in fashion and what the next celebrity is up to – but that applies to people of all ages .
Many young people care about politics and want to make things happen .
I 'm really proud to have my vote and I 'm excited to use it .
It 's sad that where I live is a marginal Scottish National Party / Conservative seat , so if I vote Labour it does n't mean much , but I still will out of principle .
I 'm excited about the prospect of an alternative system being introduced in the future so that votes are n't wasted .
Politicians rarely tell the entire truth , so I form my decision based on who has the best record for helping the poor and for providing opportunities .
I 've changed my mind over time .
I was n't a big fan of Tony Blair when he was in power but as I 've been reading what he did to help the minimum wage , increase employment and the numbers of students in university , I 've warmed to him .
I 've always felt Gordon Brown is less of a personable man , someone who concentrates on his work .
He comes across as someone who is quite selfless , with good values .
For most young people , the most important thing is the prospect of getting a job and having a happy life , and these are the issues that will ultimately engage us .
I 've always told myself that life should be about making people happy .
If you can get it right , politics seems to be the best way to do that , so once I 've finished my degree , I want to build a career helping to improve the existing political system .

I know that either Labour or Conservative will win the election , but I still think you should vote according to your beliefs .
When deciding who to vote for I looked at a few key aspects which interest me : the economy , health and education .
I 'd been put off the two main parties as they seem to put more importance on how they say something rather than what they say , and I wanted another option .
A friend suggested I look at the Green Party , who I 'd never heard of – and once I 'd done some reading , I found that in many areas we share the same views .
In order to restore the economy , the Greens have proposed to regulate the banks and close the tax loopholes .
They have made specific plans unlike Labour and Conservative who seem reluctant to commit to a strong policy .
I 'm hoping to study medicine at university , so I 'm interested in health .
I agree with the Greens ' idea of going ahead with sales of NHS services , and of some hospitals to private companies , because if you introduce an element of privatisation it will encourage competition .
I 'm all for making access to health services public – we need to look after everyone ; after all , free healthcare is a right not a privilege – but if you introduce a bit of privatisation into the market it will increase efficiency .
If we do n't , doctors , especially surgeons , will continue to move to America where they can make more money .
The Greens want a shift in the direction of education ; they promote non-academic as well as academic achievement .
At the moment it 's all about statistics and league tables , but it 's important that children are given the freedom to think things through for themselves , rather than just being taught to pass exams ; otherwise we 're creating a generation of people who are good at remembering things for a short period of time , but can't make their own decisions in the long term .
If you encourage kids to think more freely , to be more individual , it will give them better prospects , which will in turn allow the economy to grow , ensuring a better future .

Not voting
It 's important to have an understanding of what 's going on in the world , but unless something directly affects me , I try not to dwell on it too much .
I 'd rather spend my time getting a decent education and bettering myself instead of waiting around for politicians to fix everything for me .
I can't see how voting will make anything better in my life , but that does n't mean I 'm apathetic .
There are plenty of issues I care about , like securing free transport for young people , improving the benefit system , increasing jobs and improving the economy in a recession – but it 's all too much for one party to fix .
I do n't know much about specific party policies , but I know that politicians concentrate on what they want to concentrate on , which are n't necessarily the same things that matter to ordinary people .
The decisions that the Government makes affect everyone , but I 'm not seeing a difference between any of the parties and I do n't believe things will necessarily improve whoever 's in power .
There are much more productive ways to improve your situation than by voting .
If political systems and government was something that was taught more at school I 'd probably have more of an understanding about how it all works , but I doubt I 'd have more of an interest .
I 'd rather get on with the things that do affect me – like my own education and training – than worry about the big picture .
At the moment I 'm doing a music - based apprenticeship , and I 've learnt so much already .
There are only a few basic jobs that everybody hears about at school – being a lawyer or a doctor , and so on – but that 's not everybody 's dream and you do n't always learn about other options .
When I do hear the news , the main parties always seem to be talking about bettering the employment situation and the education system – and it 's still just not happening , so my way of doing that for myself is by going to school when I 've got lessons , and leaving there with the qualifications I need to get myself the job I want to do .
Joe Sheedy , Nottingham
Conservative
When i first got involved with the Conservative Party two and a half years ago , I did n't know much about politics .
I became interested through watching the news , and joined the party online ; soon after I was invited to my first meeting , and it went from there .
This year I 'm standing as a local councillor in Wigan , which traditionally was a Labour stronghold .
Until 1999 , we did n't have a single member on Wigan town council – now we have 11 , but you do still definitely get the feeling that you 're one standing against the many .
I consider myself a conservative first and a Conservative Party member second .
I do n't think this is an issue any of the main parties deal with very well ; I 'd appreciate a harder line – for one we need a referendum to decide whether or not we should leave the EU .
In some respects ours is one of the least politically aware generations – but we are also one of the angriest .
There is a lot of adversity to political systems , parties and leaders .
Even though we 're big on issues – young people like to go on about global warming , for example – we wo n't engage in debates .
It seems we 're all for protesting and shouting out about issues , without any sensible discussion .
National debt is a big issue for people my age ; we 're the ones who 'll be paying it off .
Regarding the EU , I 'm not a fan of the way they 've taken control of British people without their consent .
I think that 18 years old is the right age at which to get the vote – I do n't think it should be any lower .
Young people are prone to making rash decisions ; one of the biggest problems is people voting based on what they see in one news headline .
Often I try to engage my peers in discussions about politics , but it can be difficult .
People tend to have ideas set in their head without having any real awareness .
It is very important that people vote when they have the chance .
At the end of the day , people died in this country so that we would have the right to vote , and there are still people in the world who'll never have the chance to influence anything .
Helen Longstreth , Bath
Labour
I 'm going to vote Labour not because I have a massive calling , but rather because they 're the party my family have always voted for .
Plus I do n't like the Conservatives , and as far as I can see , those are the only two options .
I was reading an interview with David Cameron in Glamour magazine recently and it was really , really cringey .
I think he was trying to be " down with the kids " but actually he just came across as a bit slimy .
The Conservatives are trying really hard to win over the younger vote , and their tactics are quite transparent .
The new image the Conservatives are trying to cultivate is n't very convincing .
While I do n't necessarily believe the party has changed , it 's even more off - putting that they 're making such an effort to be " cool " .
I feel a bit sorry for Gordon Brown .
I think he 's trying but it 's all a bit of a lost cause for him .
From the beginning he had a lot to deal with .
Blair going to war in Iraq damaged the reputation of the party , and that rubbed off on the Chancellor when he took over .
On top of that he's had the economic crisis to deal with – it was n't ever going to be easy .
In terms of individual policies , I 'm not sure of the differences between Labour and Conservative .
I know from studying Politics at AS Level that in both cases it 's more about getting public support than anything else .
Neither has much to set them apart at the moment .
Labour is n't the same as it originally was – they 're a lot less socialist now – while the Tories are trying to act more liberal .
It 's hard to say what would make politics more appealing to younger people .
A lot of us are turned off because what we hear talked about in the news does n't really seem that interesting or relevant to our everyday lives .
If you are n't working or paying taxes , it 's hard to think about how political decisions will affect you in the long run .
Anyway , it does n't really feel like you have much control whatever you do to get involved ; even if you cast your vote , then you still wo n't have much of an effect on what the Government does once it 's in power .
Kiran Kaur , London

In order to vote you have to have a clear understanding of what the different parties are offering – and I do n't have a clue .
It 's really hard to understand each of the various policies because they 're not laid out clearly anywhere as far as I can tell .
Besides , all the reports in the media about the expenses scandal has put me off voting full stop .
I just think : would it really make any difference which party is in power ?
They 're all corrupt .
Young people are confused about politics and unclear on who to vote for – but we 're also the most important group , because we 're the future .
The main parties holding a televised debate is a good idea in order to help get their ideals and messages across to my generation ; it would also be a good idea to use Facebook and Twitter .
I know some parties are using them already to recruit members , but maybe if they made more of an effort to outline their key policies and ideas on these sites then young people could more easily access the information they need to make an informed decision .
Our generation has a bit of a raw deal .
Although there are definitely more opportunities now in many ways , society seems to be going backwards , with us having to pay more and more for our education .
We 're already paying so much for university , and now they 're talking about making it even more expensive .
In the main , adults take their ideas about young people from the media , based on stereotypes , but all too often these are really negative .
We 're always hearing terminology like " yobs " and " hoodies " and associations between young people and gun and knife crime are constantly exaggerated in the press .
Why do they always focus on the negative ?
If you look for yourself , you 'll see that a lot of positive stuff is going on across the country .
I work on a youth magazine and I 'm constantly being forwarded information about projects run for and by young people .
The media seems to want to dwell on all the bad things that happen but that just sends out a negative message – and that takes away hope .
Amy Williams , Bangor
Not voting
I wo n't be voting this year because our politicians are full of lies .
They 've been committing criminal offences with their expense claims right under our noses , and I do n't think it 's right .
They keep making false promises too , saying they have the answers to fixing the economy , but I do n't trust any of them .
Where 's all this money they keep talking about coming from ?
It 's make - believe .
Neither of the main parties can fix the recession because there is n't the money available to do the things that they need to do .
It 's always been about Labour and Conservatives for me .
My family have voted Labour every year without fail , and they 'll be expecting me to vote with them this year – but I wo n't be .
How can I vote for a party if I can't believe what it 's telling me ?
Everything 's changing for the worse , and I 'm really worried about the world I 'm heading into .
I 'm worried that this recession will ruin my life .
Everyone needs prospects , and mine have been shattered .
I 've always had my heart set on joining the police force in North Wales but with public spending the way it is , they do n't have the finances to recruit at the moment , so they are n't taking in anywhere near the numbers of new officers that they were .
I do n't think the situation will have improved by the time I graduate , so my whole career is at stake .
And the price of housing now is stupid .
I 'm renting at the moment and that 's still really expensive ; when I leave university I expect I 'll be living with my parents for a long time .
From a government I expect things like making sure that education is safe , so that when I have kids they will get the highest quality schooling they can , and that the NHS has got enough money to support the elderly and the vulnerable .
It 's the basic things that matter .
But at the moment I do n't know who will deliver that best .
I do n't want to make a decision at this time as neither parties are giving us enough information about what they intend to do .
They 're all too busy trying to put the sunniest face on the future of our economy , and I do n't buy it .
Ellen Brown , East Sussex
Lib Dem
I 've had to make a quick decision on who to vote for .
I considered the major parties and felt that on balance the Liberal Democrats would be the most sensible vote , and the one which most supports the way I feel .
I 'm not a fan of the Labour Party at the moment .
Gordon Brown is n't as much of a charismatic leader as Tony Blair , and I think some of the choices he made as Chancellor , like selling all the gold reserves , were unpopular .
As a face of the party he does n't come across in the same way as Blair did .
And I can't imagine living under the Conservatives full stop .
Lib Dem seems like a good middle ground ; it 's also the most sensible route to take without throwing away my vote .
I might have voted for a smaller party if I felt there was any hope of them getting in .
I do think there 's quite a strong chance the Lib Dems will be elected ; Labour has lost a lot of votes recently .
Some people think that the Lib Dems are a bit of a joke , that if they were voted in they would n't know what to do , but I think given the chance , Clegg would step up to the pressure .
Even if you do n't think they 'll win this time , it 's important to vote for them to sow the seeds for next time .
Most of my friends realise the importance of having your say .
Where I live is mostly a Tory area , and the views of the kids here tend to reflect the views of their parents – even if they do n't say so directly .
I do n't know if voting Tory is anything people my age feel ashamed of , but I think it 's harder to defend yourself if you say you 're going to vote right wing , which is why they choose to keep quiet .
Environmental issues are a big thing for people my age .
We 're the ones who have to live with the damage , and the ones the Government can get to with their policies .
As a younger person sometimes you do feel that parties are trying to sell you their policies – I even got a birthday card from the Conservative Party on my 18th .
Financially , I do n't think we need to be alarmed , however .
Recession is a natural thing in the market .
In fact , until Nick Griffin's in power , I do n't think we need worry about much at all .
Lee Allen , Derby
UKIP
Just before the general election of 2005 , when I was in year nine , our year held a mock election at school .
Beforehand , my class was called to a meeting and told that each of us could represent any party we liked in the debate .
I chose the Conservative Party and spent a long time researching the ideologies and policies of the three main parties .
From watching the news and flicking through the red - top newspapers , I started forming my own opinions , and thinking in depth about issues like the European Union , crime and immigration .
I later found out these are the values that UKIP stands for too , and became a supporter of the party about six months ago .
My granddad is strongly opposed to immigration – to the point where he does come across as somewhat outdated .
Although my opinions do n't mirror his exactly – I 'm much more integrated into a multi-cultural society and more accepting of different views than he is – I can see why he is angry .
People of different ethnicities are moving in and foreign labour is taking over British jobs .
My granddad and I also agree on issues such as workers ' rights and being sceptical of the EU .
We 've gone from having our own industry and controls on our borders in this country to the system we have today which totally lacks sovereignty and any form of independence .
I 'm not involved in UKIP directly , but I am a keen supporter and have just returned from my first conference .
It was something I felt it was my duty to do ; I wanted to meet other supporters , see what the party was was really like and meet the UKIP speakers I 've seen talking on clips on YouTube .
Afterwards , I felt really inspired by what was said .
SketchUp Closet Shelves
I started planning some shelves for my office closet a little less than a month ago .
It ’s a fairly large closet and none of the electronics are real heat - hogs so I ’m not too worried about ventilation .
I mostly wanted a place to hide the printer ( and router , and external hard drives ) along with a work - surface to either throw down a laptop or work with printouts / copies when I need to be doing that type of stuff .
Final SketchUp Design
Major differences between the inital design and my final were changing the left - most mounts to be a cleat instead of legs and changing from universal 3 ” posts to “ ell ” constructed 2x4 ’s + 2x2’s .
It turns out that 3 ” posts are only carried in my imagination and that posts sold at Home Depot are 4 ” , which felt entirely too bulky for what I was doing .
Cut Pieces
Before going to Home Depot for the wood , I planned and wrote out my parts list based on the sketchup design and a final set of “ accurate ” measurements .
This was really helpful when I needed to figure out how many linear feet of 2x4 ’s I was going to need and what size board I needed to buy .
I ended up splurging a bit on the top plywood and got one with the smooth birch veneer because I knew I might be using it as a light - duty desk surface .
It was only a few dollars more but has a nice smooth feel to it although you have to be careful about shredding the veneer when cutting .
I did all cuts with a basic circular saw and a hand - saw for detail / final removal ( ie : when cutting out the “ ell ” sections from the bottom shelf ) .
I ca n’t overemphasize the helpfulness of clamps and long , straight levels .
I do n’t have a table - saw , so to make the longest cut I snapped a chalk line ( straight ) , used two levels and some scrap wood along with some bracing to keep all my straight edges “ in line ” while running the circular saw down the board .
Originally I had planned on using the 2x4 ’s but they were nowhere near straight over a 5 - 6 ’ run .
Primed
After all the piece - assembly I was left with your basic ikea - style furniture pack .
I ended up priming everything twice , then another two coats of white latex glossy ( standard “ trim ” paint ) and it came out acceptable .
It would have been nicer to keep the dust down as I ended up with some random crap on the large surfaces after the first glossy coat .
I sanded some of that down then did the final coat with the garage door closed which helped quite a bit .
Installed
During the dry - fitting I discovered two problems and realized one problem during piece - construction :
I had measured the closet width “ corner to corner ” but the sheetrock bowed inwards in the middle .
Taking - 0.5 ” off the largest shelf - edge and I was back in business .
I neglected to take into consideration baseboard incursion .
A bunch of weird free - hand cuts down on three of the legs and it fit .
I had orginally intended for each shelf to be 8 ” tall but I made a mistake on the bottom shelf , measuring 8 ” down and not adding in the 3/4 ” for plywood thickness .
Differences
Installation was pretty straightforward and the shelves as a whole feel nice and solid .
I purchased some trim pieces for the front “ desk ” shelf and for the left - hand side to cover the cleat - screws .
Those are yet - to - be installed , mostly waiting until I can prime / paint the trim .
It ’ll take 5 minutes to paint everything but 30 minutes to clean the brushes , etc .
When I have the paint out I also need to paint over some of the exposed screw - holes on the shelf - top .
If you ’d like to play with the SketchUp file , have at it .
The best advice I have is to do the “ three chairs ” tutorial , use the tape - measure tool a lot , and paradoxically , sometimes it ’s a lot easier to draw things out right the first time than it is to fix or modify an existing drawing .

DESTROYED ARGUMENTS
Gal . 4:16 : " Am I therefor made your
enemy because I tell you the truth ? "
The history of the race , and each individual 's experience , are thick with
evidence that a truth is not hard to kill and that a lie told well is immortal .
– Mark Twain
The purpose of this file is simply educational .
I 've noticed too many innocents who today believe certain legal arguments popular years ago , but which were litigated by ill prepared , desperate people and lost .
To continue going down such dead end roads and to follow these dead arguments will only result in disaster .
Furthermore , there are lots of self proclaimed " legal gurus " writing books and conducting seminars all around the country .
These gurus espouse their views and personal opinions which they pretend are " the law . "
Everyone has a right to express their personal opinions , but most of these " opinions " are being marketed as " the law . "
There are publications on the Net suggesting the United States is still a part of Great Britain , a " missing 13th amendment " still exists , and our society is legally based upon contract ; there are arguments that a birth certificate means something more sinister than birth certificate , etc .
While these works and arguments may be interesting , most are pure fiction composed of personal opinions parading as " the law . "
Too many people get into trouble following these fairy tales .
These arguments have the same quality as this one .
There are also stupid ideas floating around the Net like this one .
But do not think that by posting this information I believe that all is lost and there are no important legal issues left .
To the contrary , I have a very long list of solid legal issues which need to be litigated and these are issues which will further our " freedom " cause .
For example , even though I post below the losses regarding my favorite issue , the money issue , there are some good issues left , but they will be raised only in the best of circumstances and the best of cases .
Some of these other issues are explained on my web site .
But I am protecting these remaining issues from destruction by the desperate who grab an issue and throw it in court ; these folks have no plans nor skills to engage in the legal battle , and they slaughter our good issues on the altar of stupidity .
Some may criticize me for naming specific parties here .
Please do not think based upon what you read or see here that I am an " attacker " .
Back in the mid 80s and early 90s , this movement had a more congenial attitude and people involved with it were nicer .
I have always been able to have cordial relations with most in this movement ; men from the South were raised to be southern gentlemen .
But , in the early 90s things changed and some felt it to be in their interest to attack me and lawyers in general .
For example , in the past I was friendly with some of the principals in Right Way Law ; however a few years ago , they started spreading lies and selling garbage .
Similarly , every party who is specifically named in these files , like Dave DeRiemer , " drew first blood " .
Once challenged , I respond and let the cards fall where they may .
My purpose is to expose the lies of these various " gurus " who clearly appear to want a fight .
Penhallow v. Doane ’s Administrators , 3 U.S. 54 ; 1 L. Ed. 57 ; 3 Dall. 54 " stated as follows :
Here is an example of false information promoted by gurus .
A man named Victor Varjabedian wrote several years ago a book entitled “ Cracking the Code . ”
Therein , he asserted that the case of “ , 3 U.S. 54 ; 1 L. Ed. 57 ; 3 Dall. 54 " stated as follows :
“ Inasmuch as every government is an artificial person , an abstraction , and a creature of the mind only , a government can interface only with other artificial persons .
The imaginary – having neither actuality nor substance – is foreclosed from creating and attaining parity with the tangible .
The legal manifestation of this that no government , as well as any law , agency , aspect , court , etc. therefor can concern itself with anything other than corporate , artificial persons and the contracts between them . ”
The above “ quote ” appears nowhere in the case .
Robert Marlett makes some excellent comments here .
To shorten the length of this file , the below arguments are separately posted :
I. The Money Issue :
In the seventies and early eighties , advocates of the specie provisions in Art. 1 , §10 , cl. 1 of the U.S. Constitution made a concerted effort to educate people about this constitutional provision , consequently people ( mostly those who were desperate and ill prepared ) acting pro se began litigating the issue .

" I have never seen Becraft challenge the non-judicial Federal Courts are not authorized by the Constitution for the United States . " [ sic : the whole sentence is " sic " as well as " sick " ]
Mr. Wangrud castigated those who did n't follow his legal views and brilliant legal theories .
Was Mr. Wangrud correct when he proclaimed that the US district courts are non-judicial ?
Your attention is directed to Smith v. Kitchen , 156 F.3d 1025 ( 10th Cir. 1997 ) , involving a fellow who believed in the UCC " Refusal for Fraud " argument .
He also raised Wangrud 's issue which was addressed as follows :
" Smith 's final contention of error involves his complaint that the district court should have responded to his argument that by captioning its documents ‘ UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT , ' the court below was functioning as a ‘ territorial ' court rather than as an Article III court .
Smith has raised this argument at every stage of this litigation , but he has yet to clarify his point .
As best we can determine , Smith has cobbled together stray quotations from various sources to claim that a federal district court can function either as a ‘ territorial ' court under Article I or as a ‘ constitutional ' court under Article III .
Without giving any credence to Smith 's bizarre argument , and despite our inability to see how Smith 's distinction would matter in this case , we hold that the United States District Court for the District of Colorado was fully empowered under Article III to consider Smith 's constitutional claims .
XIV .
Implementing regulations :
United States v. Hartman , 915 F.Supp. 1227 ( M.D.Fla. 1996 ) : argument regarding implementing regs and the cross references in CFR index held frivolous .
Stafford v. CIR , TCM 1997 - 50 .
XV .
Taxes are contractual :
In McLaughlin v. CIR , 832 F.2d 986 , 987 ( 7th Cir. 1987 ) , this argument was held to be without merit :
" The notion that the federal income tax is contractual or otherwise consensual in nature is not only utterly without foundation but ... has been repeatedly rejected by the courts . "
See also United States v. Drefke , 707 F.2d 978 , 981 ( 8th Cir. 1983 ) .
Others strenuously argue that social security is a contract .
The problem with this contention , however , is that it is constitutionally impossible for social security to be a contract .
Please see another file posted on this web site by clicking here .
Contentions that driver licenses are contracts will get you nowhere .
See Hershey v. Commonwealth Dep't. of Transportation , 669 A.2d 517 , 520 ( Pa.Cmwlth . 1996 ) ; and State v. Gibson , 697 P.2d 1216 ( Idaho 1985 ) .
Some today contend that use of the US Postal Service is contractual and that such use subjects one to federal jurisdiction .
Bob Wangrud advocated the " Zip Code " argument for many years and eventually people recognized the stupidity of this argument .
Making it again today causes me to wonder what these advocate are smoking .
XVI .
The US is " foreign " to the states :
A popular belief promoted in the freedom movement is the concept or idea that the United States is a foreign sovereign as regards the states .
How this idea got started is beyond me because the U.S. Supreme Court and other courts have concluded otherwise ; see Claflin v. Houseman , 93 U.S. 130 , 136 ( 1876 ) ( " The United States is not a foreign sovereignty as regards the several States " ) ; Severson v. Home Owners Loan Corp. , 88 P.2d 344 , 347 ( Ok. 1939 ) ( quoting Claflin ) ; Bowles v. Heckman , 64 N.E.2d 660 , 662 ( Ind. 1946 ) ( quoting Claflin ) ; Kersting v. Hardgrove , 48 A.2d 309 , 310 ( N.J. 1946 ) ( summarizes Claflin ) ; Harrison v. Herzig Bldg. & Supply Co. , 290 Ky . 445 , 161 S.W.2d 908 , 910 ( 1942 ) ( quoting Claflin ) ; Robinson v. Norato , 71 R.I. 256 , 43 A.2d 467 , 471 ( 1945 ) ( quoting Claflin and further stating " the several States of the Union are neither foreign to the United States nor are they foreign to each other " ) .
See also this PDF image from a legal encyclopedia , Corpus Juris Secundum .
See also Pennoyer v. Neff , 95 U.S. 714 , 732-33 ( 1878 ) ( “ Whilst [ the courts of the United States ] are not foreign tribunals in their relations to the State courts , they are tribunals of a different sovereignty , exercising a distinct and independent jurisdiction , and are bound to give to the judgments of the State courts only the same faith and credit which the courts of another State are bound to give to them . ” ) .
There are lots of theories which float through the freedom movement and people are very prone to accept any contention or position without question or investigation .
But if they fail to check out the sources upon which they rely , they run the risk of believing something which has no foundation and will not work in court .
XVII .
Citizenship :
In Boyd v. Nebraska , 143 U.S. 135 ( 1892 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court stated as follows :
" Mr. Justice Story , in his Commentaries on the Constitution , says : ' Every citizen of a state is ipso facto a citizen of the United States . '
Section 1693 .
And this is the view expressed by Mr. Rawle in his work on the Constitution .
Chapter 9 , pp. 85 , 86 .
Mr. Justice Curtis , in Dred Scott v. Sandford , 19 How .
393 , 576 , expressed the opinion that under the constitution of the United States 'every free person , born on the soil of a state , who is a citizen of that state by force of its constitution or laws , is also a citizen of the United States . '
And Mr. Justice Swayne , in The Slaughter - House Cases , 16 Wall .
36 , 126 , declared that ' a citizen of a state is ipso facto a citizen of the United States . ' "
See also Minor v. Happersett , 88 U.S. 162 ( 1875 ) .
" Pending before the Court is plaintiff Graham County Sheriff Richard Mack 's complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against the enforcement of 18 U.S.C. § 922(s ) , commonly referred to as the Brady Act .
For the reasons set forth below , the Court finds that subsection 922(s ) ( 2 ) violates the Fifth and Tenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and will enter partial judgment in favor of the plaintiff on that basis . "
Another recent example of a case where a single federal judge held a law unconstitutional is Condon v. Reno , 972 F.Supp. 977 ( D.S.C. 1997 ) , where District Judge Shedd of South Carolina declared the federal Driver 's Privacy Protection Act unconstitutional :
" In this case of first impression the State of South Carolina and its Attorney General ( ‘ the State ' ) challenge the constitutionality of the ‘ Driver 's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 ' ( ‘ the DPPA ' ) , 18 U.S.C. §§ 2721 - 25 , which regulates the dissemination and use of certain information contained in State motor vehicle records , on the grounds that it violates the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the United States Constitution .
( FN1 ) The State seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the DPPA .
The United States of America and its Attorney General ( ‘ the United States ' ) have filed a motion to dismiss based on their contention that ( 1 ) the Court lacks jurisdiction over these claims because of the justiciability concepts of ripeness and standing and , alternatively , ( 2 ) these claims fail on their merits because the DPPA was lawfully enacted pursuant to Congress ' powers under both the Commerce Clause and § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment .
In turn , the State has moved for summary judgment in its favor .
( FN2 ) After carefully reviewing this matter , the Court concludes that the DPPA is unconstitutional .
Accordingly , the Court will deny the United States ' motion to dismiss , grant the State 's motion for summary judgment , and permanently enjoin the enforcement of the DPPA in the State of South Carolina . ( FN3 ) . "
These two cases are not the only ones which prove that single federal district judges have authority to declare laws unconstitutional and they can enjoin enforcement of those laws .
Further , there are other similar cases .
Clearly , the 3 judge court position is groundless and without merit .
In short , it is ridiculous .
XIX .
Due process principles and tax collection :
Via the due process clauses of the 5th and 14th Amendments , both the state and federal governments must provide certain fundamental procedures before life , liberty or property are taken .
For those interested in this subject , reading the cases of Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. , 395 U.S. 337 , 89 S.Ct. 1820 ( 1969 ) , Fuentes v. Shevin , 407 U.S. 67 , 92 S.Ct. 1983 ( 1972 ) , and North Georgia Finishing , Inc. v. Di-Chem , Inc. , 419 U.S. 601 , 95 S.Ct. 719 ( 1975 ) , are important in understanding the views of the Supreme Court regarding the due process procedures to which the states are bound .
However , one cannot ignore the fact that there are two different due process standards ; one standards is applicable to us and the states , and quite another exists for Uncle Sam .
There is a popular position of late that Goldberg v. Kelly , 397 U.S. 254 , 90 S.Ct. 1011 ( 1970 ) , is the " key " due process case regarding the collection of taxes .
This is a very erroneous .
If you wish to understand principles of due process in reference to tax matters , the cases of Phillips v. CIR , 283 U.S. 589 , 51 S.Ct. 608 ( 1931 ) , and CIR v. Shapiro , 424 U.S. 614 , 96 S.Ct. 1062 ( 1976 ) , are the ones to be read .
XX .
The Federal Government is the 1871 act to establish a government for Washington D.C. :
For several years now , certain groups and websites like this one have advocated an argument that the " federal " government was created as a municipal corporation via an act of February 21 , 1871 .
The truth is otherwise .
This was the form of government for the District until February 21 , 1871 .
On this date , Congress adopted a new act for the government of the District ; see 16 Stat. 419-429 .
As seen by a simple review of this act , it did not create a government for anything but the District of Columbia , and it certainly did not purport to be a government for " federal " citizens living in the States .
Also posted here are the first couple of pages from the 1873 Revised Statutes for the District of Columbia .
Scandal was the reason that this form of government for the District lasted only a mere 7 years .
After the act of February 21 , 1871 , public officials of the District incurred tremendous debts for the District , eventually requiring Congress to in essence step in and take over that government .
See 18 Stat. ( Part 3 ) 116 , ch. 337 , for repeal of 1871 act .
An act of June 11 , 1878 , 20 Stat. 102 , provided " a permanent form of government for the District of Columbia . "
Much later , the District of Columbia Home Rule Act , Public Law 93-198 , 87 Stat. 777 , approved December 24 , 1973 , created the government for the District which exists today .
What have the Supremes stated about the " Act of 1871 " ?
In District of Columbia v. Camden Iron Works , 181 U.S. 453 ( 1901 ) , the Supremes held :
" June 20 , 1874 , an act was passed entitled ' An Act for the government of the District of Columbia , and for Other Purposes . '
18 Stat. 116 , c. 337 .
By this act , the government established by the act of 1871 was abolished and the President , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , was authorized to appoint a Commission , consisting of three persons , to exercise the power and authority vested in the governor and the board of public works , except as afterwards limited by the act .
Those who assert some wild theory about Washington , D.C. are utterly wrong .
They have invented a " different version " of history without bothering to check out the facts
XXI .
The ' bankruptcy of the United States " as alleged by " congressman " Traficant :
I have heard people discuss statements by " congressman " Traficant allegedly made back in 1993 where he stated in the Congressional Record that the US was bankrupt and this bankruptcy happened back in 1933 .
This statement has been used to support UCC arguments about the bankruptcy of the United States .
Frank F. checked the accuracy of this alleged Traficant statement and found it to be utterly false .
Here is what he said in a recent e-mail :
This is 99 % bogus .
You 'll notice that it claims to be from the Congressional Record of March 17 , 1993 , page H- 1303 , and a speech from Rep. James Traficant ( D - Oh ) .
It starts with a double quote mark and it ends much later with another double quote mark .
Except for the first paragraph ( the first 66 words ) , it is a fake .
Traficant 's own words run from " Mr. Speaker .... " to " ... our demise " and that 's the only portion from him or from the Congressional Record .
Trafficant was arguing against deficit spending , and everything else in the article ( starting from the words " It is an established fact ... " ) is fake .
Traficant never said them .
In fact , if Traficant thought that the Banking Emergency Act of 1933 was Public Law 89 - 719 , we 'd all have reason to doubt his soundness of mind , because the Public Law number is clearly decades after 1933 -- in fact it is the number of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966 .
Ditto for the pretended title and description of HJR 192 ( of 1933 ) .
All of that , including the references to canon law and maritime insurance , is fakery , falsely attributed to Traficant .
The actual page from the Congressional Record is here .
Please excuse the copy quality of this PDF file as it was obtained from microfiche .
This page proves that those who allege that Traficant made this statement are not telling the truth .
( 15 ) " United States " means -
( A) a Federal corporation ;
( B ) an agency , department , commission , board , or other entity
of the United States ; or
( C ) an instrumentality of the United States .
Many contend that the above quote , a part of the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act , means " the United States is a corporation . "
I must state that this is an erroneous construction of this particular law .
The Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act , 104 Stat. 4933 , applies to the entirety of the United States government .
Virtually everyone knows that the federal government has lots of agencies .
It also has lots of departments , commissions , boards and instrumentalities , including federal corporations .
In the last 100 years , Congress has created lots of corporations and some that still exist today are :
The FDCPA simply regulates the collection activities of all federal agencies , departments , commissions , boards and instrumentalities , including the above federal corporations .
Rather than repeatedly state in this 30 + page act that all " federal agencies , departments , commissions , boards and instrumentalities , including federal corporations " shall do certain things , all these entities are , for purposes of this particular act , encompassed within the words , " United States . "
Wherever the words " United States " appears in this law regulating these federal collection activities , it means all these various entities , including " Federal corporations " .

The Shard is an obvious structure which rises above the Moon 's surface by more than a mile .
Its overall irregular spindly shape ( containing a regular geometric pattern ) with constricted nodes and swollen internodes , if natural , has got to be a wonder of the Universe .
No known natural process can explain such a structure .
Computer enhancement with about 190 feet ( 60 meters ) resolution shows an irregular outline with more reflective and less reflective surfaces .
The amount of sunlight reflecting from parts of the Shard indicate a composition inconsistent with that of most natural substances .
Only crystal facets and glass can reflect that much light ( polished metallic surfaces are unnatural ) .
Single crystals the size of city blocks are currently unknown .
I concur with Hoagland that the Shard may be a highly eroded remnant of some sort of artificial structure made of glass - like material .
Other larger structures and their reflectivity in the area support this theory .

The Castle
. Source Photo for the " Castle " Anomaly The Castle
. The Castle The Castle Wire Comments NOTE :
This reference is Temporary ...
http://www.anomalous-images.com/astroufo.html
http://www.anomalies.net/ufo/moon/
The above image is the source photo of the anomaly .
This photo , regardless of the " castle " tower is absolutely bizarre .
Judging from the lighting in the craters on the lower left corner it is apparent the sun coming from the upper right side of the photo .
If you look at the immense unlit area in the right half of the photo , it begs the question , " where is the sunlight on the surface . "
The logical conclusion is that something above the surface is blocking the sun .
It is in this area we find the " castle " tower .
Close scrutiny by legitimate scientists place the " castle " some 9 miles above the surface of the moon .
When I first became aware of this anomaly some 11 years ago , I obtained the original photograph from NASA to verify for myself that it was real , and it is .
I have since met with ( and had dinner with ) Mr. Richard C. Hoagland on numerous occasions .
I believe this man to be a crusader for all of us , to deliver the truth of our wondrous past .
The nay - sayers on here can not have seriously looked at the overwhelming body of evidence that proves NASA has been lying to us for all these years about the true nature of man and his past .
The greater question is why ?
What is going on at the upper echelons of power in this world that they do not want you to know .
I know the answer to this question and it is evil , evil , evil .
If I told you you would not believe it , so I wo n't bother .
Now if you spend some time , as I have ( 20 years ) looking into it , you will come to the same evil conclusion that I have .
Fortunately , these days with the Internet and so many people having awakened to the truth , it will not take you as long to figure it out .
I will give you one big hint though .
G. W. Bush is ( d ) evil ) .
Good luck .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
An estimated 42,000 gallons of oil per day were leaking from an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico in late April , following an explosion at an offshore drilling rig on April 20 , 2010 .
The rig eventually capsized and sank .
These images of the affected area were captured on April 25 by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Aqua satellite ( top , wider view ) and the Advanced Land Imager on NASA ’s Earth Observing - 1 ( EO - 1 ) satellite ( bottom , close up ) .
In the top image , the Mississippi Delta is at image center , and the oil slick is a silvery swirl to the right .
The oil slick may be particularly obvious because it is occurring in the sunglint area , where the mirror - like reflection of the Sun off the water gives the Gulf of Mexico a washed - out look .
The close - up view shows waves on the water surface as well as ships , presumably involved in the clean up and control activities .
The initial explosion killed eleven people and injured several others , and a fire burned at the location for more than a day until the damaged oil rig sank .
An emergency response effort is underway to stop the flow of oil and contain the existing slick before it reaches wildlife refuges and beaches in Louisiana and Mississippi .
The slick may contain dispersant or other chemicals that emergency responders are using to control the spread of the oil , and it is unknown how much of the 700,000 gallons of fuel that were on the oil rig burned in the fire and how much may have spilled into the water when the platform sank .
On April 25 , 2010 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s Emergency Response Division issued the following update on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill incident in the Gulf of Mexico : “ An attempt to control the leaking well using a Remotely Operated Vehicle ( ROV ) was not successful , and the well continues to leak .

You may think LaWanda and her 43,000 blue - gloved colleagues at airport checkpoints could n’t sink any lower than humiliating a little boy wearing braces on his legs .
Or forcing a woman to stand on her sprained ankle , thereby fracturing it .
Or yanking the crutches from a passenger crippled by polio and threatening to charge her with assault for reflexively grabbing at them — after ordering her to drop her trousers ( not to worry : they promised to shield her privacy with a sheet , sorta like the whole - body scanners that blur our faces while strip - searching us ) .
Ah , but you underestimate LaWanda et al .
These brutes boast a limitless reservoir of cruelty — as Nadine Hays , her elderly mother , and a friend who was helping to care for the aged lady discovered at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank , CA , last April .
Before our public servants finished with them , Mrs. Hays would be in jail , her mother in emotional and physical distress , and her friend in tears at the savagery visited on them .
Mrs. Hays hoped to take her mother , Eleanor Albrecht , to a grandson ’s wedding in Nashville : " I … thought of my mom , who at 93 years of age will probably not see any of her other unmarried grandchildren get married .
I had to get her to this wedding . "
She was right : Mrs. Albrecht died last month .

The Almighty blessed me with four grandparents who lived into their nineties .
I know first - hand how hard it is moving folks that old from a rocker to the dinner table , never mind cross-country .
Compounding the challenge were the usual nonagenarian infirmities — dementia , diarrhea , dehydration — from which Mrs. Albrecht suffered .
And so Mrs.
Hays packed a cooler with snacks that would soothe and sustain her mother during their flight : " milk to make her specially formulated protein drink , grapes , sliced cheese , salami , cottage cheese and applesauce . "
Astoundingly , this does n’t violate the Transportation Security Administration ’s ( TSA ) endless and silly prohibitions on what supposedly free citizens may carry onboard planes .
When it comes to " persons with disabilities and medical conditions , " the agency ditches its paranoia about exploding Ensure and Evian to allow " liquids including water , juice , or liquid nutrition or gels … in volumes larger than 3.4 ounces ( 100 ml ) . "
So the astute Mrs. Hays was unpleasantly surprised when the screener at the checkpoint " started removing items from the ice chest saying u2018 You ca n’t take this , you ca n’t take this . ’ …
I told her the food was for my 93 - year - old mother ( I pointed to her ) and that she had special needs ; this did not change her mind .
I immediately asked her for her supervisor .
Her supervisor came over and agreed that none of the items could go on board . "
Mere arbitrariness and inhumanity seldom satisfy the TSA ’s goons ; sure enough , these two added robbery .
They " tossed everything back into the ice chest and started to walk away with it . "
They even confessed their larcenous intentions when Mrs .
Hays protested their stealing : " The supervisor looked at me with scorn and said … that they were going to confiscate the entire ice chest . "
Our heroine reacted with the outrage appropriate to theft , especially when it happens in broad daylight to items necessary for a parent ’s well - being : she reached for her property .
" A u2018tug of war ’ over the ice chest proceeded … , " she says .
" [ A]t one point I noticed the agent look up to her supervisor and give her a smirk like this was really funny !
I finally gave a very hard pull to the ice chest , got it away from the agent , walked over to the trash can , [ and ] dumped all of the contents into the trash … "
You & the Police !

She then left the checkpoint , mistakenly supposing that was the end of it .
After all , the TSA had won , had n’t it , protecting American aviation from an old lady ’s cottage cheese and applesauce ?
But no .
The horror continued at the gate : when " the American Airlines employee " saw Mrs.
Hays and her party approaching , she " closed the glass doors .
When I said that we needed to get on the plane she said , u2018 You ’re not boarding this plane … .
With what just happened you are a threat to my passengers and I wo n’t allow you to board . ’"
In vain did Mrs . Hays plead her mother ’s poor health and discomfort .
You might assume we ’ve reached the zenith of lunacy , heartlessness , and sheer evil .
Alas , dear reader , you again underestimate aviation ’s gulag .
No situation is ever so destitute of humanity that cops can’t wring a few more barbarities from it .
And bingo , along came several to arrest Mrs. Hays .
On what charge , you ask ?
Ministering to her mother ?
Preventing a crime , i.e. , the theft of her property ?
No : battery .
The TSA ’s supervisor asserted that Mrs. Hays " struck [ her ] in the arm with a closed fist . "

Thank God , whatever instincts cops possess completely passed me by .
I do n’t itch to Taser expectant mothers ; I long to cheer , not ticket , cars doing 32 MPH in a school zone .
But even I would have noticed that the bunched and excited audience a cat - fight always draws was n’t crowding the checkpoint when I arrived moments after the alleged brawl .
I might also have asked the few witnesses gathering their belongings after the TSA ’s warrantless searches whether they had seen Mrs .
Hays punch anyone .
And then , glancing overhead to confirm that yes , the ubiquitous surveillance camera was duly recording events , I would have asked to view the tape .
Not Burbank ’s Finest .
They listened as employees of a bureaucracy notorious for its lying lied .
Then they arrested Mrs. Hays , cuffed her , and inflicted further indignities ( including a strip - search as well as denying her a chair while booking her despite her arthritic knee ) .
In all this sorry mess , we long for just one gentleman , a single person of goodwill , courage and integrity , to stand against the bestial madness , to protest the senseless , vicious abuse of a lady and her ancient mother , to rescue them from these sadists , or , at the least , to extend some small comfort .
The closest we come is a " female officer " who finally agrees to handcuff Mrs .
Hays less painfully .
Believe it or not , Leviathan actually brought this travesty to court , though not until this week .
On Tuesday , a judge dismissed the charges against Mrs. Hays — provided she " stays out of trouble " ( sic for " does n’t tick off any bullies with badges " ) for the next six months .
Apparently , he was too busy scolding this exemplary woman to reprimand the TSA ’s lying lackeys , the callous coward at American Airlines who effectively robbed Mrs .
Hays of her ticket , and the cops who arrested her without cause .
Nor did he suggest , much less require , them to compensate her for the $ 15,000 and stress this nightmare cost .
Savaging women , preying on the weak and elderly , punishing decency , kindness , and all that ’s civilized while glorifying power … more and more , the Warriors on Terror chillingly imitate their mentors .
The Best of Becky Akers
After months of warning that Tea Party protests would erupt into violence , a wave of vandalism and violence crested in Santa Cruz this weekend .
Masked protesters wielding torches swarmed through the business district , smashing windows and chanting “ the streets are on fire ! ” and “ Revolution ! ”
It ’s exactly the kind of armed uprising that Tea Party critics predicted … except that it did n’t erupt at a Tea Party :
A group of protesters demonstrating at a May Day rally for worker ’s and immigrant rights downtown broke off into a riot vandalizing about a dozen businesses around 10:30 p.m.
Saturday , police said .
Windows were left shattered and graffiti including anarchy signs were tagged onto buildings .
The Rittenhouse Building , Urban Outfitters , Jamba Juice and Velvet Underground all had windows broken , according to Capt .
Steve Clark .
Santa Cruz police asked for help from all agencies in the county to break up the riot of about 200 people .
At one point , protesters lit a fire on the porch of Caffe Pergolesi and blocked access to firefighters , officers said .
Police were able to clear out the demonstrators before more damage was caused .
A large rock sat outside Verizon Wireless on the 100 block of Cooper Street , where vandals tried to break the window twice , according to Clark .
Jim Hoft has video of the riot :
Let ’s do a quick recap .
Tea Parties have been held in various locations for well over a year , and none of them has turned violent at all .
Arizona passes an immigration law a week ago , and already we ’ve had one Leftist demonstration result in violence , calls for the overthrow of the US , and rioting .
Will the same hyperventilating media that sees a militia in every Tea Party make the same broad - stroke analysis of the open - borders
Left after a real show of violence and demands for revolution ?
Do n’t hold your breath .
Update : Bob Owens at Confederate Yankee says it was n’t just Santa Cruz , either , but also Asheville , NC .
The Boss Emeritus finds another in San Francisco .
She also finds a Univision reporter participating in a protest he was covering .
Will Univision suspend the reporter as KOTA did Shad Olson ?
August 2020 Autoplay
Occasionally , someone will complain that “ Twitter keeps resetting my autoplay setting ” on the website , and they ’ll usually imply that we ’re doing it for ads or other nefarious purpose .
Truth : we do n’t do it for ads or any other nefarious purpose .
If anything , there might be a bug .
And sometimes , sorry , it ’s user error ( sorry , but sometimes it is ) .
I ’ve looked into the code quite a few times , hoping I can find something .
It 's something we take seriously because we recognize that while autoplay is a nuisance for some , it 's a major problem for others .
Videos can trigger epilespy or trauma .
Sometimes they are even sent maliciously , to create that effect .
Every time I look , I think I find something , but it ’ll turn out that I ’ve misunderstood some nuance somewhere .
Heh , I see you reading with skepticism : it ’s a boolean setting - where is the room for nuance in that ?
Great question .
When you opt -out of autoplaying videos on Twitter ( and , let ’s be completely honest here , I ’m 42 years old and I do n’t understand how anyone can use the site without disabling them ) , we store a setting in the site memory , and we send it to the server .
On the server , we save it with your data - saver settings .
On Twitter , you can choose data - saver mode , which reduces your bandwidth consumption dramatically .
You might be in a place where bandwidth is available but expensive , or you might be on a memory - constrained device , so this is a useful setting .
Video autoplay is closely related , so we store and fetch them with the same API .
( It ’s a memcache store served by GraphQL ) Unusually , we do n’t simply save this to your user id .
You might want to have autoplaying video on your laptop , and not on your phone .
That ’s reasonable .
So we store it to your user id AND your OS / browser .
So , right now , I ’ve got a record of 221915745 ( my userid ) and Mac / Chrome and Autoplay : OFF .
This is n’t obvious to users .
If I switch to another browser or another device , autoplay will default back to ON .
Or , if I switch to another user account ( we support up to five accounts at once on web ) , then you ’ll get the setting from the other account .
This might be unexpected , but it ’s also by design .
Ok , so for the sake of simplicity , let ’s say you have only one user account and only one device and only one browser .
What happens when you load the site ?
We will fetch the autoplay setting from the API and bake that into the HTML .
This is important - we need to know your data - saver settings immediately , and we do n’t want to slow down the site load with an extra API call .
When the site loads , we read that value from the HTML and inject it into the memory store ( redux ) .
This works fairly well , and if the API call on the server fails ( any API call should be expected to fail some percentage of the time , even if that percentage is really small ) , we can recover by calling the API again on the client .
Since we did n’t load with the right setting , we might have it wrong , but we ’ll recover almost immediately .
We also save the HTML to the cache in the serviceworker .
This lets you load the site quickly on a later visit , perhaps even when you ’re offline .
Some errors can appear here : if you change your setting , the HTML cache is n’t updated , so might reflect an old value on a future visit .
We cover this in a couple of ways : we cache specific versions of the HTML that either does n’t contain these values , or timestamps them , so that they ’re only valid for short periods .
We should talk about tabs .
If you ’ve got multiple Twitter tabs open , how do they synchronize settings ?
In truth , this gets a bit confusing .
Each tab has its own memory ( redux ) store .
The tabs will share serviceworkers and serviceworker caches , except when they ’re on different domains : we host on mobile .
twitter.com and twitter.com and the desktop browser is able to access both .
The server store ( via API ) will have a single value .
This can get weird .
You could enable autoplay in one tab , then switch to another tab where autoplay was still disabled , and toggle data - saver , which would then send the disabled autoplay setting back to the server !
So , the primary causes of real bugs are : cached values soon after changing the setting , and errors with the API ( ie , if the data - saver API is broken , nobody gets their setting and everybody gets the default ) .
I think it ’s interesting how a simple setting has a complicated implementation but still has common failure modes .
I think a possible solution might be to assume OFF in the cases where we know there ’s an API failure rather than simply not having a setting saved .
Perhaps we ’ll do that if we get more reports .

April 2020
Well this is weird
Well this is weird .
It 's April 20th .
I 've been working from home for about seven weeks now .
Jack 's been off school for five weeks .
The whole world is on lockdown , is social distancing , is staying at home , is wearing masks , is only doing essential trips , is only working essential jobs .
When the UK Prime Minister got it , that felt very movie - like .
The Queen made a public address .
The US president ... well ... he continues to be an arsehole .
Some things have n't changed .
We 're very lucky that we have n't been affected too badly .
There are very few cases in the local area ( to date , Walnut Creek has had 37 cases from a population of 65,816 ) , we have a large house that 's well equipped for kids to play around , and I 'm able to work from home in my little office .
The supermarkets have lines outside , or so I hear .
I have n't been .
Only Agnieszka shops .
Everyone talks about the supermarket staff and health workers , who are doing important but risky jobs .
This is true , but I also think about producers of consumables , of the transport infrastructure , and of the utilities .
It 's cool we have a well stocked freezer , but if the power is out for 24 hours , that 's all to waste .
I 've bought myself a big battery , but that only buys us a few hours .
When we 're able , we 're investing in solar .
I think about the little stores in town that are probably struggling .
The toy shop ?
The book shop ?
The ice cream shop ?
All little independent enterprises that will struggle .
We can still get all of those things from Amazon , but it would be sad to lose the places to go , when we 're once again allowed to go .
They talk of freeing up the restrictions .
They talk of cresting the wave .
But if you relax the restrictions that lowered the spread , what stops the spread from increasing again ?
It does n't get bored or anything .
The only way to get back to normality is to build herd immunity over time , or get the vaccine out there .
Both of these will be slow .
We wo n't be vacationing this year .
The uncertainty is unhelpful .
It 's not that we do n't know when things will open up again , but nobody has even given us the framework .
We need targets and intent .
We need to know that there is a plan .
But it seems there is no plan , just constant reaction .
We wake every morning .
Sometimes Agnieszka will head to the supermarket early .
I 'll help the boys get plugged into the television and make myself breakfast .
I 'll head up to work at 8 am or so , maybe later .
At 9.30 the boy will appear and we 'll try to do some maths .
He 's reluctant .
He hates writing in particular , but sometimes you 'll get him into a flow and he 'll enjoy it .
Those are good days .
He 's a huge distraction from my work , but it 's best if I work with him .
It would be unfair to expect Agnieszka to have both boys all day .
At 10 am he has a half - hour video session with his class on Zoom .
They do n't do much .
They tell jokes and endlessly relearn video etiquette .
Afterwards we return to the prescribed work , doing the bits we can handle or prefer .
Jack 's good at the maths if you can get him into it .
He needs to work on his spelling and writing .
At 12 we come down for lunch .
Agnieszka has made us burgers and bread .
Burgers are popular with both boys mostly .
I head back up to work .
At 1 pm Jack 's iPad unlocks and he can play games .
He lives for Roblox .
Before and after that he 'll chain - view YouTube videos of other people playing Roblox .
At some point in the afternoon I 'll take Jack out for a hike in the hills .
We 're lucky we can do that near here .
The views are spectacular , and the weather is mostly excellent .
If he 's not coming , I 'll run instead , pulling my t- shirt off as I hit the park and the sunshine .
It feels good to ( pretend to ) be free .
In the afternoon I can get a couple of hours of real work in .
I 'm avoiding more meetings than usual , because I 've got such little time available .
I 'm working on improving our smoke tests and developing the conversation tree view for web .
I 'm excited that we 're nearing experiment , and hope that we can launch soon .
At 5.30 or so , I 'll come downstairs .
There 'll be some drama with the boys .
We 'll try to have dinner together , though Max will refuse to eat much .
We 'll watch an episode of Red Dwarf .
We 'll cajole the boys into pyjamas , persuade them to brush their teeth , and nudge them to their rooms , repeatedly .
By 9 , Max will be asleep .
By 10.30 , so will Jack .
That 's not great but these are strange days .
We do what we can .
Some nights I 'll sit up with a beer and watch TV .
It 's not good , it just makes me more tired the next day .
But you need a few moments to yourself .
To be yourself and yet escape .
To enjoy a beer in peace .
Stress levels are high , and part of that is because we can't see the future .
When does this end ?
How does this end ?
What of our aging parents , now an impossible - to - reach five thousand miles away ?
For now , we 're all coping .
It 's not great , but it 's ok .

January 2020 2019 : What I did this year My annual review of the past year .
This year I tried to take a week off each quarter , rather than saving for a big trip like last year .
I kicked off the year with JSConf Hawai’i .
It was a bit weird going there without the kids , but also freeing to get a break .
I ran every day , twice a day , along Waikiki beach , which was hard work but glorious .
The days were long and packed with talks .
I was impressed with how much work must go into each one .
Maybe one day I ’ll be able to commit to that .
This year I decided to do resolutions per month .
In January , I tried Keto .
I liked it , I got thinner ( particularly because I do n’t really like eating fats ) and I liked being thinner .
I found myself oddly thirsty , all the time .
And I craved weird carbs like cereal , and those egg / bacon wraps they have at Dunkin Donuts .
The next month I tried wearing a watch every day .
I have n’t done this for years , so was n’t sure how it would go .
I got myself a self - winding watch , and on days when I do n’t move much , it stops .
It ’s the original Fitbit !
On the third month I was feeling exhausted so I tried not shaving .
I confirmed that I still look ridiculous when I do n’t shave .
By April I ’d run out of ideas that I had the energy to commit to .
In May , my brother Howard came to visit for the week .
I decided to take the week off too .
So we took Jack rafting on American River , which was amazing !
He got a bit cold and tired by the end of it , but did really well for a seven year old .
At one point , the boat captain pulled us over to the side and said , “ who wants to jump off that big rock ? ”
Jack not only volunteered , first , he just went and jumped into the freezing cold water without a moment of hesitation .
I was astonished and proud .
We also took Howard to see Hamilton .
I had taken Agnieszka to see it a few months before , and actually even took Jack and Granny Viola to see it a few months later .
It is so so good .
I spent the rest of the year playing the soundtrack through , over and over , on Spotify .
In summer , I took Jack to England .
We spent a couple of days in London to adjust to the time and meet with old friends .
We also took the chance to see the London Eye and London Dungeons .
Then we headed to Waldringfield and spent a glorious week living in a tent , eating outdoors , enduring thunderstorms , crab fishing off the beach , and sailing on the river .
We had one more day in torrential rain in London before heading home .
It was a really good trip , just me and Jack , so I think we ’ll do it again next year .
Shortly after our return , Agnieszka and I got our American citizenship !
For the first time , our little family all share a nationality ! 🎉
On a whim , I took the family to Legoland for thanksgiving .
Max in particular has been obsessed with Lego ( wegos ) recently , so I thought we ’d enjoy it .
It was indeed a good place , but we were unlucky with the weather .
Torrential rain .
And then , somehow , I hurt my shoulder really badly .
Last year I was pleased at doing my pushups and controlling my shoulder problems .
This year I switched to using dumbbells instead of doing push - ups and it got worse again .
I got xrays , which showed nothing , and started physio , which honestly did n’t make much difference .
And then thanksgiving in Legoland .
The pain was unbelievable , and it was almost impossible to lie down comfortably to sleep .
I got an MRI soon after , which shows a little tear , maybe .
We ’re doing a cortisone shot and then surgery if the shot does n’t help .
Bleah .
The pain faded after a few days but I could n’t move my arm above shoulder height for six weeks .
For Christmas we went to Hawaii , to the Disney resort .
For the first time , the kids really enjoyed meeting the characters and getting hugs and high - fives .
Jack liked the river and the slides , and Max loved the beach .
It was weird being away from home for Christmas .
At work , I celebrated my nine - year anniversary .
I switched teams for no particular reason , mostly just to keep working on a project I liked .
Next year I ’d like to do less myself and help others more .
I find that hard .

August 2019 Cookie banners
In the EU , there 's a requirement that users are warned about the cookies that a site uses .
It 's a bizarre quirk that resulted from well - meaning legislation that appeared before GDPR .
However , it suggests that users know what a cookie is and what it might be used for , which they absolutely do not .
And it 's oddly specific : I can register a serviceworker or use localStorage to store data and run code on the device , but for cookies I need a warning banner .
https://www.cookiebot.com/en/cookie-law/
Every website implements this banner differently , leading to a mix of different ways to pop up a banner over the content of whichever site you 're currently viewing .
There 's no prescribed way to handle this , so each site owner must solve it for themselves .
This leads to a lot of superstition about what the requirements actually are , especially for teams without formal legal advice , and especially for teams with formal legal teams ( because legal teams tend to hedge against the possibility of legal action rather than acting in the interests of the user ) .
What would be a better solution here ?
I notice that some sites ask me if they can send me push notifications , or whether they 're able to read my current location .
These prompts do n't need to be provided by the site owner - they 're built into the permission model of the browser .
_ Why is it different for cookies ? _
Indeed , at a basic level , it is the browser who stores cookies for the websites .
It is the browser attaching them to requests , reading them off the responses and managing cross -domain security .
A browser is the only actor that can prevent a cookie in an http response header from being saved , based on approval given in a prompt .
As I browse the internet in the EU , the vast majority of sites I see give me cookie notices .
However , some do not .
I would be interested to know if the browser vendor could be held legally responsible for not warning the users of these websites about the cookies that are issued .
That might prompt swift action from the browser vendors to implement a native prompt .
A native prompt could have other benefits : one might be able to set a setting to say " always accept " or " always reject " , or to artificially limit the lifetime of cookies across all sites .
I imagine that we could agree a means to provide the browser with a link to our cookie policy , and that the browser could display it without using cookies , before cookies are accepted by the user .
Perhaps this would be at a [ well - known ] ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785) url per site .
Cookies are essential for complex and useful websites .
Let 's ask the browsers to help us out .

Taking notes
There are different kinds of note - takers .
Some people record everything : every word .
They might or might not share them .
Others will write down important points or action items .
I tend to note down my own action items and let others fend for themselves .
Others take no notes .
Let 's say a waiter comes to your table to take orders .
If they take no notes , you 're happy , because they 're confident .
But you 're also uncomfortable .
Unless this is a very classy place , you _know_ there 's a mistake in there .
Lemonades will be forgotten ; steaks will be overcooked .
Waiters should be taking action items .
Let 's say you 're in a 1:1 at work with your direct manager .
They 're looking at you , but they 're typing every word you say .
Everything .
It 's not that they 're not listening - they _must_ be listening to every word .
But they 're distracted - they 're not _hearing_ you .
And the chances of a Slack ping popping up when they 're typing is 100 % .
They 'll just answer it and " what were you saying can you just repeat that ? "
Infuriating .
Managers should be present in the moment , taking important points , preferably to paper so that you can see them .
Both of these recommendations involve paper , but they do n't need to .
A waiter taking orders on a tablet can work fine .
A manager taking notes in a shared doc works really well , especially if you 're remote .
When I was a manager , I tried a mix of these methods .
I could n't keep up the conversation transcribing .
My touch - typing just is n't good enough , and the conversation misses the context of the day anyway , so they do n't even make good long term records .
I often took _no_ notes .
I enjoyed this - I could give my reports my full attention .
However , our 1:1s became very repetitive , neither of us made progress .
While I liked the idea of compiling a record of meetings at the end of the day , it simply never happened - I never found the time .
Sharing a single doc of basic bullet points seems to work .
Each meeting , make a new section at the top with the date .
Review your previous notes at the start of each new meeting .
Make new bullets .
This provides a useful shared track record , and gives to opportunity to build forward .
Actually , this would work pretty well for restaurants too .

August 2019 Identity and Endorsement _Verification_ is a feature common to Facebook , Twitter and several other social media networks .
The problem it was created to solve was to differentiate between Jan Smith the famous actor and Jan Smith , the absolute nobody who wants to build social capital off the reputation of Jan Smith .
Or indeed , to attempt to sully the social reputation of Jan Smith .
All the " real " Jan Smith needs to do is provide proof of identity and their username , and the networks will add a reassuring " tick " to let everyone know who is real and who is not .
Twitter is one of the few networks that still allows anonymous and parody accounts to be created , so I believe the risk of confusion and impersonation is greater .
As with basically every other feature ever , the problem is more complex than it first appears .
The " blue tick " is now seen as an endorsement .
This mixes the reputation of the network with the reputation of the verified user .
Additionally , since it appears to be an endorsement , and is of limited availability , the award of the blue tick is greatly prized .
There is always someone in my DMs asking if I can help them get verified ( I cannot ) .
Once a user has a blue tick confirming their identity , what does that mean ?
Can they then change their photo , their name , their username , their bio ?
And if they do , what does the tick mean ?
In a world of seven billion individuals , who gets to decide who the " real " Jan Smith is ?
How does Smith apply for verification ?
What if a Jan Smith has already been approved for verification ?
What if the individual lives in a place where they do not have a way to prove their identity ( a surprisingly common issue ) ?
Verification is a combination of ** identity ** ( proving that your name is what you say it is ) , and ** credibility ** ( showing which person with that name you are ) .
If I were to try to define such a system , I imagine I would try to build my qualification criteria off existing systems .
Perhaps I 'd leverage passports , government ids , and credit cards for identity .
And for a measure of credibility I 'd look to large reputable organisations like newspapers ( for journalists ) , sports teams , religious institutions , elected government officials , and so forth .
Beyond those , I 'd try to establish a measure of credibility in their field , based on mentions in the press , or wikipedia .
Without a measure of _credibility_ , we might be asked to verify every single " Jan Smith " , which would undermine our solution to the original problem : how do I find " my " Jan Smith ?
The trouble with mesuring credibility based on external factors is that we will accumulate all the biases of the original sources .
If men are more likely to get published in the press , and more likely to apply for verification , they 're doubly likely to be approved .
Have a think about how we could qualify the credibility of someone in their field .
Perhaps you would base it on the approvals of a given amount of other network users ?
Linked
In does that for " skills " .
But that factor could easily be abused ; you 'd need to account for that in your model .
And remember the seven billion people problem : we can't employ a private investigator for each and every applicant .
It 's a difficult problem .
In my opinion the best solution ( not my idea , widely discussed already ) , is to split the confusion of identity verification and endorsement of credibility .
Identity verification should be widely available , and networks could even tell us which method they used , eg " Facebook has seen copy of US Drivers License " .
Endorsement of credibility should still be left to others .
Allow people to link to official websites and crawl those websites for usernames to be verified .
When approved , add the website to the user 's profile .
This means the networks need only vet official websites for validity .
Obviously this is still not trivial , but might be more managable .
This takes time and resources , both of which are carefully managed at any social network , regardless of size .
I do n't expect to see it fixed soon .
One final problem to consider appeared last year .
My friend contacted me on behalf of [ @dog_rates ] ( https://twitter.com/dog_rates), asking if I could help with verification ( I could n't ) .
There were plenty of impersonating accounts , so I can see why it makes sense .
But how do you verify a user without an identity ?

August 2019 Losing control Twitter added a new control to the home timeline recently : " latest tweets " .
It 's a toggle that let 's you switch between " Home " ( ranked or algorithmic timeline ) and " Latest " ( reverse - chronological list ) .
The algorithmic timeline has always been controversial , both inside the company and out .
To account for that , it was rigorously tested over months and months .
The results are unequivocal : our users like more tweets , read more tweets , and use Twitter more , when they have the ranked timeline .
For new users who have subscribed to a few spammy accounts ( for example , news ) , the ranked timeline reduces the effect of the overactive accounts , letting the quieter accounts show through .
For power users , the ranked timeline helps cut through the many accounts you follow to see the more valuable tweets , surface new accounts to follow , and conversations you 're interested in .
If the ranked timeline is better for everyone , why is it controversial ?
Why can it be so unpopular ?
It 's a long - standing issue at Twitter that we do n't really know what the magic is .
We know why people use Uber : they need to get from A to B .
Why do people use Twitter ?
A whole bunch of reasons .
Why does it succeed where others did not ?
Unclear .
One of the most successful initiatives in recent years has been defining the role of Twitter : to provide news .
This does n't mean that we 're dismissing other uses , simply that we can focus on optimising for news .
One thing that distinguishes Twitter from news tv , from newspapers , from Facebook , from Google , is the ability to choose who you follow and control your experience .
You know why you 're seeing the tweets on the screen : you chose to follow those accounts .
For the ranked timeline , this is no longer true .
You 've lost control over the experience .
And with that , you 've lost _ownership_ in the product .
Previously you were free to make the Twitter experience your own .
Now , someone else is changing that .
It does n't matter if the tweets are better or not , the feeling of ownership is lost .
Was that part of the magic ?
Is that why Twitter added a toggle for " latest " ?
Actually no .
We added it to recognise that sometimes you are following a live sporting event and need the tweets to be in chronological order .
That 's why the toggle resets after a few hours ; when the event is over .
Twitter is n't alone in pushing a feature that claims to know what you want better than you do .
Apple famously design their hardware and software without user research .
They hire experts and want to solve the issues users have n't thought about yet , not the issues users are talking about ( which tend to be top - of - mind ) .
The removal of headphone jacks , or the keyboard , or the touchbar , are classic examples .
Facebook 's News Feed has been ranked for a long time , which has led to accusations of intentional ( or unintentional ) political ( and emotional ) manipulation of its users .
Apple and Facebook are some of the most successful companies in the world , suggesting that taking control away from users does not hurt the bottom line .
It 'll be interesting to see if this continues to be a winning formula , or whether new competitors offering to return a sense of ownership in the product will win through .

August 2019 Shipping
After months and maybe years of stress , meeting , late nights , bug reports , dogfooding , requirements changes , dependency changes , management changes , user testing and actual coding , you 're ready to ship your significant rebuild .
What happens next ?
There 's often some kind of anti-climax at the launch .
If your site has existing traffic , you can't just flip a switch .
You need a/b testing , holdbacks , gradual rollouts , comms .
It can take a lot longer than expected .
With an established software development team , you 've probably pivoted the whole team away from the day - to - day mission , to focus on this rebuild .
Managers will be familiar with [ Tuckman 's stages of team development ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development): forming , storming , norming and performing .
With any luck you 'll be a fast efficient team in the performing stage of the project .
Indeed , the smaller tasks near the end , where the team are very familiar with the code ( because they 've just written it ) , can feel the most productive .
Your team has been focussed on a mission .
The mission was the project , and the project is nearing completion .
But what is a team ?
It 's a group of people with a mission .
Without a mission , there 's no team .
In 1977 , Tuckman added a fifth phase " adjourning " to the model , recognising the end of the team , and to allow for a cyclic process for teams .
What might that phase look like ?
** Folks will leave .**
Either the company or the team .
It 's likely many have stayed to complete the project anyway , and you 'll have seen unusually low attrition for the last third of the project .
That will catch up .
** External stakeholders will come knocking .**
It 's likely that you had to freeze some features or push back on requirements for the duration of your project .
Those external partners will be expecting more attention , likely before you 've even shipped .
A human aspect is that they felt left out of your project launch and expect compensation .
** Management will reorg .**
Rather than leave the high - performing team alone , senior management often sees this as an opportunity for a reorg .
Like the external partners , they 've seen slow responses to requests and received pushback on their requirements because of the long project .
Perhaps your team has been left out of previous reorgs to keep the project on track .
Senior management will be looking to normalize the team with the rest of the company , possibly simply by disbanding it .
From the point of view of the team , all of this can be stressful .
The team likely has a significant backlog of technical debt which was taken on to achieve the deadline , there 'll be an accumulation of key knowledge in the team which should be codified , there 'll be bugs to address , there 'll be cleanup tasks for the previous systems , especially if they 're still running in parallel .
With the team 's future in question , it can be hard for the team to focus , especially when they believe they should still be celebrating the launch .
To make this easier , I have some ideas :
Get closure - Celebrate the launch .
- Look for signs of burnout and manage it .
Let folks take extended vacations and reassure them that they 'll be welcomed back .
-
Be honest about the end of the project and how you plan to address the wrap - up work .
You should have that work fully scoped before you launch .
Do n't make it a six - month documentation sprint .
Prepare the next phase - Compensate the team .
_ You now have the most skilled team in the current codebase that there will likely ever be ._
Increase salaries rather than giving spot bonuses .
It 'll be more clear that they 're valued after the project rather than being compensated for work done .
-
Be honest with your manager if you 're considering leaving the company .
It gives them a chance to either offer you more opportunities , or at least to manage the transition early .
Start the next phase - Consider a new mission but be careful how you discuss it - allow the team the time to enjoy the launch but let them know there will be meaningful work afterwards .
- Consider the team at the forming stage again .
New processes need to be established .
Stakeholders should be reviewed and reconnected .
The acknowledgement of the " adjourning " phase allows the group to respect the end of things the way they were , and to move onto the next project .

August 2019 Removing cookies Cookies are hard to manage .
As you 'll know , the cookie API is ... _[ infelicitous ] ( https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6265)_.
You can set a cookie like so : ``` > document.cookie= 'name=value ; Path=/ ; Domain=kenneth.kufluk.com ; Max - Age=1 ' ; ```
When a cookie is set by the server , it uses a similar format , in the " set - cookie " header of the response .
Reading the cookie back just gives you the serialized name / value pairs : ``` > document.cookie ; < " name=value ; another=value " ```
When the cookies are sent to the server in the request they 're also just the name / value pairs .
What this means is that the full metadata of a cookie is never available , to the client or the server , except when it is set .
If you want to delete all the cookies for your website , this is tricky .
You can delete a cookie by providing a new cookie if the same name with an expiry date in the past .
However , cookies are partitioned by domain and path .
If those are n't set appropriately on the deletion , you wo n't clear the right cookie .
( There is a new header " [ Clear - Site - Data ] ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Clear-Site-Data) " if you want a nuclear option , which will instruct supporting browsers to remove all cookies . )
Given that we need to set a cookie to delete a cookie , we will need to know the name , domain , path and other meta data of the cookies to be able to delete them .
We only know the names of cookies on the current page ( ie , based on the current path and domain ) , and the path / domain / meta info for those cookies is not available .
In other words , it 's important to issue your cookies appropriately in the first place .
** Always set the Path to root (/) **
** Always set the Domain **
If our cookies can expire within a reasonable timeframe then there 's little need for deletion .
A common solution is to use session cookies .
If you do n't specify an expiry or a max - age when setting a cookie , it 's set to the " session " and is deleted when the browser window is closed .
In an old browser context where we had one site per window , this made sense .
However , modern browsers are able to preserve and restore pages , windows and tabs even after a reboot .
The session cookies are no longer short - length , they 're indefinite length .
During a recent survey of cookies at Twitter , we observed session cookies in requests that we had n't issued for _three years_ . >
There are two different kinds of cookies often called " session cookies " , > which can be confusing .
I 'm using it here to mean a non-persistent cookie > that should be removed at the end of a " session " .
It is often also used > to describe a cookie that contains a serialized set of values .
** Always set the Expires or Max - Age header ** ( _max - age is not supported by older browsers , so expires is still prefered_ )
Given that we now have cookies with are properly issued with expiry dates , we should question what a reasonable expiry time would be .
Let 's consider a couple of examples .
We show a tooltip pointing to a new feature of the site .
When a user has dismissed that tooltip , we issue a cookie so that the user does n't have to see it again .
We do n't ever want the user to lose that cookie , so we set the expiry time to " infinite " , which our cookie library helpfully sets to the year 9999 .
In other words , eight thousand years from now . >
Every cookie you set with be attached to every request .
While small , > these bytes can add up over time , and can cause issues .
We call > this _request bloat_ .
An issue we see at Twitter is when the cookie > size , combined with other headers , exceeds the limit of our http > framework .
These requests are immediately rejected with a status 431 , > which is bad for users , because they wo n't know why the request failed > and wo n't be able to submit a similar request until they clear out some > cookies .
Another example is your login .
When you log in , we issue a cookie representing your credentials .
The cookie allows you to make subsequent requests as that user .
We set that cookie for a month .
Let 's consider those expiries against expectations of a user .
If you take a vacation for a month , then reopen your laptop , would you expect either of those cookies to disappear ?
Probably not .
Are you likely to be on vacation for 8000 years ?
Probably not .
I think we could set realistic grounded values here , based on common sense .
If you leave your computer for more than three months , it would n't be too much of a hassle to log in again .
If you saw an educational tooltip 18 months after you first saw it , that might n't be too annoying ( assuming the code is still in the site ) .
However , cookie expiries do n't work that way for the login cookie .
It 's not measuring the time since the cookie was last used , it 's measuring the time since the cookie was issued .
The best solution here is to keep a rotating value managed by the server .
Store the login cookie value in a table on the server .
If it 's seen and it's more than 30 days old , issue a new one .
If it 's seen and it's more than 90 days old , consider it expired .
By checking the expiry on the server not the client , we can set the cookie expiry to anything reasonable over 90 days .
** Consider 18 months a maximum lifetime for your cookie **
** Manage login expiries on the server side ** ** Refresh / reset cookies that you want to keep longer **
If your site has lost its login cookie , it might find itself in a bad state .
Maybe you have cached content in the serviceworker , in other cookies , in localStorage , in indexedDB .
In this case , we have historically cleaned up the user storage as if they had been logged out , but we found this caused problems for users , where they were unexpectedly cleaned up .
It turns out that some privacy - protection browser extensions can strip cookies from the first request .
A common example is Privacy Badger , which strips the cookies from the page requests [ if the page is served by the serviceworker ] ( https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=946908).
As these extensions are common , the developer should guard against them by checking login via XHR and either refreshing the page , or popping a dialog asking for advice .
Since cookies are a distributed store of data that is hard to read from and manage , it 's important to be careful about which cookies you issue and when , and try to limit those cookies as much as possible .
Storage such as localStorage should be used in preference , where possible .

Many of the issues mentioned here have been fixed .
2005 - 11-29
This is an overview of differences between Debian and Red Hat , from a system administrator 's point of view .
I 've used both quite a bit , on both servers and desktops , and have often been asked why I prefer Debian .
This article details the reasons for my preference .
Package Set Quantity lot of packages .
The only Linux distro which can compete on these grounds , at all , is Gentoo .
Let me give some details .
On my debian desktop , I asked APT for some stats about its database ( apt - cache stats ) .
It claims to know of 23533 packages , including 28382 distinct versions .
The
For comparison , I asked CentOS 3 for roughly the same information : yum list displays just 680 packages .
On another Red Hat - based system , it claims to provide 1199 packages .
CentOS 4.1 has 1406 ( or 1538 with the " plus " and " extras " enabled ) , which is just 6 % to 6.5 % the size of debian .
And on the newest fedora , it may even have as many as 2000 .
But that 's a far , far cry from 23000 + .
Over 90 % of the packages are missing !
Why does this matter ?
Most distros carry most of the really important or popular packages , right ?
They all have the kernel , X11 , apache , openoffice , bind , and pretty much all the other major programs .
But many people will end up wanting at least one or two " obscure " packages .
Here are a few of the packages I use which you wo n't find in the latest Ardour : professional sound editor .
Sweep : DJ 's sound editor .
CheeseTracker : music composer .
PovRay : 3D render .
MPlayer : audio / video player and swiss - army multimedia tool .
VLC : audio / video player ( VideoLan Client ) .
Video file manipulation tools : mkvtoolnix , ogmtools .
MP3 players : madplay , mpg321 , mpg123 .
Other audio - format players : xmp , festalon , etc .
Games and game emulators : Abuse , Pingus , FCEU , Zsnes , SNES9x , xdemineur , Frozen Bubble , Armagetron , GL - Tron , etc ...
( X) MAME , the arcade machine emulator .
JsCalibrator , for calibrating joysticks .
XKBD , an onscreen keyboard for tablet / PDA input .
BitchX , popular IRC client .
DircProxy , the detachable IRC proxy .
PyGame and Python - OpenGL : SDL and OpenGL support for Python .
Xaos , the fast fractal zoomer .
The Enlightentment desktop , and friends ( Eterm , etc ) .
Window managers in general : sawfish , FVWM , IceWM , pwm , ratpoison , Matchbox , ...
Exiftran , for automatically processing your digital camera photos .
BitTorrent , BitTornado , etc .
Alien , for converting and installing packages from other distros .
Checkinstall , for auto - packaging from source .
FakeRoot , for safely building packages as a regular user .
PwGen , the password generator .
A dictionary .
( dict - gcide , dict-wn )
A thesaurus .
( dict- moby - thesaurus )
QEMU , the fast computer emulator .
DOSEMU ; DOS emulator .
x11vnc , for making the current desktop available over the network .
TightVNC viewers / server ; a more efficient remote desktop solution .
x2x , which allows the user to control multiple computers with one keyboard / mouse .
xzoom , which enlarges portions of the screen .
Intelligent auto - DJ for XMMS ( gjay ) , visualizer plugin ( goom ) , or even the basic XMMS package .
Ability to record the output of audio programs ( vsound ) .
SmokePing ; monitors network response times .
EtterCap ; gives detailed network traffic analysis .
ModLogAn , for summarizing Apache ( and other ) log files .
WebMin , the popular web - based administration suite .
PhpMyAdmin , a powerful web - based front end to MySQL .
GDesklets , providing useful and pretty desktop widgets .
RadeonTool , NVidia Source , and other accelerated video support packages .
Courier , the easy and fast IMAP / POP / SMTP server .
... and many others .
These are just a few of the packages which I personally use ; other users will have a totally different set of missing packages .
Looking again , at the Debian has a lot of packages .
Let me say that again .
Debian has aof packages .
The only Linux distro which can compete on these grounds , at all , is Gentoo .
Let me give some details .
On my debian desktop , I asked APT for some stats about its database ( ) .
It claims to know of 23533 packages , including 28382 distinct versions .
The debian project only claims a modest 15490 packages , but that 's a low estimate .
For comparison , I asked CentOS 3 for roughly the same information : displays just 680 packages .
On another Red Hat - based system , it claims to provide 1199 packages .
CentOS 4.1 has 1406 ( or 1538 with the " plus " and " extras " enabled ) , which is just 6 % to 6.5 % the size of debian .

But many people will end up wanting at least one or two " obscure " packages .
Here are a few of the packages I use which you wo n't find in the latest fedora core ( 4 ) These are just a few of the packages which I personally use ; other users will have a totally different set of missing packages .
Looking again , at the extras repository , I managed to find XMMS and BitTorrent .
But the rest are all missing .
And I was looking for packages which , for the most part , are well - known , popular , and interesting to a large audience .
Chances are that you wo n't find everything you 're looking for in a Red Hat - based distro .
Quality Debian has over a thousand package maintainers .
I hear it may be nearly two thousand by now , though I do n't know the exact number .
That means each maintainer is responsible for anywhere from 8 to 24 packages , on average .
The packages are maintained by people who care about the specific software they provide , and usually are experts on what they package .
In many cases , the maintainers make significant improvements from the upstream versions , which usually find their way back to the author eventually .
Red
Hat systems usually have a much smaller package team -- anywhere from one person to a few dozen .
Each maintainer is responsible , on average , for anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred packages .
Many Red Hat - based distros simply recompile the SRPMs every six months when Red Hat makes a new release , without really checking the package quality at all -- even to see if the packages are broken .
This all tends to result in lower overall package quality .
( sometimes even Red Hat does n't check whether its packages work ... for example , the broken gcc in RH7.0 )
It 's also worth mentioning the packaging guidelines in Debian .
Packages must meet certain criteria , which creates a high degree of consistency .
I wo n't get into detail just now , but for example , you can find documentation on any package by looking in /usr / share / doc / package - name .
Feeds vs Releases
Instead of asking yourself " when do I want to schedule a massive upgrade ? " , Debian lets you simply decide easier things like " how cutting - edge do I want to be ? " and " do I feel like upgrading Bind today ? " .
Upgrade Patterns
Let me put it a different way ...
Red
Hat uses a " stair step " upgrade pattern , and Debian uses a " smooth slope " pattern .
Here are some diagrams to show what I mean .
The Red Hat upgrade pattern is much like a flight of stairs or series of cliffs .
Each step , six months apart , brings major upgrades , but there is little activity between releases .
Many people opt to skip entire release cycles , to avoid the hassle of having to reinstall everything , and end up pretty far behind .
The Debian testing and / or unstable ( see below ) upgrade pattern is a fairly smooth curve , with new packages coming out daily .
Users may upgrade whenever they like , as much or as little as desired , and in a smooth manner which avoids the need to perform traumatic rebuilds or reinstalls .
The two graphs combined reflect some other details .
Both distros are always just a little behind the upstream developers , since it takes time to package and test new software .
Red
Hat tends to be a little bit newer when a new Fedora release comes out , but Debian is usually more up - to - date the rest of the time .
By using a smooth upgrade process , you never have to take the Red Hat " leap of faith " where you upgrade everything all at once ( or rebuild / reinstall ) , and hope everything still works afterward .
This translates into serious cost savings because it avoids the need to rebuild servers every year .
Just update small pieces now and then whenever it 's appropriate to do so , and the server will keep running indefinitely .
You can generally even do complete hardware upgrades without having to reinstall the software .
Just move the old hard drive into the new machine , or copy its contents verbatim , and you 're done .
Software is a continuously - evolving field ; a moving target , as it were .
Software is released or updated every day , and Debian reflects this by releasing new and updated packages daily .
You do n't have to wait 6 months until the next release , so you can upgrade whenever you want to .

Stable , Testing , Unstable unstable , testing , and stable .
There is also an additional feed called experimental , for the truly adventurous .
The stable feed is very similar to a release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
It 's rock - solid , and maintained with security updates for quite some time after it 's released .
However , stable is not released very often , and uses a stair - step upgrade pattern .

It 's nearly as up - to - date as unstable most of the time , but much safer .

If , for some reason , there 's a brand - new piece of software you absolutely must have , and it's not in unstable yet , you can use the experimental feed .
This is almost never necessary , though .
You do n't have to choose just one .
APT will let you combine packages from any or all feeds , including 3rd - party feeds , in any way you like .
Personally , I use stable and testing on all my systems , and make unstable and experimental available only by explicit request ( a.k.a. " apt- pinning " ) .
I also have a few 3rd - party feeds set up for the rare packages here and there which are n't actually in Debian yet .
Feeds also offer the ability to choose just how safe or bleeding - edge you want to be .
Packages filter through three different feeds , called , and .

I have n't reinstalled the OS on my desktop computer since 1997 , when I first installed Debian .
And yes , it 's still up to date -- running a kernel which is , as I write this , 34 days old , plus the latest versions of nearly everything else : X11 , Firefox , GIMP , Apache , and so on .
Instead of asking yourself " when do I want to schedule a massive upgrade ? " , Debian lets you simply decide easier things like " how cutting - edge do I want to be ? " and " do I feel like upgrading Bind today ? " .
Package Manager Package Configuration
This provides a few benefits :
The user does n't have to learn dozens of different configuration tools and file formats , and the quirks of each .
Preferences chosen in the menus can be automatically applied to updates , even if the underlying config format changes .
This means you do n't have to answer the same questions over and over , and do n't have to care if the config file changes to a different language .
Unimportant settings can be skipped automatically , so the novice user ( or busy user ) does n't have to care about them .
Every package uses the same user - friendly interface for configuration .
( well , many packages , anyway ) Debian incorporates configuration into the package - installation process .
Red
Hat decided that automatic , hands - free installation was preferable .
Which one is really better is debatable , but I find the configuration step in Debian to be a useful and valuable idea .
Many packages provide a simple , modular , easy , menu - driven configurator -- built right into the package .
So , during the install , it asks you questions about anything it thinks is " important enough " to be worth asking .
( you can set a preference for the level of importance beforehand )
And if you change your mind later , you can " dpkg- reconfigure mypackage " to change the settings .
This provides a few benefits :
Config File Handling use your version ( but keep a copy of the new version if you need it )
use the new default version ( but keep a copy of your custom version )
see how the two versions are different
manually resolve the differences
It wo n't clobber your changes during an upgrade , but it also wo n't blindly encourage you to use outdated configuration .
Debian keeps track of which files are configuration and which are simply data or executables .
The upshot of this is how it handles upgrades .
It can automatically upgrade config files you have n't touched , but will detect when you have changed something and ask you how to handle it .
Any time a custom configuration is detected , you get the following choices :
It wo n't clobber your changes during an upgrade , but it also wo n't blindly encourage you to use outdated configuration .
Overall Maturity The Fedora project shows a lot of potential .
It 's a step in the right direction for Red Hat .
In many ways , it 's a partial clone of Debian .
But it 's not very mature yet .
Debian has been around , running itself via its fully - democratic self - government , since the early days of Linux -- and it has become a very stable and mature system .
Similarly , APT has been working rather well for nearly a decade .
OTOH , Red Hat 's package manager ( Yum ) is still a rather new and unsophisticated project .
The latest
Yum still has n't caught up to where apt was 5 years ago .
Speed I can't say I 'm completely happy with the speed APT runs at .
But I can say that it 's much faster than Yum .
And by " much " , I mean anywhere from 50 to 500 times faster .
I did some basic tests for things like listing the number of packages , searching for a keyword , and deciding what upgrades are available ... and apt gave me results in a matter of 0 to 3 seconds , while yum took about 30 to 90 seconds for the same operations , on a machine with much faster hardware .
Part of this is because
Yum insists on doing the equivalent of " apt - get update " before every operation .
And yes , I tried the command line option to disable that .
It did n't make any difference -- apparently that option is still broken .
But Yum is also generally just slower , taking over a minute ( after the package list update ) to complete operations which took apt just a couple seconds .
I also found that the output of apt made me faster .
It prints results in a much more concise , readable form than Yum .
And APT 's ability to answer questions in just a second or two really helps me work with the system rather than fighting against it .
Update 2006 - 03 - 21 : Fedora Core 5 was just released , and I hear that yum has gotten significantly faster .
It now takes only 7 - 14 seconds to run things such as " yum info glibc " .
The same operation in Debian , " apt - cache show libc6 " , takes 0.01s on my aging desktop system .
APT in this case is still ~ 1000 times faster , but 7 - 14 seconds really is n't bad .
However , the new graphical package manager in FC5 is apparently very slow .
It took 45 minutes to load the dependencies on a Pentium 4 , compared to 5 - 6 seconds to do the same thing in Synaptic on Ubuntu on a Pentium 3 . ( that 's even worse , considering that FC5 has only 2200 ( +2200 extras ) packages , or about 20 % as many as what " apt - cache stats " lists on Ubuntu )
By my rough estimations , the FC5 package GUI takes 4500 times longer to start than Ubuntu 's package GUI ( 450 times as long * 5X fewer packages * 2X faster CPU ) .
Custom Distros
The answer , I think , is that Debian is designed to make derivative products easy to make .
It 's currently the most suitable base for custom distros .
It has a relatively tiny base system , an extremely flexible design , and all its distro - building tools are freely available .
All the processes for building Debian are a matter of public knowledge , with most of the communication also executed in public channels .
In short , Debian applies the open source philosophy to building a distro .
It takes a lot of time and effort to make a Linux distribution .
Making one from scratch requires ungodly amounts of time and effort , unless you 're making a very small distro .
According to a
To be fair , the Debian developers did n't write most of that code .
They merely organize , clean , patch , package , and distribute it ... and write code to make the system work better .
However , managing a repository of practically all free software in the world is no easy task .
It takes nearly 2000 people to keep Debian up - to - date .
This is why Fedora has less than 10 % as many packages as Debian -- Fedora simply does not have enough package maintainers to compete .
Looking briefly at DistroWatch , I notice that five of the top ten distros are based on Debian .
Two or three are based on Red Hat ( depending on whether SuSE counts ) , and the remaining two are Slackware and Gentoo .
Why are so many successful distros based on debian ?

According to a recent study , Debian 3.1 ( " Sarge " ) consists of about 230 million source lines of code , with an estimated 60,000 person - years and $ 8 billion USD redevelopment cost .
This makes it , by a wide margin , the single largest software project ever created .

Other , misc rc.local , which seems like a bad idea .
It uses somewhat Debian - like ifup and ifdown commands to manage network interfaces , but the workings of those commands are lacking .
The configuration , in particular , is overcomplicated for no reason .
Red
Hat still does n't have its SysVInit scripts in the standard location , though it at least has symlinks to them in the right spot .
Packages are named inconsistently , or in an overly generic manner -- for example , " named " and " httpd " instead of " bind9 " and " apache2 " .
What if you wanted some other server , like nsd or boa ?
Debian provides generic packages too , but only for convenience .
They merely depend on the real package -- the equivalent of symlinks , except for packages .
Kudzu .
Yuck .
Servers should not fail to boot because the mouse is unplugged .
( I hear this behavior is fixed now , as of late 2005 . )
Package ( file ) names ...
Debian uses name_version_arch.ext , which is simple , consistent , and easy to parse .
Red Hat 's names are ambiguous -- they use dashes both in the package name and to separate the name from the version .
This problem is complicated because some packages include a version in their names , and then have an additional version after an ambiguous dash .
Custom kernels , especially in RHEL ...
The special patches applied tend to break things .
For example , a "
Another break - the - kernel patch introduced serious scheduling bugs into the Red Hat kernel around v2.4.20 : a waiting process would sometimes not be scheduled to run for exceptionally long periods of time .
This causes all sorts of problems , like causing heartbeat to think it 's dead and take down the machine it 's running on -- the opposite of what high - availability software is supposed to do .
Dependencies
In Red Hat , it 's standard practice to use file dependencies in addition to ( or sometimes instead of ) regular package dependencies .
The only practical benefit of this that I have been able to find is it slightly eases the creation of cross - distro packages .
Three different Red Hat - based distros may have three different names for a package .
So , if you want to create your own RPM which works on all three , it 's easier to check for a file you know that other package has than to check for the name of the package .
Coming from a debian background , the idea of cross - distro packages seems rather odd to me .
But 3rd - party packages are a necessity in the Red Hat world , since the main package set is so tiny .
Red
Hat simply does not provide enough packages to make up a complete system .
And there are so many different flavors of Red Hat that it would be infeasible for 3rd - party package authors to make different packages for each flavor .
So , people use file dependencies .
It may defeat the point of having a package namespace , but it is an effective kludge to work around the lack of standards between related distros .
And having semi - broken software is arguably better than having no software at all .
Otherwise , file dependencies just cause problems .
Many little details about Red Hat systems bother me .
Many of these seem to be half - cloned features from other OSes or distros , not implemented as well as the original .
I already mentioned Yum compared to APT , but there are other similar examples .

The special patches applied tend to break things .
For example , a " feature " which introduces resource starvation into the kernel ... on purpose .
Because someone at Red Hat thought they knew better than the Linux community .
The end result is that the RHEL kernel does weird things like kill init instead of dumping old cached data when it needs more memory .
Another break - the - kernel patch introduced serious scheduling bugs into the Red Hat kernel around v2.4.20 : a waiting process would sometimes not be scheduled to run for exceptionally long periods of time .

Gentoo Just a quick note or two about Gentoo ...
Debian has a lot in common with Gentoo .
Both have similar advantages in terms of available packages , upgrade mechanisms , and general choice .
If anything , Gentoo offers even more choice than Debian , or perhaps inflicts more choice .
And that 's a good thing , if you know what you 're doing .
But I would n't recommend it for anyone who is n't very technical or detail - oriented .
Gentoo also has some drawbacks , compared to debian .
The main drawback is compiling ... especially on older or slower machines .
It can take a week to get a full Gentoo desktop system built .
It may run a bit faster afterward , but the extra speed costs time .
If you 've got the time , and especially if you 've got an affinity for the bleeding edge , Gentoo is a great distro .
For most people though , a Debian - based distro like Ubuntu is probably a better idea .
Many of the issues mentioned here have been fixed .
This is an overview of differences between Debian and Red Hat , from a system administrator 's point of view .
I 've used both quite a bit , on both servers and desktops , and have often been asked why I prefer Debian .
This article details the reasons for my preference .
[ Update 5/17 : Thank you for the many interesting comments !
Please see my follow - up posted today . ]
In a professional basketball game , a player is disqualified ( “ fouls out ” ) if he is charged with 6 personal fouls .
Observers of the NBA know that the direct effect of fouling out actually has less impact than the indirect effect of “ foul trouble . ”
That is , if a player has a dangerous number of fouls , the coach will voluntarily bench him for part of the game , to lessen the chance of fouling out .
Coaches seem to roughly use the rule of thumb that a player with n fouls should sit until n/6 of the game has passed .
Allowing a player to play with 3 fouls in the first half is a particular taboo .
On rare occasions when this taboo is broken , the announcers will invariably say something like , “ They ’re taking a big risk here ; you really do n’t want him to get his 4th . ”
Is the rule of thumb reasonable ?
No !
First let ’s consider a simple baseline model : Suppose I simply want to maximize the number of minutes my star player is in the game .
When should I risk putting him back in the game after his nth foul ?
It ’s a trick question : I should n’t bench him at all !
Those of you who have n’t been brainwashed by the conventional wisdom on “ foul trouble ” probably find this obvious .
The proof is simple : if he sits , the only thing that has changed when he gets back in is that there is less time left in the game , so his expected minutes have clearly gone down .
In fact , the new distribution on minutes is first - order stochastically dominated , being just a truncation of the alternative .
This assumes only that his likelihood of getting a foul is time - invariant , which seems reasonable .
OK , while I believe the above argument is very relevant , it oversimplified the objective function , which in practice is not simply to maximize minutes .
I ’ll discuss caveats now , but please note , there is tremendous value in understanding the baseline case .
It teaches that we should pay attention to foul trouble only insofar as our objective is not to maximize minutes .
I am very comfortable asserting that coaches do n’t understand this !
First caveat : players are more effective when rested .
In fact , top stars normally play about 40 of 48 minutes .
If it becomes likely that a player will be limited to 30 - 35 minutes by fouling out , we may be better off loading those minutes further towards the end of the game to maximize his efficiency .
Notice , though , that this does n’t lead to anything resembling the n/6 rule of thumb .
It says we should put him back in , at the very latest , when he is fully rested , and this is n’t close to what is done in practice .
In fact players often sit so long the rest may have a negative impact , putting them “ out of the flow of the game . ”
Second caveat : maybe not all minutes are created equal .
It may be particularly important to have star players available at the end of the game .
On a practical level , the final minute certainly has more possessions than a typical minute , but it also has more fouls , so maybe those effects cancel out .
I think the primary issue is more psychological : there is a strong perception that you need to lean more on your superstars at the end of the game .
I think this issue is drastically overrated , partly because it ’s easy to remember losing in the last minute when a key player has fouled out , but a more silent poison when you lose because you were down going into that minute having rested him too long .
By the way , my subjective sense is that the last possession is more similar to any other than conventional wisdom suggests : a wide - open John Paxson or Steve Kerr is a better bet than a double - teamed Michael Jordan any time in the game .
On a couple of major occasions , Jordan agreed .
This is n’t to underestimate the star ’s importance in scoring and getting other players good shots , just to say that this is not necessarily more important in the final minutes .
You do often hear that a team will rise to the occasion when a star is injured or suspended , so even conventional wisdom wavers here .
Finally , note that the foul - trouble rule of thumb is applied also to players who are n’t the primary scorer , so that this argument would n’t seem to apply .
I will give coaches a little credit : they do sometimes seem to realize that they should n’t worry about foul trouble for bench players who often do n’t play at the end anyway .
One more psychological caveat : a player who just picked up a foul he thinks is unfair may be distracted and not have his head in the game immediately afterward .
This may warrant a brief rest .
Final note : Conventional wisdom seems to regard foul management as a risk vs. safety decision .
You will constantly hear something like , “ a big decision here , whether to risk putting Duncan back in with 4 fouls . ”
This is completely the wrong lens for the problem , since the “ risky ” * strategy is , with the caveats mentioned , all upside !
Coaches dramatically underrate the “ risk ” of falling behind , or losing a lead , by sitting a star for too long .
To make it as stark as possible , observe that the coach is voluntarily imposing the penalty that he is trying to avoid , namely his player being taken out of the game !
The most egregious cases are when a player sits even though his team is significantly behind .
I almost feel as though the coach prefers the certainty of losing to the “ risk ” of the player fouling out .
There may be a “ control fallacy ” here : it just feels worse for the coach to have a player disqualified than to voluntarily bench him , even if the result is the same .
Also , there is a bit of an agency / perception problem : the coach is trying to maximize keeping his job as well as winning , which makes him lean towards orthodoxy .
There are well - documented cases in the last decade of sports moving towards a more quantitative approach , so maybe there is hope for basketball strategy to change .
The foul - trouble orthodoxy is deeply ingrained , and it would be a satisfying blow for rationality to see it overturned .
* Final outcomes are binary , so the classical sense of risk aversion , involving a concave utility function in money , does n’t apply at all .
But there is also a sense of what I call “ tactical risk ” : a decision may affect the variance of some variable on which your probability of final success depends in a convex ( or concave ) way .
I might write an essay sometime on the different meanings of “ risk . ”
Anyway , here you presumably should be risk - averse in your star ’s minutes if ahead , risk - loving if behind .
But this is rendered utterly moot by first - order stochastic dominance !
One thing I really liked about Windows 7 was its excellent terminal - server - facilities .
I could detach a running local session and reattach it again remotely .
I could even tunnel it through ssh with ordinary ssh-x - forwarding by installing rdesktop on cygwin .
It supported changing the size of the desktop and logging in without being visible on the physical screen .
X11 under Linux never worked that good , let alone Mac OS X , which is sort of the worst of all , with the worst VNC - Implementation I know so far .
Something none of the solutions knew were suspendable rootless GUIs .
I dont know for how long I wished there was something like screen for X11 - Applications .
Well , there it is : Xpra .
It is a surprisingly small set of software , written in python , and though well done .
The installation procedure is unusual but well documented , and for Arch Linux , there is an AUR - Package , which is why I love Arch Linux so much more than Debian – there are a lot more buildscripts available .
Having it installed , it can simply be started using
xpra start : 1927
This will start a Server listening on Display 1927 .
To start an application running on this X - Server , we have to set its $ DISPLAY to this , or supply it as an argument .
I mostly start an XTerm , from which I then can start the rest .
nohup xterm - display :1927 &
If anything works , the XTerm can be attached to the current server by running
xpra attach : 1337
inside another X - Server .
It also works remotely , through SSH X - Forwarding .
Killing this process via C-c ( or – if it is remote – by just pulling the network cable ) the XTerm will disappear .
But it can be attached again by simply doing the same command as soon as the connection is there again .
Like one would do with screen .
When trying to attach a server inside itself , then the connection gets lost , but – surprisingly – I can attach the server afterwards .
It doesnt crash .
Now if that isnt solid !
There is no Tray - Bar - Integration ( yet – I am sure this is possible ) , so when using tray applications , I use trayer for that .
Of course , it doesnt always work perfectly .
I sometimes have to run
setxkbmap de
multiple times .
And I heard of some issues with CapsLock .
Sometimes I have to give a window the focus twice ( i.e. clicking on its titlebar twice ) before it actually gets focus .
But well , it hasnt even reached version 1.0 , and already made my life a little easier .
I think its already worth using , and definitely worth being developed ( and hopefully integrated into the default package trees of the major distributions ) .

Lena Horne , the singer and actress who was the first black performer to be signed to a long - term contract by a major Hollywood studio , died on Sunday night at New York - Presbyterian / Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York .
She was 92 .
An obituary by Aljean Harmetz can be found here .
Though Ms. Horne is most closely associated with the song “ Stormy Weather , ” which she can be seen performing above in the 1943 film of the same name , we were first introduced to her via another musical number that found her performing a duet with a fuzzy little green guy with a big broken heart .
It appears below :
Placido Polanco hit a grand slam and drove in six runs , and Ryan Howard also homered for the Phillies , who got their push for a third straight World Series appearance off to a strong start .
" We definitely got started off on a good note today , " Jayson Werth said .
" Roy was magnificent .
He was exactly what we expected . "
Halladay ( 1 - 0 ) allowed one run and six hits in seven innings and settled down to dominate after the Nationals scored in the first .
Ivan Rodriguez doubled to lead off the second , but Halladay then faced the minimum number of batters -- with help from a pair of double plays -- until the seventh , when he worked out of a two - on , one - out jam .
" It was a lot different , " said Halladay , whose seven previous Opening Day starts came with the Toronto Blue Jays before being traded to the Phillies .
" It 's been fun for me .
Nothing against Toronto , but it kind of gives you renewed energy coming over here .
It 's a team that wants to win and can win . "
Halladay even helped himself at the plate with his second career RBI , albeit on a dribbler that traveled all of about 30 feet in Philadelphia 's five - run fourth inning .
He had plenty of support from a sellout crowd whose support was about evenly split .
" That was impressive .
It felt like all of right field was only Phillies fans , " Werth said .
" This is starting to be our home away from home a little bit . "
Obama received only scattered boos among thunderous cheers as he took the mound to mark the 100th anniversary of presidential first pitches .
Not a natural baseball player by his own admission , the left - hander double - clutched before uncorking a wayward delivery that had third baseman Ryan Zimmerman standing and stretching his arm just to make the catch .
" It was high and outside .
I was intentionally walking the guy , " Obama quipped during an appearance in the Nationals ' TV broadcast booth .
" Fortunately , Zimmerman has a tall reach . "
Obama wore a Nationals jacket but made an audacious fashion statement by donning a White Sox cap -- a nod to his favorite team -- as he walked to the mound .
" Bad move there , " Washington manager Jim Riggleman said with a shake of the head .
" He said he wanted us to win , " said Philadelphia manager Charlie Manuel , recounting Obama 's pregame visit to the clubhouse , " as long as we did n't beat the White Sox . "
On April 14 , 1910 , when William Howard Taft became the first president to take part in a first - pitch ceremony , The Associated Press story opened with the following sentence : " President Taft today enjoyed the novel experience of seeing the Washington American League team win a ball game . "
Obama brought no such luck .
The 1910 Washington team was n't very good , and the 2010 National League version started off looking like the crew that lost 100 - plus games in 2008 and 2009 .
John Lannan ( 0 - 1 ) lasted only 3 2/3 innings , allowing five runs and seven hits with three walks and no strikeouts .
He was done in by a morale - sapping fourth inning , when eight of the 10 batters he faced reached base .
By then , Obama had left the ballpark .
" People are going to say what they want , " Nationals right fielder Willie Harris said .
" We can't really worry about that .
We got to concentrate on the 25 guys that are in this locker room .
We got to concentrate on sticking together , even if we do get out to a bad start . "
Game notes
The Phillies broke a streak of four consecutive opening day losses .
...
When the Nationals scored in the first , it broke Halladay 's 24 - inning scoreless streak over his last three starts with the Blue Jays .
...
The loss ended the Nationals ' majors - best seven - game winning streak from the end of last season .
... Zimmerman , Adam Dunn and Lannan were the only three Nationals starters from their opening day lineup a year ago .
... Rodriguez made his 19th consecutive opening day start , the longest streak in the majors .
He had three hits , including a pair of doubles .
... Ian Desmond , Washington 's new starting shortstop , made an error on the first ball hit to him .
Only an alert play by first baseman Dunn kept a run from scoring as the Nationals went 6 - 3 - 2 to record the final out of the first inning .
...
The Phillies were without 1B coach Davey Lopes , whose brother died in a house fire in Rhode Island on Friday .
Manuel said he expects
Lopes to be back after the current six - game road trip .
... Zimmerman was awarded his Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards before the game .
He and OF Matt Kemp of the Los Angeles Dodgers were the only National Leaguers to win both last year .
...
Howard 's homer reached the first row of the middle deck .
...
Polanco 's second career slam came in the seventh off Jason Bergmann .
... Commissioner Bud Selig tried to put a positive spin on the disproportionate number of Phillies fans in the ballpark .
" I think it 's great for the sport , I really do , " he said .
" There 's enormous interest , obviously , in Philadelphia and the fact that people travel as much as they do now .

It 's only a testament to this game 's popularity . "
Two brothers in their late sixties are setting out on a journey they hope will “ restore democracy to America . ”
Starting out from San Francisco , Robin and Laird Monahan have begun a 3000 - mile hike that will take them across ten states to Washington , DC .
Along the way , the Monahans hope to rally opposition to the controversial U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Citizens United v. FEC .
As the Times - Standard pointed out in a short piece on the Monahan brothers , the decision overturned sections of the McCain - Feingold campaign finance law , and ruled that corporations are entitled to some of the same rights as people .

RAW STORY caught up with them on foot outside Sacramento after they were interviewed on Davis Community Television .
“ The Citizens United decision was just a hammer blow to me , ” Laird Monahan told RAW STORY .
“ Frankly , I was despondent for a couple of days .
I just thought the end of my country had come to pass . ”
After long talks with his wife , Laird was only growing angrier .
“ I just said , I gotta do something .
I gotta do something physical , I gotta make a physical sacrifice to restore democracy to America . ”
The hike will total more than 3000 miles and the brothers plan to descend on the Lincoln Memorial before election day in November .
“ The idea that appealed to me greatly was the idea of seeing the United States a much slower pace , perhaps three miles per hour as opposed to seventy miles per hour , ” said Robin .
“ For the most part , our route will follow very closely Highway 50 .
It goes through ten states , through middle America , and it gives us an opportunity to talk to people from the smaller towns in hopes of raising their awareness of the necessity of reducing corporate power by passing a constitutional amendment to abolish corporate personhood . ”

“ The tipping point for me , as was for my brother , ” he added , was that the decision “ not only recognized corporations as persons , but also identified money as speech . ”
In an interview with their childhood hometown newspaper , the International Falls Daily Journal , Laird clarified , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ Let me say at the beginning , I think freedom of speech is one of our greatest achievements in democracy , and corporations are an essential part of our economy , but corporations are creations of people .
And originally , they were chartered with the obligation of existing for the public good . ”
“ They have gained more power over the years and influenced our Congress , all of our legislators , to pass laws , ” Laird told RAW STORY .
“ They wrote their own regulations and then they appointed their own regulators .
So the American people have no real control over any corporation . ”

Slowing to make his point clear , Laird issued a resolute call to action in his smoky baritone .
“ What really needs to happen is for the American people to rise up , get off our knees and say we ’ve had enough and we ’re going to elect people who represent us , ” he said .
Stopping completely , his eyes began to well up and he added , “ It may take several elections , and maybe not in my lifetime , but I hope it does and I hope it happens soon that we ’ll have enough elected representatives to pass an amendment to the Constitution to abolish corporate personhood .
And then it has to be ratified by the states .
All of our legislators should promise to represent us in this effort . ”

Cheerfully , Robin talked about his youngest son , who supports Dad ’s decision .
“ He sacrificed his stash of Tootsie Rolls to speed us on our walk , ” he laughed .
“ And they were good too , ” Laird chimed in .
“ Right now the only contributors to our fund are ourselves .
We ’re hoping that Exxon will come in with a half a million bucks . ”
“ And Nike will come across with new shoes , ” Robin chirped back , sarcastically .

The Monahans are documenting their travels on Facebook and Twitter , as well as on their own blog , which included a note about their toe - dipping visit to the Pacific Ocean on day one of the walk across the country .
They have been endorsed by Move to Amend , a joint project of more than 50 organizations dedicated to overturning the Citizens United decision .
Though the Monahan brothers went to boot camp together in 1964 , and Laird served in Vietnam , neither belongs to VFW , Veterans for Peace or any other veterans group .
“ I feel as though I ’m back in service with my country , for my country , ” Laird stated unequivocally .
“ I was a volunteer from 1964 to 1968 , I served in the Navy .
Now I ’m volunteering to save my constitution from corporate interests .
I ’m doing this because I ’m tired of writing letters that do n’t get answered and signing petitions that have no effect . ”

Women with high - pitched voices apparently prefer deep - voiced , manly men , according to new research that sheds light on the rules of attraction .
Scientists research the features that make people attractive because these reveal what physical and mental qualities we favor , shedding light on what forces drive human evolution .
" People obviously prefer to marry and date people they consider attractive , but also are more likely to cooperate with attractive individuals , prefer to hire attractive people and even prefer to vote for those they think are attractive , " said psychologist Benedict Jones at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland .
" So , by understanding the factors that influence attractiveness judgments , we 're really getting insights into something that 's one of the most powerful driving forces behind social interactions . "
Intriguingly , past research has shown that women with high - pitched voices are not only thought of as sounding more attractive but often have faces others consider more attractive as well .
Further studies revealed these voices in women are often linked with higher estrogen levels , perhaps serving as a cue to their health and fertility .
Straight women who are attractive , in terms of whether they have hourglass figures and how beautiful others deem their faces , typically show particularly strong preferences for men with masculine faces — those with larger jaws and heavier brows , for instance .
Such manly traits could be linked with a man 's health , and thus women might be unknowingly vying for potentially healthier offspring .
In fact , past research has shown that deep - voiced men have more kids .
This suggested that maybe soprano - voiced women preferred macho , deep - voiced men as well , in essence , pairing up the most feminine with the most masculine .
" Over the years , many philosophers have suggested that it 's impossible to understand beauty and attraction , largely because beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder , " Jones said .
" Our recent work shows that , although it 's certainly true that people often differ in the types of people that they find most attractive , these idiosyncratic tastes can , to some extent , be understood and even predicted . "
To test their idea , Jones and his colleagues first measured the pitch of the voices of 113 female college students .
They next listened to recordings of men saying either " I really like you " or " I really do n't like you , " and were asked how attractive they found them .
The voices of these men were electronically modified to have either higher - pitched , more feminine voices , or lower - pitched , more masculine voices .
The volunteers preferred the lower - pitched voices regardless of what the men were saying .
In addition , the 20 women with the highest - pitched voices preferred masculine voices nearly 20 percent more on average than the 20 women with the lowest - pitched voices .
" The findings suggest that women's own attractiveness in some way influences their preferences for masculine traits in men's voices , " Jones said .
" Effects like those in our study might simply reflect people finding their place in the mating market and taking that into account when judging others ' attractiveness . "
" What 's a little bit surprising is that we see these types of effects in studies like ours where people are judging the attractiveness of people they will never meet , never mind attempt to enter into a relationship with , " Jones told LiveScience .
" Awareness of our own market value seems to be so entrenched that we take it into account even in situations where we really do n't necessarily need to . "
An interesting direction for further research could be whether or not women with high - pitched voices actually enter into relationships with deep - voiced men .
" Is it an effect that 's specific to attractiveness judgments , or does it also shape our decisions about who we enter into relationships with ? "
Jones wondered .
Also , instead of just using static pictures or altered voice recordings , " I 'd be keen in the future to alter the appearance and vocal characteristics of videos of people in order to investigate how people combine visual and auditory cues when judging others ' attractiveness , " he added .

When AOL paid $ 850 million for Bebo two years ago , the deal immediately smelled rotten .
Now it 's looking downright putrid : AOL might write the social network off entirely .
AOL chief Tim Armstrong will go through the formality of shopping the site around before closing it , of course , but it 's hard to imagine a buyer stepping forward to pick up an also - ran Facebook competitor whose business is declining .
Armstrong could be forgiven for shutting down the site immediately ; after al , it was his predecessor Randy Falco who went forward with the terrible deal while Armstrong was helping Google mint billions .
Bebo's shutdown will burnish the reputation of two executives , at least : Founders Michael and Xochi Birch ( pictured ) , who sold a Friendster copyu to Monster.com before making a mint unloading a MySpace copy ( that would be Bebo ) on AOL .

We are seeing open warfare between various feminist and other progressive factions on social media and in the universities .
A key divide is between so - called gender critical feminists and trans activists .
Professional scholars might once have been expected to bring a degree of moderation and clarity to these sorts of debates but many of the worst offenders are academics .
This is hardly surprising given that higher education in the humanities and social sciences has long been dominated by ideologues and their acolytes .
Independent thinking on controversial issues is generally not encouraged and in many instances is simply not tolerated .
Even once - respected fields like philosophy have been progressively transformed into platforms for mindless social activism .
Daniel Kaufman has described this sad state of affairs :
Woke Philosophy is built upon a kind of Newspeak , one once only expected from aspirant ( and actual ) totalitarians .
The difference , of course , is that real totalitarians are really dangerous , while the collection of walking and talking personality disorders that constitute the Woke Brigade only have the capacity to frighten people by way of what Elizabeth Anscombe , when speaking of moral imperatives in the absence of God , called “ mesmeric force . ”
Kaufman suggests that in this “ age of social media and … generalized social anxiety ” such “ entirely illusory muscle ” can still exert power .
And so it does , to a point .
But the patent silliness of many of the claims of these virtue - signalling activists , coupled with their lack of self - awareness , simply invites ridicule from those not directly involved .*
These internecine conflicts amongst self - described progressives derive ( as I see it ) from deep - seated contradictions and flaws within feminism itself and within progressive and radical thinking more generally .
Some of these contradictions relate to the Enlightenment view of the mind as infinitely malleable , a tabula rasa , a blank slate .
Even the mythical notion of original sin has more psychological plausibility than this view .
Another fallacy of progressive ideology is the belief that complex problems of ethics and society are amenable to theoretically - elaborated solutions ( based on discursive reason ) .
Strangely , even feminist thinking – typically ( and irrationally ) hostile to science and mathematics – often falls into this trap .
Though core feminist ideas are anti-rationalistic in certain ways , they are presented nonetheless as “ theory ” .
Standpoint theory , for example , has been adopted by feminists .
It entails a highly politicized approach to knowledge and values .
You know the sort of thing : the “ oppressors ” see everything in distorted , self - serving ways , while oppressed groups tend to see things more truly .
It is patently obvious that judgments regarding social and political values depend on a multitude of factors which no theoretical construct or ideological narrative can adequately represent .
The classical and conservative notion of practical wisdom – encompassing as it does both personal and cultural contingencies – is far more closely aligned with lived experience than any theoretical construct or ideological narrative could ever be .
The errors of progressivism have been compounded and exacerbated by the notion that objective knowledge of the world is not possible .
This idea has deep roots in radical social thought and philosophical pragmatism .
But it is self - defeating ; and perhaps it is the realization of this fact which lies behind the attempt to present traditional – and commonsense – views of objectivity and truth as being not simply in error but also as somehow morally or politically tainted .
Feminism , like other kinds of identity politics , relies heavily on this kind of rhetorical moralizing .
We are dealing here with emotional manipulation , ploys designed to promote or prop up ideas which cannot sustain themselves in the absence of a particular kind of value - laden belief system .
If truth is socially constructed then science and rigorous scholarship should not be privileged over the pseudo - intellectual effusions of feminists , critical theorists , et al . .
How convenient .
All these various virtue - signalling discourses are not about intellectual inquiry at all – and never have been .
For most of the participants , it has always been a power game , pure and simple .
The facts are not in dispute .
Successive generations of left - leaning intellectuals and activists somehow managed – in the wake of the social and economic upheavals of the 1960s and 70s – to establish and maintain niches for themselves within the education system , the arts , the media and various sections of an ever - expanding bureaucratic and regulatory web .
And the resulting relentless flood of propaganda and ideologically - driven scholarship in conjunction with other forms of activism has led to deep and wide - ranging social and political changes .
God knows where it goes from here .
* I recently came across these “ obituaries ” for the cancelled by Sarah Lazarus .
She has a light but deadly touch .
The characters and behavior of the few known liquid bomb suspects are completely inconsistent with any notion that they were preparing to kill themselves in acts of mass terror - mirroring the pre-attack demeanor of the 7/7 patsies .
A CCTV image ( top ) shows one of the suspects , Tayib Rauf , entering a bulk order supermarket in Birmingham just two hours before anti-terror police swooped in to grab him for his alleged role in a plot to bomb ten transatlantic airliners .
What were the tools of terror Rauf was acquiring before his kamikaze death mission ?
Knives ?
Peroxide to make the deadly liquid bomb ?
Cameras to detonate the bombs ?
No - he was buying cakes .
" Does this look like the kind of person planning such a plot ?
He does n't look like he 's about to blow himself up , " the owner of the store told the London Mirror .
Rauf chatted with the owner , who said he was more concerned about his father 's confectionary business than the fact that he was about to aid in the mid-air slaughter of 3,000 people .
Any two - bit psychologist can tell you that this individual 's behavior completely belies the notion that his life is about to come to an end .
That in itself exposes the alleged plot for the monumental fraud it is .
Former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray has also highlighted the limited capabilities and intent of the suspects - proof he says that the alert was government propaganda from a cabal that yearns for a " new 9/11 . "
" None of the alleged terrorists had made a bomb .
None had bought a plane ticket .
Many did not even have passports , which given the efficiency of the UK Passport Agency would mean they could n't be a plane bomber for quite some time , " said Murray .
Again we hear the same story over and over - they had young families , they were not political , they were active members of the community , everyone liked them whatever race , they loved football , they planned to be doctors , they had future prospects .
Is this an inside joke ?
MI5 can't even find some angry Muslim loners with criminal records to at least make it appear as if they would have any motive to carry out these attacks ?
It 's such a blatant ruse you wonder if they are doing it on purpose to send a message - that everyone should live in fear of a dawn raid from the terror cops .
The evidence that the London bombers knew they were about to die was so flimsy that newspapers and even the London Metropolitan Police concluded that they were unwitting dupes .
" A Metropolitan Police counter terrorist expert told a seminar that the four terrorists - Mohammad Sidique Khan , 30 , Shehzad Tanweer , 22 , Germaine Lindsay , 19 , and Hasib Hussain , 18 , - did not fit the preconceived terrorist profile . "
The bombers purchased return tickets , played cricket , ate Big Macs , and had arguments with members of the public in the hours before the attacks took place .
They left no suicide notes .
" I 've seen the CCTV footage of these people .
They do not appear to be on their way to commit any crime at all .
The Russell Square bomber [ Hasib Hussain ] is actually seen going into shops and bumping into people [ prior to his attack ] , " the expert said .
The bombers were described by friends as as four " nice lads " , " normal kids who played basketball and kicked a ball around . "
A week after the liquid bomb alert and we still have no motive and no evidence that suggests these individuals are anything other than unfortunate fall guys for Blair 's latest act of psychological warfare against the British people .
But it 's a battle of information that is increasingly swinging away from baseless fearmongering and in favor of the truth .
BBC and British newspaper website forums have been swamped with people expressing their incredulousness about the reality of the latest so - called threat .
A London Guardian journalist in an article today highlights how he traveled the country and found widespread skepticism about the real nature of the alert amongst British citizens - with only tourists wholeheartedly trusting the government .
Assertions that the alert is nothing more than political propaganda have also been echoed by commentators and journalists themselves , following a rash of articles in broadsheet newspapers that scoff at the much vaunted scope of the alleged plot .
