The Hyundai Sonata Hybrid was one of the worst kept secrets of the New York Auto Show and even with all the advance notice we still ca n’t decide if we like the design or hate it with a passion .
The Hybrid Sonata has some rather obvious external design cues from the Mercedes line - up ( look at the side profile and you ’ll see what I mean ) and that front grill could clear snow from the streets of all of Cleveland .
So far we can all agree that we do n’t quite like it and we do n’t quite hate it .
Not really the best place for a car to be but the team at Hyundai have produced much , much worse cars in the past .
The Sonata Hybrid features the 2.4 - litre Theta II engine ( 169 hp at 6,000 rpm and 156 lb - ft of torque at 4,500 rpm ) running in parallel with a 30 kW ( 151 lb - ft ) electric motor and offers both full electric drive mode and hybrid drive mode ( for long distance and highway driving ) .
With fuel economy set to be around 38 mpg ( combined ) the Sonata is a big step in the right direction and should help setting the bar for those that hope to compete with the Prius , Volt and Fusion Hybrids .

How will we know when IP v4 address space is all used up ?
And what will happen when that day comes ?
The modern Internet has been built using IPv4 , which provides for 4.3 billion address , a supply that could run dry within the next two years .
Organizations that allocate IP address space like the American Registry for Internet Numbers ( ARIN ) have attempted to forecast when IP v4 address space will be gone , but it 's not an exact science , and there is no precise date to mark on a calendar .
At the ARIN XXV policy meetings held here this week , ARIN CIO Richard Jimmerson explained how the organization expects to know when the final IP v4 address is gone .
" We will run out of IP v4 address space and the real difficult part is that there is no flag date .
It 's a real moving date based on demand and the amount of address space we can reclaim from organizations , " Jimmerson told InternetNews.com .
" If things continue they way they have , ARIN will for the very first time , sometime between the middle and end of next year , receive a request for IP v4 address space that is justified and meets the policy .
However , ARIN wo n't have the address space .
So we 'll have to say no for the very first time . "
Saying no to an IP v4 request will be shocking to some organizations , which is why ARIN is trying to get the word out now on the importance of moving to IPv6 , Jimmerson said .
The IPv6 address space , the next generation of IP addressing , provides 340 trillion trillion trillion ( 34 x 10 to the 38th power ) Internet addresses .
The first time that ARIN declines an IP v4 address request wo n't necessarily be the date that IP v4 is completely exhausted .
" It will be a different date for different sizes and types of organizations , " Jimmerson said .
" For instance there are some large national organizations that make address space requests of big blocks .
They 'll be the first ones to come in and we 'll have to tell them we do n't have as much as they want and they 'll have to take a smaller block .
That will be the first indication . "
For other organizations requesting smaller blocks of a few thousand addresses , IP v4 may be available for a longer period of time .
But eventually , ARIN will reach the point when it wo n't be able to fulfill even small requests , Jimmerson said
To date , the smallest address size allocation ARIN has issued is what is referred to as a / 22 address block , which provides 1,024 IP addresses .
Jimmerson noted that in the future , ARIN may well begin to offer smaller sized address blocks in the / 24 range , which provide 256 IP v4 addresses .
Once the final IP v4 address space that ARIN has available is allocated , there will still be some extra IP v4 addresses that the organization will hold in reserve .
" We have some special addresses that we 'll hold onto , according to the policy that has been set , " Jimmerson said .
He explained that members of the policy community recognized a few years back that IP v4 address space was running out .
They also recognized that there would soon be some organizations that would need to deploy new networks and services on IP v6 without the benefit of IPv4 .
As a result , the decision was made to retain some IP v4 address space so that new networks could put up their IPv4 DNS and run protocol - translation services .
" So the community set up a policy where we reserve a / 10 of IP v4 address space from our final / 8 address allocation , " Jimmerson said .
A /8 block contains 16,777,214 addresses .
The /10 contains 4 million addresses .
" So in the future when we do run out of IP v4 we still have that /10 set aside for organizations that just need a little bit for protocol translation or DNS , " Jimmerson said .
ARIN manages IP address space allocations for the U.S. , Canada and the Caribbean region .
ARIN is one of five global Regional Internet Registry ( RIR ) organizations that in turn receive their IP allocations from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) .
The other four RIRs are the RIPE Network Coordination Centre ( RIPE NCC ) for Europe , the Middle East and Central Asia , the Asia - Pacific Network Information Centre ( APNIC ) for Asia and the Pacific region , the Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry ( LACNIC ) for Latin America and the African Network Information Centre ( AfriNIC ) for Africa .
At this point , Jimmerson said that ARIN will still be making IP v4 address space available as long as the supply from IANA holds out .
" There is a global policy that states when the IANA free pool of IP v4 addresses gets down to five / 8s remaining they will automatically take and give one of the remaining / 8s to each of the five RIRs , " Jimmerson said .
According to Jimmerson , there are now 20 / 8s remaining in the IANA pool , which makes it likely that ARIN will get more IP v4 address space .
As IP v4 address space nears exhaustion , ARIN has seen the demand slacken .
" In the ARIN region demand for IP v4 may have leveled off and slowed down in the last few years , " Jimmerson said .
" We have a pretty saturated market with IP v4 address space in North America . "
Other areas of the world are still seeing high demand for IP v4 address space .
In particular , the Asia - Pacific and Latin America regions are experiencing historically high levels of IP v4 address demand , Jimmerson said .
" For only the second time ever , LACNIC , which services all of South and Central America , issued more IP v4 address space in the first quarter of 2010 than ARIN did , " he said .
" I do n't think it has anything to do with IP v4 depletion -- it 's just that the markets are picking up down there . "

As adults , we notice that certain colors have a substantial impact on our overall mood .
In fact , many psychologists around the globe recommend decorating and painting with colors that uplift , calm and energize .
The same can be said for young children , though , they seem to be hypersensitive to color ’s emotion altering effects .
Youth that spend a majority of their waking ( and napping ) hours at a daycare facility depend on an environment that they can feel comfortable in .
It is important to note that not all children are the same , so the results may vary depending on the child .
By choosing the right paint colors for each room , the area ’s intended purpose may help little ones adhere well .
We wanted to bring you expert information on the best paint colors for a daycare , so we asked the professional painters at Fort Wayne Painters – https://www.paintersfortwayne.com.
They have a lot of experience helping homeowners with picking the best paint colors for their house , so we thought they would also have some ideas for a daycare .
Here ’s what they shared with us , along with information about the emotions each color can help bring about :
Blue for Nap Rooms
Whether you only have a designated location for naps or an entire room dedicated to it , it goes without saying that the area will have to be clear of distractions , calm and soothing .
To help achieve this cozy , comfy , stress free environment , the color blue can be painted along the walls .
Some suggest even painting the ceiling of a nap room , with a darker blue on the walls and a lighter blue tone on the ceiling .
The color blue is well - known for its anti-anxiety calming effects , and it can even help lower heart rates and blood pressure , which is perfect before nap time !
Red for Playroom
As children play , squeal , laugh and let their imaginations run wild , it is only natural for them to immerse themselves in the fun , excitingly painted room for playtime !
Red paint would be a fine addition to the walls of a playroom as it energizes the body by increasing heart and breathing rates .
Too much red , however , can be agitating for young minds , so red paint is best as an accent , allowing room on the walls for other bright , playful colors like orange , purple or pink .
Green for Library
Have a spot in your daycare for story hour ?
No matter what age , encouraging literacy in young minds is essential , and a good way to introduce reading is to do it at a young age in an environment that supports it !
The color green has scientifically been noted as possibly helping to improve a child ’s reading speed and comprehension .
Soothe your daycare ’s tiny readers with green paint to ensure their reading experience is a memorable one that will help them want to keep at it for the rest of their lives .
Conclusion
Choosing what colors to paint a daycare can be a difficult task for those that are not familiar with colors and their mood changing abilities .
With that being said , not every child may become restful by seeing the color blue or excited when viewing the color red .
The same can even be said for adults , as some may be fond of painting their entire house bright yellow while the thought of such action might make others disgusted .
Nonetheless , colors are not just pleasing to look at ; they have valuable capabilities that can help guide the mind , body and spirit in the right direction .
It is hard not to appreciate the power and beauty of a color , and lucky for us , we can add it to our daily lives by purchasing some paint cans and brushes .

He said he ran toward his son , Nicholas , 15 , for help and the teenager grabbed a two liter bottle of Coca - Cola , shook it up and sprayed the contents on his father .
" The fire went out straight away , " Wythe said .
" He 's a very level - headed boy .
Without Nicholas it would have been a lot worse , without a doubt .
I was lucky really . "
Wythe said he suffered burns to his neck , chest and ears and will require skin grafts .
henderson bridge in singapore a new elevated walkway that connects mount faber park and telok blangah hill park image © designboom henderson waves , jointly designed by RSP architects planners & engineers and IJP corporation , is singapore ’s highest pedestrian bridge and was awarded this year ’s design of the year for the president ’s design award at the singapore design week 09 .
standing at 36 meters above the ground , in an iconic , sculptural leap spanning across singapore ’s henderson road .
based on the principle of parametric design , this new visual symbol has attracted the community to its walkways and shelters .
its three - dimensional surface integrates structure and form in a unique wave that undulates dramatically over and under the bridge deck and creating sheltered seating areas inside every upward curve .
with the sensitive use of natural organic shapes and materials such as wood and steel , this structure helps unite the city ’s southern ridges , which are comprised of a nine - kilometer chain of green open spaces spanning the rolling hills of mount faber park , telok blangah hill park and kent ridge park before ending at west coast park .

Sioux Logo Retired by State Board
CHN Staff Report
North Dakota 's State Board of Higher Education decided today to retire the University of North Dakota 's Fighting Sioux athletic team logo , ending a saga that was years in the making , the Grand Forks Herald is reporting .
With the decision , the Board advised school Chancellor Bill Goetz to immediate begin the transition .
The school is expected to retain the name and logo for 2010 - 11 , and change it after that .
The door was opened to the move when the North Dakota Supreme Court struck down an injunction today that had been granted to the Spirit Lake Sioux tribe stopping the retiring of the logo .
The board originally voted to retire the name in May 2009 , but the Spirit Lake Sioux tribe was granted the injunction .
After the N.D. Supreme Court made its ruling today to lift the injunction , board president Richie Smith re-introduced the logo issue at the end of today 's scheduled meetings .
There was a motion offered to reconsidered , but it was not seconded , and consequently , that logo was officially retired , the Herald reported .
The issue has been controversial for years .
The NCAA originally mandated that all schools with Native American - related nicknames , mascots and logos to change them , or else not be allowed to host NCAA events .
This led to most of the schools changing their nicknames .
But North Dakota , with the support of numerous local fans and athletic alumni , was granted a reprieve when it received the backing of the local tribes .
The board later decided to make the move anyway .
Ralph Engelstad , a major athletic department benefactor and namesake of the hockey team 's arena , had threatened , before he passed away , to pull funding if the school changed its logo .
The school ultimately decided to keep it at that time , but Engelstad poured all of his contributions directly to a new hockey arena , resulting in the palacial Engelstad arena the team now calls home .

For months we have assumed that when Sarah Palin gave a speech she was saying something worth paying $ 100,000.00 to hear .
Yet as I have listened to speech after speech , I am left with the lingering thought …
“ What did she say ? ” A common error in listening to a speech of Sarah Palin is the assumption that Sarah is trying to make some point .
Once you realize that she has no point , but is simply trying to fulfill her $ 100,000 contract , you will find peace .
While listening to the speeches you may forget which speech you are listening to , as they all sound identical .
Whether speaking at a rally for John McCain or speaking in an interview with Glen Beck , Palin seems to repeat the same phrases and mottos .
Thus , perhaps I can be of help by providing this Pocket Guide , for use in translating the words that are coming out of Sarah ’s Palin ’s mouth .
This Guide can provide comfort to you when you are feeling distraught that someone so ignorant ever came so close to being the President of our country .
This Pocket Guide should be maintained near your computer or television for quick relief upon listening to anything Grandma Palin might say .
It should be current through December of 2012 , as there would be no reason for her to change anything , except her clothes , before 2012 .
Repetitive Phrases of Sarah Palin
Do You Love Your Freedom ?
Palin is asking the question , “ Do you love being able to choose whether to attend her church at the 10:00 service , or the 12:00 service ? ”
She is NOT asking whether you love …
Your reproductive freedom
Your freedom to marry the person of your choosing
Your freedom to read books in your local library expressing views different than hers
Your freedom from having to fund earmarks for Alaska to study the mating habits of crabs or the DNA of harbor seals .
A Poor Man ’s Teleprompter
Palin is making reference to her hand .
She is NOT making reference to :
Her own teleprompter , because everyone would agree that if Palin is worth in excess of $ 12,000,000.00 , she is not poor
An actual teleprompter , as we know that if she were a “ poor man ” McCain would have been embarrassed to nominate such an incompetent man ; but he seems to have different standards for the ladies
A real teleprompter because , if she were using a teleprompter of any sort , surely she would make more sense
Do n’t Retreat , Reload
Sarah Palin’s “ can do ” spirit when it comes to giving speeches to liquor distributors , bowling leagues , or any organization about which she knows nothing , but that is willing to pay her fee
She is NOT making reference to :
What the majority of Alaskans do when they see Sarah Palin
Common Sense Conservatism
Palin is making reference to the appropriate use of RNC funds , for :
$ 150,000 to adorn Sarah Palin
Thousands of dollars to the mistress of Nevada Republican Senator , John Ensign , and her teenage son
$ 17,000.00 for private planes during the last month
$ 12,000.00 for limo service in the last month
$ 15,000.00 for hotel rooms at the Beverly Hills Hotel
$ 2000.00 for “ meals ” at the Voyeur in West Hollywood , a bondage themed topless night club
She is NOT making reference to :
Mark Sanford ’s use of frequent flyer miles for his trip to Argentina
Americans Now Spend 100 Days
Out of the Year Working for the Government
Palin is making reference to her limited time at work as the Governor of Alaska
Government is Deciding How Much Money People Can Have
Palin is making a joke at the expense of those politicians who have not resigned their elected positions , who still receive a pay check from the Federal Government
This is the People ’s Movement
Palin is making reference to those people who read this blog and would like to move her off of our computers and televisions .
Nah , We ’re Gonna Keep Clinging to Our Constitution and Our Guns and Religion
Sarah ’s response to seeing a witch
Just Because You Can , Does n’t Mean You Should
This is the lesson Sarah has tried to teach her sister - in - law about burglary
BS from the Lame Stream Media
Sarah ’s characterization of the last show she did on Fox News .
Drill Baby Drill , Not Stall Baby Stall
Sarah ’s way of telling Todd to “ have a good day ” , and to ensure that he keeps his job on the North Slope
You Betcha !
Sarah placing a wager on the next Iron Dog race
God Created Resources for Our Use , Right Here in America
Sarah ’s attitude about marijuana
We are Selfishly Sticking Our Kids and Grandkids with the Bill and that is Stealing From Them …
It Is Immoral
Sarah ’s expression of shock and dismay that her grandchild should ever be required to pay for his own health care , and should be entitled to rely upon the government to pay because he is 1/32 Eskimo
Freedom is a God -Given Right and Freedom is Worth Fighting for and that ’s Why We ’re Doing what We ’re Doing
Admittedly Sarah is a little confused here .
If freedom is a God - given right , then we would n’t need to fight for it .
Do n’t try to make sense of this one … just wink .
We Need to Restore Balance and Common Sense
In Sarah ’s mind balance is achieved only when people , not animals , dominate the world , so common sense would dictate killing all animals .
Ronald Reagan , Ronald Reagan , Ronald Reagan …
Ex -Governor Palin makes reference to Ronald Reagan an average of five times in most speeches , hoping that people will associate Palin with Reagan .
In reality the only similarity between Reagan and Palin may be Bonzo , but that may disrespectful to an especially bright chimpanzee .
Special Needs Child
This is particularly confusing as the words are not subject to definition unless you know who is saying the words .
For example if a Democrat uses the term it might be f’ing retard .
This is offensive and grounds for removal from office .
If a conservative talk show host uses the term f’ing retard , he is simply being sarcastic .
If Sarah uses the term “ the retarded one ” she is making reference to Trig , so no offense should be taken .
Blind Man ’s Bluff
Over the past three months , several prominent American think tanks and academic institutions have conducted simulation games about the Iranian crisis .
Although these war games have nicely covered almost all facets of the problem , they have left one aspect mostly understudied : the nature of Iran ’s response to a U.S. or Israeli airstrike .
I recently took part in two U.S. government - sponsored games in which the participants attempted to provide a modest assessment of that crucial issue .
War simulation games are certainly not a new invention in government practice .
Indeed , the history of strategy and that of simulation are inseparable .
Ever since men formed armies and thought of ways to outfox their enemies , simulation has been an integral part of military planning .
The art of simulation was perfected during the Cold War , but once the Soviet Union fell , it experienced a lull .
Today , as the United States faces the Iranian nuclear challenge , simulation is back in business .
The simulations in which I participated began with the premise that the U.S. president , having exhausted all diplomatic strategies , had just made the tough decision to employ military force against Iran , with the chief objective of destroying or at least seriously damaging the country ’s key nuclear - power centers .
With this hypothetical scenario in mind , the participants tried to assess the Iranian response to a limited U.S. airstrike .
Driving this assessment was the assumption that though the U.S. intelligence community possesses some knowledge about the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ’ ( IRGC ’s ) retaliatory capabilities , it has no clue as to how the IRGC would choose to respond .
So we laid out three fairly basic scenarios .
First , no response : Iran absorbs the hit and uses it to play the role of victim before the international community and reap whatever diplomatic benefits .
Second , a symbolic , limited response : Iran fires back in peripheral theaters such as Lebanon / Israel , Iraq , or Afghanistan , perhaps launching in tandem a terrorist campaign against U.S. interests at home or abroad , all for the purpose of saving face and preserving some of its deterrent posture and defiant image .
Third , a full - on response : Tehran makes use of all its retaliatory tools , possibly leading to an all - out , strategic confrontation with the United States and Israel .
Each scenario had its group of backers .
Those predicting the first scenario were few , but their voices were loud .
Just like U.S. Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay , who asserted during the Cuban missile crisis that the Soviets would do " nothing " in response to a U.S. airstrike , these analysts argued that Iran ’s mullahs , who prize the regime ’s survival above all else , would not risk their own necks by retaliating .
The majority of participants backed the second scenario .
The thought was that , though Iran would do its utmost to avoid an all - out war with the United States , the political costs of holding fire would be too great .
For a leadership that prides itself on being the vanguard of Islamic resistance against the " evil West , " inaction or ineptitude would be ridiculed at home , make a mockery of its deterrence posture , and lead to domestic political upheaval .
The third scenario — all - out war — though remote , has led strategic planners inside the Pentagon to work day and night , participants with inside knowledge said .
To understand whether the regime would actually make such a suicidal move requires an incisive understanding of the Iranian leadership ’s mindset .
Unfortunately , there are two important challenges to Washington ’s effort to read Tehran .
First , though U.S. intelligence on Iran is slowly improving , it remains severely lacking .
Americans barely know how Iran functions in peaceful times , let alone how it would respond to an external threat it might perceive as existential .
Second , the Iranian regime is notoriously opaque and factionalized .
There may be political harmony and ideological congruence between the IRGC and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , but there is no reason to presume that these two central players ( and that ’s assuming the IRGC is a homogeneous organization ) have identical beliefs .
This makes any attempt at deciphering the collective Iranian response to a possible U.S. preventive attack more elusive .
All participants agreed that history could serve as a useful guide to the future .
The United States relied on a similar approach during the Cold War , dissecting Moscow ’s response to multiple crises in various theaters and concluding that its enemy was politically aggressive but militarily cautious .
Today , the United States needs that same type of strategic assessment vis-à - vis Iran , if Washington ever finds that the only way to solve the Iranian nuclear problem is through the calculated use of force .
By carefully examining , for example , how Iran fought in the 1980 - 1988 war against Iraq , how it behaved during several military crises with the United States ( the 1987 - 1988 and 1995 - 1997 ones are two examples ) , and how it " instructed " Hezbollah to respond to Israel during the 2006 summer war , we can very roughly deduce the following :
Its messianic ideology and belligerent rhetoric notwithstanding , Iran is not suicidal .
Most military historians agree that , despite Saddam Hussein ’s use of chemical weapons against Iranian forces , Tehran ’s conventional response was relatively measured during the Iran - Iraq War .
Also , in 2006 , despite Israel ’s pounding of Hezbollah ’s civilian strongholds in Beirut , the Shiite group did not bomb the petrochemical plants in Haifa largely because it and the Iranians wanted to avoid a total war .
Although Iran did not hesitate to defend itself and its interests in all these direct and indirect military encounters , it exercised some restraint and refrained from crossing any red lines that would place the Islamic regime ’s future in jeopardy .
But different crises require different responses .
There is no reason for Americans to think that Iran will restrain itself against its most hated enemy , the United States .
Therefore , more cues on how the Iranians could respond to U.S. or Israeli airstrikes are needed .
Some U.S. officials might be tempted to think that one way to acquire more cues is by " testing " the Iranians in various local crises in the region where they have a presence ( Iraq ) or major interests ( Lebanon and Afghanistan ) to defend .
Today , no one in Barack Obama ’s administration is seriously contemplating employing military force to halt Iran ’s nuclear program .
But the Iranian nuclear clock keeps ticking , and time is certainly not on America ’s side .
For reasons that could be beyond Washington ’s control , Obama or his successor might find himself or herself in the unenviable position of ordering the U.S. military to bomb Iran ’s nuclear infrastructure .
Absent a reliable reading and strategic assessment of Tehran ’s resolve and its likely response , Washington should shelve the military option altogether .
U.S. strategic interests in the Middle East demand that Washington be very careful not to slide , once again unprepared , toward another disastrous war in the region .
The new age of activist atheism , which began with the publication of bestsellers such as Richard Dawkins 's The God Delusion ( 2006 ) , and Christopher Hitchens 's polemic God is Not Great ( 2007 ) , has grown into a loose global coalition of civil libertarians , liberals and gay rights activists .
Australians , notorious for their political complacency , have begun to join up .
Membership of the Atheist Foundation has increased since 2001 , Nicholls says , although he refuses to release numbers .
Next month the incipient Australian movement will come together for the Global Atheist Convention in Melbourne .
Speakers include Dawkins , the movement 's supreme deity ; the philosopher Peter Singer ; and Dan Barker , a prominent American atheist activist and former Christian preacher .
Organisers say it is the largest such event to be held in Australia , and perhaps in the world .
The 2500 - capacity convention is sold out and there is even a waiting list .
'' It started with the scandals of the televangelists in America , the [ paedophilia ] scandals of the Catholic Church , and then there were the attacks on the Twin Towers , '' Nicholls says of atheism 's recent popularity .
'' People began writing books that gelled with the population .
People realised if they wanted change in society , they had to make it happen .
Religion was getting a free ride . ''
Tanya Smith , a 35 - year - old financial services professional and one of the volunteer organisers of the convention , says the religious lobby is a well - funded , well - organised force that has a disproportionate influence on politics .
Atheists would like to '' neutralise '' that influence .
'' I want laws that will make society better , not laws based on a book that was written two thousand years ago , '' she says .
This is the chief cry of the Australian atheist movement - that religion plays too great a role in politics .
They point to Kevin Rudd's on - camera churchgoing , Tony Abbott 's controversial views on abortion , the refusal of both leaders to support gay marriage , and the fact that the balance of power is in part held by Steve Fielding of the conservative Christian party Family First .
' 'A lot of people who do n't believe have got fed up with the political role of religion , '' says Russell Blackford , an author and philosopher who will address the convention .
'' They see the enormous influence of religious groups , they see Christian lobbies opposing abortion and gay rights , and there is a feeling that , ' They 've got their say , it 's about time we had a say as well . ' ''
Atheists such as Blackford have no problem with the Christianity of Rudd or Abbott but they object when it informs policy - making .
'' What worries me is when their Christian morality fails to give gays rights or claws back abortion rights , or unfairly advantages churches in terms of tax breaks , '' he says .
Dr David Hohne is a theologian and philosopher at Moore College .
He names state - subsidised religious education , charity and healthcare as tinder - box issues between the faithful and the faithless .
If a religion accepts state - funding and tax breaks , should it be able to absent itself from , say , anti-discrimination labour laws ?
'' You get a clash of cultures , '' Hohne says .
'' Should Christians be forced to hire a Muslim , a homosexual or an atheist ? ''
He is quick to condemn any homophobic or aggressive policies that result in discrimination .
He admits that where faith - based communities are receiving state money , '' they have to weigh up very carefully the extent to which they want to keep themselves separate from state laws ' ' .
The debate becomes more complex when the state seeks to regulate the religious sphere .
Atheists are traditionally aligned with libertarianism and civil rights , but religious organisations increasingly complain that a militantly secular state represses the rights of the faithful .
Recent examples are the touted burqa ban in France and proposed legislation in Britain that would require religious organisations to justify hiring discrimination against gays for church jobs .
Pope Benedict said recently that the legislation violated '' long - standing British traditions ' ' of freedom of speech and urged Catholic bishops to protest against it .
Hohne says atheists must realise a secular state does not mean a state devoid of religion - that in itself is a form of extremism .
As atheists organise and unite , they increasingly face the criticisms they are used to levelling against their faithful counterparts - that they are extremists , skewed fundamentalists .
Others warn that strict adherence to evolutionary theory leads logically to social Darwinism .
Hitchens is often accused of recycling arguments and of demolishing his marks with one - eyed fervour .
His targets include Mother Teresa , a woman well on her way to canonisation .
Dawkins has been criticised for his ignorance of Christian theology , and his inability ( and that of science in general ) to disprove the existence of God .
Hohne sees the new atheism as ' 'a hangover from the 19th century ' ' , when people began to mistrust the idea of knowledge bequeathed by a deity and instead put faith in the power of individual inquiry , through science and rational argument .
Dawkins and Hitchens are on a ' ' crusade ' ' , he says , but Blackford rejects any such label for his tribe .
'' Some atheists are accused of being fundamentalists but that is unfair , '' he says .
'' You wo n't find many high - profile atheists who are extreme politically , in that they want to use the power of the state to suppress religion . ''
If such atheists exists , they are likely to make their voices heard at next month 's convention , to be held at the same venue as the recent Parliament of World Religions .
As Hohne says , in this debate it is near impossible to sit on the fence .

8.4 Clocking Work Time
Org mode allows you to clock the time you spend on specific tasks in a project .
When you start working on an item , you can start the clock .
When you stop working on that task , or when you mark the task done , the clock is stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded .
It also computes the total time spent on each subtree 72 of a project .
And it remembers a history or tasks recently clocked , so that you can jump quickly between a number of tasks absorbing your time .
To save the clock history across Emacs sessions , use :
( setq org - clock - persist ' history ) ( org- clock - persistence - insinuate )
When you clock into a new task after resuming Emacs , the incomplete clock73 is retrieved ( see Resolving idle time ( 1 ) ) and you are prompted about what to do with it .

Okay , so now that you ’ve downloaded the brand - spanking - new version of Ubuntu , what are you going to run it on ?
A similar question faced Linux users more than a decade ago .
Desktop Linux distributions have always run on commodity hardware , but late in the last century a quartet of computer makers went a little bit further :
HP , IBM , Dell and Compaq formed the principal group of hardware vendors that made high - profile statements of support for GNU / Linux in 1999 … — Rebel Code : Linux and the Open Source Revolution
Granted , the support of which they spoke was really about the deployment of Red Hat Linux in business environments — but even this was a huge deal at the time , and gave both Linux and the FLOSS movement in general some much - needed credibility in the wider world .
So how are the FLOSS four doing 11 years on ?
Let ’s find out …
But first , some notes :
The informal findings below are based on results from the Canadian market .
If things are different where you ’re reading this please let me know !
I ’m consciously focusing on desktop ( and laptop ) computers here , since we all know that Apache rules the server - verse . 😎
Oh , and Compaq is out of the running , since they merged with HP in 2001 .
But you already knew that , right ?
Lenovo , who got the rights to IBM ’s PC division in 2005 , does n’t seem to sell any desktop products without Windows — which is a real shame , because I think their hardware is both stylish and dependable , from the cheap and cheerful laptop I got in 2006 ( okay , that was n’t stylish at all ) to my new all - in - one .
I ’m also secretly lusting after a ThinkPad x100e , and my birthday is only 11 and a half months away …
HP also sells a fine netbook in Canada — the Mini 210 , which is quite affordable as well .
Unfortunately , there ’s nary an option for Linux as a default OS on any of the computers they offer , at least in this country .
But HP does at least deserve some brownie points for rescuing beleaguered Palm from an uncertain fate — so long as its reasons for so doing are pure ; i.e. to bring that slick webOS to more new products and not just call dibs on a bunch of patents .
A search for “ Linux ” on Dell.ca yielded a fantastic 501 results , yet the only computers I could find were a pair of netbooks with “ Red Hat Ubuntu ” (? ) 8.04 — the previous LTS ( long - term support ) release .
Once again , you can download and install Ubuntu ( or the distro of your choice ) on products from any of these companies , but of the original FLOSS four only Dell is currently selling computers without a Windows license .
Thankfully , there are four new hardware manufactures who have taken up the Linux torch …
Say what you like about the default Xandros on the Asus 900 and 901 , that this pair of early netbooks were free of the “ Microsoft tax ” was enough for me to end up buying one of each .
IMHO , Asus is largely responsible for kickstarting the netbook revolution , and all the wonderful netbook distros that came with it .
They ’ve since regressed to a Windows - only shop it would seem , but their contributions to netbooks and FLOSS should not be forgotten .
HTC , long a maker of Windows Mobile handsets for other companies , got the nod to produce Google ’s first Android handset , the Dream / G1 .
They ’ve been on a roll ever since , and make some of the most desirable Android products out there , like the Hero , the Legend and the Desire .
As a hardware and software company Nokia deserves kudos for making two of their major operating systems open source .
Though the benefits of Symbian seem to be largely for developers , Maemo and the forthcoming MeeGo are aimed squarely at us , the end users .
For the world ’s number - one manufacturer of mobile devices , this is a pretty big deal .
Bringing computers and Linux to kids in the developing world makes the OLPC project pretty much a no - brainer , does n’t it …
But the thought and care that ’s gone into designing a laptop specifically for this market — one that can withstand the elements , operate in bright sunlight and make the most of a battery charge — makes it an especially worthy endeavour .
I ’m going to go out on a limb here and proclaim Asus , HTC , Nokia & OLPC as the new FLOSS four , leading the way in software freedom by bringing it to new products and markets .
Unless you think there are better or additional candidates …?
People send me stuff .
This one reminds me of a famous wrong way :
Hi Anthony Today we had some rumour in the Dutch media due to a paper by a couple of econometricians which projected dramatic warming .
Ross McKitrick discovered they had used a wrong dataset ;
We blogged about here : http://climategate.nl/2010/03/09/four-degrees-warming-in-2050-oops-you-used-the-wrong-dataset/
It would be nice if you could post it on WUWT as well , cheers Marcel Crok Science writer
This morning , there was lot of noise in the Dutch media ( unfortunately in Dutch only ) about new research that was claiming a dramatic warming of 4 degrees in 2050 .
The news report quoted Dutch econometricians from the University of Tilburg .
They had done a statistical analysis of temperature data and the influence of CO2 and solar radiation and concluded that aerosols masked much more of the warming of greenhouse gases than previously thought .
This also means there is more warming in the pipeline for the future if the trend of global brightening , that has been detected by researcher Martin Wild of ETH in Zürich , will continue in the coming decades .
They also draw policy conclusions from their research stating that in order to avoid more than 2 degree warming more drastic measures are to be taken .
This news was copied by many Dutch news outlets .
Detection
Although at first I could not figure out if there was a paper behind the news article and whether or not it has been accepted for publication ( I still do n’t know ) , I finally determined it had to be this paper : http://center.uvt.nl/staff/magnus/wip04.pdf
I decided to pass the paper on to Ross McKitrick , who , as many of the readers know , published two interesting papers ( here and here ) on the influence of different economic parameters on the pattern of warming at the surface .
Within hours McKitrick came back with an interesting finding which makes any detailed discussion on the paper let ’s say … irrelevant .
Remember , their study is an attribution study depending on long term trends in temperature measurements .
For their study they use a rather obscure CRU dataset : CRU TS 2.1 .
You can find its documentation below .
The webpage reads :
The CRU TS 2.1 data - set comprises 1224 monthly grids of observed climate , for the period 1901 - 2002 , and covering the global land surface at 0.5 degree resolution .
There are nine climate variables available : daily mean , minimum and maximum temperature , diurnal temperature range , precipitation , wet day frequency , frost day frequency , vapour pressure and cloud cover .
Read the documentation
There is also a peer - reviewed paper behind CRU TS 2.1 : Mitchell and Jones , International Journal of Climatology , 2005 , so that ’s OK .
However , if the authors had just cared to go through this webpage in some detail , they would have found a link to this page :
It says :
Q1 .
Is it legitimate to use CRU TS 2.0 to ‘ detect anthropogenic climate change ’ ( IPCC language ) ?
A1 . No. CRU TS 2.0 is specifically NOT designed for climate change detection or attribution in the classic IPCC sense .
The classic IPCC detection issue deals with the distinctly anthropogenic climate changes we are already experiencing .
Therefore it is necessary , for IPCC detection to work , to remove all influences of urban development or land use change on the station data .
In contrast , the primary purpose for which CRU TS 2.0 has been constructed is to permit environmental modellers to incorporate into their models as accurate a representation as possible of month - to - month climate variations , as experienced in the recent past .
Therefore influences from urban development or land use change remain an integral part of the data - set .
We emphasise that we use all available climate data .
If you want to examine the detection of anthropogenic climate change , we recommend that you use the Jones temperature data - set .
This is on a coarser ( 5 degree ) grid , but it is optimised for the reliable detection of anthropogenic trends .
For precipitation trends , use the Hulme data - set ( 5 degree grid or 2.5 x 3.75 grid ) .
There are few alternatives to Hulme in the first half of the 20th century ; later , to include the oceans use the Xie and Arkin data - set ; for the last 25 years you could also use the GPCC data - set .
Yikes .
This dataset is not to be used for the type of study performed by these econometricians .
Never . Period .
Do n’t use it .
Lies , damned lies , statistics and very sloppy science .

Shark Attack vs. Sand Hole Collapse Fatalities

A l'entrée de l'avenue des Chardons , séparée de l'océan par une dune impressionnante où dominent les pins , on peut mesurer la violence avec laquelle la tempête Xynthia s'est attaquée , dans la nuit de samedi à dimanche 28 février , au littoral vendéen .
Aux petites heures du jour , mardi , l'eau recouvrait encore des dizaines de maisons dans ce quartier dévasté et surveillé toute la nuit par les hommes du 6e régiment du génie d'Angers .
Là , dans un bar qui ne paie pas de mine , est installé le poste avancé des secours qui réunissent gendarmes , pompiers , plongeurs , sauveteurs et agents de la sécurité civile , quelque 600 hommes en tout .
Tous redoutent que ne s'alourdisse encore le bilan si meurtrier pour la petite commune de La Faute - sur - Mer , située de l'autre côté de l'estuaire du Lay , ce fleuve côtier qui a tout englouti , gonflé par la forte marée , les pluies et un vent violent .
Sa voisine , L'Aiguillon - sur - Mer , n'a pas été épargnée non plus .
Dans les deux villages , 3 500 habitants à eux deux , on compte 27 morts , pour la plupart des personnes âgées résidant là depuis toujours ou ayant choisi d'y prendre leur retraite .
Les victimes reposent dans une chapelle ardente dressée à côté du funérarium de L'Aiguillon , seulement accessible aux proches des victimes .
Le président de la République , Nicolas Sarkozy , s'y est rendu lundi matin , essayant autant que faire se peut de soutenir le moral des familles endeuillées .
Un peu plus tard , à LaRochelle , il a annoncé qu'il demandait au gouvernement de mettre sur pied une mission d'inspection qui devra rendre dans les dix jours " un rapport pour comprendre ce qui s'est passé " .
Malheureusement , ce rapport existe déjà mais n'a pas été lu comme il aurait dû l'être .
Il est signé de Pascal Raison , de la direction départementale de l'équipement de Vendée .
" La vulnérabilité du littoral vendéen aux submersions marines ne fait aucun doute " , expliquait - il en 2007 , lors de la présentation de son rapport à l'occasion des Journées nationales génie côtier - génie civil à Sophia - Antipolis ( Alpes- Maritimes ) .
L'expert jugeait nécessaire la mise en place d'un plan de prévention des risques de submersion " dans l'estuaire du Lay sur les communes de La Faute - sur - Mer et de L'Aiguillon - sur - Mer , où la conjonction de deux phénomènes – la crue du Lay et la submersion marine – , pourrait avoir un impact très important sur les zones densifiées à l'arrière d'un réseau de digues vieillissant . "
" La rupture des digues engendrerait des dégâts majeurs aux biens et aux personnes " , insistait - il .
C'est exactement ce qui est arrivé dans la nuit de samedi à dimanche .
Le même rapport indiquait qu'à La Faute - sur - Mer , " la digue était dans un état structurel variable " .
Ce que contestent les élus locaux qui assurent que la digue de la pointe du Lay n'a pas cédé mais a été submergée .
" Nos digues étaient régulièrement entretenues et en bon état " , soutient Alain Barraud , maire adjoint de L'Aiguillon .
" A La Faute comme à L'Aiguillon , des travaux importants avaient été actés et engagés , aussi bien de surélévation que d'enrochement .
A la veille du drame , la préfecture nous avait annoncé avec certitude que la mer allait monter au moins d'1 mètre .
Il faut bien comprendre que nous sommes les victimes d'un petit tsunami , la mer est venue par la pointe d'Arçay et elle est montée beaucoup plus haut que prévu . "
C'est d'ailleurs la raison pour laquelle la population des zones inondables n'a pas été évacuée avant la tempête .
" Nous avons été confrontés à une conjonction extraordinaire , explique , de son côté , le nouveau préfet de Vendée , Jean - Jacques Brot .
Est-ce qu'aux Pays - Bas , on évacue les populations à chaque tempête ?
L'état des digues n'était pas calamiteux , et il appartient désormais aux parlementaires , aux conseillers généraux , d'entreprendre des travaux sur de nombreuses digues de Vendée et de contribuer au plan digues dont la responsabilité a été confiée par le président de la République à Jean - Louis Borloo , ministre de l'écologie , de l'énergie , du développement durable et de la mer . "
La longueur totale de ces digues , dont les plus anciennes datent de Colbert et les plus récentes de l'entre - deux - guerres avoisine les 1000 kilomètres pour les seuls départements de Vendée et de Charente - Maritime .
" Les zones submergées étaient bien connues , explique Jean - François Fountaine , premier vice - président ( PS ) du conseil régional de Poitou - Charentes .
La mer , qui jadis allait jusqu'à Niort , a brutalement repris ses droits .
Même si depuis la tempête de 1999 , les plans de prévention mis en place par l'Etat ont fortement réduit la pression immobilière sur la bande littorale , le bras de fer a continué entre l'Etat , les collectivités locales et les propriétaires .
Récemment , le tribunal administratif de Poitiers a donné droit aux habitants de Port - en - Ré qui s'opposaient à la surélévation d'une digue parce que cela allait leur ôter la vue sur la mer …
Ce sont peut - être les mêmes personnes qui vont demander aujourd ' hui des indemnités . "

Hi all , This 'll be a short message , with a longer one later .
First things first : I am alive .
Family 's doing well , including Harper : There 's been a lot going on , but that 's a lousy excuse to be radio silent for this long .
I 'm sorry about that .
This does n't justify it , but it 's symptomatic of one thing : I 've been managing my energy poorly .
I 'm being stretched too thin .
That warrants more explanation , and I 'll say more soon .
What I want you to know right now is that I 'm going to be resigning from Escape Pod .
This is n't actually a negative , although it probably sounds that way .
It 's the right thing to do for myself and it's the right thing to do for the podcast .
There 's a plan in the works to bring new energy in -- one or more people who will do better by you than I have lately .
Escape
Pod wo n't be going away .
I really do think the podcast matters .
The stories matter , and the audience matters .
And I 'm not going to say you 'll never hear my voice again .
But I wo n't be trying to keep everything on my shoulders .
That worked for a few years , and I felt I needed to keep coming back to it .
But I think you deserve better .
And we 're going to work to make sure you get it .
Whew .
So .
How 's things with you ?
In 1940s and 1950s , right after the World War 2 Russia had to recover from the consequences of the Nazi invasion .
Lots had to be done and as we know to complete something you need to have enough energy .
And energy at that times as well as it is much likely now meant oil .
At that times the known oil reserves differed from what people in Russia know about it now .
The main places to drill for oil was Southern Russia on contrary to frozen Northern Siberian regions as it ’s for now .
And the gemstone of the Soviet Oil production was Caspian sea region , mainly the territories that are an independent state of Aizerbajan now .
So after a massive attack of oil thirsty state the lands of this previously oil - saturated region little by little got exhausted of the black mineral treasure and the need for new sources of it arouse .
Now it ’s not clear who was that this genius who first came up with an idea of getting the oil right from the sea bottom where it was still plenty of it and for this purpose to build a real city 42 km ( 25 miles ) off the coast right in the middle of the sea , but what we know is that this idea came into play and by some crazy chance it got support from that times Soviet leaders who leveraged it with the all support the biggest ( by the territory ) state could offer at that time .
What this meant is that in a matter of just a few month a real town was built right in the middle of the nowhere on giant steel blocks coming from the sea bottom , from as deep as hundreds of feet down .
And they called it “ Oil Stones ” .
And that was really a city !
Just one fact : the length of the streets of this one - of - a- kind town was exceeding 350 km ( 200 miles ) if combined .
There were nine stored buildings , schools , industry complexes and fountains .
Lawns with green grass and children playing ball .
And all that is forty two kilometeres from the nearest Earth surface close !
As Soviet Union was keeping its achievements behind the iron curtain less was known to the rest of the world about such engineering wonder being built .
Later , the new Northern reserves of oil were discovered which exceeded hundred times the ones they had in Caspian Sea region so the Soviet oil production industry giant moved away from that place , making it semi abandoned .
But even now this place according to what has been said has more than the 2,000 inhabitants .
A true example of what human is capable of achieving , maybe one of the biggest man made structures on Earth and how small we sometimes know on such places around the world .
Also there is a good old Soviet documentary footage from this place , made on its rise , where you still
can see the fountains working , people are happy and no shadow of coming times can be guessed looking
at the place itself and at the faces of its inhabitants .

The brewing battle between the journalists and the political commentators at Fox News took a new turn today as Hill reporter Carl Cameron refuted the right wing , including FNC ’s own Glenn Beck ’s attack , on the so called Slaughter Solution as an unprecedented move to pass healthcare reform .
Cameron said , “ Deeming has been used literally for centuries , and it is legislative language that says look we are going to consider this already done . ”
The brewing battle between the journalists at Fox News and Glenn Beck took a new turn today as Hill reporter Carl Cameron refuted the right wing , including FNC ’s own Glenn Beck ’s attack , on the so called Slaughter Solution as an unprecedented move to pass healthcare reform .
Cameron said , “ Deeming has been used literally for centuries . ”
The Slaughter Solution is a proposal by Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D - NY ) to use deeming to advance the healthcare reform bill through the House .
In essence , it would help the bill clear a legislative hurdle by passing a rule approving debate on the second Senate bill .
After the rule is passed , the first bill will be considered agreed upon .
On Monday , Slaughter pointed out that this procedure has been used in the House since 1933 , and she was backed up today on Fox News .

Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
While the right wing has been trying to portray the Slaughter Solution as unprecedented in American history , on FNC ’s America ’s Newsroom today , Carl Cameron said , “ Deeming has been used literally for centuries , and it is legislative language that says look , we are going to consider this done so that we can move on to the next thing .
As a political matter and as a historical matter , one can see how Democrats who vote for the reconciliation package will still have to answer to their voters who understand that healthcare is included in it . ”
Here is Beck claiming that deeming is a new idea :
The Republican position is rife with hypocrisy on this issue as when they were the majority in the House they set new records for the use of deeming .
According to a 2006 column in Roll Call by Don Wolfensberger , ”
When Republicans took power in 1995 , they soon lost their aversion to self - executing rules ( deeming ) and proceeded to set new records under Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga . ) .
There were 38 and 52 self - executing rules in the 104th and 105th Congresses ( 1995 - 1998 ) , making up 25 percent and 35 percent of all rules , respectively .
Under Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) there were 40 , 42 and 30 self - executing rules in the 106th , 107th and 108th Congresses ( 22 percent , 37 percent and 22 percent , respectively ) .
Thus far in the 109th Congress , self - executing rules make up about 16 percent of all rules . ”
Howard Kurtz had a piece in yesterday ’s Washington Post about how Glenn Beck is dividing Fox News , and the journalists at the network are growing concerned that Beck is redefining them .
I think what we saw out Cameron was a moment of journalism that was not in tow with the right wing media / Glenn Beck line .
It will be interesting to see what direction Fox News goes in , but my guess is that they will follow the money .
Entertainment and propaganda will take center stage , as rare moments of journalism will be few and far between .
Politicians from the three main parties and football supporters ' groups have united in calling for the Football League to make public who owns its clubs after the league approved as " fit and proper " the offshore owners of Leeds United while keeping their identity private .
The sports minister , Gerry Sutcliffe , said : " Fans of any football club have a right to know who the owners are .
We want to see greater supporter representation in the running of football clubs and far greater accountability .
The League should insist on clubs making public to their supporters who owns them . "
He was joined by the Conservative shadow sports minister , Hugh Robertson , who argued : " As with Parliament and many other areas of public life , transparency is going to be an increasing requirement and expectation .
That includes publicly identifying the owners of football clubs .
Football should reform its governance , to include greater supporter representation on the board of clubs . "
That call was echoed by the Liberal Democrat MP for Harrogate , Phil Willis , who has long criticised the anonymity of Leeds ' ownership , routed via companies in offshore tax havens .
" At the very least , supporters of a club have a right to know who owns it .
As an act of faith and goodwill , I hope the Leeds United board now publish the documentation they have presented to the Football League so that all sense of mystery can be removed . "
The Premier League does now require its clubs to publish the names of all shareholders with stakes of 10 % or more , but the Football League does not .
Instead , clubs must tell the League 's chairman , Lord Mawhinney , and three other senior executives , who the ultimate owners are , but the information is not made public .
Leeds have declined requests from the Guardian , following the League 's ratification , to say who the ultimate owners are .
The only response this week came from Peter Boatman of Château Fiduciare , the Geneva - based financial administrator of Leeds ' holding company , Forward Sports Fund .
" It is not necessary for you to have that information , " he said .
The politicians were joined by the Leeds United Supporters Club , the national Football Supporters ' Federation and Supporters Direct in calling for League clubs ' owners to be publicly identified .
" Like all football clubs , Leeds United 's character is that of a public institution wrapped in a privately owned business and that creates a mismatch , " said Dave Boyle , the chief executive of Supporters Direct .
" The authorities can recognise that public nature by sending a clear message : you can remain a private anonymous citizen , and you can own a football club , but you cannot do both . "
Boatman was named last May as an FSF director and confirmed this week he had passed the fit and proper person test .
He pointed to the progress Leeds have made on the field and financially this season , and said questions about who owns the club would be seen as unwelcome criticism with the club pushing for promotion .
He added that no information has been withheld from the League .
Summing up Leeds ' position under the current ownership , Boatman said : " The situation at the football club has improved immensely , which is very satisfying when some other clubs are in serious financial trouble .
We have never denied information to the Football League and although I cannot confirm or deny who the shareholders are , the only thing I can say about the structures we control is that they are all above board . "
The League 's approval of Leeds ' owners follows inquiries it began in October after the Guardian revealed that the club 's chairman , Ken Bates , had revised his account of its ownership at a court case in Jersey .
In January last year , Bates ' solicitors told Jersey 's royal court , which is hearing a dispute between Leeds and a finance company , Admatch , that he and his long term financial adviser , Patrick Murrin , jointly owned " management shares " in the club 's holding company , the Forward Sports Fund .
In May , Bates swore an affidavit stating that the previous statement had been " not correct " and " an error on my part " .
In fact , he stated , he did not own a management share in FSF .
The affidavit attached a letter from Château Fiduciare , which said FSF had 10,000 shares , owned by shareholders who have not been named .
The League confirmed it had written to Leeds seeking clarification because directors and 30 % shareholders in its clubs must be identified to it and passed as fit and proper people who have no recent criminal convictions and have not run a football club into insolvency twice .
The League made no further comment until a spokesman said last month : " The Football League has concluded its enquiries regarding Leeds United 's fit and proper persons test documentation and has addressed the issues raised with the club .
Following further information from Leeds , the League is now satisfied that the club is compliant with Football League regulations . "
No further details have been released .
Sutcliffe this week acknowledged the moves the League has made in securing detailed financial information from clubs and requiring outstanding tax to be paid , but said " more can still be done " to make clubs more transparent .
A League source said clubs currently have " no appetite " to introduce a rule requiring their owners to be made public .
Mawhinney , who is due to retire this month after seven years in which he has overseen a series of reforms , did indicate that he believes the League should go further .
" We have come a long way , " he said .
" Clubs can not play in our league unless we know who the beneficial owners are .
Could we do more ?
Yes – but it is a matter of priorities .
Eventually I think football will be strengthened if the ownership of clubs goes public . "

“ Now , there ’s something else – now they can be the Doctor in brand new episodes .
Doctor Who : The Adventure Games will offer fans of the Doctor a unique opportunity to enter his world , face his challenges and grapple with his deadliest foes .
“ By developing these games alongside the new TV series , we ’ve been able to weave exciting narrative strands with the very finest game design to create a new kind of Doctor Who , which can be enjoyed by the whole family . ”
“ There are n’t 13 episodes of Doctor Who this year , ” adds Piers Wenger , Head of Drama , BBC Wales and Executive Producer , Doctor Who .
“ There are 17 – four of which are interactive .
Everything you see and experience within the game is part of the Doctor Who universe : we ’ll be taking you to places you ’ve only ever dreamed about seeing – including locations impossible to create on television . ”
Simon Nelson , Head of BBC Multiplatform in Vision , continues : “ A few years ago we could n’t have dreamt of commissioning such an innovative form of drama .
By integrating the creation of these ‘ interactive episodes ’ with the development of the TV series , we ’ve been able to create amazing two - hour dramas in which you control the action .
We ’ve all imagined what it would be like to come face - to - face with some of the universe ’s most terrifying monsters – now viewers can find out for themselves .
“ Establishing new forms of drama is exactly what the BBC should be doing .
By aiming these ‘ interactive episodes ’ at the broad audience of TV show – unique in British television , in that it encompasses at least three generations – we ’re aiming to encourage the family to gather round the PC or Mac in the same way they do the television .
Driving computer literacy is a keystone of the BBC ’s public service remit and we expectDoctor Who : The Adventure Games to be hugely popular in the homes of Britain this year .
“ Only the BBC could produce such an innovative slice of new drama .
We ’re offering two - hour original Doctor Who episodes to production standards on a par with the TV series , working with the very best creatives within the UK .
We ’re hugely proud of Doctor Who : The Adventure Games , which will establish new standards in interactive drama and allow families the country over to enjoy Doctor Who stories in unique and innovative ways . ”
“ Doctor Who : The Adventure Games will offer the chance for Doctor Who fans to visit places they ’ve only dreamed off , facing off against monsters they ’ve previously had to imagine , ” concludes Anwen Aspden , Executive Producer , BBC Wales Online .
“ Players will visit places which have never been shown on television – and these will go on to define the look and feel of future TV episodes . ”
The exact titles of the four episodes are being kept secret for the time being , but the four original stories will take players on a journey throughout time and space , including one location from the Doctor Who series which has never been seen before on screen .
Players will encounter new and original monsters , in stories which form part of the overall Doctor Who canon .
Brass Issue Not Resolved
When I last reported on the ongoing question of the release of once - fired military brass to the civilian marketplace , it seemed the issue might finally be resolving itself .
Any passing on of that impression seems to have been either premature or unintentionally erroneous .
Seems the efforts of base commanders to skate around a Congressional order not to try and sell the brass outside the prescribed process - sales via auction via Government Liquidations , an outside auction house for government properties - has been an ongoing process .
As a result , Montana ’s United States Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester have sent a very strongly - worded letter to the Department of Defense insisting on answers to some very pointed questions on the matter of military brass destruction .
The issue came to light after sales solicitations from ATK ( NYSE : ATK ) were disclosed by Montana Shooting Sports Association ( MSSA ) head Gary Marbut .
In the ATK sales pieces , base commanders were told how they could sell their once - fired brass to ATK for demilling rather than sending it through the prescribed governmental process .
That sales process would result in the funds going directly into each base ’s funds instead of the treasury .
Despite the fact that most military commanders would probably be better stewards of those funds than Washington , the process is basically a no - no .
When given a clear directive to follow , it ’s not only unusual for military officials to fail to comply , it ’s the equivalent of issuing a throw - down at Washington .
The most unsettling part of the report , however , was a series of quotes taken from the ATK program literature being directed to the commanders .
In those materials , several reasons for participating in a direct sale rather than a government liquidation were quoted .
None portrayed potential civilian purchasers , reloaders or shooters in a very positive light .
Those included :
“ We cannot allow this reloaded ammunition to fall into the hands of militias . ”
“ Keeps Military Grade Brass from being re-loaded by unauthorized users . ”
“ To PREVENT anyone from using your scrap ammunition components for non-military purposes . ” ( Emphasis in the original )
“ Assurability for the [ military ] installation , that no one can use this cartridge against law enforcement or our military personnel , by reloading the case . ”
Get the idea ?
When I contacted ATK President and CEO Mark DeYoung , I received an official response that described the presentations as “ dated ” , promising they would be “ immediately withdrawn . ”
“ ATK , ” it concluded , “ fully supports the provision passed by Congress last year to ensure that demilitarized spent brass casings remain available for civilian use . ”
Seems , however , that not everyone might have gotten the word .
We received word from reliable sources telling us that the same ATK person who had issued the now - withdrawn earlier documents had notified some of the bases participating in the demilled brass project “ we are doing the same thing still , same goal , just different words … ”
Even if the whole affair was a misunderstanding , there ’s a clear directive issued from Congress to the military that no Congress - appropriated funds may be used to destroy brass .
Here ’s the excerpt from the 2009 Department of Defense appropriation by Congress :
“ None of the funds available to the Department of Defense may be used to demilitarize or dispose of M - 1 Carbines , M - 1 Garand rifles , M - 14 rifles , .. 22 caliber rifles , .30 caliber rifles , or M - 1911 pistols , or to demilitarize or destroy small arms ammunition or ammunition components that are not otherwise prohibited from commercial sale under Federal law , unless the small arms ammunition or ammunition components are certified by the Secretary of the Army or designee as unserviceable or unsafe for further use . ”
Even if it ’s a case of everyone not being informed , it ’s not sitting well with the same Montana senators who went to bat for civilians when the whole ammo demilling issue first surfaced .
The pair has sent a letter to Defense Logistics Agency head Vice Admiral Alan K. Thompson demanding answers , and setting an April 15 deadline for receipt of those answers .
After reminding Vice Admiral Thompson the domestic market for ammunition was “ highly sensitive to shortages of spent cartridge cases ” they expressed their concern that “ certain installation contracts with private entities for the sale of once - fired small arms cartridge cases under the QRP ( Qualified Recycling Program ) might not be in compliance with this law . ”
The pair then gave Thompson until April 15 to provide :
- the number and location of military installations that have contracted with private sources for the sale of their once - fired small arms cartridge cases under the QRP . ,
- An assessment of whether these contracts are in compliance with Section 8019 or PL 1111 - 1111
- An assessment of whether once - fired small arms cartridge cases sold to private entities under the QRP earn as much revenue as otherwise would be earned if the brass were put up for public bid through government liquidations .
- The steps our agency is taking to ensure that all interested buyers have the opportunity to purchased once - fired small arms cartridge cases and an assessment of whether your agency is taking every step to assure the maximum availablility of once - fired small arms cartridge cases to those who repurchase them for resale and reuse via the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office ( DRMO ) system . ”
In other words , the matter of civilian access to once - fired military brass remains an open issue – at least until April 15 .
At that point , the situation may either stabilize or continue to spiral .
We ’ll keep you posted .

Introduction :
Video cards have come a long way over the past couple years .
Their ever increasing performance has to meet the needs of the everyone from the work station user to the high end gamer .
This card from Sapphire is aimed squarely at the latter segment of the market .
As games become more graphically demanding and with people moving to ever larger resolutions , you need to have the hardware that can handle the load .
The HD 5870 is a proven performer in its own right as shown in countless reviews and feedback in forums across the web .
With this kind of buzz the only thing left to do is improve upon a proven commodity .
This is something Sapphire does and does quite well as seen in the past with their Atomic , Vapor - X and Toxic versions of some of ATIs best products .
For the Sapphire Toxic HD 5870 2GB card , Sapphire has bumped up the clock speeds on the Cypress core and increased the amount of frame buffer memory to 2GB ( from the standard 1GB ) , in addition to a slight bump in clock speed to 1225 Mhz .
Instead of using the reference cooling solution , Sapphire has equipped this Toxic Edition overclocked card with its proprietary Vapor - X cooling to keep the thermals in check .
All this combines to give the consumer another option for increased performance .
Lets face it , not everyone likes to tinker with the workings of a video card for more performance , these people just to want to pop in the video card and start fraggin ' .
Lets see how the Toxic Edition HD 5870 2GB card performs .
From the specs alone it looks as though it may jump up a little closer to Nvidias latest , the GTX 480 .
Closer Look :
The Toxic HD 5870 2GB card from Sapphire comes in retail packaging that steps away from the use of " Ruby " ( ATI 's heroine ) with the use of a sinister figure under a shroud .
The front panel of the packaging shows that this card is equipped with 2GB of GDDR5 memory and is a factory overclocked video card .
Some of the Toxic HD 5870 2 GB 's features are listed on the front panel and include the comparable compute power , Eyefinity and CrossfireX support , the fact that the card features native HDMI and DisplayPort connectivity and the inclusion of software from Arcsoft .
The rear panel goes into more detail on more features of the card including the Vapor - X cooling , Black Diamond chokes , Advanced GDDR5 memory and ATI stream technology .
On the bottom left you have a long list of awards Sapphires products have earned over the years showing that their products are well received and present a value to the consumer .
Slipping off the outer sleeve , you are left with a cardboard box that houses the Toxic Edition HD 5870 .
The paper goods that Sapphire uses for packaging are 100 % recyclable , this is something that helps the environment as well as its CRS ( Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability ) goals .
The card is housed in a formed cardboard housing , with a bit of closed cell foam to keep the card in place in its bubble wrapped bag .
Under the card is a box that contains the accessory bundle .
Sapphires video cards always come with everything you need to use the full capabilities of the card .
This bundle includes the instruction manual , driver disk , Arcsoft software disk , DVI to D- sub connection , CrossfireX bridge connector and a pair of power adapters to hook up to the 6 and 8 pin PCIe power connections .
Pretty much everything you need to get started .
With the packaging out of the way , lets dig a little deeper into the card itself to see what makes it tick .
Every season , at every company , there has to be that one terrible intern .
Usually they just fall asleep at work , or show up drunk .
Allow us to introduce you to one intern candidate who sounds much , much worse .
A tipster sent us these emails from a real intern applicant at a company in New York .
After the company did n't get back to him after one full day , the would - be intern sent them this reminder note :
Goodness !
The company wrote back to the applicant saying that the internships had already been filled , and by the way , the note he sent was rude .
This was his response :
Interns : Always teaching .
The Population ExplosionAccording to the Population Reference Bureau , in 1991 , there were about 5.4 billion people in the world .
The global birth to death rate was 27/9 , meaning that for every person that dies , three more babies are born .
From 1990 to 1991 , the population increased by 95 million people , and now has continued to grow at that rate .
This may appear to be no danger , but if one were to think of it as a pond doubling its amount of lily pads for 40 days , they 'd see it differently .
It would start out with one lily pad , the next day it has two , and on the 39th day it is half filled .
However , in one day , on the 40th day , it will be completely filled .
The Earth 's population is doubling about every 40 years .
We do n't want to wait until the 79th year to fix our problem or else humankind will not have enough time to change the inevitable obstacles that come with overpopulation .
In his book , The Population Explosion , Paul Ehrlich , a famous population controlist , came up with the equation I = PAT .
He believes the impact on the environment is equal to the population multiplied by the affluence ( meaning the amount of energy and food supply the population consumes ) multiplied by the amount of destructive technology a country has .
He showed that the impact is directly affected by the population .
Therefore with a larger population , there is a greater impact on the Earth 's water , air , and land .
A common problem that people think is associated with overpopulation is running out of space to live , but there are also many other environmental predicaments that it causes .
More people use more cars , need more firewood , drink more water .
This causes more air pollution , more land ruined , and more water to disappear .
Therefore , population control is necessary on an international level in order to protect our environment .
There are experts who believe that population control is not needed such as in Singapore .
The government in Singapore decided that it would be better for the country to grow in population so that they are able to help their economy .
Many less developed countries promote population growth because they want their economy to grow .
The experts who believe that it is better for us to let the population increase or decrease on its own also think that overpopulation will never become a problem .
Let us take a walk back in history , and unravel the mysteries that have surrounded cats .
These animals have gone through every emotion displayed by human beings ; they have been loved , hated , worshipped and persecuted .
Despite , all this , the cat is still a human beings best friend .
The African Wildcat was the first to be domesticated some 5000 years ago .
There are more than 3000 types of domestic cats , but only 8 % are pedigree .
And , unlike other cats , they are found all over the world … in abundance .
In the US , there are more cats than dogs , and people annually spend more on cat food than on baby food .
Cats will fight each other over territory , mating rights and to defend their young .
Kittens will also frequently playfight with one another as practice for later life .
Catfights consist mainly of grappling and powerful slaps with claws out to the opponent ’s face and body .
Humans may find it difficult to distinguish between cats playing and a genuine fight .
The poaching of elephants in Democratic Republic of Congo has “ dramatically increased ” since 2006 , a group of researchers said .
The findings were based on data gathered from 11 parks and reserves throughout Congo and compiled by a group of American and Canadian researchers affiliated with the TL2 conservation project in central Congo .
Most elephant deaths came at the hands of organized armed groups , the researchers said in a statement on March 16 .
Congo is recovering from more than a decade of war that left millions dead , and armed groups in the east of the country still use national reserves as hideouts .
“ The large scale commercial based poaching exploded in 2009 , and is comparable to levels in the 1980s which led to a major decline of Congo ’s elephants , ” the researchers said .
Congo ’s elephant population is now around 20,000 , down from an estimated 100,000 a decade ago , the statement said .

Dr Aubrey Levin , who in South Africa was known as Dr Shock for his use of electricity to " cure " gay military conscripts , was arrested after a patient secretly filmed the psychiatrist allegedly making sexual advances .
Levin , who worked at the University of Calgary 's medical school , has been suspended from practising and is free on bail of C$ 50,000 ( £ 32,000 ) on charges of repeatedly indecently assaulting a 36 - year - old man .
The police say they are investigating similar claims by nearly 30 other patients .
The Alberta justice department is reviewing scores of criminal convictions in which Levin was a prosecution witness .
Levin has worked in Canada for 15 years since leaving South Africa , where he was chief psychiatrist in the apartheid - era military and became notorious for using electric shocks to " cure " gay white conscripts .
He also held conscientious objectors against their will at a military hospital because they were " disturbed " and subjected them to powerful drug regimens .
South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission heard that Levin was guilty of " gross human rights abuses " including chemical castration of gay men .
But after arriving in Canada in 1995 he managed to suppress public discussion of his past by threatening lawsuits against news organisations that attempted to explore it .
How to Decide
One way to figure out whether to buy or rent is to look at the rent ratio : the purchase price of a typical house divided by the annual rent of a similar house .
A number above 20 means you should consider renting .
A number well below 20 makes a better case for buying .
House phone lines were nearing capacity on Tuesday as conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh encouraged fans to call in their objections on healthcare legislation .
The House e-mail system was also deluged in what the House ’s technology office called “ a very significant spike ” in traffic .
ADVERTISEMENT
The office of the Chief Administrative Officer ( CAO ) sent out a system - wide advisory to member offices at 2 p.m.
Tuesday , warning them of the dramatic increase in traffic .
“ Our phone system is nearing capacity , ” said Jeff Ventura , spokesman for the CAO .
“ It got critical enough whereby we notified all systems ’ administrators throughout the House that the phone systems are overloading . ”
At the top of Limbaugh ’s website are toll - free and local phone numbers for the Capitol operator , plus the message : “ Call the Capitol Switchboard , ” followed by “ Code Red : Click Here for List of Targeted Congressmen . ”
While Ventura said the CAO did n’t have specific numbers of how many calls the House was receiving , he did say that it would have to be “ an extraordinary volume ” in order for it to clog the system .
Ventura said the surge in calls , which results in occasional busy signals for callers , is likely to persist throughout the week .
The House is preparing for a possible weekend vote on healthcare reform .
Ventura added there ’s not much that can be done to alleviate the busy signals and advised callers to keep calling until they get through .
“ Unlike computers , which can be scaled to accommodate something like this in real time , phone lines are hard - wired , so you have your capacity and once the capacity is full , you ’re going to get the good old - fashioned busy signal , ” he said .
“ And that ’s what ’s happening . ”
A similar deluge of communications from voters came in 2008 when the House had to limit the number of e-mails being sent to lawmakers on the financial bailout bill in order to prevent House websites from crashing .
As a result , some constituents got a “ try back at a later time ” response if they used the House website to e-mail their lawmakers about the bill that was defeated in the House .
And three years ago , then - CNN anchor Lou Dobbs and conservative talk radio hosts helped to defeat an immigration bill after they urged listeners to call Capitol operators .
The effort overloaded the switchboard , and senators ultimately voted against advancing the immigration measure despite strong bipartisan support and the backing of President George W. Bush .

Over the last couple of months , Keith has brought us joy every Sunday with his interviews .
Today , the burden of responsibility falls on Keith ’s shoulders to bring us tragic news …
It is my unpleasant duty to report the passing of our friend and fellow builder Nate “ nnenn ” Nielson .
Nate ’s death was the result of an automobile accident earlier this month .
A resident of Tekoa , Washington , Nate was a father , an artist , and a professor specializing in graphic design .
Nate is survived by his beloved wife and two sons ages 3 and 8 .
It is important to Nate ’s family that he is remembered by our community , one that he took great joy in participating in .
Above all they want Nate to be remembered as a devoted husband and father , and for us to know that his interest in the brick was inseparable from his love for his boys .
Nate was notorious for his brevity , and when I was searching through his models , interviews , and comments for inspiration , this quote jumped off the screen :
“ Ha !
Spring break a week ago .
Rainy day today .
No friends .
Two boys . ”
Nate ’s other great passion was teaching the principles of design and graphic art , something that should seem obvious to our community .
It was Nate ’s goal to encourage others and to push people to their creative potential .
In our small corner of the universe , I think it is safe to say : mission accomplished , Nate .
I did n’t know Nate very well , certainly not as well as I would have liked .
We did however share a love of the brick , 70 ’s sci- fi and being a father .
I always imagined I ’d run into nnenn at a convention … that he ’d slip out of the crowd on public - day looking like a dead ringer for Christopher Walken .
In this fantasy he would walk up to my model on display and say something like :
“ Guess what Goldman ?!
I ’ve got a fever , and the only prescription … is more cowbell ” .
I ’ve always been a fan of Nate ’s models , even when I initially disliked him in a superficial way for his heretical tendencies with my sacred bricks .
In time I grew to respect him for his uncompromising stance and commitment to form over purist devotion .
It was my distinct pleasure to interview nnenn last month , and in the process we exchanged some fun emails ; I only wish I ’d asked better questions .
You know a builder is big - time when he not only gets an entire scale named after him , but an element as well .
Nnenn ’s consistent level of quality and production since his debut in late 2006 is nothing short of extraordinary .
I can say without exaggeration that Nate influenced a generation of builders , and even an old man or two like me .
Nate had 1347 contacts on Flickr , 1347 students for a guy who loved to teach .
I think time will prove that he taught us well .
For those of you missed it , James Wadsworth of LAML Radio conducted an audio interview with Nate last summer .
Tom over at Masoko Tanga also has a wonderful interview with Nate on his site .
Missing Man Vic Viper Formation – BrickWorld & BrickCon
I ’m organizing a fly - in style community build for the Brickworld 2010 fan convention in Chicago , and potentially at BrickCon 2010 in Seattle .
Anyone who is interested in celebrating the life and models of nnenn is invited to bring or mail a small space - fighter in his iconic Vic Viper style to the convention .
The vipers will be arranged in the traditional “ missing man formation ” common to air forces around the world .
Nate drew inspiration from his father who served the US as an F - 16 fighter pilot , making the fly - in seem even more appropriate .
So if you ’d like to participate in the formation , contact me at Legomankeith AT aol DOT com for further details .
Guestbook
It only seems fitting to close this tribute to a legend with a word or two from some familiar voices in the community .
The Brothers Brick and I invite all of you to add your thoughts to this memorial guestbook .
There is no rhyme or reason to these first 20 fans ; they are simply friends that I reached out to , to help make sense of Nate ’s untimely passing .
The one exception is Peter L. Morris , who contacted me after speaking directly with Nate ’s widow and graciously invited me to participate in this tribute .
Pete was closer to Nate than most of us , and his insights into Nate as a friend have been invaluable as we prepared this tribute .
Rest in peace nnenn , you ’ll be missed .
Read the guestbook and leave your own comments after the jump :
Peter L. Morris
My first real encounter with nnenn was on his Brickshelf account .
I was checking it almost every night , and a small fighter appeared with this caption : “ QrT - 74 .
Upallik standard law enforcement .
Ironically , very popular among pirates .
Nod to the starfighters of peterlmorris , one of the better colorist on brickshelf . ”
I laughed because I do n’t know what I ’m doing when it comes to color , as I have a form of color blindness , so I took it as a great compliment , especially from a guy like him who burst onto the scene seemingly with no incubation period and a massive collection of impressive MOCs .
The bricks to him were a means to an end .
Like an itch that is impossible to satisfy , he saw things that needed to be shared , and made them come alive .
We are all impoverished with his loss , but not just for the lack of MOCs .
He desired , perhaps naively , a community that shared more than it quibbled , and listened more than it spoke .
I miss him and will continue to miss him .
Good bye , Nate .
You ca n’t be forgotten .
Rodney Bistline
I am certainly a ‘ nnenn fanboy ’ when it comes to Nate ’s Lego creations and I know I ’m not alone in viewing him as an all - time favorite builder .
But I was also impressed by the way he generally presented himself in our online community .
Despite his respectable secrecy in some regards , he seemed like someone who wore his heart on his sleeve and wore it well .
He continually gave back by sharing his expertise , being active in the ongoing social life of the community , and by presenting us all with a seemingly endless supply of amazing creations .
For me , many a tedious or tense day was momentarily brightened by setting eyes on a new nnenn masterpiece .
My thoughts and prayers go out to his family .
I hope they know how much he inspired so many of us .
Of all the “ people I ’ve never met ” in the Legoverse , he ’s one of the few I could consider a friend and really hoped to meet one day .
Very saddened to hear of his passing .
Ley Ward
A farewell to a man I barely knew .
In our online community of LEGO enthusiasts , there are several whom I have met in person and several whom I would like to meet .
Nnenn was of the latter category .
I was quite excited by the possibility of his attendance at BrickCon this past year as I had hoped to meet him and perhaps shoot the breeze about music or whatever .
Sadly that never happened .
Despite the paradox ( having never known his name , let alone seen his face ) , he put a very human face on the non-purist side of our hobby .
Rather than a youngster with sharpie in hand or clay at the ready … he was a truly talented artist ( who made it clear he was not happy with that label and had a solid professional interest in that very subject ) who caused many of us to question our own purism and aspirations to art .
Perhaps the best way I could honour his passing is by cutting an element and including a non-LEGO piece in a creation , not to change my own approach , but to never forget his challenge to all of us .
He was truly talented and prolific , often mind - bendingly so .
He will be truly missed .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family .
Andrew Lee
The passing of the prolific and talented nnenn is a profound loss for both myself and the Lego community .
Nate single handedly pushed and challenged the limits of our hobby and what can be done with the brick .
A man shrouded in mystery , Nate was both a gentleman and a scholar .
He will be missed but his work will live on .
Nannan Zhang
Nnenn was an inspiration for the community .
We knew him not only as a brilliant builder but also as an innovator who is unafraid to push the limits of creativity and even the medium itself .
The countless space creations displaying his unique style could easily populate an entire idea book .
I once asked him when he would stop building spaceships , and he told me he would keep going until he has exhausted every possible configuration .
I did n’t think it was possible , but neither did he .
Mark Neumann
I ’m reflecting on the builder known to me as nnenn .
Realizing that I really never knew him , yet feeling like I just lost a friend .
I have a sense of sorrow , knowing that our community has been robbed of one of the best builders our hobby has had the fortune of knowing .
We ’re a curious group , us fans of Lego .
There really are not that many of us , and the loss of one affects us all .
Nate was part of the collective creativity that makes our universe , and when one of those stars in the collective suddenly goes dark , the entire landscape is darker because of it .
But then we find ourselves looking , searching really , and while we may never find that same star we find other light .
Lots of light , more than perhaps we ’ve never seen before .
I find myself thankful that I have this group to surround myself with and feel its brightness .
We are the sum of all we travel with , directly or indirectly ; influenced in great and insignificant ways .
It is in this spirit that I celebrate my brother .
Namaste ’ nnenn .
Jon Palmer
I never hung out with nnenn .
I never shared a beer with him in a bar packed with other LEGO nerds or traded driving shifts with him on a cross-country road trip to a LEGO convention .
I never traded emails or IMs with him .
I did n’t know his name …
But his coming and going has effected me nonetheless .
A quick punch in the face ; something to shake me up and give me pause .
The man himself never wasted his time on too many words or unnecessary discourse .
His economy of language was legendary .
And like all great LEGO builders his creations spoke for him .
Good on nnenn .
The other night I talked to someone who talked to someone who had just talked to nnenn ’s wife .
The builder had died in a car wreck .
A man I had never met in any conventional way is now gone and I ’ve been staring off into space randomly in the middle of the day ever since .
nnenn ’s entrance onto the LEGO building scene in 2006 coincided with my gradual exit .
The very first time I heard about him , it was from a space builder telling me that there was this new guy who uses “ clone ” LEGO parts along with his real LEGO pieces .
He was using whatever bit of plastic or sticker or modified part he wanted .
His obvious skill , matched with the perceived subversion of our building values caused quite a stir initially .
Although I ’m a part purist myself I never gave much thought to this controversy … and I like some good subversion .
Let ’s hear it for chaos and new blood .
Regardless , nnenn soon shrugged off his reputation as some sort of a rabble - rouser and quickly became a LEGO building god .
His output was staggering .
nnenn ’s understanding of color theory was perfect .
Adventurous .
His appreciation of clean lines and a well thought out design was apparent .
nnenn built a great LEGO spaceship .
He built hundreds of them .
nnenn humbly disregarded his creations as art .
They were simply craft or toy .
Something that was just for fun .
Something that just wooshed through space and went pew - pew and blew up aliens .
But indulge me for a moment and consider nnenn ’s creations as more than just LEGO models .
More than just pop-culture creations .
Consider these colorful objects as communication .
And let ’s say the single greatest thing you or I can do while we are here is communicate to one another .
Assume the method of this communication is entirely irrelevant .
That this message is delivered in the form of a song or a book or a painting or even a small LEGO creation is unimportant .
What is important is that you speak to the world .
Make your vision clear .
The thing you alone see or hear in your head .
Show it to us .
To your friends , to strangers and to your sons .
It can therefore be concluded that stoic , quiet and anonymous nnenn in fact shouted at the LEGO community and the world for 4 amazing years .
Shouted the images and colors and ideas in his head at all of us .
Thank you , nnenn .
Thank you for never ever shutting up .
You are greatly missed .
Nathan Proudlove
The first time we really got a glimpse into nnenn ’s life was the August 2008 interview on LAML radio .
I was immediately endeared to him upon discovering that he , like myself , was a stay at home dad .
He related stories of building with his young sons that resonated with me and my own experience building for and with my son .
Most in the Lego community will remember nnenn as the mysterious , rebellious , anonymous , larger than life entity whose presence could not be ignored and will not be forgotten now that he ’s gone , but the void created by his absence from our midst is nothing compared to that he left at home with his wife and kids .
My thoughts and prayers are with them during this tragic time .
Tyler Clites
I like to think of nnenn as the infamous “ sasquatch ” or “ bigfoot ” of the online Lego community .
Nobody new what he looked like , his image was a blur as a result of his secretive nature and his “ footprint ” on the Lego community was enormous .
When I first became aware of the enigma that was nnenn , I despised him .
I saw him as a cheater without the creativity or ability to use Lego parts in the way they were designed .
It did n’t take long for me to realize how wrong I was .
In his use of non-Lego parts , he was more creative than any purist builder .
He opened his mind to the possibilities of brick - built art , while the rest of us remain in our box of Lego without even looking at the possibilities beyond .
I know that I speak of nnenn exclusively in terms of his achievements and art , but I ’m confident that he placed a little of himself into each of his MOCs .
Loosing an artist such as nnenn is like losing an artist like van Gogh or Michelangelo .
Their death is a great loss , but they will live on through their art .
My prayers go out to nnenn ’s family and anyone who had the privileged of personally knowing such a great artist .
Pete Reid
Nnenn and I collaborated a while back .
He was a pleasure to work with online , and a good friend .
I always planned to meet him some day , and we were going to drink beer and he ’d tell me stuff about spaceships and art and it would have been amazing .
His legacy will never die .
Soren Roberts
I did n’t know Nnenn very well — we had one or two email conversations , we dropped comments on one another ’s latest models .
It feels a little strange to be eulogizing someone I never met and did n’t really know .
I do n’t believe in an afterlife .
I ’m sure my saying that offends a lot of people .
But I ’m not going to say something about going to a better place or things happening for a reason .
People die for good reasons , and bad reasons , and no real reason at all .
I ’m sad that his death was one of the last kind .
I ’ll remember Nnenn as a guy who always had something interesting to say .
He had a sense of perspective , which is pretty rare in this hobby .
He irritated the hell out of the people who needed it .
He built good models .
He gave great feedback .
I ’m glad I knew him , however little .
Tim Gould
The internet makes for strange varieties of acquaintance .
I find myself today writing a eulogy for someone whose name I only found out one hour ago .
At first I thought I did n’t really know nnenn and did n’t know what to write but that ’s not really true .
I feel I ’ve chatted , debated , discussed and interacted with him enough to write something .
Three things stand out for me about my acquaintance with nnenn : he was willing to stand by his convictions , he was happy to argue and debate and he adored his family , especially his young boys .
I ’ll focus on these .
I really admired his willingness to build his models using techniques and ideas that the community in general considered ‘ wrong ’ .
I felt it showed a strong sense of character and I respected him for that .
It ’s a trait I wish was more common .
Likewise I enjoyed arguing , debating and generally playing out ideas in an adversarial manner with nnenn .
He was an engaging person whose thoughts were always well constructed .
I thoroughly enjoyed these
interactions and will very much miss them .
Finally it was obvious to anyone just how much nnenn loved the company of his children .
Any discussion of his models would invariably end up with him writing comments about ‘ his boys ’ .
The older the boys got the more his models seemed to reflect what they liked rather than stuff explicitly for himself .
To have such a loving father ripped away is something I wish on noone .
Honestly the news that nnenn had died came as a great shock to me and has left me greatly saddened .
I did not know his name but I will very much miss him .
I wish his widow and especially his boys all the condolences I can .
I hope that nnenn ’s online presence persists long enough for his boys to get to know nnenn retrospectively in the way I was priveleged to know him up until now .
PS .
I was reminded of this sadly prescient comment when I first heard the news .
I know that for me nnenn will be remembered far , far more positively than that .
Shadow Viking ( Peter )
I guess the first thing to come to mind is about LEGO … well , it ’s all about LEGO ; that ’s how I knew him .
So more accurate would be what he did without LEGO .
I think that ’s the best testament I can give .
From my limited interaction he seemed kind and polite , and I always appreciated his comments .
I guess this is a little sappy so I ’ll end here .
And as cliché as it is , rest in peace .
Leigh Holcombe
As a fellow INTP and part - time agoraphobe , I can understand his reluctance to suffer the slings and arrows of fame and criticism .
But he kept building and innovating and sharing in spite of it all .
His creativity and persistence will be sorely missed .
Brian Kescenovitz
“ Yep …another winner from nnenn .
Amazing form ?
Check .
Brilliant color usage ?
Check .
Razor sharp design that is somehow immaculately clean and supremely detailed at the same time ?
Of course …it ’s just nnenn , and he always does that .
It ’s just nnenn … God help me , if this is n’t occasionally the thought that crossed my mind when one of his works of art appeared in my contact photostream on flickr .
And I know I ’m not the only one .
What a colossal injustice , born of the fact that nnenn was simply so good , so often , for so long .
And like so many things , only now when we are deprived of them , do we ( or at least I ) come to fully appreciate them .
Completely irreplaceable in the LEGO community , nnenn ’s body of work will continue to amaze , influence , and inspire builders for years to come .
My most heartfelt condolences to nnenn ’s widow and two sons .
I ca n’t begin to imagine your loss , but perhaps a fleeting moment of peace might be provided by realizing how much nnenn meant to this community , and how badly he will be missed .
Even if some of us are only just now realizing that fact …
Carter Baldwin
Nnenn kept his personal profile online low , generally preferring to let his creations speak for him .
Those creations changed the way that the community builds and challenged the way the community thinks about mixing types of brick .
He was prolifically inventive , and his almost weekly builds across the past three years have always been a source of inspiration and envy for me .
A few weeks ago , out of the blue , he emailed me an edited picture of one of my ships with his classic background and engine flare , after I had posted the difficulties I ’d been having with photoshop .
That was just how he was — always helpful and always surprising .
Lenny Hoffman
Nate , or nnenn as he was known to us , was always a controversial genius .
He built like no one else before , combining color and form in wild and creative ways .
He built more quickly , with a high rate of success .
Often , he ’d post a mind boggling new creation every day for a month in a row , an unprecedent ( except when he ’d do it again and again ) achievement .
He was controversial in his ideas about how to build and in how to commune together .
Many people attacked him , mostly unfairly .
But all of that controversy will fade away with time .
What will remain is how his passion , his creativity , and his willingness to challenge us and himself .
We will all remember Nate , in our discussions and in our building , because he did so much so well .
I did n’t always see eye to eye with , and we had our disagreement .
But Nate showed me that our community , the we , are our best when we build .
When we create .
And there is no one who could build as freely as he could .
I ’ll miss you , Nate .
James Wadsworth
I ’ve never been the greatest interviewer , but when I spoke with nnenn he was more than willing to answer all my questions with honesty and sincerity .
It was n’t long into the interview that nnenn brought up his two boys and his obvious affection towards them .
It seemed to come across that nnenn ’s building was n’t a regular hobby to escape from life , but instead to enjoy it to the utmost with his family .
That is what I ’ll always respect him for .
Dave Shaddix
I must immediately confess that I did n’t have the privilege of getting to know Nate very well .
Nate was an intelligent and well spoken man , but he kept his personal life personal ( a trait that is all too uncommon today ) , so what I best know of Nate or ‘ Nnenn ’ is his work with LEGO modeling .
I regarded Nate as a pillar in the community ; he constantly challenged us to push our abilities and limits , to try new things and to approach each challenge with a new and often interesting perspective .
His style was instantly recognizable and demanded closer inspection due to his innovative usage and technique .
When he left criticism , his voice was steady , reasonable and constructive ; the community will feel his silence .
Tragically , that silence will be heard the loudest by those who love him the most , his wife , his children , family and friends .
I mentioned that I did n’t know Nate very well , but as a man in my mid-30 ’s with two young children of my own , this hits exceptionally close to home .
My children re-introduced me to LEGO a few short years ago and it quickly became a bond between us .
We share much of our time together building and discussing our common hobby but upon reflection , I realize that I should share much more of my time with them .
Today , my heart and prayers go out for Nate and his family .
Godspeed .
Shannon Sproule
Nnenn ’s passing is a massive loss to the international Lego community , he was an inspiration to both old and young with his skillful technique , superb presentation , help on colour theory and downright passion for building .
Also his customisation of Lego bricks and creative use of stickers was , to me , a reminder to be loyal only to my imagination .
I still ca n’t believe he ’s gone ; he helped me immensely improving my mocs , I will miss him greatly .
Thoughts go to his family .
Today the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could have serious implications for the laws we have created to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in society .
The central question raised in Christian Legal Society v. Martinez is whether a public university , the University of California 's Hastings College of the Law , can be forced to officially recognize and provide funds to clubs that violate the school 's nondiscrimination policy .
Although Hastings allows the Christian Legal Society ( CLS ) to meet and recruit on campus , the group is claiming that it should be entitled to official club status and its share of the small amount of money set aside for school clubs even though it denies membership to anyone — even fellow Christians — who does n't follow the club 's view of Christianity , which includes the belief that gay conduct is sinful .
In our view , Hastings has done a thoughtful job of balancing all interests .
Hastings does not restrict official clubs in their beliefs or speech .
Other official clubs at the university range from the Clara Foltz Feminist Association and the Hastings Federalist Society to the Hastings Democrats and the Hastings Animal Law Society .
Hastings has one simple rule :
If a club wants to use the university 's name and receive university funds , anyone must be allowed to join .
That means men are able to join in the feminist club , Republicans may join the Democratic club , and so on .
Defenders of CLS claim that denying the club official status somehow impinges on its constitutional freedoms .
But CLS and other unofficial clubs are allowed to meet and recruit on campus , and to use campus bulletin boards and chalk boards to make announcements .
CLS is free to hold whatever beliefs it likes , and to exclude anyone from membership on the basis of any characteristic or belief .
But if it chooses to exclude students based on their religion or sexual orientation , it cannot then also demand public funding and official recognition .
Publically funded universities have a financial , historical , and legal imperative to ensure that tuition - paying students are not discriminated against in the pursuit of any educational opportunity .
If the court were to accept CLS 's claim that religious beliefs trump the need to abide by nondiscrimination rules , all nondiscrimination laws — the laws we have put in place to guarantee everyone an equal opportunity to earn a living , find housing and to obtain access to critical services including healthcare — would be in jeopardy .
That 's a pretty scary proposition .
In this case , it is lesbian and gay students and students with different religious beliefs who are targeted .
But we 've been down this road many times before .
Religious beliefs have been offered as an excuse to justify discrimination based on race , gender , disability and national origin .
In fact , just over 20 years ago , a religious school claimed that it was justified in refusing women the health benefits it provided male employees because of its religious view that men are the heads of the household .
And just 40 years ago , a restaurant owner in South Carolina argued that his religious beliefs about segregation exempted him from having to serve African - American customers , regardless of what the civil rights laws said .
Fortunately , those claims did not prevail .
Our Founding
Fathers very wisely understood that society benefits when everyone is free to form their own beliefs .
But to ensure that freedom , they also realized that religion and government must remain separate .
Allowing one particular religious viewpoint to dictate the rules automatically leads to less freedom for other forms of belief .
Hastings has created rules that establish a level playing ground for all .
In respect for the diversity of its student body , it should not be forced to endorse or fund actual discrimination .
The club of scientists who write fiction is small , but its members tend to be accomplished .
Carl Djerassi , inventor of the birth control pill , writes novels and plays .
Legendary astronomer Carl Sagan dabbled in science fiction .
And now another giant has joined their ranks : Harvard naturalist and biologist E. O. Wilson , the two - time Pulitzer Prize winner who has contributed landmark works in the fields of insect behavior and biological anthropology .
His latest book , his 22nd , is his first novel .
Anthill tells the parallel stories of Raff Cody , a southern lawyer trying to preserve the wilderness of his youth , and the epic territorial wars among the ants that inhabit that land .
Wilson has argued that our behavior is governed by genetics and evolutionary imperatives .
In Anthill , he turns that conviction into a narrative technique , writing about human nature with the same detachment he uses when explaining how worker ants lick the secretions of their larvae for nourishment .
But Wilson 's novel is also an emotional plea to safeguard wild landscapes .
Wilson talked to Wired about ants , evolution , and the creative aspects of the scientific process .
Wired :
You 've already established a successful nonfiction career .
Why write fiction now ?
E. O. Wilson : I 've always wanted to try it .
If you 've mastered a subject , then writing about the factual content and ideas of it is easy , relatively .
But if you write a novel , you have to create the world and carry it around in your head .
And that 's difficult .
Wired :
You sparked a huge controversy in the 1970s when you wrote about the biological roots of behavior .
You called it sociobiology , but some of your critics called it racism and eugenics .
Wilson : Yeah , but I won that argument .
We 've learned so much about neurobiology , genetics , and biological anthropology that no serious scholar , except maybe a determined ideologue , would doubt there is a genetic component to human nature .
It should be a major goal of science to understand the genes that predispose us to do one thing as opposed to another .
Wired :
In Anthill , you describe human interactions with the same scientific terminology that you use to describe the ants .
For example , you have Raff size up a future girlfriend by analyzing bone structure and hip - to - waist ratio .
Are we humans really just a set of reactions to biological signals ?
Wilson : I 'll tell you , the analogies implied in the novel are not accidents .
Social insects — termites and ants — in terms of biomass totally dominate the insect world .
In parallel manner , human beings have essentially taken over the planet , with the same general properties of altruistic social behavior and division of labor .
Wired :
But does that make for good fiction ?
It does n't seem very literary .
Wilson : Science takes the subconscious process of creating ideas , all those crazy dreams and imaginings and rhapsodies , and puts them to the test .
But then you have to tell the story , and unfortunately you can't tell it like a poet .
Metaphor has no accuracy or measurable quantities .
The ideal of the creative arts , on the other hand , is to provoke a deep emotional response — from something that , again , often has its origin in the subconscious .
The similarity is in the thought process .
We constantly hear about the creative arts being linked to the scientific imagination .
But we have n't been very successful in making that link .
Anthill is my attempt in that direction .
MEXICO CITY — Armed men raided two hotels in the center of Monterrey , Mexico ’s industrial capital , early Wednesday morning , hauling away four guests and as many as three staff members and sending a wave of panic across a city that has experienced a spate of violent episodes in recent weeks , the authorities said .
Dozens of gunmen were involved in the attacks , which occurred at 3 a.m. and were bold even by Mexican standards .
They stormed through numerous rooms on the fifth floor of the Holiday Inn Centro , removing four guests but letting others go .
The gunmen also abducted the hotel ’s receptionist and clashed with a security guard outside the hotel , possibly taking him as well , the authorities said .
A receptionist at the Misión Hotel across the street was also abducted , bringing the likely total number of missing people to seven , officials said .
“ It could be an organized crime group who was looking for an opposing group , ” said Alejandro Garza , the top prosecutor in the state of Nuevo León .
Investigators said the gunmen entered the Holiday Inn with a man who was handcuffed and who told them to go to the fifth floor of the 17 - story hotel .
Once there , they barged into many rooms .
They took one guest ’s laptop computer .
Other guests reported that the gunmen looked inside and left .
UPDATE 4/23 4 PM : I ’ve been in contact with the Eureka Weather Station manager , and despite the incredible nature of the temperature jumps that are outside of normal experiences , such as July 14 2009 , they do appear to be real .
The METAR coding errors are another issue .
I have many pictures now , plus a plan map , and a better meteorological insight than what can be gained from the meager online metadata .
I ’ll have an updated post later tonight or tomorrow – Anthony
Ecotretas find more cases of missing “ M ”s and mangled data in METAR reports making it into climatic temperature data .
I ’ve reposted his findings below and added some of my own notes [ in brackets ] to strengthen his findings .
This time it ’s Eureka , Nunavut , Canada .
From “ Up Here ” magazine :
The first High Arctic Weather Station in history , Eureka was established in April 1947 at 80 - degrees north latitude in the vicinity of two rivers , which provided fresh water to the six - man United States Army Air Force team that parachuted in .
They erected Jamesway huts to shelter themselves and their equipment until August , when an icebreaker reached Eureka – as it has every year since – and brought permanent buildings and supplies .
For decades after that , small , all - male crews would hunker down for entire winters , going a little stir-crazy from the isolation .
As I pointed out last Saturday there ’s a common reporting flaw in world meteorological stations that use the METAR weather data format to report their hourly temperatures .
Just one bad report in a cold location in the Arctic or Antarctic is enough to throw off the whole month ’s worth of data when averaged .
And it is monthly data that is used for climate .
The all time high temperature error identified below has found it ’s way into Wikipedia as “ factual ” when it is clearly wrong .
Some METAR and other kinds of unidentified errors also seem to be finding their way into official Environment Canada data .
I ’ve made screencaps .
Given the importance of this weather station as the last surviving GHCN station that far north , also used in GISS , you ’d think better quality control would be done , particularly when EC has a statement about data quality on each data page .
What has been found seems to point to a corrupted dataset there .
– Anthony
=======================================
Eureka by Ecotretas
[ Images above from GISS – click to enlarge ]
Eureka , in Nunavut Canada , is a very special meteorological station .
As can be seen in the first image above , it is responsible for the very big stripe on the very top of Canada .
As can be seen on the second image , the data from only one station is responsible for a very big percentage of global temperatures …
Both graphs can be obtained here .
So , one would imagine that data for this station is quality proof .
We found two sources for temperature data : at Weather Underground and at the National Climate Data and Information Archive .
The first interesting data about this station is its record high temperature , which according to Wikipedia was reached on July 14 , 2009 , with 20 ºC. [ image below added by Anthony ]
[ UPDATE : Wikipedia editor removed the sentence above within 8 hours of this posting .
See discussion here ]
On Weather Underground , the monthly page for that day does say that 20 ºC was the maximum temperature .
But when you check the METAR data , the maximum temperature was 14ºC .
[ Here is where it really gets strange , I ’ve added two screencaps from Environment Canada , on for the monthly data , another for the daily data from July 14th , 2009 .
They do n’t match !
The 20.9C value never appears in the July 14th hourly data .
Click images below to enlarge , EC’s July 2009 Monthly report on the left , July 14th , 2009 daily / hourly data on the right .
Perhaps EC corrected the error in the daily / hourly data , but missed the monthly ?
– Anthony ]
[ click images above to enlarge ]
[ It also shows up as 20.9C on the EC yearly report for 2009 , shown below ]
Checking the Environment Canada page , the maximum for the date was 14.4ºC .
Things were different on the day before , July 13th .
Maximum temperature for Weather Underground was also 20 ºC , while at Environment Canada was 19.6 ºC .
But if you check the graphs below , some special heat occurred at 10 PM , when temperatures soared some 15ºC !
( click images to enlarge )
[ Image below added by Anthony .
Here is the METAR report for Eureka , via Weather Underground , the error is highlighted in yellow , note the jump in temperature followed by a fall the next hour ]
[ In the image below added by Anthony , note the implausible temperature jump in the Environment Canada data for July 13th , 2009 at 22:00 where it was 5.9C at 21:00 , jumping to 19.6C at 22:00 , then back down to 4.1C at 23:00 .
Looking at the weather conditions of clear sky and moderate sustained winds from the North ~ 24 km / hr , there does not appear to be a meteorological explanation .
Looking at the METAR data above , it appears the temperature was rounded up by the observer to 20C from 19.6 .
This makes me wonder if the event could be caused by something like a plane , truck , or snow - cat parked briefly near the sensor .
In the Arctic , vehicles are left to idle , as turning them off allows them to freeze up , sometimes never to be restarted . ]
As Anthony Watts pointed out at Watts Up With That , the Eureka station registered the biggest rise in temperature probably seen on the Earth ’s surface : 86 ºC in one hour , on March 3 , 2007 !
Now this data is available on Weather Underground , but seems not to exist in Environment Canada .
The graph differences are clear below :
But that seems not to be the case in other examples .
Take January 1st , 2007 , for instance .
Both Weather Underground and Environment Canada agree : there was a mighty spike at noon .
Seems like the “ M ” problem affects both :
[ Here ’s the METAR data with the missing “ M ” , note at 11 AM the M reappears ]
There are times where differences are not so big , but the “ M ” problem is still there .
Check the images from Weather Underground and Environment Canada for September 26 , 2006 :
Other times , changes are so significant , that something must be wrong .
Check out the temperature rise on June 20 , 2005 .
On the left , the weekly graph from Weather Underground shows a great surge in temperatures , confirmed by the Environment Canada graph for the day .
=====================================
Thanks to Ecotretas for his sleuthing , I ’m sure there are many more like this yet to be discovered .
It seems with Eureka , more is going on than METAR errors .
The temperature rises reported seem impossible given the meteorological conditions , and because they seem to be automated , suggest sensor error or perhaps sensor environment contamination ( like a vehicle or other heat source ) .
If you look at this 1997 image from Wikipedia ( and click it to get the super hi-res version and pan around ) you ’ll see a number of vehicles near buildings .
Where is the temperature sensor ?
– I do n’t know , but if someone can find out it might shed some light on this mystery .
The fact that the obvious error on July 14th is now cited in Wikipedia as an “ all time record high ” , when it does n’t appear in the EC hourly data , is troubling .

Climate Catastrophe A Superstorm for Global Warming Research
Plagued by reports of sloppy work , falsifications and exaggerations , climate research is facing a crisis of confidence .
How reliable are the predictions about global warming and its consequences ?
And would it really be the end of the world if temperatures rose by more than the much - quoted limit of two degrees Celsius ?
Last week , the UK LibDem party was thrown into scandal when two of its Lords proposed an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill that would allow for national web - censorship , particularly aimed at " web- lockers " like Google Docs and YouSendIt .
Now a leaked document from the British Phonographic Institute suggests that the amendment was basically written by the record industry lobby and entered into law on their behalf by representatives of the " party of liberty . "
This weekend , LibDem members who attend the national convention in Birmingham will have the chance to vote on an emergency measure affirming the party 's commitment to an open and just Internet , repudiating this disastrous measure .
If you ( or someone you know ) is attending the convention , please support the " Save the Net " emergency measure and help rehabilitate the party 's reputation on fundamental freedoms in the information society .
Parliamentarians need to recognize that copyright touches everyone and every technology in the digital age .
It is no longer a question of inter- business regulation and deals .
Getting copyright wrong has the potential to mess up our freedom of speech , prevent us from getting the benefits of new technologies , and damage society in other very profound ways .
It is therefore deeply inappropriate for such fundamental proposals to have been introduced by both the government or the opposition parties at the behest of one side of the debate .
That applies just as much to disconnection , which Mandelson introduced in the summer at the last minute under pressure again from the BPI and other rights holders .

John Newman fondly recalled the eight years he taught first and second grades in Vallejo public schools — he felt appreciated , and was once named “ Teacher of the Year . ”
It was the 1990s , before he got sick and was told to leave the United States .
“ I was accepted by co-workers , neighbors and employers , ” Mr. Newman said .
“ But I was not welcome by the government . ”
Mr. Newman , a Canadian , contracted H.I.V. , which causes AIDS and nearly killed him .
Breakthrough drugs brought back his health .
Then he discovered that a law many considered cruel required him to leave his home .
Sadly , he returned to Canada .
Now the stories of people like Mr. Newman are becoming public .
Experts say tens of thousands shared similarly interrupted lives thanks to a 22 - year United States ban on allowing foreigners with H.I.V. to live in this country .

But if you need them again , you can simply look them up .
How to use it :
Add a new note : insert it and hit " enter " or click " OK "
Search for a note : the first character needs to be " / " , then just input your search pattern ( regex possible ) and click " OK "
Delete something : search for it and then click " Delete Selected " to delete all search results
More Than Just A Competition
The Plasma Javascript Jam Session has been more than just a simple competition : it has also been instrumental in helping to discover the strengths and weaknesses in the Javascript Plasmoid system and introduce new faces to the KDE community .
Each of the Jam Session participants became real - life test cases for Javascript Plasmoid creation , and via the IRC channel and the Plasma development mailing list they were able to offer extremely valuable input over the course of the Jam Session .
This in turn resulted in a number of bug fixes , documentation improvements , feature additions and even helped to shape the feature goals for version 2 of the Javascript Plasmoid API which will be released this summer as part of the KDE
Software Compilation version 4.5 .
The Jam Session was also a great way for several people who had never had the opportunity to participate in KDE at the code level to do just that .
The low barrier to entry of Javascript Plasmoids and the excitement of some very cool prizes both helped .
We hope that this is just the start of an energetic , lively Javascript development community within KDE that can grow and flourish in the months and years to come .
This is only the beginning , not the end !
So a big " thank - you " and " congratulations on your efforts " to all of the submitting authors for making the ( first ? )
Plasma Javascript Jam Session a great success and an immensley enjoyable experience for the Plasma development team as well !
You Be The Judge
There is one last detail to sort out : the competition part of the Plasma Javascript Jam Session .
With the submissions in the queue , it is now time to crown the stand - out submissions .
One lucky winner will receive a brand new Nokia N900 .
The grand prize winner and the first runner up will both receive an invitation including transportation and lodging , to a KDE event , while the top three submissions will also earn a KDE t- shirt .
We have a panel of four judges who will scoring all of the submissions based on usefulness or entertainment value , orginality , beauty and technical merit .
In addition to the overal winners , the judges will be handing out the Beauty Queen , Technical Giant and Creative Genius bragging - rights awards

( CNN ) --
More than a quarter of young adults are unable to meet physical requirements to join the military , creating a potential threat to national security , a group of retired armed forces leaders said Tuesday .
" It 's not drug abuse , it 's not asthma , it 's not flat feet -- by far the leading medical reason is being overweight or obese , " said retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Norman Seip at a news conference .
About 27 percent of young adults are medically ineligible for the military , according to Mission : Readiness , a group of retired admirals , generals , and other senior military leaders .
Mission : Readiness ' report , " Too Fat to Fight , " said that 75 percent of young Americans between the ages of 17 to 24 do not qualify for the military because of failure to graduate [ from high school ] , criminal records or physical problems .
The study cited Department of Defense and health data .
Different branches of the military have their own policies , but they all measure strength , body fat , aerobic capacity , weight and height , Seip said .
A person must pass the physical fitness standards at the time he or she signs up for enlistment .
These standards include sit-ups and push - ups .
" The logic is pretty obvious , " said retired Army Brig .
Gen. Clara Adams - Ender .
" The troops need to be in excellent physical condition because of the demands of the important jobs they do in defense .
Rigorous physical and mental standards are critical if we are to maintain the fighting readiness of our military . "
The maximum weight depends on the person 's sex , height and age .
The Army allows a woman who is between 21 - 27 years of age , with the height of 5 feet 3 inches and no prior service , up to 137 pounds .
A man between 21 - 27 years of age , height of 5 feet 8 inches and no prior service can weigh up to 186 pounds .
The weight allotment increases with age and height .
The Army 's body fat limit for women in the 21 - 27 age range , with no prior service is 32 percent body fat and for males , 26 percent .
Once enlisted , individuals also have to pass annual physical tests .
" We lose upwards to 12,000 young men and young women a year before they even finish up the first term of enlistment , " Seip said .
" That 's another person , who has been recruited , trained and left because they 're not able to maintain standards and can't pass the physical fitness test . "
Retired officials said it 's not about looking good in uniform , but ensuring the future health of the nation .
" We cannot wait until our young adults reach enlistment age to do something about it , " said retired Navy Rear Adm. James Barnett Jr. " By that time , they may have already developed a chronic and lifelong weight problem . "
Mission : Readiness urged Congress to pass a new childhood nutrition law to remove school junk food , improve nutritional standards and quality of school meals , and to open access to anti-obesity programs for children .
" If we do something about it , school can become a terrific environment for proper meals , " Barnett said .
The retirees referred to a similar push military leaders made in 1945 , when concerns about poor nutrition in potential recruits resulted in the creation of a national school lunch program .
The retired military leaders were joined by Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack .
" The reality that so many youngsters are not fit for military service is indeed a wake - up call for this country , " Vilsack said .
In new research bound to irk conservative geniuses , people with high IQs are deemed more likely to be liberal , monogamous non-believers than those who are less intelligent .
Satoshi Kanazawa , an evolutionary psychologist from the London School of Economics and Political Science , says it makes sense biologically .
In an article for Social Psychology Quarterly , Kanazawa lays out facts based on U.S. data to support his theory .
According to that research , young adults who identify as " not at all religious " had an average IQ of 103 as teens , while those who identified as " very religious " had an average IQ of 97 .
Similarly , young adults who called themselves " very liberal " had an average IQ of 106 during adolescence , while those who identified themselves as " very conservative " had average IQs of 95 .
Kanazawa believes there are evolutionary reasons behind this .
Ten thousand years ago , when humans were hunter - gatherers , we mated , tended to our kin and fled when danger was in the air – activities that did not require much intelligence .
Kanazawa says humans were thus biologically designed to be conservative and put a high value on family .
" What is conservative in the U.S. – caring about your family and your friends and your kin – is sort of evolutionarily familiar , " Kanazawa says .
" We are designed to care only about people we associate with . "
Among our ancestors , men – though not women – were polygynous , having more than one sexual partner .
And the U.S. data show a relationship between male adolescent intelligence and how much , as adults , they came to value sexual exclusivity .
The more intelligent the male respondents were , the more they believed in monogamy .
It was also natural for hunter - gatherers to seek intentions behind natural phenomena , leading to religious belief , Kanazawa says .
The ability to think and reason , he says , evolved to deal with occasional but serious problems such as fires caused by lightning strikes , flash floods or severe droughts that threatened starvation .
He terms these phenomena as evolutionarily novel .
As time passed , more of the elements of our lives fell into the " evolutionarily novel " category , Kanazawa says .
People who are more intelligent , he argues , are better able to consider these novel elements and decide , for example , that liberalism , atheism or monogamy are things they want to subscribe to .
" Liberalism , caring about millions of total strangers and giving up money to make sure that those strangers will do well , is evolutionarily novel , " Kanazawa says .
In other words , the ability to respond to any element that is evolutionarily novel , whether it 's caring about earthquake victims in Haiti or accepting the theories of Darwin , is tied to intelligence .
Does this model help in understanding Canada 's liberal - conservative divide ?
John English , editor of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography , says that in the last decade or so , university - educated people have tended to be politically liberal .

But as far as religion goes , our experience differs .
" In the States , you have to be religious to be a politician , but the founding fathers were n't all that religious and certainly you can find many in the '50s and ' 60s who were n't that religious , " he says .
" But now it 's expected .... Those are the formalities . "
Sir Wilfrid Laurier , a Liberal , was agnostic but never said so , English says .
" He would regularly say , ' I 'm Roman Catholic ....'
He was not a believer but he realized he could n't say that publicly . "
Neither , English says , could Lester B. Pearson , a brilliant ( and notably monogamous ) Liberal who did not practise religion .
Maryanne Fisher , a professor in the department of psychology at St. Mary 's University in Halifax , says Kanazawa 's new theory is provocative , but she has her doubts .
" I could see how smart people might be more apt to wanting to push boundaries but , at the same time , " she says , " I can easily think of many intelligent people I 've met who would be exceptions to this rule . "
Kanazawa says future research will explore whether intelligent people are more likely to buy into other evolutionarily novel values , like vegetarianism , feminism , pacifism and environmentalism .
Meanwhile , he expects the average intelligence of all western populations to decline slightly in the 21st century , because more intelligent people tend to have fewer offspring .
Interestingly , Kanazawa describes himself as a married atheist libertarian with a strong distaste for liberals .
But , as a scientist , he says he is bound to report the facts .
Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 1/3/2010 ( 3865 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
The University of Manitoba 's equity services office will investigate whether a raunchy engineering students ' publication is offensive .
The 24 - page Red Loin magazine features several articles in which male engineers tell women how to please them in sexually explicit terms .
Some of the articles are illustrated by scantily clad women in suggestive poses .
A two - page article presents statistical tables of various aspects of sexuality , such as penis length , the average size of nipples , average menstrual flow , speed of ejaculation and duration of erections .
U of M public affairs director John Danakas said Monday the administration will not comment on Red Loin , but will ask equity services to determine if the magazine 's contents violate the U of M's respectful work and learning environment policy .
" Anything that could be considered offensive , equity services will be made aware of , " Danakas said .
He would not speculate on what the possible outcomes could be for the students involved .
" It depends on what the content is , how offensive it is , " Danakas said .
" They are adults , but they are young . "
U of M Engineering Society senior stick Megan Lusty defended the publication Monday , saying it is available only within the faculty of engineering building and no one has complained to her about its contents .
Lusty said that UMES publishes its Red Lion magazine three times a year , and a somewhat less - serious Red Loin once a year , for the past 35 years .
" This year has been toned down . "
Lusty said she has final say over the content .
Red Loin is produced by three engineering students , two of them women , but anyone in the faculty can contribute , she said .
" I'm the final one to look over the content , " Lusty said .
" It 's meant to entertain people , not offend people .
I have no concern about the content . "
Asked what she would consider the entertainment value of statistical tables about vagina size or the average duration of a male orgasm , Lusty said the male student who wrote it thought it entertaining , and was offering it for other students to consider as entertainment .
" Most female students have a really good relationship with the male students , " Lusty said .
" I found it offensive , " social work Prof. Judy Hughes said Monday .
" We 're supposed to be living in a different kind of world .
" The construction of what 's supposed to be funny is actually quite narrow .
It 's from the point of view of heterosexual male engineeers ... ( showing ) women as objects of men's sexual desires , " Hughes said .
" It constructs men as mindless creeps only out to have sex -- there are men , even heterosexual men , who'd be offended by that material . "
U of M sociology Prof. Susan Prentice said Red Loin " reflects a culture in the engineering faculty which helps us understand why engineering is a male - dominated profession . "
" It puts female engineers in a bind .
If you complain , they 're not good sports .
If they go along , you contribute to your own second - class status , " said Prentice , a former Margaret Laurence Chair in Women 's Studies .
" It 's a reflection of the way the climate is chilly " for women in engineering .
Red Loin appears to be a reversible magazine -- flip it over and turn it upside down , and there is a back cover promising entertainment for female engineers , However , all the content is right - side - up only for the male engineers ' cover .
Lusty said the content is intended for both men and women .
The first page inside the magazine includes straightforward messages from Lusty and from engineering dean Douglas Ruth outlining some recent engineering students ' achievements .
" They routinely ask the dean for a message , and he submits it , not knowing what the content will be , " Danakas said .

For those who follow star signs , " hornyscopes " for both men and women .
For instance , the female Aries is " wildly sexual , passionate and adventerous . ' "
The male Scorpio is " a lustful sexy animal "
But a select few decided to take it a step further .
And then another step , and another , until they were in a full out sprint towards the ninth level of hell to punch the Devil in the throat and steal his bike .

Jack Johnson was the first black heavyweight champion , but also paved the road for future athletes in the ways of trash talking , flashy bling and openly banging white women in an era when that could get you lynched .
The man was everything Muhammad Ali would be ...
The Badassery :
... except he was doing it at the turn of the century .
We were n't kidding about the lynching thing -- this was 39 years before Jackie Robinson and just a generation removed from his father being born a slave .
After he became champion , the media openly pined for a " Great White Hope " to come forward and beat him , and set the racial hierarchy back to its natural order .
Former undefeated champion James J. Jeffries came out of retirement to fight Johnson , satisfying both the white masses and fans of alliteration .

In the ensuing " Fight of the Century , " Johnson forced Jeffries corner to throw in the towel in the 15th round to avoid a complete knockout and post - fight cuckold session ( as was the custom of the time ) .
Outside of the ring , Johnson 's hobbies included racing flashy sports cars , traveling the world and generally making the Dos Equis guy look boring .
He rocked gold teeth and a gold handled pimp cane while sipping champagne and taking his pet leopard for walks .
Pretty much this , but with bigger balls .

He spent time as a jazz musician , Chicago nightclub owner , stage actor , dock worker , coral fisher , bullfighter , volunteer secret agent in World War I for the U.S. Government ( and possibly also for the Kaiser ) and as a beer salesman .
He was a legendary eater and drinker ( and spent a night in Russia downing vodka shot - for - shot with Rasputin ) and had the onions to deliver a speech on sportsmanship , fair play and the golden rule to the motherfucking KKK .
It should be noted that nothing in the previous paragraph was a joke .
All that shit really happened .
He was a goddamned bull fighter , people !
A talk by Andrew Kliman , author of ‘ Reclaiming Marx ’s Capital ’ *
update : click here for sound file
In the past few weeks , since we announced this talk , recognition has increased substantially that the United States , and now the world , are caught up in the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Because Marxists are famous for “ predicting five out of the last three recessions ” , I need to point that the term crisis does not mean collapse , nor does it mean slump ( recession , depression , downturn ) .
While the US is probably in the midst of a recession , the downturn has been - thus far - a relatively mild one .
For instance , payroll employment has fallen nine months in a row , but the total decline , 760,000 , is well less than half of the decline that occurred during the first nine months of the last recession , in 2001 , which itself was relatively mild .
In contrast to this , a crisis is a rupture or disruption in the network of relationships that keep the capitalist economy operating in the normal way .
The present crisis is characterized above all by an acute crisis of confidence that loans will be repaid , which has in turn caused an acute crisis of liquidity - an official at the Boston Fed recently termed it a “ liquidity lock ” ­­ - the inability of businesses to get cash for their short - term , day - to - day needs .
Some major credit markets have been essentially “ frozen ” ; which means that lending has been dropping rapidly or even coming to a halt .
But the business sector depends crucially on credit , not only to finance new investments , but just to get from today to tomorrow .
General Electric , for instance , has to produce before it can sell , so in the meantime it regularly borrows heavily by issuing commercial paper in order to pay its suppliers and workers .
If it does n’t obtain credit , the workers do n’t get paid and the suppliers can’t pay off the debts they owe , and so on .
So the economy would be in danger of complete collapse if this situation were to persist for any length of time .
Now , many liberals and leftists have told us that the $ 700 billion - plus bailout was not needed , or that it is meant to provide windfall profits to the financial industry , or that the money could be spent differently , for instance to protect homeowners against foreclosure , or invest in infrastructure .
But the crisis is much worse than they want you to think , and that ’s because they ’ve been focusing on the wrong issues .
They ’ve focused on the slump - which is not yet terribly severe and which can perhaps be dealt with in many different ways - and / or on the bank failures and bankruptcies in the financial sector .
The really acute , immediate crisis , however , the one that could lead to outright economic collapse , is the crisis of confidence that has caused the liquidity lock .
These liberals and leftists have proposed no alternative policies to deal with this crisis , and that ’s because , if one wants to save the capitalist system , there basically are n’t any alternatives that differ , except in the details , from what the Treasury and the Fed and foreign governments are now doing - namely making the liquidity flow , the cash flow , especially by the Fed stepping in to become the lender of last resort in the commercial paper market and by the Treasury twisting the arms of the banks to take the bailout money and then turn around and lend it out .
There ’s only one alternative to crisis of confidence and the liquidity lock that differs from this in more than details - a new , human , socio- economic system , socialism .
Figure 1 . Risk Aversion ( TED Spread )
3 - mo. LIBOR ( US $ rate ) minus 3 - mo .
T - bill interest rate Source : bloomberg.com
I want to illustrate some of what I ’ve been talking about above by looking at a couple of graphs .
I have n’t found decent data on the decline in the volume of short - term lending , so I ’m forced to try to illustrate the problem by looking at interest - rate figures .
Figure 1 is the so - called TED Spread , the difference between the rate of interest that a bank can get by lending to another bank for 3 months ( the 3 - month LIBOR in terms of US dollars ) and the rate of interest it can get by lending to the U.S. Treasury for 3 months .
Lending to the Treasury is safer .
So the difference between these rates , the TED Spread , is essentially a measure of the willingness or unwillingness to take on risk - the extra interest a bank demands before it will take on the extra risk of lending to another bank instead of lending to the U.S. government .
Through the 1st third of last month , the TED Spread was slightly more than 1 percentage point , which is already about double its usual level .
But after the government had to take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and Lehman Bros. was allowed to collapse , and the government had to buy AIG , and so forth and so on … the spread rose and , after temporarily declining a bit , kept rising and rising , reaching over 4.5 % , until last week , when the most recent of the bailout measures and other emergency measures were announced .
As of today , as a result of the bailout and related measures , it had fallen back down , to below 3 % .
Figure 2 is the interest rate on 4 - week Treasury bills .
Again , for financial institutions , lending to the U.S. government in this manner is safer than putting the money in the bank , because the bank might fail and , until very recently , big institutions ’ deposits in the banks were n’t government - insured .
And it ’s safer than buying short - term commercial paper .
So when they became afraid to lend to private entities , financial institutions became willing to obtain ridiculously little interest by lending to the U.S. government .
The greater the fear of private - sector lending , the lower the interest rate they were willing to accept .
And so the interest rate on 4 - week T - bills has been , again and again , next to nothing for much of the past month .
For instance , much of last week , it was 5 hundredths of 1 percent , meaning that , if you bought a $ 10,000 T - bill , 4 weeks later , you ’d earn 42 cents interest .
But this is what institutions have been willing to do with their cash , because they ’ve been so afraid of the alternatives .
( The latest figure , not shown above , is that the interest rate has risen to 0.42 % , as the bailout and related measures begin to restore confidence . )
Now let ’s consider some of what ’s been coming from the left .
In the Oct. 27 , 2008 issue of The Nation ( pp. 4 - 5 ) , the historian Howard Zinn wrote ,
“ It is sad to see both major parties agree to spend $ 700 billion of taxpayer money to bail out huge financial institutions that are notable for two characteristics : incompetence and greed . …
A simple and powerful alternative would be to take that huge sum of money , $ 700 billion , and give it directly to the people who need it .
Let the government declare a moratorium on foreclosures and help homeowners pay off their mortgages .
Create a federal jobs program to guarantee work to people who want and need jobs . ”
This is all well and good , and these are measures worth fighting for to help working people as the slump in the economy worsens .
But how do they address the crisis of confidence and the liquidity lock ?
Of course , one could say , “ forget trying to restore confidence , ” but that is basically to say , “ forget trying to save capitalism , ” and Zinn did n’t say that .
Barbara Ehrenreich , the well - known writer and erstwhile revolutionary socialist , at least faced the fact that what is on the line is the capitalist system itself , not just incompetent and greedy and huge financial institutions .
She recently opined that there ’s no alternative to capitalism “ ready at hand , ” so she hopes it survives the current crisis : “ I ’m hoping that capitalism survives this one , if only because there ’s no alternative ready at hand .
At the very least , we should get some regulation and serious oversight out of any bail - out deal …. ” ( Huffington Post , Oct. 1 , 2008 ; www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-ehrenreich/the-communist-manifesto-h_b_130934.html)
And then there ’s the left - liberal economist Dean Baker , who was for the bailout before he was against it .
On Sept. 20 , he wrote ,
“ There is a real risk that the banking system will freeze up , preventing ordinary business transactions , like meeting payrolls .
This would quickly lead to an economic disaster with mass layoffs and plunging output .
“ The Fed and Treasury are right to take steps to avert this disaster .
… there is an urgency to put a bailout program in place …. ”
( “ Progressive conditions for a bailout , ” p. 243 .
Real - world Economics Review , No. 47 . www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue47/Baker47.pdf)
In this statement , Baker characterizes the liquidity lock and its implications much in the manner that I characterized it earlier .
But then , 9 days later , he reversed course :
“ The bail - out is a big victory for those who want to redistribute income upward .
It takes money from school teachers and cab drivers and gives it to incredibly rich Wall Street bankers . …
“ This upward redistribution was done under the cover of crisis , just like the war in Iraq .
But there is no serious crisis story .
Yes the economy is in a recession that is getting worse , but the bail - out will not get us out of the recession , or even be much help in alleviating it . ”
( “ Wall St held a gun to our heads , ” www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/29/us.economy.wall.street)
Portraying the bailout as a program to make the rich richer , Baker says correctly that it wo n’t do much to alleviate or end the recession .
But that does n’t mean its purpose is to make the rich richer , either .
What about the system ’s need to getting the liquidity flowing again - which he was acutely aware of 9 days before ?
Well , Baker says , the government can just take over the banks :
“ In the event the banking system really did freeze up , then the Federal Reserve would step in and take over the major banks . ”
But the government must either take over the banks by buying them , which brings us back to a bailout costing hundreds of billions of dollars - or more , depending on how extensive the nationalization is .
Or the government can take over the banks without compensation .
That ’s a lovely way of dealing with a lack of confidence on the capitalists ’ part .
And it ’s a lovely way of getting credit flowing again .
In order to lend , banks , even nationalized banks , need people and institutions to lend to them and / or invest in them .
But I know that I would n’t want to lend to or invest in any institution that has shown a willingness to expropriate without compensation .
Once again , of course , one can say , “ forget trying to restore confidence and forget the sanctity of property rights ” - in other words , “ forget trying to save capitalism ” - but Baker did n’t go there .
I want to turn now to the roots of this crisis .
My view is basically that the crisis has its roots in the economic slump of the 1970s , from which the global economy never fully recovered - not in the way in which the destruction of capital in and through the Great Depression and World War II led to a post - war boom .
Policymakers here and abroad have understandably been afraid of a repeat of the Great Depression .
So they ’ve continually taken measures to slow down and prevent the destruction of capital ( a plummeting of the value of capital assets as well as physical destruction of capital ) .
But the destruction of capital is not only a consequence of an economic slump ; it is also the mechanism leading to the next boom .
For instance , if there ’s a business that can generate $ 3 million in profit annually , but the value of the capital invested in the business is $ 100 million , the rate of profit is a measly 3 % .
But if the destruction of capital values enables a new owner to acquire the business for only $ 10 million instead of $ 100 million , the new owner ’s rate of profit is a more - than - respectable 30 % .
That ’s a tremendous spur to a new boom .
But such a massive destruction of capital as took place in the Depression and then in World War II has n’t taken place , and so there ’s been a partial recovery only , brought about largely through
(1 ) declining real wages for most workers and other austerity measures , as well as exporting the crisis into the 3rd world , and
( 2 ) a mountain of debt - mortgage , consumer , government , corporate - to paper over the sluggishness and mitigate the effects of the declining real wages .
Because of this excessive run-up of debt , there have been persistent debt crises .
These will continue until
( a ) sufficient capital is destroyed to once again make investment truly profitable .
( The present crisis may well end up being this moment . ) .
Or
( b ) there ’s such a panic that lending stops and the economy crashes , ushering in chaos or fascism or warlordism or whatever , or
( c ) capitalism is replaced by a new human , socialist society .
Bubbles are thus , according to the above , an inevitable result of efforts to “ grow the economy , ” by means of debt , faster than is warranted by the underlying flow of new value generated in production .
The more sophisticated and widespread the credit markets , the greater is the degree to which “ forced expansion ” ( Karl Marx , Capital , vol .
3 , Chap. 30 ; p. 621 of Penguin ed. ) can take place , but also the greater the degree of ultimate contraction when the law of value eventually makes its presence felt .
So a bubble is kind of like a rubber band stretching and snapping back .
Figure 3 depicts what ’s meant by a bubble .
Imagine that demand for assets such as homes or stock shares increases , without a corresponding increase in new value being produced .
This causes the prices of these assets to rise ; and on paper , people ’s and businesses ’ wealth increases , so they now have the means to borrow more , and they may become “ irrationally exuberant ” ; and all of this leads to a further increase in demand , and so forth and so on .
The debt - induced bubble that ’s resulted in the present crisis is of course the housing sector bubble .
Paradoxically , it came about because of the weakness of the U.S. economy .
First stock prices plunged sharply as the “ dot.com ” stock market bubble burst .
Then the economy went into recession in 2001 , and it was weakened further by the 9/11 attacks later that year .
In order to allay the fears of financial collapse that followed the attacks , the Fed lowered short - term interest rates .
Even after the recession ended a couple of months later , employment kept falling , through the middle of 2003 , so the Fed kept lowering short - term lending rates .
For three full years , starting in October of 2002 , the real ( ie inflation - adjusted ) federal funds rate was actually
Figure 3 .
negative ( see figure 4 ) .
This allowed banks to borrow funds from other banks , lend them out , and then pay back less than they had borrowed once inflation was taken into account .
This “ cheap money , easy credit ” strategy created a new bubble .
With stock prices having recently collapsed , this time the flood of money flowed at first largely into the housing market .
Loan funds were so ready to hand that working class people whose applications for mortgage loans would normally have been rejected were now able to obtain them .
As Figure 4 shows , the trajectory of the mortgage borrowing to income ratio during the 2000 - 4 period is an almost perfect mirror image of the trajectory of the real federal funds rate .
This is a clear indication of the close link between the explosion of mortgage borrowing and the easy credit conditions .
And with new borrowing increasing so rapidly , the ratio of outstanding mortgage debt to after - tax income , which had risen only modestly during the 1990s , jumped from 71 percent in 2000 to 103 percent in 2005 ( see figure 5 ) .
The additional money flooding the housing market in turn caused home prices to skyrocket .
Indeed , total mortgage debt and home prices ( as measured by the Case - Shiller Home Price Index ) rose at almost exactly the same rates between start of 2000 and the end of 2005 - 100 percent and 102 percent , respectively .
Those of us who attempt , following Marx , to understand capitalism ’s economic crises as disturbances rooted in its system of production - value production - always face the problem that the market and production are not linked in a simple cause and effect manner .
As a general rule , it is not the case that particular disturbance in the sphere of production causes an economic crisis .
Instead , what occurs in the sphere of production conditions and sets limits to what occurs in the market .
And it is indisputable that , in this sense , the US housing crisis has its roots in the system of production .
The increases in home prices were far in excess of the flow of value from new production that alone could guarantee repayment of the mortgages in the long run .
The new value created in production is ultimately the sole source of all income - including homeowners ’ wages , salaries and other income - and therefore it is the sole basis upon which the repayment of mortgages ultimately rests .
But from 2000 to 2005 , the rise in after - tax income was barely one third of the rise in home prices .
This is precisely why the real - estate bubble proved to be a bubble .
A rise in asset prices or expansion of credit is never excessive in itself .
It is excessive only in relation to the underlying flow of value .
Non-Marxist economists and financial analysts may use different language to describe these relationships , but they do not dispute them .
Indeed , it is commonplace to assess whether homes are over or under - priced by looking at whether their prices are high or low in relation to the underlying flow of income .
Now , some players in the mortgage market did realise that something was amiss but nonetheless sought to quickly reap lush profits and then protect themselves before the day of reckoning arrived .
But there was a good reason ( or what seemed at the time to be a good reason ) why others failed to perceive that the boom times were unsustainable : home prices in the US had never fallen on a national level , at least not since the Great Depression .
So it was “ natural ” to assume that home prices would keep rising .
This assumption served to allay misgivings over the fact that a lot of money was being lent out to homeowners who were less than creditworthy , and in the form of risky subprime mortgages .
Had home prices continued to go up , homeowners who had trouble making mortgage payments would have been able to get the additional funds they needed by borrowing against the increase in the value of their homes , and the crisis would have been averted .
Even if home prices had leveled off or fallen only slightly , there probably would have been no crisis .
In the light of the historical record the bond - rating agencies assumed , as their worst case scenario , that home prices would dip by a few percent .
It was because of this assumption that they gave high ratings to a huge amount of pooled and repackaged mortgage debt ( mortgage backed securities ) that included subprime mortgages and the like .
Today these securities are called “ toxic ” - very few investors are willing to touch them .
But if the bond - rating agencies had been right about the worst case scenario , the investors who thought that they were buying safe , investment grade securities would indeed have reaped a decent profit .
As we now know , however , the bond - raters were wrong , massively wrong , and thus there has been a massive mortgage market crisis .
According to the latest Case - Shiller Index figures , between the peak in July 2006 and July of this year , US home prices fell by 19.5 percent .
And because the mortgages were pooled and resold as mortgage - backed securities , the mortgage market crisis has spread throughout the financial system and become a generalized financial crisis .
I now want to say a bit about who or what is to blame .
We ’re hearing a lot about greed , but capitalists are always greedy .
But we do n’t always have massive crises .
So what explains the fact that we have one now ?
There ’s also a lot of talk about lax regulation and insufficient regulation .
I know of no better answer to this notion than the answer recently given by Joseph Stiglitz .
In a Sept. 17 article , “ How to prevent the next Wall Street crisis ” ( http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/
09/17/stiglitz.crisis/) , Stiglitz , a Nobel Laureate and former World Bank chief economist , proposed a six - point program chock - full of regulations and laws .
But he then acknowledged : “ These reforms will not guarantee that we will not have another crisis . ”
So why the title “ How to prevent the next Wall Street crisis ” ?
Stiglitz went on explain why his proposed reforms are no guarantee : “ The ingenuity of those in the financial markets is impressive .
Eventually , they will figure out how to circumvent whatever regulations are imposed . ”
Yes .
So why the 6 - point program ?
He then wrote , “ But these reforms will make another crisis of this kind less likely , and , should it occur , make it less severe than it otherwise would be . ”
Hmm .
If the financial markets will eventually circumvent whatever regulations are imposed , then why is n’t another crisis equally likely with these regulations as without them ?
And why wo n’t it be as severe with them as without them ?
Finally , I want to say a few words about the significance of the various government interventions we ’ve seen this year –the government ’s forced dismantling of Bear Stearns , the nationalization of Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae , and AIG , and the bailout money that ’s being used to partially nationalize the banking system .
Some commentators portray this , as I noted earlier , as an effort to make the rich richer .
Others depict it as some sort of progressive turn , an ideological shift away from the “ free market . ”
I think both notions are seriously mistaken .
What we are witnessing is a new manifestation of state - capitalism .
It is n’t the state - capitalism of the former USSR , characterized by central “ planning ” and the dominance of state property ; it is state - capitalism in the sense in which Raya Dunayevskaya used the term to refer to a new global stage of capitalism , characterized by permanent state intervention , that arose in the 1930s with the New Deal and similar policy regimes ( Marxism and Freedom , Humanity Books , 2000 , pp. 258 ff . ) .
The purpose of the New Deal , just like the purpose of the latest government interventions , was to save the capitalist system from itself .
Because many liberal and left commentators choose to focus on the distributional implications of these interventions - who will the government rescue , rich investors and lenders or average homeowners facing foreclosure ?- let me stress that I mean “ save the capitalist system ” in the literal sense .
The purpose of these interventions is not to make the rich richer , or even to protect their wealth , but to save the system as such .
Consider the takeover of Bear Stearns .
It was in serious trouble but there were other ways of dealing with its troubles than by the government forcing it to be sold to JP MorganChase .
Had Bear Stearns been able to borrow from the Fed , it could have overcome the cash - flow problem it faced .
But the Fed waited until the following day to announce that it would now lend to Wall Street firms .
Or , if Bear Stearns had been allowed to file for bankruptcy , it could have continued to operate , and its owners ’ shares of stock would not have been acquired at a fraction of their market value .
Instead the Fed forced it to be sold off .
Thus the takeover was definitely not a way of bailing out Bear Stearns ’ owners .
Nor was the Fed out to enrich the owners of JP Morgan Chase .
( The Fed selected it as the new owner of Bear Stearns ’ assets because it was the only financial firm big enough to buy them . )
Instead the Fed acted as it did in order to send a clear signal to the financial world that the US government would do whatever it could to prevent the failure of any institution that is “ too big to fail ” , because such a failure could ultimately bring the financial system crashing down .
And consider the government ’s rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
This came about because of a sharp decline in their share prices .
But the government did n’t rescue them in order to prop up the price of their share prices .
Their share prices continued to decline after the rescue plan was announced , precisely because the government ’s motivation was not to bail out their shareholders .
Indeed , the shareholders are n’t receiving any money from the government .
Only those institutions and investors that lent to them are being compensated for their losses , and the government had been seriously considering not compensating some of these lenders ( the holders of subordinated debt ) .
Just as in the Bear Stearns case , the point of the intervention was to restore confidence in the financial system by assuring lenders that , if all else fails , the US government will be there to pay back the monies that are owed to them .
The new manifestation of state - capitalism we are witnessing is essentially non-ideological in character .
Henry Paulson is certainly no champion of government regulation or nationalization .
But at this moment of acute systemic crisis , ideological scruples simply have to be set aside .
The be -all and end - all priority is to serve the interests of capitalism–capitalism itself , as distinct from capitalists .
As Marx noted , “ The capitalist functions only as personified capital ….
[ T ] he rule of the capitalist over the worker is [ actually ] the rule of things [ capital ] over man , … of the product [ capital ] over the producer ” ( Results of the Immediate Process of Production , ” in Penguin ed. of Capital , vol. 1 , pp. 989-90 , emphasis in original ) .
The goal is the continued self - expansion of capital , of value that begets value to beget value , the accumulation of value for the sake of the accumulation of value - not for the sake of the consumption of the rich .
Of course , we are indeed witnessing a movement away from “ free - market ” capitalism , and back to more government control and even temporary ownership .
But this is a pragmatic matter rather than an ideological one .
There ’s nothing inherently progressive about it .
The government is simply doing what it must , whatever it must , to prevent a collapse of the system .
The recent state capitalist interventions are perhaps best described as the latest phase of what Marx called “ the abolition of the capitalist mode of production within the capitalist mode of production itself ” .
There is nothing private about the system any more except the titles to property .
As I ’ve been stressing here , the government is not even intervening on behalf of private interests : it is intervening on behalf of the system itself .
Such total alienation of an economic system from human interests of any sort is a clear sign that it needs to perish and make way for a higher social order .
The current economic crisis is bringing misery to tens of millions of working people .
But it is also bringing us a new opportunity to get rid of a system that is continually rocked by such crises .
The financial crisis has caused so much panic in the financial world that the fundamental instability of capitalism is being acknowledged openly on the front pages and the op - ed columns of leading newspapers .
Great numbers of people are already searching for an explanation of what has gone wrong .
Many of them may be ready to consider a whole different way of life , and many more will be ready to consider this as the recession in the real economy deepens .
Revolutionary socialists need to be prepared , not just prepared to organize , but prepared with a clear understanding of how capitalism works , and why it can not be made to work for the vast majority .
And we need to get serious about working out how an alternative to capitalism - one that is not just a different form of capitalism - might be a real possibility .
* This talk is posted on the New SPACE website at http://new-space.mahost.org/crisis08talk.
The talk draws in part on Andrew Kliman , “ Trying to Save Capitalism from Itself ” ( April 25 ; available at marxisthumanismtoday.org/node/13 and at www.thehobgoblin.co.uk/2008_11_AK_Economy.htm) and Andrew Kliman , “ A crisis for the centre of the system ” ( Aug. 23 ; published in International Socialism , No. 120 , available at http://isj.org.uk)./
Addition , October 22 :
In discussion following this talk , questions were raised about how my discussion of capital destruction is related to Marx ’s “ law of the tendential fall in the rate of profit . ”
To address this , let me quote from pages 30 - 31 of my book Reclaiming Marx ’s “ Capital ” : A refutation of the myth of inconsistency ( Lexington Books , 2007 ) :
“ what Marx meant by the “ tendency ” of the rate of profit to fall was not an empirical trend , but what would occur in the absence of the various “ counteracting influences , ” such as the tendency of the rate of surplus - value to rise . ”
“ He singled out one of these counteracting influences , the recurrent devaluation of means of production , for special consideration .
Like the tendential fall in the rate of profit itself , and the tendency of the rate of surplus - value to rise , the devaluation of means of production is a consequence of increasing productivity .
Capitalists incur losses ( including losses on financial investments ) as a result of this devaluation ; a portion of the capital value advanced in the past is wiped out .
In this way ( as well as by means of their tendency to cause the price of output to fall ) , increases in productivity tend eventually to produce economic crises .
Yet since the advanced capital value is the denominator of the rate of profit , the annihilation of existing capital value acts to raise the rate of profit and thus helps to bring the economy out of the crisis ( see Marx [ Capital , vol . 3 ] , chap .
15 , esp. pp. 356-58 , 362-63 [ of the Penguin ed. ] ) . ”

BA is urging stranded passengers to be in close contact about flights home UK airlines are seeking volunteers to give up seats so the thousands of people still stranded after the volcanic ash disruption can get home .
British Airways ( BA ) has asked customers who are booked on long - haul flights up to 2 May to make way for those who were stranded .
And Virgin Atlantic says many such volunteers have contacted the airline .
But many airlines ' long - haul passengers still face weeks of delays , with re-booked returns stretching into May .
Earlier BA rejected suggestions it was prioritising new passengers over those stranded abroad .
British airspace reopened on Tuesday following almost a week of grounded flights .
Although more planes than usual are flying , tens of thousands of Britons are still stuck overseas .
Airlines are adopting different strategies to get their customers home as soon as possible .
BA is seeking volunteers who can delay their journey and give up their seats for a stranded passenger .
STRANDED PASSENGERS Egypt : 10,000 Florida : 9,000 India : 8,000 South Africa : 5,000 California : 4,000 Thailand : 2,500 Malaysia : 2,000
Other significant regions : Caribbean ( especially Antigua , Barbados , Cuba ) ; Dubai ; Maldives Source : Industry figures compiled by travel journalist Simon Calder
The company says those volunteers can then re-book on later flights at no extra cost , but the re-arranged flight has to be at least seven days after the original departure date .
Some passengers have complained that BA appeared to be selling empty seats on earlier flights to new passengers .
BA said its computer system forced empty seats to be made available for sale , but the tickets had been significantly overpriced so they would remain unsold and stranded customers were not being asked to pay anything extra when their flight was re-booked .
Virgin Atlantic is also taking up offers from volunteers who can fly home at a later date .
Backlog Easyjet said it was setting up stand - by desks in airports to process waiting passengers , while Ryanair said it had cleared its backlog .
Travel journalist Simon Calder said holiday firm Thomson aimed to bring all its stranded customers back by Monday .
In some areas of the world , there is a significant lack of air capacity to enable British people to be returned quickly
Mark Tanzer
Abta Emirates said it was putting on extra flights , and that it had repatriated 6,000 passengers so far .
The airline said the vast majority would be back home in the next week or so .
It said customers affected could cancel their booking or change their onward destination without incurring charges .
American Airlines said it was " very close to finishing the repatriation " .
The Association of British Travel Agents ( Abta ) said it aimed to have repatriated more than 100,000 British passengers by the end of the weekend .
But chief executive Mark Tanzer said : " While most flights are back to normal , and most stranded British passengers will be back by the end of this weekend , there is still quite a high level of disruption in some destinations .
" In some areas of the world , there is a significant lack of air capacity to enable British people to be returned quickly . "
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson said the blanket ban on flights had been an " overreaction " , insisting that there had been " no danger at all " to flying .
He said that Virgin engineers had advised that there had been plenty of flight corridors which were " quite safe " and called for compensation for the air industry after the ban cost his airline £ 50 m in six days .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has defended the government 's stance , insisting that passengers had to be " safe and secure " .
Sir Richard said the airline was still " battling " to get some people home from some routes , including Orlando and the Caribbean and that it was " nearly on top of the problem , maybe another week or so to go " .
Bills mounting Paul Lewis from the BBC's Money Box programme warned the fallout from the volcanic ash would " hit people so hard " in their wallets .
He said the British Bankers Association had said its members would be sympathetic and most banks were offering to waive charges for foreign withdrawals and cash advances on credit cards , and penalty charges for exceeding overdraft limits .
We do not feel like we are being prioritised as stranded passengers .
It 's a disaster .
Andrew , stranded in Cape Town Volcanic ash : Still stranded abroad
He warned stranded Britons could also be faced with huge mobile phone bills as they attempted to book flights .
O2 has said it is allowing customers to call BA , Virgin , Thomson , BMI and Easyjet free .
Britons stranded in Bangkok are said to be too scared to leave Suvarnabhumi Airport for fear of being caught up in anti-government protests taking place in the capital .
Some passengers have described the situation as a " dog- eat - dog atmosphere " as fellow tourists scramble for flights home .
Briton Tim Rutledge , who is awaiting a flight home , said not only was there trouble with the protests , but it was " brewing up " and " getting a bit nasty " inside the airline offices at the airport .
Over the weekend BA hopes to send out extra planes to repatriate customers from New York , Newark , the Maldives , Antigua / St Kitts , Barbados , Johannesburg , Dubai , Sharm El Sheikh , Mumbai , Bangkok and Hong Kong .
The airline said it was aiming to operate a full service on Saturday out of Heathrow , Gatwick and London City .
BA 's European subsidiary , Openskies , is also operating extra flights and BA Cityflyer is adding extra flights from Madrid and Barcelona into London City for the next four days .

Right now about 10,000 people in New York City are waiting for someone , most likely a stranger , to save their life .
At any given time at least that many New Yorkers are on the national waiting list for an organ transplant , according to the New York Organ Donor Network .
Now , one group wants to lower that number and they ’re looking to regular people to make that happen .
“ The waiting lists are enormous and many , many patients do n’t get the organs they need , ” said Douglas Cohen , a neuro - surgeon at St Luke ’s - Roosevelt hospital .
Although Cohen is not a part of the Coalition made up of lawmakers , doctor's , and the Organ Donor Network , but he could n’t agree more with its cause .
Today , New Yorkers , like the rest of Americans , are given the option of opting into organ donation when he or she gets a drivers license .
The coalition wants to reverse that , making becoming a donor “ opt out . ”
That means when you get your license , you need to actively say , " No , I do not want to donate my organs when I die ” .
If you do not , you ’re presumed to be willing to donate .
As it stands now , only about 11 percent of eligible New Yorkers are organ donors .
Dr. Cohen believes that number would be higher if New York did become an “ opt out ” state .
“ In general if the passive route involves the most good , then its probably better to set up a system in that fashion , because people will end up doing what ’s passive which is what ’s right , " Cohen said .
But when it comes to matters of a person 's own body , nothing is simple and not everyone will agree .
Manhattan resident Boris Vischnevski thinks it 's a bad idea .
“ It ’s pretty stupid , " Vischnevski said .
" You ca n't put somebody on the list just because they do n’t give you an answer .
It ’s unethical ”
On the religious end , Rabbi Joseph Potasnik , of the New York Board of Rabbis , argues that spiritual concerns would n’t necessarily clash with a new law like this -- so long as the DMV makes the options clear .
“ If your family member was in dire need of that organ what would your position be ? ” asked Potasnik .
Currently , the legislation to " opt out " has more than a dozen sponsors in Albany .
Mead - Johnson , the company that prides itself on its “ decades - long patterning of infant formulas after breast milk , ” now goes one better .
It sells chocolate - and vanilla - flavored formulas for toddlers , fortified with nutrients , omega - 3s , and antioxidants .
The company ’s philosophy : Your toddler wo n’t drink milk ?
Try chocolate milk !
The unflavored version of this product , Enfagrow , has been around for a while .
In 2005 , nutritionists complained about this formula because it so evidently competed with milk as a weaning food .
Mead - Johnson representatives explained that Enfagrow is not meant as an infant formula .
It is meant as a dietary supplement for toddlers aged 12 to 36 months .
Really ?
Then how come it is labeled “ Toddler Formula ” ?
And how come it has a Nutrition Facts label , not a Supplement Facts label ?
Here ’s the list of ingredients for everything present at a level of 2 % or more :
Whole milk
Nonfat milk
Sugar
Cocoa
Galactooligosaccharides ( prebiotic fiber )
High oleic sunflower oil
Maltodextrin
I bought this product at Babies - R - Us in Manhattan .
It ’s not cheap : $ 18.99 for 29 ounces .
The can is supposed to make 22 servings ( one - quarter cup of powder mixed with 6 ounces water ) .
At that price , you pay 86 cents for only six ounces of unnecessarily fortified milk plus unnecessary sugar and chocolate .
No wonder Jamie Oliver encountered so much grief about trying to get sweetened , flavored milks out of schools .
But really , are n’t you worried that your baby might be suffering from a chocolate deficit problem ?
Do n’t you love the idea of year - old infants drinking sugar - sweetened chocolate milk ?
And laced with “ omega - 3s for brain development , 25 nutrients for healthy growth , and prebiotics to support the immune system ” ?
Next : let ’s genetically modify moms to produce chocolate breast milk !
FDA : this package has front - of - package health claims clearly aimed at babies under the age of two .
Uh oh .
Should n’t you be sending out one of those package label warning letters to Mead - Johnson on this one ?
Addition , May 1 : in response to interest in what other products are made by Mead - Johnson , or its parent , the drug company Bristol - Myers Squibb , I ’ve linked their names to product pages .
Addition , May 6 : Julie Wernau of the Chicago Tribune did a front page ( business section ) story on this and is following up on it in her blog .
This is weird because just as I understand some of what they are saying it descends into randomness to my ears .
Kind of like how this song is supposed to sound like english but it is really gibberish ( ok so I wanted a reason to post this video but the point remains ) .
This picture was taken right after we finished shooting The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary last year .
I 'm not going to lie to you , Marge : it 's one of my prized possessions .
It 's taken me this long to share it , because shortly after I upgraded my Macs to Snow Leopard , all of my Macs and my HP scanner stopped talking to each other .
I spent a lot of time researching help forums , looking for updated drivers , and saying lots of swears , because it appeared that HP blamed Apple , and Apple blamed HP .
My scanner still does n't work with any of my Macs , but I am able to bring you this picture today thanks to the magic of Linux .
If you 've been reading my blog for a long time ( or you 've gone through the archives ) you know that I love the Linux operating system .
I first switched to Linux in 2002 , and eventually ended up running a heavily - modified version of Debian for years , until I was seduced by the elegance and stability of OS X .
From time to time , though , I grab a LiveCD ( usually Ubuntu , these days , though I 've gone through most of them at one time or another ) and spend an hour or so poking around to see what 's new and how quickly I can break it .
Shortly before I went to Vancouver for Eureka , I burned an iso of Ubuntu 10.4 beta , to see what all the fuss was about ( short version : Ubuntu made some significant UI changes for that version , and a lot of Linux users are apparently as keen on change as Garth was in Wayne 's World . )
My incredibly short review : I liked it .
I thought it looked nice on my iMac , it booted fast from the DVD and ran smoothly once I was logged in .
It comes with enough software to give a curious user a good feel for what it does without overwhelming them with options , and it autoconfigured every single thing I had ... including my HP scanner .
When I realized I could finally scan this picture — and get a cool Linux advocacy story — I took carefully took it off the top of my desk ( where I stuck it with two - sided tape several months ago ) and scanned it .
I put a thumb drive into the machine , which Ubuntu recognized immediately , copied the file over , and ran into my office to put it on my MBP .
I remember , back in the old days when we had to use vi to edit our config files , how much we all longed for a day when Linux Just Worked ™ ; I think it 's pretty cool that , in this case , it did .

ANNAPOLIS , Md. —
Law school students nationwide are facing growing attacks in the courts and legislatures as legal clinics at the schools increasingly take on powerful interests that few other nonprofit groups have the resources to challenge .
On Friday , lawmakers here debated a measure to cut money for the University of Maryland ’s law clinic if it does not provide details to the legislature about its clients , finances and cases .
The measure , which is likely to be sent to the governor this week , comes in response to a suit filed in March by students accusing one of the state ’s largest employers , Perdue , of environmental violations — the first effort in the state to hold a poultry company accountable for the environmental impact of its chicken suppliers .
Law clinics at other universities — from New Jersey to Michigan to Louisiana — are facing similar challenges .
And legal experts say the attacks jeopardize the work of the clinics , which not only train students with hands - on courtroom experience at more than 200 law schools but also have taken on more cases against companies and government agencies in recent years .
Three people who fell to their deaths from a Glasgow tower block on Sunday are believed to have been Russian nationals who had been trying to claim asylum in the UK from Canada .
A source close to the case said the three were a father , aged 43 and named Serykh , believed to be a former member of the Russian security services , a mother , and a son in his early 20s .
The source said it was a highly unusual case .
The family are said to have been trying to claim asylum in the UK from Canada , which had reportedly given them leave to stay but had denied them citizenship .
They are said to have first arrived in the UK in November 2007 and came to Glasgow in autumn last year .
The bodies were found at the foot of the 30 - storey block in the Springburn area of north - east Glasgow on Sunday morning .
Strathclyde police have said they will not release the identities or nationalities of the deceased until next of kin have been traced and informed .
The Home Office , meanwhile , has denied that there was any UK Borders Agency activity at the property on Sunday morning after claims by some living in the area that there may have been a raid on the flat prior to the incident .
The source said the family had been in Canada from November 2000 to November 2007 before travelling through Germany , the Netherlands and Ireland to the UK , where they initially lived in Brent in north London .
The source said the family had made a series of wild claims about the Canadian government .
No one at the Canadian high commission was available for comment .
Their case to stay in the UK had been rejected but the Home Office was not pursuing them immediately .
Their financial support had been withdrawn and they had been asked to vacate their flat .
They had also been told to approach the Scottish Refugee Council and other charities for emergency assistance .
Neighbours said the three had only moved into the flat in the Red Road complex two months ago .
Carol Craig , 51 , and Graham Galbraith , 38 , who live in the flat next door , said they were woken by police on Sunday morning who told them that their immediate neighbours had fallen to their deaths .
When the couple looked over their own balcony on the 15th floor of 63 Petershill Drive , they saw three bodies on the small patch of grass below .
" We last saw them on Saturday , " said Craig .
" They were out on the landing .
I thought it was a family .
It 's been such a shock .
I ca n't get it out of my head . "
The Red Road towers , at one time the highest in Europe , have been a feature of Glasgow 's skyline since the 1960s , but have fallen into disrepair and are due for demolition .
In recent years , they have been used to house many refugees and asylum seekers from a variety of countries , including Kosovo , parts of Africa , Iraq and Afghanistan .
Paint is peeling from the walls and the small balconies are protected only by plastic mesh .
The block at Petershill Drive is currently leased to the YMCA .
A spokesman for the organisation said they could not comment on the nationality of those who had died .
Today small groups of asylum seekers gathered at the spot where the three died .
A single candle had been lit and pieces of paper laid out on the scarred and pitted patch of grass with the words : " Freedom , please believe us . "
Seyed Ali Ghasemi , 28 , from Iran , who lives in an adjoining tower , said he could understand the desperation that might drive someone to take their own life .
Those seeking asylum only have each other for support , he says , and everyone is worried about their own situation .
He had looked out of his window on Sunday morning and had assumed that the figures he saw at the base of the opposite tower were sleeping rough , as he himself has done in the past .
" It is very , very sad .
They are scared .
They are just so fed up of everything .
Maybe I 'm in a bad situation and I do the same thing .
I have not seen my son for two years .
We are all scared and fed up , " he said .
Ledia Tewelde , 22 , from Eritrea , said that last year she had jumped from the window of her second floor flat in another part of Glasgow , after hearing loud noises at the door and fearing she was about to be deported .
She said she broke both her ankles and injured her back .
" I was very , very scared .
I thought there was somebody coming into the room and I just jumped .
I did n't want to go back to my country .
I have been four years in this country with nothing .
They give me vouchers for my food .
You come from a bad situation and you come here and you are scared .
It is very stressful . "
Robina Qureshi , director of Positive Action in Housing , a charity that works with refugees and asylum seekers , said it was time for an overhaul of the asylum process .
" This case raises serious questions about the way the UK asylum system operates in this country .
Members of the public have a right to know if we have a fair asylum system or one which terrorises vulnerable people to the point they would kill themselves .
" We believe the current asylum system is based on the false premise that all asylum seekers are bogus . "

You do n't have to be so polite .
You really do n't want your opponent to be lucky , do n't you ?
J/k , gm is a good talent toi have if it 's not over the top .
Anyways , thank you NonY !
I 'm looking forward to watching more of your games ( livestream ) .

Most starcraft players are used to the pre-game lobby as a form of chat , and a place to say these things .
Being unable to speak until the game is in progress just seems alot different , and because of that , I too only happen to say hi or gl hf occasionally .

Saracen Profile Blog Joined December 2007 United States 5139 Posts # 15 I actually just starting experimenting with Phoenix openings in PvZ a few days before you posted this thread and it's been working really well .
Despite all the complaints on the SC2 forums , I do n't think Phoenixes are underpowered at all - they have incredible harassment potential , especially if you keep on making them .
People keep expecting them to be the Corsair v2.0 , but they just do n't work that way , and in that sense , I think they 're even more flexible .
This thread needs more love .
Thanks ,

One of my favorite reps in this pack is the 3 minute game on Desert Oasis .
I dunno why , but I guess it makes me feel better knowing that stuff can happen to the best of the best .
^_^
However , the REAL meat here , is the Phoenix play .
Using them in this manner has single handedly help me beat opponents who I could not beat before .
I did n't get to see the Day9 ep on this pack but I look forward to the VOD .

The Federal Communications Commission is proposing an ambitious 10 - year plan that will reimagine the nation ’s media and technology priorities by establishing high - speed Internet as the country ’s dominant communication network .
The plan , which will be submitted to Congress on Tuesday , is likely to generate debate in Washington and a lobbying battle among the telecommunication giants , which over time may face new competition for customers .
Already , the broadcast television industry is resisting a proposal to give back spectrum the government wants to use for future mobile service .
The blueprint reflects the government ’s view that broadband Internet is becoming the common medium of the United States , gradually displacing the telephone and broadcast television industries .
It also signals a shift at the F.C.C. , which under the administration of President George W. Bush gained more attention for policing indecency on the television airwaves than for promoting Internet access .
According to F.C.C. officials briefed on the plan , the commission ’s recommendations will include a subsidy for Internet providers to wire rural parts of the country now without access , a controversial auction of some broadcast spectrum to free up space for wireless devices , and the development of a new universal set - top box that connects to the Internet and cable service .
When British cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned against contact with extraterrestrials in a new Discovery Channel documentary , he was repeating a well - worn argument .
If aliens ever visit us , I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America , which didnt turn out very well for the Native Americans .
But Hawkings reasoning is flawed on a number of counts .
First , we can ask why the aliens would come here with guns blazing .
What could they possibly want ?
Hawking suggests that Earths resources ...
Depending on what arguments you supply , the : edit command may do one of 3 things :
pass it the name of a file , and it will open that file in the current window
pass it the name of a directory , and it will open a file explorer for that directory
when called with no arguments , the : edit command will revert to the latest saved version of the current file .
To discard unwanted changes , you will have to force this command with a trailing ‘!’ bang .
Pressing the < tab > key triggers auto - complete for directories and files that match the characters you have typed so far .
If you want to open several files from the same directory , specifying the full path can start to feel like a lot of extra work .
You could set the working directory to match that of the file being edited in the current window by issuing the command :
: cd % : h
However , this can make it harder to locate some files , because you have to climb the directory tree before drilling down again .
I prefer to create a set of shortcuts for opening files located in the same directory as the current file :
let mapleader = ' , ' map < leader > ew : e < C - R >= expand ( " % : p : h " ) . " / " < CR > map < leader > es : sp < C - R >= expand ( " % : p : h " ) . " / " < CR > map < leader > ev : vsp < C - R >= expand ( " % : p : h " ) . " / " < CR > map < leader > et : tabe < C - R >= expand ( " % : p : h " ) . " / " < CR >
Now , I can run , ew and it expands to :e path/to/directory /of/current / file / .
This makes it really easy to open several files from the same directory .
The ‘ ew ’ command stands for open in window .
The other variants stand for open in split ( ‘es ’ ) , open in vertical split ( ‘ev ’ ) and open in tab ( ‘et ’ ) respectively .
Update
Thanks to Gary Bernhardt , here is a less horrible way of creating the same mappings :
cnoremap %% < C - R >= fnameescape ( expand ( ' % : h' ) ) . '/' < cr > map < leader > ew : e % % map < leader > es : sp % % map < leader > ev : vsp % % map < leader > et : tabe %%
Additionally , this allows you to expand the directory of the current file anywhere at the command line by pressing % % .

Its equipment is in place at more than 60 public exchanges and , Labovitz said , over the past year the company has deployed its Google Global Cache servers in more than half of all large consumer networks in North America and Europe .
Google has effectively cut out the middleman and now more than half of its traffic is sent directly from its servers to the world 's consumer ISPs , Arbor revealed .
Next , it could cut out the ISPs as well by offering internet plans itself .
With a wealth of infrastructure already in place , Google recently announced it was taking the next step by building an experimental fibre - to - the - home network in parts of the US servicing initially between 50,000 and 500,000 homes .
Google plans to connect these homes to the internet at blistering speeds of 1 Gbps .
By comparison , the upcoming National Broadband Network in Australia is predicted to offer about 100 Mbps .
" I think Google is gearing up to be potentially quite a formidable competitor to existing telcos and ISPs , given their moves into the infrastructure level , " Warren Chaisatien , research director and principal analyst at Australian firm Telsyte , said .
Indeed , at the recent Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , Google chief executive officer Eric Schmidt was heckled by telco representatives in the audience who feared that Google was increasingly competing with them not only on the infrastructure level , but also by selling its mobile phone , the Nexus One , directly to consumers online , and by releasing apps such as Google Voice , which allows users to bypass the networks to make voice calls .
Schmidt stressed the Google was purely experimenting in an effort to see what was required to bring networks up to 1 Gbps , which could pave the way for more exciting applications and convince telcos to upgrade their networks .
Analysts are n't buying it .
" I think what we are seeing today is that Google is conquering the world , starting from online content but now they are building infrastructure , " Chaisatien said .
Chaisatien believes that , in the next five to 10 years , the ISP , telecoms and utilities industries will merge to form " smart grids " .
He said this was " one of the key arenas that Google intends to play very strongly in " .
Steve Dalby , chief regulatory officer with iiNet , said the ISP saw Google as a significant player in the online world but did not fear it any more than other potential competitors .
Peter Coroneos , chief executive of the Internet Industry Association , which counts both Google and the ISPs as members , said increasing competition between Google and telcos would only provide better outcomes for consumers .
He pointed to the roll - out of cable networks in the US , which unlike in Australia are not controlled by existing telco players , but by companies traditionally in the television space .
The end result is consumers get more choice and cheaper access to the internet .
" What we 're witnessing is technological convergence and , in the long term , people are going to be getting their internet access from many different sources , " Coroneos said .
" Change is necessarily painful but the successful well - managed companies will always adapt , and that 's why in the face of the cable threat in the US the telcos are still profitable companies . "
Loading
Google 's push into infrastructure will inevitably add to fears surrounding its overwhelming corporate power , and increase regulatory heat on the company .
But Coroneos pointed out that Facebook this week overtook Google as the most trafficked site in the US , showing that dominance can never be assured .
" Competition is important and we have very strong laws in Australia to prevent abuse of market power ... so you would expect our competition laws to keep it in check , " he said .
I wish everyone on Earth -- including Oprah , and Jenny McCarthy , everyone -- would take 19 minutes of their lives and watch Michael Specter talk about why science is so important :
Of course , Jenny McCarthy wo n't listen .
But if the people who listened to her did , then they 'd stop listening to her .
And what a wonderful world that would be .

Formula 1 drivers have asked FIA race director Charlie Whiting to punish anyone weaving on the straight during a race with a drive - through penalty .
During Friday afternoon 's regular meeting with Whiting , the drivers moved to clarify the regulation allowing only one move to defend their position - as laid out in Appendix L of the FIA 's Sporting Code - after Lewis Hamilton was given a black - and - white warning flag for weaving across the track in front of Vitaly Petrov in the Malaysian Grand Prix .
Jarno Trulli told AUTOSPORT : " It is written in the rules that you cannot move more than once , but he got only a black - and - white warning flag .
Most of the drivers think that , no matter whether it is Lewis or anyone else , you should n't do it .
" And if you do , Charlie should not give a reprimand but a penalty so that we all know not to do it .
We do n't want a yellow card , we would prefer to have a red card .
" I think Charlie got the message and he 's happy with it .
It 's just a clarification of the rule . "
The Italian added that Hamilton 's driving was not " a big story " and that his case was being used as a means to clarify the regulation .
" The drivers would like it to be clear whether or not you can do that , " said Trulli .
" It 's not a comment on Lewis , because I did n't actually watch it .
" People were concerned because he moved a few times .
But he claimed that he was not actually blocking , he was trying to break the tow , which is fair enough .
" But Lewis was an example of what the drivers do not want to do .
For the future we all want to be clear that we have to get a penalty so that it is clear that each driver knows what you can do . "
The FIA Sporting Code states that " manoeuvres liable to hinder other drivers , such as more than one chance of direction to defend a position , deliberate crowding of a car beyond the edge of the track or any other abnormal change of direction , are strictly prohibited . "
Why Tony Stark is better than you
My all time hero as a developer is Tony Stark .
It has nothing to do with the fact he ’s rich , famous , or that he gets the ladies .
It ’s because Tony Stark builds his tech , front - end and back - end .
He does n’t make things that just do the job .
They do , but they look awesome while at it .
You see , most developers nowadays fit in one or more of the following brands of bad : “ I ’m a developer , hence : ”
I do n’t have to care about how things look .
I have a designer who handles that for me .
it ’s ok for me to be ignorant about how to lay down a good interface , because I ’m a right side of the brain kind of person .
I ’m happy with unusable interfaces that look plain bad .
Hey , as long as my forms get posted , I ’m set .
Now picture Tony Stark coming back from the cave where it all began , and hiring a team of designers to come up with the Iron Man suit .
Then having 2 meetings per week until finally , after 2 years , they come to a consensus , after which he retreats to his lab with the final design , and proceeds to build the suit , only to find out that turns out the groin region looks weird , so he re-submits the design to be amended .
Another few months of back and forth and he ’s done .
By then , the world has been taken over by the evil guys .
If you ca n’t design , do n’t be proud about it .
That most likely is so because either you learned to accept as gospel whatever negative remarks people made about your attempts at making something that looks good , or because you never tried .
And then because you decided it was n’t worth learning .
Listen up : there ’s nothing clever about limiting yourself .
This mindset makes you a code monkey .
You will never come up with anything that has any decent wow factor to it .
If you justify that by saying you like to write libraries exclusively , I ’d hedge my bets on them being average at best .
Why ?
Because you ’re not spending enough time solving end - user problems , hence , you got no clue on how you could make your library feel great to use .
It probably reeks of old school , cryptic software made for other mediocre programmers like yourself .
So what can you do about it ?
Stop believing Photoshop , Pixelmator , Illustrator , or anything else is too hard .
These tools can have a steep learning curve ( not as bad as you ’d think ) , but so did programming when you were starting on this game .
Nothing was immediately clear , you ’d see people writing awesome code all around and you had no clue on where to begin .
But you went on for over 30 minutes , asked questions , annoyed your programmer friends , and wrote bad code until you learned from a bunch of mistakes , and ( hopefully ) you got good at it .
That ’s the whole formula , and you already knew it .
Still do n’t want to fork the cash for these suites , or you consider yourself really incapable of learning any of them ?
Design straight in HTML and CSS .
It will be fast as hell once you master it , and like anything else , you will only master it by doing a lot .
HTML came a long way since the 90s .
Things do look great nowadays if you know how to write good markup and stylesheets .
What do you get in all this ?
Freedom and power .
The moment you ’re capable of make things look good AND on top of that , build fast and efficient back - ends , there ’s no stopping you .
Do n’t get me wrong , you might still work with specialized designers ( and you probably should ) , but you ’ll be in a very different position : you ’ll be a qualified collaborator .
Your knowledge of How Things Work™ combined with good architecture and style is what software nirvana is made of .
You ’re officially out of the bag of cats that a lot of self - appointed designers like CEOs and managers are , into the land of your input counts .
Do n’t side with mediocrity .
If you hear someone tell you you ca n’t do it , assume this person has an agenda in keeping you low .
Go aggressive on them .
Better yet : laugh .
Do n’t take full negatives as truth .
Your average work today is the half way through to awesomeness .
They do n’t have to believe that , but you do .
Then take suggestions well .
Which does n’t mean accepting them as they come .
Hear people out , and if it sounds like something you could like , then give it a try .
Come back to the person who made the suggestion and show your work .
If they like it , accept whatever compliments you get .
If they seem to find nits to pick ad nauseam , walk away .
It ’s poison .
It ’s likely that they ’re concerned about you becoming better than them so they just ca n’t hand that one to you .
And finally , hone those skills at every goddamned chance you have .
A few hours a week will do .
When you get any good , it will stop being a chore and start paying off .

I did n't know at the time that Tesla himself was enjoying an enormous and belated surge in popularity .
Everyone seems to be on Tesla 's side now , against the evils of Edison
Mostly I think inventors are probably dicks to each other across the board .
Last update , I mentioned I was going to the MoCCA Comic Festival in New York this coming weekend , I should add that I will be with the Topatoco table !
This is sort of a double update , but the double part is n't here .
Keep an eye out on the wonderful comic
Way back when I first started making comics , one of the very first happened to be about Nikola Tesla .
Do n't pay attention to the comic number there because when we re-launched the site , the early archives were all jumbled .
In any case , I still think the Tesla comic did more to spread my name around than any other since , very unexpected !

Everyone seems to be on Tesla 's side now , against the evils of Edison ( and how ! ) .
Edison is getting to be well known as the jerk he totally was !
But let us never forget :
He was n't the only one , as Marconi demonstrates for us .
I bet there is a ton of shit Tesla invented that got effed up and stolen by other people .
Probably cool shit like skateboards and helicopters too .
Mostly I think inventors are probably dicks to each other across the board .

Who 's downloading this one ?
I 'm no techno aficionado .
I like bleeps and bloops .
Who cares if they 're acid house or space jam or whatever ?
But I can tell you this : " Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat " is amazing .
And it 's from 1982 .
Advertisement
I may not know that much about techno , but specialist music website and retailer Boomkat sure does .
They uncovered Charanjit Singh 's amazing 1982 album , " Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat " and it's a mindbending treasure of vintage 303 and 808 sounds that makes retro-modern sound entirely new .
Here , just let them explain it :
Charanjit Singh's ' Ten Ragas To A Disco Beat ' is quite easily one of the maddest records we 've ever had in stock .
It was originally made in 1982 by a Bollywood soundtrack composer , intending to capitalise on the disco phenomenon with a combination of centuries - old classical Indian Ragas set to a disco backing .
To achieve this Charanjit used a prototypical acid set - up of Roland TB303 bass melody sequencer and TR808 drum computer together with a Jupiter - 8 keyboard .
He basically created a sound which mirrored , and more importantly , pre-dated the first acid house record - Phuture 's ' Acid Track ' by five years , and even preceded Chip E's ' Jack Trax ' in 1985 .
It 's no throw - away novelty record either , instead capturing the hypnotic potential of acid music in the most ornate and scarily prescient fashion , making explicit the similarities of infinitely arpeggiated bass sequences and pure electronic pulses that would soundtrack dancefloors for the next 30 odd years .
The more cynical among you will probably be thinking this is Ceephax or Aphex Twin delivering one of the most elaborate in - jokes of their career , but with the gatefold sleeve depicting the original sleeve and some in - depth liner notes from the label and Charanjit , our cynicism is waning in favour of absolute shock and awe .
' Ten Ragas To A Disco Beat ' is vintage futurism of the highest calibre , and made all the more amazing by the fact it came from India , a place hardly renowned for its electronic output !
This is a remarkable record and comes with our highest recommendation - AN ABSOLUTE FIND .

Boomkat has three sample tracks to whet your tongue 's ears .
Twitter has just announced that it has acquired Atebits , the company behind the popular Tweetie iPhone app and Mac desktop application .
Tweetie 's creator , Loren Brichter , will be joining the Twitter team as well .
The app will be renamed " Twitter for iPhone " and be made free in the next few weeks .
Twitter CEO Evan Williams explained the move in a blog post :
" We 're thrilled to announce that we 've entered into an agreement with Atebits ( aka Loren Brichter ) to acquire Tweetie , a leading iPhone Twitter client .
Tweetie will be renamed Twitter for iPhone and made free ( currently $ 2.99 ) in the iTunes AppStore in the coming weeks .
Loren will become a key member of our mobile team that is already having huge impact with device makers and service providers around the world . "
Twitter also specifically mentions that an official Twitter iPad app is indeed coming : " Developers , services , and publishers will be able to leverage the Twitter iPhone and iPad applications to create additional innovative tools and integrations for users , " Williams said in today 's announcement .
The move comes less than a week after a controversial blog post from Twitter investor Fred Wilson , Principal of Union Square Ventures .
In it , Wilson explained that he is looking for Twitter apps to not fill holes in the Twitter platform ( e.g. photo sharing , mobile apps ) and instead focus on innovative products and " killer apps . "
The post caught the attention of developers , who feared that Twitter itself would begin competing with their applications .
It 's uncertain what the acquisition of Tweetie means for unofficial Twitter mobile apps such as Echofon , TweetDeck , or Seesmic .
My latest pornographic discovery [ Aug. 8th , 2007 | 03:46 am ] Robin Bougie EDIT ( Sept 2012 ) :
All the awesome photos that were here in this post got dumped , and I can't be bothered to go gather them all up again .
No fear , they are all available here :

Every once and a while , I discover a lady who made smut that makes me practically drop everything and suddenly become a little obsessed .
Then I have to track down all her old films ( it 's almost always someone from the 60s or 70s , or maybe the early 80s ) until it subsides a little and I can go on with my life .
My current flavor of the moment is a French model who plied her trade in the French porn scene of the early to mid 90s -- producing some of the most visually arresting and memorable content to come out of that industry at that point in time .
She just DOESN 'T take a bad pic .
The camera loves her .
She was Monica Bellucci before there was a Monica Bellucci , motherfuckers .
Cept ' better , even .
Let me introduce to you : Chloé des Lysses ( aka her real name , Nathalie Boet ) , and she 's about to change the way you look at anal porn .
Yup .
Pooper - pumping is what I said .
Chloe was known for was teh anal sexors , but not JUST buggery the way North American porn sluts do it .
Her unique version of it was ELEGANT .
STOIC .
GORGEOUS .
SLEEK .
She makes this universally dirty act seem CLASSY .
Do n't get me wrong , I like skeezy , swearing , hair - pulling back - alley fuckbaggery , but to see someone who can make mud-muscle penetration look like it should be performed with a classical music soundtrack of Chopin or Motzart is something unusual and interesting .
Today , Chloe has dropped out of porn and works in Paris as an entertainment Journalist .
This is what she looks like today at the age of 35 .
If you dig on the photos , and want a hard copy .
Check out this hardcover art book that has a bunch of these in it 's pages :

And Torontonians can anticipate having dozens of walks for people to take .
Just visit Jane ’s
Walk website here for the expanding line up of walks .
Below is a typical listing :
These are rain or shine walks – with an umbrella and the many places to duck in , even rain can be daunted .
And if you tote a camera along the Spring colors and hues are just gorgeous .
Rain brings out colors like a coating of polish ; sunshine makes for great back - lighting and shimmering image studies .

So come for a pleasant walk which will promise to surprise you with at least 2 new facts about your Toronto neighbourhood and likely double that number in great pictures and memories .
BROOKLYN , N.Y . – Community residents filled the library at Brooklyn Tech High School Tuesday night to hear Jo Comerford , executive director of the National Priorities Project , speak on budget cuts , the federal budget and war spending .
Comerford , a nationally - known expert on budget matters and our country ’s tragically misdirected national priorities , helped clarify the complicated subject of federal spending so that people could see where and how their tax dollars are being used ( or misused ) .
People were able to see clearly that the oversized Pentagon budget ( $ 737 billion next year ! ) and the two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ( $ 1 trillion since 2001 ! ) were draining resources so that solutions to urgent domestic problems are becoming difficult , if not impossible , to solve .
Comerford also visited students at two high schools in the hours before the evening event .
At Carroll Gardens ’ Brooklyn School for Collaborative Studies and later at Brooklyn Tech High School , she addressed students who were asking why free transit MetroCards are being threatened by the MTA ( Metropolitan Transportation Authority ) and the city – who both are pleading poverty .
She pointed out that just in Brooklyn alone , taxpayers have doled out $ 9 billion on the two wars – money which could solve the mass transit shortfall many times over .
The events were sponsored by Brooklyn For Peace .
The Brooklyn Tech events were also sponsored by Progressive Student Awareness , a student club at that school .
A slideshow of the day ’s activities is available here .
Photo : During Comerford ’s talk with students at Brooklyn Tech High School , schools , health , environment and science collected the largest amount of students ’ “ dimes ” ( i.e. , their spending choices ) .
The military scored no money at all !

In response , Elaine Marshall blasted Burr moments ago :
“ Senator Burr and his Republican colleagues need to grow up , ” said Marshall .
“ The health care vote is over , they lost and it ’s time to move on to other business .
This is one more example of how Washington needs people who will get things done , not people who will stand in the way . ”
The committee was scheduled to hear from Adm. Robert Willard , Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command ; Air Force Gen. Kevin Chilton , Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command ; and Gen. Walter Sharpe , Army Commander of U.S. forces in Korea .
However , before the hearing began , Burr used a procedural measure to delay the meeting .
Help Elaine Marshall restore real leadership for North Carolina by making a donation of $ 5 or more before the financial quarter ends on March 31st !
Richard Burr has got to go .
His legendary failed leadership is n't surprising anymore , but it is shameful .
It 's one thing to vote " no , " but it 's another thing to simply prevent anyone from cleaning the mess that you and your friends created .
North Carolina deserves a better leader .
Elaine Marshall is that leader .
On Monday , we set a goal to raise $ 20,000 online from 500 donors -- already we 've raised $ 21,885 from 578 donors .
So we 're upping the ante to $ 30,000 from 800 donors before midnight on Wednesday March 31st !
Can you help us finish strong and defeat Burr with a donation of $ 5 or more ?
Lightning streaks across the sky as lava flows from a volcano in Eyjafjallajokul April 17 , 2010 .

I realize that this photograph is pretty much the attention grabber from all those that I have taken in Iceland on this trip so I figured I would write up a little about what it took to get the image .
As soon as I got this assignment , a photograph of a volcano erupting with lightning inside of the ash plume was on my mind .
I had seen one a couple of years ago from a volcano in South America so I knew it happened .
When I was watching the ash during the first dusk I saw plenty of lightning so I knew I had a shot at making this picture .
I have shot lightning a few times before but it tends to be a bit of a fishing excursion because of the erratic habits of lightning bolts , this was less so .
I knew exactly where the lightning would be ( in the caldera ) and I just had to find a good vantage point .
Earlier in the day I spent some time with some sheep farmers , who lived directly across the valley from this eruption .
I noticed some cars crossing a river and driving northeast to get a better view inside the crater .
With dusk approaching , I decided to make a go of that route .
I drove my jeep across the river and down a very bumpy road that had been rebuilt through fields of mini-icebergs that had been deposited by a glacial flood triggered by the initial eruption .
It was here that I made another of my favorite images showing the “ Land of Ice and Fire ” that Iceland is known for .
Ice from a glacial flood triggered by a volcanic eruption is seen as the volcano continues to erupt near Eyjafjallajokul April 17 , 2010 .

It took 30 - 45 minutes of driving from the farm before I came upon a viewpoint where the road raised to follow a mountain .
Police were parked there informing drivers that the road had been washed out a little further up .
The two men inside , and all the police in general here , were extremely helpful and , although a bit tired from staring at a volcano for 8 hours , informed me that it was fine for me to drive up the road a bit and park to take some photographs .
I had not brought a tripod and unfortunately could not find my cable release before I left my home base New York .
In order to take a long exposure photograph I needed to use a magic arm clamp attached to the rear - view mirror with my camera and lens resting on the window frame of my Jeep .
This did two things .
It allowed me to steady the camera and it allowed me to hide from the biting cold and wind .
As long as the engine was off it offered a steady platform from which to photograph .

It took me a while to nail down the correct exposure .
I did a custom white balance off of the lightly clouded sky above the volcano to get the color that you see in this frame .
Below is a handful of images that were not quite right , to say the least , but in the end I managed to capture something that was as close as possible to what I was seeing .

Now came the difficult part , and the part where I was on my own as I had never done a photograph of lighting in a specific location like this before .
It was here that I realized I should have arrived on location when it was still daylight because focusing on lightning is next to impossible .
With a 5DMKII attached to a 70 - 200 I set the ISO at 100 and began to figure out my composition and how to take this picture .
Luckily there was just enough light for my camera to see – in live view mode on program .
In order to make sure things were sharp I zoomed in 10 x to manually focus my lens and tape it down so that it would n’t move .
This gave me the best chance of getting things sharp as autofocus tends not to work as well in dark situations like this .
From here on it was pure experimentation .
I tried several shutter speeds and apertures to get the right effect and found that above f5.6 it was difficult to see the bolts while below f4 it was too bright .
I also found that until the sun was completely gone , it created an odd and abstract view of the ash plume with a really slow shutter speed .
The volcano also made it difficult as only certain eruptions seemed to cause the lightning and they were the blackest and thickest of the bunch .
This made it difficult to see the bolts inside of the plume making it important to wait for a few powerful exterior bolts to get a good image .
Another challenge I tackled was that darn cable release I could n’t find .
This made it mandatory for me to physically press the shutter button on the BULB setting for as long as I could .
Perhaps this sounds simple but when it is literally freezing outside and with the car engine off that finger got pretty chilly as I held the shutter open for a minute or more to get a good amount of lightning in the frame .
It took several photographs to get this one and while there are a few other “ almost ” frames this one immediately struck me as successful , which led me to make probably my biggest mistake since I have been here .
With one photograph in the can I decided a change of focal length was in order .
I put the 16 - 35 mm lens on my camera and proceeded to take a few wide frames with the lightning in the crater .
Lightning and lava can be seen as a volcano erupts after dark in Eyjafjallajokul , Iceland April 17 , 2010 .

These worked relatively well but I think had I been zoomed in , this frame would have been ten times better than the one I got .
Unfortunate , but that is the way it goes sometimes .
Taking this wide shot was not the mistake .
The mistake was thinking that it would be possible to re-focus the 70 - 200 mm on lightning in complete darkness .
This was simply not possible .
After about half an hour of trying I realized that the long flight , jet - lag , and general exhaustion were setting in and it was time for bed so I began the long trek back to the hotel .
The key picture was frame # 32 from when I started the long exposures shot at :
110mm
ISO 50
F4
125 second exposure
White Balance : Custom

Why spend your summer working on FOSS ?
When you work in the open on free software , you create a body of work that follows you for the rest of your life .
Rather than a coding assignment done by thousands of other students and relegated to the bottom of the bit drawer at semester 's end , working in FOSS is a chance to contribute to a living project .
Working in FOSS gives you a chance to :
Work with real world large codebases .
Collaborate with real engineers and other professional experts .
Contribute to something meaningful while learning and earning student value .
Learn tools and processes that are just like what you are going to use if you work in technology after graduation .
Make friends and contacts around the globe .
Possibly attract attention that gets you an internship or job after graduation .
Earn while you learn .
We are planning to sponsor $ 5000 for full projects and $ 2500 for half projects .
Check out Summer_Coding_FAQ for more details .
Why work with Fedora and JBoss.org ?
Our projects are large and diverse .
We are very experienced at working with new contributors and helping them be successful .
Many long - time contributors continue to be around , lending expertise and mentoring .
People who stay around the community and do good work are noticed .
They get hired for jobs from it , including being hired by Red Hat .
Past Google Summer of Code students were hired by Red Hat , as well as interns in various positions .
This is just an example , as experience and reputation in the JBoss.org and Fedora Project communities is influential on your career in many ways .
As long - standing communities with many facets , it is possible for you to find many rewarding sub-projects to work on .
You should know that contributing to FOSS does n't require you to have super programming skills , or super - anything else .
You just need be interested and curious enough , and be willing to become comfortable being productively lost .
This is the state of learning through finding your way around and figuring things out .
Do you want to start from ideas mentors already have ?
Mentors and sub-projects have put up sections on the Summer Coding 2010 ideas page .
There you can find :
Full ideas that you might want to start on ;
Suggestions and use cases , to help you make up your own idea ;
Links to the sub - project / upstream where you can learn more .
For example , if you are interested in doing something for the RHQ Project , there is a link to an ideas page on their website and how to contact the team .
If you contact them , you can learn about even more ideas , and share some of your thinking .
Even if a mentor has an idea , you want to find one that inspires you .
You must become part of the idea yourself .
Mentors have until 13 May to finish idea pages
Mentors are updating those pages until then , so it crosses over with the student schedule .
If you see an idea you like , begin talking with the mentor immediately .
Check back with the idea page regularly and put a watch on the page .
Do you have an idea you need a mentor for ?
People can be most passionate about an idea that is their own .
That passion can be what helps you get through the hard part of the project .
Do you know what person or sub-project in JBoss or Fedora that might be the mentoring group for your idea ?
You need to do these things :
Contact the relevant sub - project for your idea or contact the discussion group .
Be prepared to explain your idea , receive input and criticism , and grow ( or reduce ) the idea so it has the best chance of being accepted for Fedora Summer Coding .
Create an idea page , noting in the section for mentors that you are looking for a mentor .
Use
How to create an idea page for Summer Coding to make the page .
Are you already working in the Fedora or JBoss communities ?
Students who are users , participants , or contributors in the Fedora and JBoss communities are encouraged to participate .
Do you have ideas for what you 'd like to see in the project ?
Are you working in an area of the project that might want to mentor you for your Summer Coding 2010 work ?
For example , if you write for the Fedora Documentation Project or translate for the Fedora Localization Project , talk with your group to see if there are ideas you can turn in to a student proposal , with another sub - project member as the mentor .
What are my chances of having a proposal accepted ?
This is the first year we are running a solo summer coding program , and many details are being finalized in parallel with taking and reviewing proposals .
For example , sponsors are still being sought , which affects the size of the funding pool .
We 'll announce this information as it is known and decided ; final funding - per - student may vary and is dependent on the quality of proposals as well as size of funding pool .
We may not be able to fund as many projects as we ran under the Google Summer of Code , but our goal is on quality and not quantity .
We intend to run Fedora Summer Coding in the future .
One idea is to run it for the summer in the Southern Hemisphere ( Sep 2010 to Feb 2011 ) .
If you do n't get in this round , keep trying !
You are welcome to keep lurking and offering ways to help improve the program for future rounds .
You are a mentor
Wanting to be a mentor is a good thing .
Join the discussion list and tell us about yourself , your project idea , and so forth .
You must be committed to work with the student and be a liaison between the student , sub - projects , upstreams , and the overall project ( Fedora Project or JBoss.org . )
You can come from a Fedora sub - project , an upstream such as a JBoss.org project , from a university or college sponsoring students , as a few examples .
After discussion on the main Summer Coding 2010 list , you will be invited to join the private mentor discussion list

What to do with your ideas
Put them here on the Summer Coding ideas page .
Reference
How to create an idea page for Summer Coding when creating your idea .
We are looking in to using OpenHatch for managing ideas .
If you are interested in learning more about that , join us on the Summer Coding SIG mailing list .
How to work with students
One way is to provide an idea for students to work on .
This idea might be very well planned out , in which case you may need a high - level of contact with the student to get it implemented correctly .
It is harder to find success where you are completely certain of how an idea needs to be implemented ; finding a student with the skills and interest to implement a specific solution is a lot harder than finding a student with enough skills to respond to a use case need .
Where you can have looser ideas , you may be able to find a student who works as a sort - of intern who can implement a solution to a use case you have .
In past experiences , students going after a use case are more likely to get somewhere with self - direction .
You may also want to work with a student who brings an idea to your sub-project .
This requires a different level of communication throughout the project , but can be the most rewarding .
Mentor responsibilities
You are an essential part of the student 's success , the project 's success , and the success for your overall organization ( Fedora , JBoss.org , or another ) .
Your responsibilities include :
Being an interface for an identified sub- project or SIG in Fedora or JBoss.org .
Helping students communicate with the overall project and any upstreams .
Be the final , accountable person for deciding if the student is successful or not , which affects payment .
Are you committed to working with all parties ?
You need to be committed to working on your part of the Fedora Summer Coding 2010 for it to be successful .
You may want to work with another mentor ( co- mentoring ) to ensure there is always someone available to work with the student and other project members .
For Summer Coding 2010 this is the process to follow when commenting on student proposals .
Conversations and especially decisions should happen on the Talk : page of the proposal .
When commenting on a student 's proposal , click on the discussion tab .
The first time the Talk : page is used , it comes up as an empty page .
Use a second - level section block to give the subject of your comment : == Subject of comment == Make your comments throughout the section
At the bottom of your comments , sign and date the block using the special tag for this : ~~~ ~.
Convention is to precede the tildes with two dashes :
This : ... blah blah blah , and so there .
--~~~~
Makes this : " ... blah blah blah , and so there .
-- Quaid 15:34 , 9 April 2010 ( UTC ) "
To reply to a comment , use the edit link for that comment .
When it is open for editing , go to the bottom to add your reply , adding it as a nested sub-section of the section you are commenting on .
If the section is a second - level section block , use a third - level : === Subject of reply to another comment ===
Be sure to sign your section with ~ ~ ~ ~ .
If you are adding a new section , you can edit the page , or use the + symbol that appears next to edit when you are viewing the Talk : ... page .
If you do a straight edit , add your new comment on the bottom as a new section .
If you use the + to edit , the contents of the Subject / headline are the second - level section name .
Fill out the body with your comments , and be sure to sign your section with ~ ~~ ~ .
For any discussions about proposals that happens on the summer - coding - discuss list , make sure to create a new section on the talk page .
List any decisions made and link back to the thread (s ) in the mailing list archives .
Save all changes .
For anyone who has a watch on this page , the discussion tab should show when there are new , unread discussion points for the viewer .
You are a sub- project
Sub - projects are teams working on discrete parts of the Fedora Project or JBoss.org .
For example :
Fedora Infrastructure
RHQ
Fedora Docs Team
Drools
Fedora Website Team

Summer Coding 2010 step - by - step for sub-projects
Working with students and the Summer Coding program
You can gain a lot of value from students working via the Summer Coding program in your sub - project area ; read GSoC report 2009 for examples .
Your sub - project may need to identify a single mentor to work with the student , if the mentor does n't come from somewhere else in Fedora / JBoss.org .
In addition , you want a back - up mentor or , in some cases , co-mentors , to ensure continuity for the student and the rest of the sub -project .
If you have ideas / problems you want students to work on , they are best served to the students as use cases .
If you do have a strong plan for execution , make that clear in the idea so the student knows it is more of a guided project .
Some experience shows that student projects have a higher success rate for all involved when more of the initial idea is from the student .
Keep that in mind as you create ideas .
Ideas can be divided in to several parts for different students .
There are no explicit limitations on how students may interact on multiple parts of a project .
For example , two students could team build a new component instead of working on two discrete components separately .
Fedora Summer Coding is about connecting sponsors ( those with resources to share ) with students ( those with time , passion , and skills to share . )

Other positive brand associations .
What you need to do
We need to start talking , soon .
Open by default on the discuss list - http://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-coding-discuss
Private via direct email to project leadership - Karsten Wade , ...
What are the resources you can supply ?
Money to pay stipends to students for spending focused time on these FOSS projects .
This is a cross between a summer job and an internship .
Someone to help coordinate and to contribute as part of the Fedora Summer Coding special interest group ( SIG ) .

Step - by - step for upstreams
Summer Coding 2010 step - by - step for upstreams
Has a student brought a project idea to you ?
Please join the discussion list and talk with us about it .
We 'll ask at least one member of your project to be on that list throughout the 2010 program .
It is not a requirement , and you can best work it out with the student 's assigned mentor .
Do you have one or more ideas you want exposed to students ?
As long as the idea is relevant for the Fedora Summer Coding program , you can put it on the Summer Coding 2010 ideas page .
Follow the process on that page .
As this is a program for the Fedora Project and JBoss.org , there must be some benefit to those projects for your upstream idea .
When you bring the topic to the discussion list , be prepared to talk about that .
There must be a demonstrable benefit to Fedora , even if it is only updated code in a package .
Another example is having a student do the work of getting your software packaged for Fedora .
All of your ideas and ramifications should be topics on the discussion mailing list .
Are you committed to working with all parties ?
A project needs a mentor .
Throwing an idea over the wall on to the wiki page does n't get it the attention it needs to be part of the Summer Coding program .
If you put an idea out there but do not have a mentor in mind for it , it is left open to the Summer Coding mentors and administators to sort out .
When considering a proposal , the mentors look at the amount of connection with upstream is required , and how strong the communication channels are .
A stronger connection means the proposal looks better .
You are a Campus Ambassador
Campus Ambassadors should work to guide new interests through this process .
They should work in both generating interest in Fedora Summer Coding within the Fedora Community and also generating interest in Fedora within student contributors .
Campus Ambassadors should then guide new contributors in helping them get set up with mentors and helping submit their Summer Coding proposal .
[ edit ]

Fearing that social workers would take her daughter away , Shahnaz Malik smuggled five - year - old Amaani out of the country .
After allegations that included Mrs Malik cuddling Amaani for too long while dropping her off at nursery , social services placed the little girl on a ' child protection plan ' and scheduled a child mental health assessment .
But using tickets booked under assumed names , Mrs Malik and her daughter caught a ferry to Ireland from a Welsh port .
Police arrested her husband for obstructing their investigation , and raided their Birmingham home in the hunt for Amaani .
Detectives even removed toothbrushes from their home to obtain DNA , in case the pair had been murdered .
Mrs Malik , who has a masters degree in social policy and has lived in Britain all her life , plans to stay in Ireland with her daughter until the family can raise enough money to start a new life in Dubai , out of the reach of the UK social services .
They own four properties in Birmingham which they plan to rent out .
At her Irish hotel , Mrs Malik said she fled the UK because she feared losing her daughter .
She added : ' Once social services are on to you it 's a complete nightmare and no matter what you do you are deemed a bad parent .
If your child is full of beans or just sitting there quietly , it is your fault .
' Amaani was born premature so we 've always been protective of her and would do anything to keep her with us .
' Ideally we 'd like to get the matter resolved and return home , but we know that is n't going to happen . '
Social services became involved after a dispute between the family and a private nursery .
Nursery staff told social workers that Amaani had used a swear word , bit her nails , told them she was delivered by caesarean and that they had seen Mrs Malik cuddle her for up to ten minutes .
In January , Birmingham city council notified the family that Amaani was subject to a child protection plan for ' emotional abuse ' .
Further meetings were arranged , including a mental health assessment for Amaani a month later .
But fearing that her daughter would be taken away , Mrs Malik went into hiding at a friend 's house , and social workers contacted police .
After her husband Vijay Bansal , 42 , was arrested at their home , Mrs Malik came out of hiding , but before social workers could meet the family they drove to Wales and boarded a ferry as foot passengers to Ireland .
Mr Bansal , an IT consultant , has returned to Birmingham to deal with their properties , but makes regular trips to Ireland .
Mrs Malik said : ' It 's been really tough on Amaani as she has left all her family and friends .
We hope to leave for Dubai soon .
' We have been there on holiday and really enjoyed it .
There 's plenty of work out there for my husband and we have friends there too .
' The only problem is having to remortgage our properties so we can have a large deposit to satisfy the Dubai authorities we are able to settle there . '
She added : ' I told Amaani that she was cut from mummy 's tummy as I wanted her to be informed , but not in a graphic way .
' As for the hugging - no mother would not comfort their child if they were screaming . '
The family are being supported by Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming , who campaigns against abuses in the family courts .
He said : ' This whole case is madness .
There is no reason for the state to be involved in this little girl 's life in this way . '
A spokesman for West Midlands Police confirmed that Mrs Malik and her daughter were investigated in a suspected missing persons case .
Colin Tucker , Birmingham city council 's director for children 's social care , said : ' It can be a case of you 're damned if you do and damned if you do n't .
' People want to portray things as black and white but the reality in social care is that we are dealing with very complex situations . '
Critics have given Michael Schumacher a hard time all season so far over what can charitably be characterized as lackluster performance .
Leading figures at the Mercedes - Benz GP team , however , have magnanimously attributed the problems to their car .
But if his young teammate Nico Rosberg is currently second in the championship , having reached the podium twice so far this season ( doubling his record from four seasons at Williams ) , then how can you blame the car ?
The answer may be coming as soon as May 9 , when the circus heads to Barcelona for the Spanish Grand Prix .
According to reports , Mercedes will give Schumacher a new chassis design to try out at the Catalunya circuit .
If the new car suits Schumi better than the current one , they 'll presumably have him run it for the remainder of the season .
But given Rosberg 's performance in the current chassis , the smart money would be on Nico continuing with the existing machinery , meaning that the team could – in a Formula
One rarity – wind up running two different cars in a bid to defend the championships it won last year under the Brawn GP banner .
Reports have since verified that Mercedes GP is set to introduce a longer - wheelbase version of the current car , and not a full redesign .
By increasing the wheelbase , the team hopes to address certain weight distribution issues related to the latest tires provided by Bridgestone .
At the same time , the new set - up aims to rectify the understeer that 's been hindering Schumacher , while a new aerodynamics package will also be introduced on the revised car .
Thanks for the tip , Patrick !

Noted Italian exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth , commented this week that the recent defamatory reporting on Pope Benedict XVI , especially by the New York Times , was “ prompted by the devil . ”
Speaking to News Mediaset in Italy , the 85 - year - old exorcist noted that the devil is behind “ the recent attacks on Pope Benedict XVI regarding some pedophilia cases . ”
“ There is no doubt about it .
Because he is a marvelous Pope and worthy successor to John Paul II , it is clear that the devil wants to ‘ grab hold ’ of him . ”
Father Amorth added that in instances of sexual abuse committed by some members of the clergy , the devil “ uses ” priests in order to cast blame upon the entire Church : “ The devil wants the death of the Church because she is the mother of all the saints . ”
“ He combats the Church through the men of the Church , but he can do nothing to the Church . ”
The exorcist went on to note that Satan tempts holy men , “ and so we should not be surprised if priests too … fall into temptation .
They also live in the world and can fall like men of the world . ”

Editor 's note : CNN will have complete coverage of the 2010 South by Southwest Interactive Conference at www.cnn.com/TECH and @cnntech on Twitter .
AUSTIN , Texas ( CNN ) --
It 's billed as a showcase for the brightest minds in technology -- a place to network with industry leaders and see the latest Internet innovations .
South by Southwest Interactive -- a tech conference not to be confused with the related music and film festivals -- kicks off today in Austin , Texas .
But tech entrepreneur Dennis Crowley has another term for it .
" It 's spring break for nerds , " said Crowley , a co-founder of Foursquare , the mobile game and social - networking application that debuted at the event last year .
The South by Southwest ( SXSW ) festival was founded in 1987 to showcase a burgeoning music scene in Austin , Texas .
A week for interactive and film showcases was added in 1994 .
Last year , 11,000 people registered for the interactive festival alone -- with organizers expecting maybe 15,000 this year .
Are you at SXSWi ?
Share your photos , videos
Since its inception , South by Southwest Interactive ( SXSWi ) has been the launching pad for some of the online and technology world 's biggest new ideas .
Twitter , the micro- blogging site with more than 70 million users , debuted at SXSWi in 2007 .
Last March , Foursquare went live the day before the festival began .
Crowley said he expects the application to hit a half - million users before this year 's SXSW starts .
Blogging platforms that make the Web more social have launched in Austin , while video sites like YouTube have gained traction by exposure at the festival .
For developers , the concept is simple -- put your product in front of the plugged - in tech crowd that flocks to South by Southwest .
If they like it , they 'll spread it to everybody else .
" More and more , we see companies taking advantage of the key influencers and ' digirati ' that are here , " said Shawn O'Keefe , producer of South by Southwest Interactive .
" They realize that if they can make their product successful at South by Southwest , they can make it successful anywhere . "
But the spirit of the show remains focused on ideas , not products , O'Keefe said .
he says sets the five - day conference apart from events like the gadget - driven Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
" Not that we do n't have a lot of companies involved as sponsors , but we tend to focus on the community and people doing creative things , " he said .
" It 's about making things and doing new things with technology to make the world a better place . "
Among the anticipated highlights of this year 's conference are keynote speeches by Twitter CEO Evan Williams and Daniel Ek , CEO of free music service Spotify , and a wide range of panels with such intriguing titles as , " How I Lost My Job Through Twitter , Again " and " Duh !
It 's , Like , Tech for Girls . "
And the exchange of ideas does n't just happen during the official events .
" It 's a completely different atmosphere , " said Foursquare 's Crowley , comparing SXSWi to other tech events .
" There are a lot of parties .
It 's almost more valuable to go to the events outside the convention center than the ones in the convention center . "
Not that the event has n't gained its detractors .
Some in the tech community say that the power of South by Southwest was its outsider credibility , and that it 's gotten too big and mainstream to be a true force for innovation .
Paul Carr , of the technology blog TechCrunch , wrote this week that the festival has become too much of a march from industry party to industry party -- with a little Internet celebrity gawking thrown in -- to be of value .
" The idea that SXSWi is a conference -- or even a festival -- for people doing interesting and useful things in technology is a fallacy , " Carr wrote .
O'Keefe counters that the event continues to evolve .
He said that while the festival received more proposals for panels than ever before , organizers were more selective about which were approved .
And he said this year 's layout will put events involving similar topics close to each other , in effect creating a series of mini-conferences that will let like - minded people move in smaller , more intimate circles .
" It 's about creating these micro-events within the larger event , " O'Keefe said .
" You can still very much experience that . "
Even Carr 's criticisms seemed to come with a dose of mixed feelings .
After all , as he writes after urging readers not to go to the festival , he 'll be moderating a panel on Saturday .
" See you in Austin , " he wrote .
EVGA today showed off their GTX 480 Super Clocked graphics cards running on their Classified 4 way motherboard running in Quad SLI .
Many of you may not know this , but Nvidia officially supports 4 way or quad SLI with the GTX 480 and 470s .
Tom Petersen , Director of Technical Marketing at Nvidia stated that Nvidia will officially support 4 - Way SLI designs coming from EVGA and ASUS .
While we currently do n’t have benchmark figures for the GTX 480 in Quad SLI , we hope that either EVGA , some overclockers , or we ourselves will get an opportunity in the near future to see how four GTX 480 ’s scale in addition to their overall performance .
Hopefully these cards are capable of running for extended periods of time with appropriate air flow considering the fact that from our own GTX 480 SLI review we noticed that these cards did get quite hot .
Here are some pictures of the EVGA setup running four GTX 480 Super Clocked cards with an EVGA 4 - Way SLI Classified motherboard .

The Right Honourable Stephen Timms is the UK's " Minister for Digital Britain . "
He 's the guy behind the Digital Economy Bill , which makes the US DMCA look good by comparison .
Seriously , this is some terrible , terrible lawmaking .
Here 's what appears to be a letter the DigiMini sent to another MP , explaining why the Digital Economy Bill needs to go forward .
It reads , in part , " Copyright owners are currently able to go on - line ( sic ) , look for material to which they hold the copyright and identify unauthorised sources for that material .
They can then seek to download a copy of that material and in so doing capture information about the source including the Intellectual Property ( IP ) address … "
If this letter is genuine ( and it seems to be ) , it means that the guy who 's in charge of Britain 's digital future thinks that the " IP " in " IP address " stands for " Intellectual Property . "
The Rt Hon Stephen Timms MP does n't know what an IP address is

I never had a Pop - Tart until college .
I realize that for some people this may cause a shocked reaction on par with my husband ’s the time I told him I ’ve never watched Goonies before ( or Jacob ’s , upon discovering the internet ) .
Obviously I grew up under a rock , right ?
Thus , given my proximity to concrete - like materials you ’d think I have been better prepared for the texture of the one I purchased from the vending machine in the basement of my freshman dorm ( not at 4 a .m. or anything , either , nope , not this angel ! ) .
But I was not .
It was like particle board , but even particle board has a fresher aroma .
It took two hands to break off a piece .
I choked down my first bite , then chugged some water , convinced bits were stuck in my throat .
Do n’t you hate that ?
I understand that if I had toasted it , my experience might have been better .
And maybe the brown sugar cinnamon variety is n’t exactly the most vibrant .
Also , it is entirely possible that a dusty dormitory basement does n’t have , say , the packaged pastry turnover a large grocery store chain .
But even at its most ideal , it could never be anything but a compromise for me : a dry , flavorless , glycerin , high fructose corn syrup , “ artificial strawberry flavor ” - ed version of what could be homemade and flawless .
I ca n’t believe I waited so long to make these .
Neither can my still - not - over - the - Goonies - thing husband , who responded to my “ what should I make next ?
I ’ve got a muffin , salad , cake and pop tarts on my list ” query this weekend with a “ you know how to make Pop Tarts and you have n’t yet ? ”
( Do n’t you love hearing things from his perspective ?
He ’s had similar reactions to fried chicken and peanut butter crispy bars . )
Most recipes I have come across use a pie dough for the pastry but I was really stuck on getting a crust that was a little more sturdy — one with an egg .
Often I see fillings of just jam , yet a little thickener added to the jam goes a long way towards keeping it from being too wet and soggy inside .
Finally , a lot of versions I came across while I was digging around offer some sort of apology that the glaze ( should you make one ) is n’t as hard as the packaged ones , that a homemade version really wont hold up well in an upright toaster or that the brown sugar filling does n’t have the odd stiffness of the ones you can buy at the bodega ; this version does not .
Sure , it may lack the sturdiness and shell - like slick of a packaged Pop Tart , but it has the buttery , flaky , no - toaster - required - to - soften - it transcendence the grocery store aisle version can only dream about , and hooray for that .

Homemade Pop Tarts
Adapted from King Arthur Flour
Pastry
2 cups ( 8 1/2 ounces ) all - purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup ( 2 sticks or 8 ounces ) unsalted butter , cut into pats
1 large egg
2 tablespoons ( 1 ounce ) milk
1 additional large egg ( to brush on pastry )
Cinnamon Filling ( enough for 9 tarts )
1/2 cup ( 3 3/4 ounces ) brown sugar
1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon , to taste
4 teaspoons all - purpose flour
1 large egg , to brush on pastry before filling
Jam Filling
3/4 cup ( 8 ounces ) jam
1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon cold water
Alternate fillings : 9 tablespoons chocolate chips , 9 tablespoons Nutella or other chocolate - hazelnut paste or 9 tablespoons of a delight of your choice , such as salted caramel or a nut paste
To make cinnamon filling :
Whisk together the sugar , cinnamon , and flour .
To make jam filling : Mix the jam with the cornstarch / water in a small saucepan .
Bring the mixture to a boil , and simmer , stirring , for 2 minutes .
Remove from the heat , and set aside to cool .
Use to fill the pastry tarts .
Make the dough :
Whisk together the flour , sugar , and salt .
Work in the butter with your fingers , pastry blender or food processor until pea-sized lumps of butter are still visible , and the mixture holds together when you squeeze it .
If you ’ve used a food processor , transfer the mixture to a large bowl .
Whisk the first egg and milk together and stir them into the dough , mixing just until everything is cohesive , kneading briefly on a well - floured counter if necessary .
Divide the dough in half ( approximately 8 1/4 ounces each ) , shape each half into a smooth rectangle , about 3×5 inches .
You can roll this out immediately ( see Warm Kitchen note below ) or wrap each half in plastic and refrigerate for up to 2 days .
Assemble the tarts :
If the dough has been chilled , remove it from the refrigerator and allow it to soften and become workable , about 15 to 30 minutes .
Place one piece on a lightly floured work surface , and roll it into a rectangle about 1/8 ″ thick , large enough that you can trim it to an even 9 ″ x 12 ″ .
[ You can use a 9 ″ x 13 ″ pan , laid on top , as guidance . ]
Repeat with the second piece of dough .
Set trimmings aside .
Cut each piece of dough into thirds – you ’ll form nine 3 ″ x 4 ″ rectangles .
Beat the additional egg and brush it over the entire surface of the first dough .
This will be the “ inside ” of the tart ; the egg is to help glue the lid on .
Place a heaping tablespoon of filling into the center of each rectangle , keeping a bare 1/2 - inch perimeter around it .
Place a second rectangle of dough atop the first , using your fingertips to press firmly around the pocket of filling , sealing the dough well on all sides .
Press the tines of a fork all around the edge of the rectangle .
Repeat with remaining tarts .
Gently place the tarts on a lightly greased or parchment - lined baking sheet .
Prick the top of each tart multiple times with a fork ; you want to make sure steam can escape , or the tarts will become billowy pillows rather than flat toaster pastries .
Refrigerate the tarts ( they do n’t need to be covered ) for 30 minutes , while you preheat your oven to 350 °F .
Charming tip from King Arthur : Sprinkle the dough trimmings with cinnamon - sugar ; these have nothing to do with your toaster pastries , but it ’s a shame to discard them , and they make a wonderful snack .
While the tarts are chilling , bake these trimmings for 13 to 15 minutes , till they ’re golden brown .
Bake the tarts :
Remove the tarts from the fridge , and bake them for 20 to 25 minutes , until they ’re a light golden brown .
Cool in pan on rack .
Whole Wheat Variation : I was itching to swap out 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour .
I am sure it would make it more deliciously breakfast .
Pop Tart Minis :
The biggest struggle I had with these was the size .
I actually like my baked goods on the tiny size , thus I think this could make an adorable batch of 16 2 1/4 ″ x 3 ″ rectangles .
Savory Pop Tarts :
Nix the sugar in the dough and halve the salt .
Fill with pesto , cheese , ground nuts or olives , or any combination thereof .
Brush the tops with additional egg wash and sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds .
Please invite me over .
Do ahead :
The sweet versions should keep at room temperature in an airtight container for a week .
If you ’d like to make them further in advance , I vote for freezing them unbaked between layers of waxed paper , and baking them as you need .
Warm kitchen warning : Guys , I live in an inferno , the kind of steam - heated , 85 degrees inside ( 68 gorgeous degrees outside ) existence many other New Yorkers are familiar with .
Between the heat and yesterday ’s rainy humidity , me and this dough were struggling .
To keep it from being too warm and soft , I was stuffing the trays of dough in the freezer for 10 minute shifts almost every time I worked with them .
If you find yourself in an overly warm kitchen working with dough that gets soft too quickly , just keep using your freezer .
The 10 minutes here and there that you extend this project will save you many gray hairs as the dough becomes easy to work with again .

The two - week old assault on Marjah , Afghanistan , is laying the basis for the next one , Kandahar .
Marjah was the largest offensive by U.S. troops in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion .
Both Marjah and Kandahar are said to be Taliban strongholds .
U.S. , NATO and Afghan troops are supposed to clear out Taliban fighters and set up local governments to run schools and clinics and provide for other basic needs .
The military is dependent on local populations to provide intelligence and to go along with the Kabul and Washington - run program .
However , the Karzai government is widely seen as corrupt , and the local populations are angered at civilian deaths and dragnet arrests of Afghan men by U.S. and other foreign troops .
Even if schools and clinics open in Marjah , the situation there is still dangerous and , according to New York Times Kabul bureau chief Alissa Rubin , it ’s unrealistic to expect a parent to send a child to school under those conditions .
In a recent question and answer session with readers , Rubin also questioned the effectiveness of the military - then - development strategy .
“ The idea behind reintegrating the Taliban into civilian life is to offer them jobs .
I am not yet sure what kinds of jobs those will be .
Most people in the area are farmers , and at the moment many are fearful that their only crop , opium poppy , will be destroyed .
According to local farmers , about 60 percent of the cultivation in Marja District is opium . ”
And Rubin questioned the legitimacy of what ’s being referred to as the “ government in a box ” – a widely used term to describe the U.S. efforts to quickly set up local governments .
“ Since in order for a government to be credible it has to be chosen by the people , it remains to be seen exactly how it will work and whether power will be shifted to district elders who have deeper roots there than people from outside the area , ” she said .
In a report about U.S. , Afghan and NATO forces moving on to Kandahar , Al Jazeera showed a meeting between tribal leaders and NATO ( Canadian ) and Afghan forces where worries about drone attacks and arrests dominated .
One Kandahar tribal elder , Jan Muhammed , is shown saying , “ We do n’t want your schools and clinics .
We want international forces to stop drone attacks and arrests . ”
Two possible paths have emerged to potentially hasten an end to the conflict .
One , regional powers China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan , along with India , Iran , Pakistan and Mongolia , under the umbrella of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( seen by many as an emerging counterweight to NATO ) are taking a bigger role in efforts to bring the Afghanistan conflict to an end .
Second , there are antiwar forces in NATO countries , including the U.S. Many governments are facing strong public opposition to their military role in Afghanistan .
The Dutch government recently collapsed over the issue , and withdrawal plans are in the making .
Canada plans to withdraw its troops .
The present German government is facing growing unpopularity over the Afghan war , along with the economic crisis .
And in the U.S. , which just marked the death of its 1,000th soldier in the Afghan conflict , cities , counties and states are facing unprecedented budget crises .
Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago recently lashed out at the Afghan war and occupation .
“ Just think of all the money that we spend on wars to save the world , ” he said .
“ Today we ca n’t save America .
Why do we always have to go to war , continually , why ca n’t we rebuild America ? ”
The U.S. government has now spent $ 961 billion on the Iraq and Afghanistan military occupations , including $ 253 billion on Afghanistan .

Many critics of the surge say it could alienate the Afghan people .

" They had two proms and I was only invited to one of them , " McMillen says .
" The one that I went to had seven people there , and everyone went to the other one I was n’t invited to . "
Last week McMillen asked one of the students organizing the prom for details about the event , and was directed to the country club .
" It hurts my feelings , " McMillen says .
Two students with learning difficulties were among the seven people at the country club event , McMillen recalls .
" They had the time of their lives , " McMillen says .
" That 's the one good thing that come out of this , [ these kids ] did n't have to worry about people making fun of them [ at their prom ] . "
A team reporting in PLoS Biology has published the genome of the pea aphid .
The hope is the genome will unlock the aphid's " epigenetics " : it can form different types - sexual and asexual , winged and wingless - based on environmental factors like temperature or day length , without altering its genes .
MOST eras have their symbolic murders : crimes that are not only terrible but seem also to reflect the nation 's pathologies .
Victorian London had Jack the Ripper ; modern Britain has the death of James Bulger , a two - year - old who in 1993 was abducted from a Merseyside shopping centre , tortured and killed by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson , both aged just ten .
Their trial inspired national fury , revived in 2001 when they were released under new names .
Mr Venables has now been returned to custody for an unspecified breach of his licence .
Unspecified by the government , that is ; channelling the ire the crime still arouses , newspapers have gleefully relayed rumours of his offence .
It is not surprising that this incident retains its power to appal : the grainy CCTV image that captured the small boy being led away by a bigger one has become an icon of depravity .
The trouble is , the case held up a mirror less to the real state of Britain than to its dark , psychic fears .
The confusion of those things has led to mistaken conclusions being drawn from it .
They may be again .
Parents naturally fear harm coming to their children .
But the recent increase in that sentiment is odd , because the murder of children , always rare , has become more so .
Murder by children — it was the age of Mr Venables and his accomplice that shocked most — is even rarer .
And while the shock they caused was understandable , it was also irrational .
Children are generally thought to be less capable of moral reasoning than adults ; they are permitted to be ruder , noisier , even , in a limited way , more violent ; they are seen as less responsible for their actions .
Except , it turned out , when they kill : “ unparalleled evil ” , said the judge in 1993 , echoing a view that the boys represented evil incarnate .
Thus the murder chimed with fears about children 's safety , and at the same time violated a confused but cherished notion of infant innocence : a pyrotechnic combination .
In truth it was too exceptional to be used in diagnoses of British society 's ills .
Nevertheless , it was , not least by Tony Blair , then the shadow home secretary , who called it a “ hammer blow against the sleeping conscience of the nation ” .
Some criminologists and police officers partly trace the toughening of sentencing policy in the years since , especially for young offenders — and thus the huge rise in the prison population — to the outrage the crime provoked .
The immediate political row this week concerned how much the government should say about Mr Venables 's circumstances .
Jack Straw , the justice secretary , claimed to be balancing the public 's “ right to know ” with the risk of prejudicing future criminal proceedings .
He was also , of course , juggling his official duties and his instincts as a politician .
He wavered , but in the end sensibly opted to say very little .
But Mr Venables has already been enlisted in a more important debate , about the rehabilitation of criminals : if it works and whether it is worth paying for .
Hard cases , bad vibes
Sober reflection suggests that — living as he does under an assumed identity , with the fear of discovery as well , presumably , as crushing guilt —
Mr Venables 's situation , like his crime , is too freakishly unusual to help in reaching broader judgments .
Yet some have seen him as proof that some young criminals are beyond rehabilitation ; that they are over - indulged when in custody and released from it too soon .
The tabloid throw - away - the - key cause has been boosted .
Whatever the facts in the case of Mr Venables , that is worrying .
Rehabilitation may be only one function of imprisonment , but it is an important one , for society and the taxpayer as well as the recipient — and the evidence suggests there is too little of it rather than too much .
For example , Britain locks up more children in secure detention than any other western European country ( though the total has recently fallen a bit ) , in part , say some , because of the Bulger furore .
Yet the resources devoted to them are much scantier than those offered in psychiatric hospitals .
Much the same applies to young adults .
Sparing them the “ corrosive atmosphere ” of adult jail was one reason given for releasing Mr Venables and Mr Thompson in 2001 .
The atmosphere does n't seem to have improved all that much since then .
The last annual report from the chief inspector of prisons concluded that “ the high rate of re-offending among young adult men is unlikely to reduce without significant changes in approach , funding and focus . ”
Ditto criminals who serve short - term sentences : “ Only a small proportion of prison budgets is spent on activity intended to reduce reoffending ” by such prisoners , said the National Audit Office this week , “ despite the fact that 60 % … are reconvicted within a year of release . ”
And this costly imbalance — between the alacrity with which politicians imprison people , and the resources available to rehabilitate them — looks set to worsen .
The Conservatives , still likely to form the next government , envisage an increase in the prison population under still - tougher sentencing rules ; they hope the figures will later come down , though history suggests that it is unlikely .
They also talk about a “ rehabilitation revolution ” .
But whether they will find the money for that , while simultaneously building new prisons , already seems doubtful .
The timing does n't help .
Mr Blair 's original response to the Bulger murder helped to establish his reputation ; Mr Venables has returned into public consciousness just as New Labour seems set to lose office , an eerie bookend to its political supremacy .
In some of this week 's coverage , the life of this one individual has seemed to serve as a parable for the progress of the country over the last two decades , or the lack of it .
The story has captured and conveyed a widespread sense that the things that were supposed to get better have n't , and perhaps , more damagingly , that they could n't : that there is no escape from the past .

The National Transportation Safety Board cited Mr. Smiley ’s case and four other accidents in a recent letter urging the F.A.A. to tighten its procedures for reporting lost aircraft and quickly getting radar data to the Air Force .
The board said miscommunication , a lack of trained personnel and other problems were hindering rescue efforts .
“ The whole process needs to get nailed down a lot tighter than it is , ” said Scott Dunham , a radar expert for the safety board who drafted the letter .
The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center in Florida , the agency chiefly responsible for getting inland searches started , said it helped search for 227 missing planes and helicopters in 2008 , the latest figures available .
The center could not say how many fatalities or injuries were associated with those searches .
In Mr. Smiley ’s case , there was a mix - up in terminology : An F.A.A. air traffic manager reported to the Air Force that he had a signal from an emergency beacon ; the Air Force uses the term emergency transponder .
The Air Force , believing the call was related to a different emergency signal south of Atlanta , did not begin a search .
The safety board , in its letter , placed most of the responsibility for the mix - up on the Air Force .
But the board also said the F.A.A. manager should have realized that a search had not gotten under way when the Air Force controller did not reply that a case had been opened .
After the manager made his report to the Air Force , F.A.A. controllers continued to discuss the signal , but they did not take further action because they believed it had been reported properly , the letter said .

AS POLICY wonks across the developed world fret about aging populations and overtaxed social welfare systems , America ’s future has already arrived in Japan , where the labor force has started to shrink .
The percentage of Japan ’s residents over age 65 is closing in on 25 percent — a level that makes Florida seem youthful by comparison .
But so far the country has n’t declared bankruptcy or erupted in cataclysmic generational warfare .
Instead , its fate is partly in the hands of people like Kenji Ueda , a 72 - year - old entrepreneur who founded a temporary employment service for older workers in Tokyo .
Most of Japan ’s elderly are healthy .
So Ueda is giving them a chance to put their time to productive use — and trying , as he told me through an interpreter , to “ strengthen the ‘ elderly ’ brand . ’’
Such upbeat talk is oddly reassuring for the United States , now that yawning Medicare obligations are beginning to spook creditors and Social Security is paying out more than it ’s taking in .
For if Japan offers any guide , the graying of the population does n’t just produce grim , abstract debates about how to divide up resources .
It also raises a more interesting question :
In a country where the elderly far outnumber children , and where retirement can last for decades , what does it take to live happily ?
Ueda , who started his company after many years at Tokyo Gas , certainly means to make a profit for himself and his shareholders .
But he also has higher goals : not just to give older workers an outlet for their energies , but even to alleviate the marital strains that develop when long - employed workers are suddenly home with their spouses .
That last part sounds like a joke , but it is n’t , really .
Multiplied across millions of households , the search for harmony and happiness becomes an issue of national importance .
In a series of interviews with policy experts , business people , service providers , and civic activists , the priority that kept coming up was ikigai , which translates as “ life worth living . ’’
“ We have to develop a Japanese society , ’’ said Akira Morita , director of a think tank at Tokyo University , “ where the elderly can live with ikigai . ’’
Attaining it is partly a matter of self - esteem : A senior citizens ’ co-op named Koureikyo , for instance , is working to persuade Japan ’s elderly that they are more than mere recipients of services .
A potentially thornier issue is what role elderly Japanese will play in the economic system .
Many employers have a mandatory retirement age of 60 or 65 .
And while marketers have been calibrating their sales pitches to retirees for some time , there is n’t a clear path for those who want to stay in the workforce .
Protections against age discrimination are weaker in Japan than under US law , and employers may underestimate their capacity to contribute .
Ueda ’s temp agency offers one option , at least for his roster of 370 workers , and he hopes others copy his business model .
On a broader scale , major employers are increasingly bringing back their retirees , often at reduced hours and lower pay .
This is n’t a minor step : Especially in the hierarchical world of big Japanese corporations , it ’s an adjustment for all when retired managers take direction from their former underlings , so some companies that “ re- recruit ’’ retirees make a habit of assigning them to divisions they have never worked in .
These patterns suggest a level of hard - headed realism .
A 70 - year - old is bound to have different needs and motivations than a 30 - or 50 - year - old .
“ We have to accept the fact that physical strength will decline , ’’ said Morita , the think tank director .
“ Based on the fact of declining capacity , we have to enable these people to remain active . ’’
Obviously , the public discussion of aging in Japan is n’t just about quality of life .
Japan also faces the kind of policy choices that keep US deficit hawks up at night .
The government is debating whether to raise a sales tax to pay for pensions .
Japan ’s stiff public debt , which ballooned amid the malaise of the 1990s , gives it less room to maneuver .
But that ’s not the point .
Japan ’s experience shows that , while the aging of society looks mainly like a problem for the social - welfare system when it appears on the horizon , it reveals other dimensions when it arrives .
Objectively , it matters to society whether seniors feel useless and bored or needed and pleasantly occupied .
People who say they have ikigai in their lives , studies show , have lower mortality rates than those who do n’t .
Not all senior citizens need nursing care , and not all can take , or want to take , the equivalent of a permanent vacation in West Palm Beach .
Over time , aging societies will have to recognize their older residents as an economic force and as a pool of talent — or as Ueda , the entrepreneur , sees it , as “ a mountain of treasures . ’’

I have signed in my personal capacity a letter organised by Richard Reeve of Demos in today 's Guardian .
It says a great opportunity for reform is opened up by support for the Liberal Democrats and calls on Labour and Tory supporters of democracy and liberty to switch to them .
This is an extraordinary political moment .
An election seemingly destined to produce a narrow Conservative victory has been seized by the voters and turned into a democratic contest – a contest not just between parties , but over the shape of our democracy itself .
What offers the best chance of democratic reform ?
The question is where the energy for the future of progressive politics is to be found .
It is a contemporary political fact that the stronger the performance of the Liberal Democrats on 6 May the better the chances of progressive reform ....
Long - standing party loyalties , even in a less tribal world , are not easily suspended .
But May 2010 offers a once - in - a- generation opportunity to reshape politics for the better .
It must be seized .
When I signed I said I 'd blog to add that by Liberal Democrats I mean them or other smaller parties or independents where they have a chance of winning , such as Caroline Lucas in Brighton Pavilion and the SNP in Scotland and Plaid in Wales .
" I am for pluralism led by the Lib Dems not the Lib Dems monopolising pluralism ! "
This is the Hang 'em strategy now signalled by George Monbiot in his excellent call for post-election unity of those who want change in Britain needs a Ginger Revolution and Rory Cellan - Jones at the BBC .
It is not the same as the strategy in the letter , which is closer to David Marquand 's , but the main thrust is .
The critical point is this : we must stop either the two main parties from getting their monopolistic hands on the hyper - centralised UK state .
Do you think feminism ’s job is done ?
Kat Banyard ’s book will remove your rose - tinted glasses , says Jess McCabe
The Equality Illusion , subtitled The Truth About Women & Men Today , aims to blow away the myth that feminism ’s work is over , and gender equality has been achieved .
As editor of a feminist website , I am perhaps not the ideal reviewer ; I do n’t need convincing .
Nevertheless , in as much as I can judge , Kat Banyard makes good headway in shredding the misconception that we ’re in a post - feminist utopia , backed up with references , studies and many interviews .
Her book is loosely structured to show how sexist oppression affects women from the moment the alarm goes off in the morning ( beginning with body image issues ) through to the end of the day with a chapter on ‘ Bedroom Politics ’ , covering some of the ground of reproductive justice , such as abortion access and sex education .
The book closes with a chapter on ‘ Tomorrow ’ , outlining examples of what activists are doing to address the problems she highlights in the book , with guidance on how to get involved and Kat ’s own policy ideas .
Banyard combines often heartbreaking interviews with girls and women with a battery of statistics and studies to demonstrate the issues that these individuals face are common and take place in a broader political context .
This is by no means an easy book to read ; one chapter piles on top of another creating a cumulative impression of just how bad the situation is .
As I made my way through the book , the interviews and descriptions of various forms of violence against women became unrelenting .
( This was exacerbated because , stylistically , The Equality Illusion sometimes reads more like a policy report than a book for a general readership . )
In contrast with a number of recent feminist books , Banyard includes many interviews with black and minority ethnic women and girls .
This certainly is a welcome improvement , particularly in Banyard ’s chapter on body image and beauty standards , as this is an issue all - too - often considered primarily in terms of how it affects white women ( although at times she could have gone deeper into an intersectional analysis of this information ) .
Banyard uses statistics and studies , brought home through interviews with women and girls at the sharp end of inequality and violence against women
For my money , her chapter on education is the most successful .
Banyard puts in context the received wisdom that boys are disadvantaged in the education system , in light of widespread evidence of sexual harassment and assault of girls at school .
Fifteen - year - old Jena , we learn , is being sexually bullied by a boy named Alec .
She tells Banyard Alec has been “ grabbing her breasts in the school corridors .
Sitting opposite me in class and making obscene gestures and threatening comments ( ‘ I ’m going to fuck you ’ ; ‘ Are you going to sit on my cock ’ ) .
Jumping on me in the playground and rubbing against me . ”
The deputy head of the school told her “ boys will be boys ” ; advice apparently dished out to many girls when they complain about offensive behaviour directed at them by boys within the school .
The interviews with Jena and a number of other girls in similar situation are backed up with a raft of discomforting statistics .
To take just one example , according to the World Health Organization school is the most common setting for sexual harassment and coercion of girls .
The chapter proceeds to look at examples of how sexism operates in the classroom and beyond , from how gender roles are introduced when children are just babies , reinforced in primary school and then maintained throughout their school career .
Banyard explores how a combination of gender stereotypes , policing of femininity and homophobia affects girls ’ participation in sport from an early age .
Other chapters cast a similarly uncompromising and wide - ranging eye on the ‘ sticky floor ’ and ‘ glass ceiling ’ faced by women in the workplace , the horrific impact of rape and intimate partner violence on women , and the sex industry .
Banyard ’s formula : statistics and studies illustrating the problem , brought home through interviews with women and girls at the sharp end of inequality and violence against women , works well here .
These latter chapters in particular are a very difficult read – perhaps this is only right , given the subject matter .
The final chapter ‘ Tomorrow ’ seeks to lift us up from this state of depression , sketching out Banyard ’s ideas of how best to solve the problems she has outlined .
Banyard says : “ For this chapter I have interviewed a small selection of people currently taking action against gender inequality , particularly those involved in grassroots activism , campaigning organisations and , vitally , men who are active in feminism today .
What these individuals and groups demonstrate is that , by using or creating opportunities in our daily lives to challenge the equality illusion and further the ideal of a world without sexism , change is possible , and everyone has a crucial role to play . ”
Unfortunately , it is also the weakest chapter .
Banyard skirts all too swiftly over a few examples of grassroots activism .
Although I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth as Kat mentioned The F - Word and quoted our founder Catherine Redfern , I ca n’t help but feel a bit dissatisfied with the scant few pages Banyard dedicated to grassroots feminism before moving on to cover at breakneck speed the voluntary women ’s sector , campaigns to close the gap in protection against domestic violence left by the government ’s ‘ no recourse to public funding ’ rules , professional - scale policy campaigns carried out by formal organisations such as the Fawcett Society , pro-feminist men ’s activism , political representation of women in Rwanda and then making the case for Sweden ’s prostitution law .
All good stuff , but she has tried to cram too much into too little space – which is probably why the otherwise thorough book reverts to a shorthand that certainly I could understand , but I ’m not convinced her target readership is in the same position .
Mentioning organisations like Eaves Housing for Women without an explanation of what they do or where in the world they do it , for example , or stating that someone ’s feminist politics fits within a “ social justice ” context , but without explaining what that means , is only going to confuse .
The book clearly needed an uplifting ending and positive message that change is possible .
It becomes apparent why many other feminist books end each chapter with a list of further reading , suggestions for activism , and ways to channel the deep emotions and anger inevitably stirred up through any serious look at oppression .
The Equality Illusion is a big step up from Ellie Levinson ’s much criticised attempt last year to introduce feminism to an as - yet - unconvinced audience .
Banyard manages to cover a wide spectrum of feminist issues .
She also does a good job of centring some issues that are still not talked about nearly enough in mainstream debate , such as sexual harassment of girls in their own schools , and how this is ignored and downplayed by teachers .
She is careful to back up everything with supporting data , so the book would work well tucked in a convenient place to be pulled out at times you need to reference a statistic or study .
Much like the Feminism 101 blog , it could be a useful shortcut for feminists ; ‘ do n’t ask me , read this ’ .
Today we ’re going to take you step - by - step ( and jump - by - jump ) through beginner parkour training .
We ’ll teach you everything you need to know ( yep , even that ) .
A ninja costume is optional , but having fun is mandatory !
( That ’s one of the cheesiest things I ’ve ever typed .
Sorry ! )
While parkour can seem very advanced , we actually use it as a tool in our Online Coaching Program when we program workouts .
Yes , you can start exercising with some basic parkour movements if being glued on a treadmill seems like death .
Learn how our coaches can help you train in a fun way !
Here ’s what we ’ll cover today :
After you ’re done with today ’s lesson , all you ’ll need is a killer soundtrack and somebody following you around with a camera to create your own epic parkour montage .
Just please do n’t be like Michael , Dwight , and Andy :
What Is Parkour ?
Parkour is natural , effective movement .
That ’s it .
Which is why we love it here at Nerd Fitness .
After all , we encourage the following :
Train naturally : Parkour is a stellar poster child for natural movement training .
We encourage bodyweight training here at NF , and that ’s what parkour is built around !
Train with conviction and intelligence : Parkour ’s emphasis on awareness of your environment and circumstances , as well as performance under pressure , requires as much of these qualities as you can muster , then challenges you to dig deep down and find even more .
Train for fun : the playful and spontaneous nature of parkour encourages creativity in a way that I can only liken to improvisational jazz and dancing .
In French , the term passement is used for overcoming any obstacle .
You pass or traverse a barrier in whatever way suits you and the moment ; there ’s no one prescribed method for anything .
Parkour is a lens of efficiency applied to every aspect of your movement through life .
At its broadest definition , it implies a low - impact and considerate attitude towards bosses , co-workers , family , friends , driving , consumer purchases , and the environment ( natural or manmade ) .
What is the least amount of effort and stuff you need in order to live the most meaningful and happy life you can make for yourself ?
As with the Nerd Fitness Rebellion , it is an exuberant and responsible celebration of life .
The Difference Between Parkour and Freerunning
You ’ll often hear the terms “ parkour ” and “ freerunning ” used interchangeably .
However , there are some differences worth highlighting .
Parkour is about efficient movement through your environment , using jumps , swings , and vaults .
is about efficient movement through your environment , using jumps , swings , and vaults .
Freerunning is much more about the theatrics , and you ’ll find more cool - looking acrobatic movements .
It ’s not that flips , tricks , aerial acrobatics , etc , are banned from parkour .
These movements can be used to traverse certain obstacles more rapidly or aggressively , but their use in parkour is ultimately dictated by need .
Will your zombie pursuers be deterred by a double front tuck flip as you clear a 14 ′ gap ?
Or do you just need to leap and roll the gap ?
Or again , maybe a quadrupedal crawl across that fallen log bridge might be best .
Success is a must , and looking cool comes from success .
People who have never done parkour ( or any other high - risk physical activity ) tend to see only the sensational end results on YouTube , and not the obsessive levels of meticulous and conservative training that underpin the visible final product .
Safety is huge , but ultimately a part of “ effective . ”
The speed and airborne moves you may have seen can be a part of parkour , but are far from necessary .
Am I too old or big for Parkour ?
Do I have to be in shape for Parkour ?
Anyone can figure out a way to traverse an obstacle .
Case in point , Emily , one of our coaching clients , started her fitness journey by training with parkour .
Emily recounts pitching the idea to her coach :
“ It felt silly at first .
I ’m still overweight .
How could I even think about running and jumping and all that ?
I braced for laughter and some gentle turn down , but Coach Matt being Coach Matt …he just got EXCITED ! ”
Coach Matt was thrilled Emily wanted to do some Parkour training ( since he practices it himself ) , so he started by programing the fundamentals ( more on this below ) .
That ’s all it took to begin Emily ’s Parkour obsession .
Today , Emily heads to her local park at night ( like a true ninja ) and practices her runs , climbs , and jumps :
So badass .
Parkour is just a mindset to find your own best way through each particular situation and moment .
From one week to the next , you could be looking at the same obstacle .
But by developing a traceur ’s eye ( a traceur is somebody who practices parkour , by the way ) , you ’ll begin to see different ways over or around it , depending on conditions .
Plus , as a beginner , you wo n’t begin by doing anything sketchy .
Emily shares , “ Nobody starts by jumping scary gaps between buildings .
Plenty of people in the PK community NEVER do anything even remotely dangerous . ”
Even if you do n’t level up to anything that ’ll go viral , parkour is still a practice worth undertaking .
How Parkour Can Help You Improve Your Life
Anything we do in life can be as easy or hard as we care to make it .
Parkour just makes us realize it upfront :
Taking five or ten seconds to set and prepare for a standing jump can be easy .
Carefully climbing over a four - foot wall can be easy .
But when preparation time is taken away , the pressure to perform makes the same task much harder .
Any traverse or passement rapidly becomes challenging when you have to do it at a dead sprint .
The hardest and most beautiful thing about parkour and other challenging activities is that they unequivocally call shenanigans on us when no one else will .
When you stand on top of a 6 - foot wall and look down at the concrete or grass below , you can say whatever you like :
“ It ’s easy ! ”
“ Man , that looks scary ! ”
But that knot in the pit of your stomach will tell you what you really feel .
Your mind will know whether you trained a hundred jumps and landings this past week , or whether you slacked off and played Xbox for three hours daily .
If you trained up on your shorter jumps and landings , the knot will be smaller or not there at all .
If you did n’t , the knot will be so large it ’ll threaten to choke you with fear .
Good parkour is fairly easy .
Impressive , fast , and aggressive parkour is hard .
If you want to perform YouTube or District B13 ( pictured below ) movie quality parkour , your typical time per passement goes from five seconds to half a second , which is a tenfold increase in difficulty .
Your methods , movements , and relative safety considerations must all adapt when your time changes .
Got it ?
Good !
Let ’s move onto some basic training on how to get started .
Beginner Training For Parkour ( Ninja 101 )
If you ’ve done any of our circuit workouts or bodyweight training , you ’ve already begun to prepare for parkour .
Do not take my advice here as a requirement set in stone .
Instead , learn your body , and you will be able to learn parkour .
Activities like yoga , lacrosse , boxing , swimming , and running ( and so on ) will keep your body in peak physical condition and ready for anything .
I like to think of it as becoming antifragile .
Let ’s start you with some moves to help you build up some strength .
The Parkour Workout for Beginners :
#1 ) Bodyweight Squats : 10 reps
# 2) Push -ups : 10 reps
#3) Leg lifts : 10 reps ( each leg )
# 4 ) Pull - ups : 10 reps
If you ca n’t do a pull - up , no problem .
Start with bodyweight rows :
Here ’s how to get your first pull - up if you ’re interested .
Do two sets of this list , every other day .
If some or all of this list is too hard , reduce your reps per set for the hard exercise (s ) until you can do two sets .
It ’s also OK to start with knee push - ups or assisted bodyweight squats – you can find easier versions of all these moves at The 42 Best Bodyweight Exercises .
The important thing is to do more next week than you can this week .
Here ’s how to progress :
Each week , add 1 - 2 reps to each exercise ( 2×12 , 2×14 , 2×15 , etc . )
After doubling the reps for each exercise ( 2×20 ) , add another full set to your workout ( 3×20 ; you may have to temporarily reduce reps on that final set back down to 10 or less ) .
When you can do 4×20 , perform each rep a little faster , more explosively , to get in a more plyometric and aerobic workout .
“ Plyometric ” are exercises where muscles exert maximum force , in short intervals of time .
Think “ explosive ” here , which is critical for parkour .
To make these moves more “ plyometric , ” you can swap regular push - ups for the explosive kind :
Your squats can become jump squats :
That will help you develop the power you need for overcoming obstacles .
Bodyweight exercises may seem really easy , but they provide a base level of strength for more advanced parkout maneuvers .

4 Moves for Beginner Parkour : Jumps , Landings , Vaults , and Muscle- ups
Now it ’s time to learn some parkour moves .
Let ’s start with our jumps .
First , practice your jump squat :
Then , you can work on a broad jump :
Then , we ’ll want you to train jumping upward , with box jumps :
After you become comfortable with basic jumps , it ’s time to leap over some obstacles .
We ’ll start with stairs .
Find some stairs or outdoor steps , and practice jumping with your whole body .
Jump from the ground up to one step , then two , then three , etc .
You should be relaxed , well - balanced with a relatively upright posture , and land softly on your toes 10 times in a row before you add another step to your jumps the next session or week :
1 - 2 steps are fairly easy
3 - 4 is a moderate challenge
5 - 6 is difficult
7 steps or more probably is n’t happening .
Here ’s a great video highlighting some beginner parkour stair exercises :
Stairs are n’t the only obstacle you ’re going to need to overcome with parkour .
Any beginner traceur will be comfortable doing four moves to navigate their environment :
Landing Two - Handed Vault The Muscle - Up A Precision Jump
Let ’s go over each of these beginner parkour moves now .
These videos are all courtesy of American Parkour .
Beginner Parkour Move # 1 : Landing Properly
Beginner Parkour Move # 2 : Two - Handed Vault
Beginner Parkour Move # 3 : The Muscle - Up
Beginner Parkour Move # 4 : Precision Jump
How to do More Difficult Parkour Moves
Here ’s a great video showcasing solid parkour skills without being too flashy :
Brilliant .
This is what parkour should look like .
No flips , no huge gap - clearing launches into empty space , just a lot of little things that add up to efficient zombie - fleeing movement … after all , you never know when that zombie apocalypse may strike 🙂
Before you jump into a sequence like this , make sure you ’re comfortable with the basics , like the muscle - up :
You should be able to do our 4 beginner moves ( Landing , Two - Handed Vault , Muscle - Up , and Precision Jump ) over and over again .
Hundreds of reps of full - body exercises will help strengthen all your minor stabilizers and oblique muscles that you do n’t think about .
All it takes is one weak muscle getting pulled to ruin your day .
For you to stay safe and minimize the damage and injury from stumbles and falls , you need to be as fit as you can afford to be ( in terms of time and willingness ) .
You will be the best judge of doing only what is within your ability .
If you want to flip and vault off monkey bars , be prepared to spend many hours at a gymnastics gym .
Want to Kong Vault over a picnic table or other object ?
Then be prepared for thousands of clapping push - ups .
This trains not only the strength but the reflexes to use those muscle motions in the 0.1 second when you trip on a wall or rail in mid-air and come tumbling down .
Reports of bone breaks , sprains , and concussions are not uncommon with parkour .
However , they are almost always because someone got a little overconfident and pushed beyond their current training and ability .
Respected traceurs may not be flashy , could they can also report not breaking any bones in their years of training .
I ’ll take that win every single day .
Before we bring up some advanced techniques , you should be able to regularly perform these exercises with ease :
Jump up at least 24 ” and grab an overhead rail or ledge for a casual pull - up .
Jump and tuck your knees to land gently on a bench or a picnic table .
Broad jump 4 - 6 ’ with good balance on landing .
A set of plyometric push - ups .
Did you get that down no problem ?
Awesome …now let ’s do some fun stuff .
Advanced Parkour Training Techniques
Shoulder rolls are your absolute top face - saver and pain - preventer .
Choosing to do them well is n’t important .
Falling and rolling when completely surprised and off - balance is what ’s important .
Tuck your head and hands in , relax your body , arc your arms and one shoulder forward in a hula hoop shape around your head , and roll your butt over your head .
To do the parkour roll :
Here ’s the rest of the APK parkour tutorial channel , with videos covering these foundation parkour movements ( listed in approximate order of increasing difficulty and greatest to least utility ) :
Advanced Parkour Move # 1 : Wall Run
Advanced Parkour Move # 2 : Cat Leap
Advanced Parkour Move # 3 : Cat Balance
Advanced Parkour Move # 4 : Monkey Vault
Advanced Parkour Move # 5 : Kong Vault
Advanced Parkour Move # 6 : Tic - Tac
Want some more ?
Work through Demon Drills ’ category of videos .
Try everything once slowly .
Skip anything that ’s too challenging , and come back to it in a week or so .
Parkour is a highly personal form of self - expression and choice , and it demands a fine sense of body awareness .
Your body can only be as strong as its weakest muscle when it comes to parkour , so make sure you are well balanced .
More Parkour Resources and Motivation
Ready to get started ?
Good , now watch a few more videos for motivation and inspiration :
After that , head outside , start practicing your movements and look for other traceurs in your area .
A simple google search for “ parkour ” or “ free - running ” plus your town name will generally turn up a group that practices in your area .
That should help you get started .

Newswise — Shells from mollusks presented to the dead during ancient funeral ceremonies are keys to helping a geologist gauge ocean movements near the Peruvian coast from as much as 13,000 years ago .
No , really .
These unlikely sources serve almost as historical calendars filled with data about the conditions of the portions of the ocean in which they lived – conditions which may well have been vital to the well being of ancient Peruvian cultures , including the Moche , according to Dr. Fred Andrus , an assistant professor in UA ’s geological sciences department .
Andrus and colleagues at the University of Arizona and the University of Maine , were awarded a $ 600,000 National Science Foundation grant to develop a better understanding of a deep ocean phenomenon known as upwelling and its impact on the climate and the economy of the people who lived in Peru over the past 13,000 years .
The work revolves around radiocarbon dating of the shells , but draws from anthropology , archaeology , chemistry , forensics and geology .
It ’s providing insight into climate history and a key contributor to that history , El Niño events , as well as , perhaps , significant developments in culture shifts that may have resulted from those long ago climate changes .
In 2002 , Andrus co-authored a paper publishing in Science describing a change in El Niño - related ocean temperatures 5,000 years ago .
The research suggested the climate shift may have contributed to increased economic complexities among cultures .
Suggesting the one led to the other was , and is , a contentious idea , Andrus says .
“ What does seem to be pretty well accepted is that you had a major change in El Niño about five - to - six thousand years ago , and then you had this huge fluorescence in civilization , ” Andrus says .
“ The question has long been , is that just a coincidence , or is it linked ?
My mind was drawn to see if changes in upwelling changed coastal production ( related to fishing ) because those things can be directly linked to El Niño . ”
Upwelling is the wind - driven act that brings deep water back to the ocean ’s surface .
As the ocean ’s deeper waters contain more nitrogen and phosphorous , more marine life lives in the upwelled water .
So , deep water upwelling off Peru ’s coast makes fishing more plentiful , except when it does n’t occur during El Niño events .
Upwelling is part of the El Niño cycle , but the interaction is complex .
El Niño , a temporary , cyclical climate change initiating in portions of the Pacific Ocean near the equator , is devastating to Peruvians and impacts the rest of the world , Andrus says .
“ El Niño is the largest source of inter-annual climate variability in the world , ” Andrus says .
“ Peru is the epicenter of this action .
And , upwelling is an absolute central component of it .
If upwelling changes , it means El Niño changes .
If El Niño changes , global climate changes . ”
While Peruvians bare both the brunt of El Niño ’s effects and the most immediate ones , no part of the globe is unaffected , says the UA College of Arts and Sciences researcher .
The El Niño cycle , which we ’re presently in , is partially responsible for the atypical winter weather the U.S. just experienced , Andrus says .
“ So , many people , including myself , have been interested to see how El Niño has changed over time .
While now it happens every two to seven years , more than five thousand years ago it happened much less frequently , and seven thousand years ago , much less frequently than that , and so on , at least back to the last ice age .
“ I want to figure out how upwelling has changed because that will tell me , on one hand , how the Pacific Ocean circulated back then and , two , how these civilizations may have been able to make a living . ”
And , as powerful as the Internet seems , there ’s no archived footage stored online of The Weather Channel ’s local Peruvian report from 50 centuries ago .
“ It ’s challenging to measure the movement of water 5,000 years ago . ”
And , that ’s where the mollusk shells come in .
“ If you can find a shell that you already know how old it is , you can measure the radiocarbon , and it will tell about past upwelling there . ”
And dating those shells ?
That ’s where the ancient funerals – and the mummified remains within Peruvian tombs – come in .
Archaeological sites , including tombs thousands of years old , are numerous along the coast of Peru .
While the Inca may be the only famous historical culture from this part of the world , there were , Andrus says , dozens of other cultures that pre-date the Incas , including cultures that were powerful empires with gold , standing armies and huge cities , perhaps containing hundreds of thousands of people .
And for many of these cultures , including the Moche , whose founders pre-date the first Incas by more than 1,000 years , the dry climate assists in the preservation of their artifacts … and even their bodies .
“ You have these really , really well - preserved burials ” Andrus says .
“ Often times , depending on the culture , the mummies are sitting upright in a tomb , and they will have arrayed around them offerings . ”
These offering sometimes include food , such as the sea creatures and their shells , and / or jewelry , weapons and tools .
In one set of burials , which draws the specific attention of one of Andrus ’ graduate students , Christie Jones , offerings of corn and cotton were placed , along with mussel shells , as offerings .
“ Archaeologists tell us that all these were presented at the same time . ”
Andrus and colleagues radiocarbon date the cotton , corn or other offerings to obtain an accurate estimate of the mummies ’ ages .
“ Then , we compare that to what the archaeologists think based on the stratigraphy ( the study of sediment layers in the tombs ) and artifacts .
When we are confident we know the age when someone was buried , then we measure the radiocarbon in the shell , and it tells us what the ocean upwelling was like then .
It ’s a very direct measure .
Ok , so that explains how scientists know how old the shells are , but how does knowing their age help in determining the conditions of the waters they once lived in ?
To understand that , you have to explore the basics of radiocarbon dating .
Radiocarbon forms in the atmosphere and rapidly mixes throughout it .
It takes , on average , about 400 years for this radiocarbon to mix into the ocean .
After diffusion at the ocean ’s surface , it may travel downward with sinking currents .
In the North Atlantic , the ocean ’s cold , salty waters sinks near to the ocean ’s floor , taking the radiocarbon with it , Andrus explains .
“ In the ocean , water that sinks must come back up to the surface . ”
This rising to the surface , or upwelling , occurs in zones , including one near Peru .
The longer the water has stayed beneath the ocean ’s surface , the more the radiocarbon within it decays .
“ Basically , you can date the carbon dissolved in water and learn how long that current has been down deep , ” Andrus said .
Shells contain growth bands – rings similar to those found in trees .
These rings provide hints as to what was happening during a certain portion of the shell ’s life like a calendar .
“ We would take multiple samples in a single shell , from birth to death , and it would tell us , at this particular moment in a shell ’s life , it has x amount of radiocarbon , and , in this part , it has y amount of radiocarbon , and it would vary through the life of the shell – up or down along with upwelling .
This is like a little key .
“ We know how old the mummies are due to archaeological contexts and other types of dating techniques .
We have a shell , and we know how old it is .
We measure the radiocarbon in the shell and the difference between its real age and its radiocarbon age is , at least in part , a function of upwelling .
“ We can go to these archaeological sites , collect shells and measure fairly directly how much upwelling was happening at the time the people lived there , and then infer how abundant fishes were , what the coastal ecosystem was like and , since these people were depending upon fishing , maybe how hard it was for them economically . ”
Andrus is awaiting final data from the research , but is intrigued by early indications .
“ We are detecting changes in upwelling through time .
Sometimes they are very sudden changes and happen very quickly .
“ I ’m trying to understand the foundation for the climate and economy of early civilizations of South America . ”
And the mummified remains of some of the members of those civilizations , and the shells from the animals they consumed , are both assisting with that understanding .
If there ’s one thing the newest generation of people that are getting interested in snowboarding does n’t know it ’s MSRP .
Yeah , yeah , say what you want about price gouging and all that fun stuff .
But the truth is , the newest generation have grown up with online mega warehouses severely discounting products .
Add to that rampant over production and the ability to shop online from your cell phone you have a recipe for ultimate destruction .
Fingers can be pointed at just about anyone when it comes to online shopping , death of local shops , over production , and all that is associated with what ’s wrong with the snowboard industry .
This is not what its about its about a company that was a huge part of the problem finally doing something right .
As of today Burton has pulled the plug with its agreement with Sierra Snowboards .
Sierra broke the contract and Burton finally realized they should use some of that almighty power and leverage to stop posturing and do something .
The short of it is that Sierra will no longer be able to carry any products under the Burton umbrella i.e.
Red , Anon , Forum , AK , etc. etc .
So begins the tail spin of what ’s going on .
Sierra has started its damage control spin by posting on their forum and others .
What we ’re left with here is Sierras side of the story and what ultimately looks like a smear campaign against Burton .
I will give credit where credit is due they owned up to breaching a contract .
But then proceed to make this out about the riders and “ community ” .
Sorry fellas but when you run a business it ’s about the bottom line and that translates to dollar amounts say what you will about customer service and care but do n’t even pretend that buying in bulk and discounting was n’t to line your pockets .
Their are responses from them pointing fingers at other shops ( The House , Backcountry.com ) the fact the CEO used to work for Louis Vitton and is now making the brand a “ luxury ” , and that Burton is selling direct and only doing this to line their pockets .
How much of that is true and how much of that is propagated hate though ?
I ’ll be shooting an email to Clark Gundlach over at Burton to get his side of the story as we ’ve been inundated with Sierra ’s side .
Now it ’s understandable the patrons of Sierra are upset .
Who would n’t be upset if their favorite store with huge discounts lost the largest snowboard company in the world ?
But how many of those patrons are only there because Sierra is notorious for giving products away to build up their “ community ” base and I use the world “ community ” loosely .
If you take away the cookie jar and there ’s a lot of hands in it , it ’s guaranteed they ’ll be highly vocal about it .
So why would Burton now suddenly do this ?
Lets look at the sad state of affairs the industry is in .
The big companies have horribly over produced for the better part of this last decade , big online warehouses have destroyed the pricing models , and we have consumers that feel MSRP is price gouging .
Burton is finally cracking the whip on their agreements and doing something that has the potential to help save the snowboard industry .
Control your over supply and prices .
When a companies board is supposed to sell for 500 bucks but it ’s constantly marked down to 300 bucks every season it lessens its perceived value .
When a big shop goes off price months before others then those shops now either eat it because they ’re living up to the contracts they signed or they match the price and make less money due to the fact they are n’t buying in bulk .
As it stands right now Burton has done something right for the industry .
It has the potential to right a lot of what ’s wrong if things are done correctly .
Sierra got busted and admitted to it but much like a child is now lashing out because they did n’t get their way .
We have their side of the story published and for all to see .
Where will this end and what do you think of this ?
Fans watching Doctor
Who tonight will see a message blasting the Conservatives , according to show insiders .
The Time Lord will land on a space station called Starship UK during an election and discovers that people ignore how terrible things used to be before casting their vote .
A livid Doctor says : " Once every five years everyone chooses to forget what they have learned .
That 's democracy . "
A source said : " This almost echoes what Labour has been saying about how people should not forget what they learned in the 80s .
They think the Tories will drag the country down again and it looks like the Doctor feels the same . "
The show 's new star , Matt Smith , has declined to reveal who he will be voting for but executive producer Steven Moffat said this month : " I hope the Tories do n't win . "
Christina Romer , chair of the president ’s Council of Economic Advisers , says the reason unemployment remains so painfully high is clear :
It ’s not the inadequacy or laziness of the workers or the long - standing mismatch between workers ’ skills and employers ’ needs .
It ’s the old - fashioned Keynesian diagnosis :
Too little demand in the economy .
“ The overwhelming weight of the evidence is that the current very high — and very disturbing — levels of overall and long - term unemployment are not a separate , structural problem , but largely a cyclical one .
It reflects the fact that we are still feeling the effects of the collapse of demand caused by the crisis .
Indeed , at one point I had tentatively titled my talk “ It ’s Aggregate Demand , Stupid ” ; but my chief of staff suggested that I find something a tad more dignified , ” Ms. Romer said in remarks prepared for a conference at Princeton University today .
It does n’t have to be this way , she argued , essentially making the case for more government stimulus to help the economy .
“ We have the tools and the knowledge to counteract a shortfall in aggregate demand .
We should be continuing to use them aggressively . ”
Her comments contrasted with a recent flurry of optimism among some forecasters that the recovery may turn out to be stronger than the lackluster one many anticipated .
“ We we are growing again , but not booming , ” she said .
GDP is rising at a solid pace , but not as quickly as after other severe recessions and not as quickly as it needs to .
As a result , the unemployment rate remains painfully high and is not predicted to reach normal levels for an extended period . ”
The jobless rate , at last report , was 9.7 %
Do you hate rich people ?
Come on , be honest .
Rich people are greedy and shallow .
They get rich by taking advantage of others .
They are miserly and selfish .
Money is their god .
They do n't really care about the poor or less fortunate .
Deep down they are not really happy anyway .
Our beliefs about money drive all of our financial behaviors .
The problem is that we are often unaware of our money beliefs , as we acquire them early in life .
Typically , beliefs about money are developed during as we try to make sense of money 's role in the world , and where we stack - up compared to those around us .
One of the most self - destructive conclusions about money is that it is somehow bad or evil .
On a rational level , this is of course ridiculous .
Money is just a tool , no more , no less .
It is how it is used or not used that determines its virtue .
But when our emotional brain clings to the association that money is bad , we are financially doomed .
If you carry the core belief that money is bad and rich people are evil , chances are you came by it honestly .
At some point in your life you learned either through instruction from adults or through direct experience that someone wealthier than you engaged in some nefarious behavior or exhibited some undesirable trait .
Therein lays the problem .
The fact is that some people do take advantage of others on their way to accumulating wealth .
Every now and then a Madoff comes along to drive home the point .
However , when this stereotype is applied to all wealthy people , and money is seen as bad in itself , it can become self - limiting .
If you , your family or your community have come to associate wealth with evildoing , how likely are you to accumulate any money yourself ?
Not very .
The psychological cost would be too high .
You would become one of " those people . "
Your friends and family members would look at you differently .
You would no longer belong .
This explains , in part , why many people who come into sudden money , through an inheritance , insurance settlement , or lottery win , get rid of it quickly .
As those close to you learn that your financial situation has changed , it can quickly become uncomfortable .
It also explains , in part , why many people unconsciously sabotage their financial success , believing that wealth and integrity cannot coexist .
Given the subjective and contextual definitions of rich and poor , these descriptors are not very helpful , and at any " categories " of human beings usually does more harm than good .
That fact that you can read and have access to the internet means that you are likely quite rich compared to most other people in the world .
Many rich people got that way by hard work , taking extraordinary risks , or providing a product or service that is of great benefit to the world .
Many rich people are also quite generous , donating to charities and setting up foundations to help those in need .
Take a close look at your early experiences around money and your resulting beliefs about wealth .
Are they keeping you stuck ?
If so , challenge some of your core beliefs about money and see if a more balanced view of money can help you improve your financial health .

There are no naked pre-cogs inside glowing jacuzzis yet , but the Florida State Department of Juvenile Justice will use analysis software to predict crime by young delinquents , putting potential offenders under specific prevention and education programs .
Goodbye , human rights !
Advertisement
They will use this software on juvenile delinquents , using a series of variables to determine the potential for these people to commit another crime .
Depending on this probability , they will put them under specific re-education programs .
Deepak Advani—vice president of predictive analytics at IBM — says the system gives " reliable projections " so governments can take " action in real time " to " prevent criminal activities ? "
Really ?
" Reliable projections " ?
" Action in real time " ?
" Preventing criminal activities " ?
I do n't know about how reliable your system is , IBM , but have you ever heard of the 5th , the 6th , and the 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution ?
What about article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ?
No ?
Let 's make this easy then : Did n't you watch that scientology nutcase in Minority Report ?
Advertisement
Sure .
Some will argue that these juvenile delinquents were already convicted for other crimes , so hey , there 's no harm .
This software will help prevent further crimes .
It will make all of us safer ?
But would it ?
Where 's the guarantee of that ?
Why does the state have to assume that criminal behavior is a given ?
And why should the government decide who goes to an specific prevention program or who does n't based on what a computer says ?
The fact is that , even if the software was 99.99 % accurate , there will be always an innocent person who will be fucked .
And that is exactly why we have something called due process and the presumption of innocence .
That 's why those things are not only in the United States Constitution , but in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights too .
Other people will say that government officials already makes these decisions based on reports and their own judgement .
True .
It seems that a computer program may be fairer than a human , right ?
Maybe .
But at the end the interpretation of the data is always in the hands of humans ( and the program itself is written by humans ) .

But what really worries me is that this is a first big step towards something larger and darker .
Actually , it 's the second : IBM says that the Ministry of Justice in the United Kingdom — which has an impeccable record on not pre-judging its citizens — already uses this system to prevent criminal activities .
Actually , it may be the third big step , because there 's already software in place to blacklist people as potential terrorist , although most probably not as sophisticated as this .
Advertisement
IBM clearly wants this to go big .
They have spent a whooping $ 12 billion beefing up its analytics division .
Again , here 's the full quote from Deepak Advani :
Predictive analytics gives government organizations worldwide a highly - sophisticated and intelligent source to create safer communities by identifying , predicting , responding to and preventing criminal activities .
It gives the criminal justice system the ability to draw upon the wealth of data available to detect patterns , make reliable projections and then take the appropriate action in real time to combat crime and protect citizens .
Advertisement
If that sounds scary to you , that 's because it is .
First it 's the convicted - but - potentially - recidivistic criminals .
Then it 's the potential terrorists .
Then it 's everyone of us , in a big database , getting flagged because some combination of factors — travel patterns , credit card activity , relationships , messaging , social activity and everything else — indicate that we may be thinking about doing something against the law .
Potentially , a crime prediction system can avoid murder , robbery , or a terrorist act .
It actually sounds like a good idea .
For example , there are certain patterns that can identify psychopaths and potential killers or child abusers or wife beaters .
It only makes sense to put a future system in place that can prevent identify potential criminals , then put them under surveillance .
Advertisement
The reality is that it 's not such a good idea :
While everything may seem driven by the desire to achieve better security , one single false positive would make the whole system unfair .
And that 's not even getting into the potential abuse of such a system .
Like the last time IBM got into a vaguely similar business for a good cause , during the 1930s .
They shipped a lot of cataloguing machines to certain government in Europe , to put together an advanced census .
That was good .
Census can improve societies by identifying needs and problems that the government can solve .
At the end , however , that did n't end well for more than 11 million people .
And yes , this comparison is an extreme exaggeration .
But one thing is clear :
No matter how you look at it , cataloguing people — any kind of people — based on statistical predictive software , and then taking pre-empetive actions against them based on the results , is the wrong way to improve our society .
Agreeing with this course of action will inevitably take us into a potentially fatal path .

I doubt if Rupert Murdoch watched the election debate last week .
His focus is very firmly on the United States , especially his resurgent Wall Street Journal .
But if he did , there would have been one man totally unknown to him .
One man utterly beyond the tentacles of any of his family , his editors or his advisers .
That man is Nick Clegg .
Make no mistake , if the Liberal Democrats actually won the election – or held the balance of power – it would be the first time in decades that Murdoch was locked out of British politics .
In so many ways , a vote for the Lib Dems is a vote against Murdoch and the media elite .
I can say this with some authority because in my five years editing the Sun I did not once meet a Lib Dem leader , even though I met Tony Blair , William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith on countless occasions .
( Full disclosure : I have since met Nick Clegg . )
I remember in my first year asking if we staffed the Liberal Democrat conference .
I was interested because as a student I 'd been a founder member of the SDP .
I was told we did not .
We did not send a single reporter for fear of encouraging them .
So while we sent a team of five , plus assorted senior staff , to both the Tory and Labour conferences , we sent nobody to the Lib Dems .
And while successive News International chiefs have held parties at both those conferences , they have never to my knowledge even attended a Lib Dem conference .
It gets even worse .
While it would be wrong to say the Lib Dems were banned from Murdoch 's papers ( indeed , the Times has a good record in this area ) , I would say from personal experience that they are often banned – except where the news is critical .
They are the invisible party , purposely edged off the paper 's pages and ignored .
But it is worse than that , because it is not just the Murdoch press that is guilty of this .
The fact is that much of the print press in this country is entirely partisan and always has been .
All proprietors and editors are part of the " great game " .
The trick is to ally yourself with the winner and win influence or at least the ear of the prime minister .
The consequence of this has been that the middle party has been ignored , simply because it was assumed it would never win power .
After all , why court a powerless party ?
So , as the pendulum swings from red to blue and back to red , the newspapers , or many of them , swing with it – sometimes ahead of the game and sometimes behind .
Over the years the relationships between the media elite and the two main political parties have become closer and closer to the point where , now , one is indistinguishable from the other .
Indeed , it is difficult not to think that the lunatics have stopped writing about the asylum and have actually taken it over .
We now live in an era when very serious men and women stay out of politics because our national discourse is conducted by populists with no interest in politics whatsoever .
What we have in the UK is a coming together of the political elite and the media in a way that makes people outside London or outside those elites feel disenfranchised and powerless .
But all that would go to pot if Clegg were able to somehow pull off his miracle .
For he is untainted by it .
Just imagine the scene in many of our national newspaper newsrooms on the morning a Lib - Lab vote has kept the Tories out of office .
" Who knows Clegg ? " they would say .
There would be a resounding silence .
" Who can put in a call to Gordon ? " another would cry .
You would hear a pin drop on the editorial floor .
The fact is these papers , and others , decided months ago that Cameron was going to win .
They are now invested in his victory in the most undemocratic fashion .
They have gone after the prime minister in a deeply personal way and until last week they were certain he was in their sights .
I hold no brief for Nick Clegg .
But now , thanks to him – an ingenue with no media links whatsoever – things look very different , because now the powerless have a voice as well as the powerful .
All of us who care about democracy must celebrate this over the coming weeks – even if Cameron wins in the end , at least some fault lines will have been exposed .
How Did School Staffers Get Insulin Instead of Flu Vaccine ?
Officials looking for answers in vaccination mix -up .
Jan. 20 , 2010  --
When staff members at a Wellesley , Mass. , school went to the nurse last Friday , they expected to be injected with a vaccine for the H1N1 flu .
What they received instead was a shot of insulin resulting in a bout with low blood sugar .
While the staffers seem to be suffering no long - term damage from mistakenly receiving the insulin injections , investigations are ongoing to determine what caused the medical error .
Indications thus far have been that a school nurse was responsible .
The nurse has been temporarily relieved of duty .
While ABC News contacted people at the departments of health for the town of Wellesley and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , as well as the Wellesley School District , it remains unclear how the flu vaccine , which can be distributed in pre-filled syringes or vials , was mistaken for insulin , which is drawn from a vial because each dose needs to be calibrated when it is given .
Such errors have happened before .
This past fall , a number of people in the neighboring town of Needham received a seasonal flu vaccine in place of the H1N1 vaccines they were supposed to receive .
And in 2007 , a teacher in the nearby town of Attleboro also received an injection of insulin instead of the intended flu shot .
" Mistakes can always be made , " said Lisa Lowery , a registered nurse and immunizations program manager for the Visiting Nurse Service in Indianapolis .
While she is reluctant to blame the nurse , she said other steps can be taken to avoid such a problem .
The benefit of having a nurse specifically performing a vaccination clinic , according to Lowery , is that it allows the nurse to be more focused .
" You 're in a habit of doing what you 're doing .
You 're doing one vaccine and only one vaccine , " she said .
" In practices , you 're taught to take the bottle to another nurse and have her double - check what you 're about to give , " she said -- a situation that is n't possible when a school nurse alone is administering vaccine .
" That nurse is not used to injecting vaccines as a school nurse , " said Lowery .
" It would have been her habit to pick up insulin .
Having someone to back them up and check them out would have prevented some more errors .
If you 're holding a vaccination clinic , use someone who 's used to doing that . "
Kay Renny , a registered nurse and manager of community programs for the Visiting Nurse Association of Southeast Michigan in Detroit said other steps are typically taken to avoid such a problem .
She said when her nurses are giving out both seasonal and swine flu vaccines , they do so in two separate lines with two separate forms , which do not look alike , so that nurses -- who are only administering one shot -- will notice .
" This is the first year where we 're administering two flu vaccines at the same time , " she said , explaining it presented a new challenge .
When a mistake happens , " It does n't hurt them , but it does n't help them .
What they want is what they 're there for , " said Renny .
" You try to put steps in place to avoid that happening . "
She noted that the vials for insulin and flu vaccine are similar but the syringes are different , with those for insulin being smaller .
" Whenever administering any kind of medication , you have to double check when you have multiple kinds of medication in front of you .
You really need to double check your double check . "
Possible Fallout
While no one seems to be suffering long - term consequences from the medical error , adverse events are always possible with insulin being needlessly injected , since it drops the blood - sugar levels .
" It 's basically going to make them hypoglycemic , " said Dr. Sue Kirkman , senior vice president for medical affairs for the American Diabetes Association .
" That might cause anything from just feeling shaky and jittery and hungry all the way down to making it difficult to think . "
Kirkman explained that a person can become unconscious if their blood - sugar drops too low , but noted that this type of error could be corrected by certain injections or " you can have the person eat carbohydrates to bring the blood sugar back up , " depending on the severity .
It remains unclear what , if any , impact this incident will have on public demand for flu vaccine .
Both nurses seemed to think , however , that the incident , while unfortunate , would likely improve safety in people still getting vaccinated without reducing the number of people willing to get the shot .
" When you have stories out there , then people are going to be asking the person administering -- the nurse -- what are you giving me ? " said Renny .
" What I think it does is help the administrator administer the right vaccine , because it 's forefront in their mind . "
" I do think people who are actively going to seek a shot are going to be proactive about asking the nurse , which is a good thing , " said Lowery .
At the same time , she said , " We still need to encourage the public to get both their H1N1 vaccination , " noting that it remains unclear if H1N1 will return and the traditional peak of seasonal flu has not yet arrived .
" Do n't let an incident as isolated as this affect your choice , " she said .
" Make sure you get vaccinated and prepare for the flu season . "
More Answers Needed
One complicating issue that has not been resolved yet is how the error was made , given that the H1N1 doses had come in prefilled syringes , while insulin doses are filled at the time from a vial .
Insulin " typically would not be in pre-filled syringes , " said Kirkman , adding that " there are some situations where a home health nurse , for example , might pre-fill syringes for someone who 's homebound .
I think it 's just impossible to speculate . "
" It does seem odd , " said Lowery .
" However , having been a school nurse , it involves more than giving out Band - Aids , " she said , noting that kids and teachers are coming in for a variety of ailments .
" I can see , unfortunately , where it would be very easy to get flustered and confused . "
A woman answering the phone for the Wellesley superintendent 's office indicated that the investigation is ongoing and no answer could be provided for that particular question yet .
So I ’ve got a so - called villain strapped to the operating table ( he would n’t stop squirming while I was using the scalpel ) because I was wondering what makes them work .
What ’s makes them tick ( tick - tock , tick - tock , like an evil clock ! ) so speak .
It seems to be a fad these days , to be chillin’ like a villain .
As I mop up ( more like smear it around ) the pools of blood this dastardly fellow leaked ( how uncooperative he ’s been ! ) , I try to listen ( he was screaming the whole time ) to the notes I recorded during my dissection .
Anyways , I should let one of my trusted assistants finish cleaning up , I know how much they like to chew the fat while working .
Hey , do n’t forget to put those organs through the grinder before they spoil !
Where was I ?
Oh yes , my notes … well I present my written report on the composition of a villain .
DAMN IT MINIONS !
Chew with your mouth closed , you know how much the smacking of lips irritates me !
Disclaimer
We all like to build the most effective villains for our games , but some components work better in different atmospheres .
If you ’re game is a light , humorous poke at the supers ’ genre , then a truly nasty demon villain that eats babies may not be appropriate ( or it may , depending on your group … ) .
The underlying point is to use the components that work for you and forget the rest .
Antagonists vs. Villain
Let ’s get one thing straight ; villains are the bad - asses of the bad - guy universe .
If you look at the bad - guy universe as a Venn diagram , the big circle is the general antagonists set and then a much , much smaller circle , a subset of the general antagonists , is the villains .
Villains are a special breed .
Antagonists
Antagonists are anyone who becomes obstacles in the player characters ’ path .
They could range from the diligent guard blocking access to a location ( just doing his job ) to the thug who beat up one of their grandmas and left her for dead .
It could be the bard in the corner singing out of tune so loudly that the PCs cannot hear what the thief in the corner is saying to her boss .
An antagonist just someone ( or something ) like makes life more difficult , but does n’t necessarily have a lasting effect on the campaign .
The Villain
Actual villains should probably remain relatively rare in a campaign , otherwise they lose their effectiveness .
The single factor that make a villain distinct from lesser antagonists is the fact his goal (s ) is the direct anti-thesis of the PC ’s ultimate goal (s ) .
A villain is the arch - nemesis of the player characters , and he actively tries to defeat them .
Mechanisms of Good Villains
I have collected , preserved , and placed in labeled jars full of formaldehyde some of the common components of effective villains .
These are some of the most rotten elements that comprise many of the most hated and feared villains .
Cult of Personality
Many villains become powerful leaders and influential people of station through their commanding presence and charisma .
They may use sex appeal or oratory skills ( no it ’s not the same , pervert ! ) .
This usually means any dialog with a villain should be real and memorable .
Not to mention the hoards of zealous followers willing to lie down and die for their liege .
Truly Threatening
If a villain does n’t pose an honest threat the player characters , then he ’s a mook ( as opposed to a villain ) .
A villain should strike fear into the hearts of the players , not just their characters .
A villain actually uses sound tactics in and out of combat and he orders his minions to do the same .
Corresponding Intensity
This is really a reflection of the game ’s attitude and atmosphere .
A villain should be just as intense as the player characters ( or more so if they are a bunch of gimpy roleplayers ) .
If the characters see the world as black and white ( and they are white ) , then the villain is the blackest black .
If everything is seen in shades of grey , this guy is nebulous too .
If everything is tongue - in - cheek comedy , then the villain should be dark humor .
Shattered Mirror
This is a reflection of the player characters .
Sometimes the best villain is a photographic negative of one or more player characters , or what they believe in .
The villain should be a perverse mockery of all the good traits of the characters .
Lingering Humanity
Some villains still possess a shred of their humanity ( or elvenity , or whatever ) that they had before they became the cruel bastard they are now .
Perhaps they have a soft spot for children ( or gully dwarves ) , or like ice scream an awful lot .
This is a great way to get players to feel sympathy for a villain .
Twisted Endings
So your players have slain the big bad evil guy , but wait … this guy was actually the good captain who was undercover trying to find the real bad guy ?
Oh yeah , the truly despicable villain will throw the player characters with excellent red herrings .
What did you just say , you ’re my mother !?
Nooooooooo !!
Tragic Origins
Give the player characters a greater understanding of their nemesis and have them discover the tragic origins of the villain .
Perhaps he grew up in an orphanage where the Sisters of Mercy would n’t give him any ice cream but would pound down pints of Cookies ’n ’ Cream in front of him , oh the torture !
So now he will drown any nun he sees in hot sticky cream .
Hidden Enemy
Occasionally is it can be fun keeping the villain unknown and working from the shadows .
The player characters are always baffled until he finally slips and makes a mistake .
Then you reveal the villain in all her glory , hopefully crushing the PCs ’ spirits with hopelessness .
Scaling Power
Usually , I am not a proponent of scaling elements in the world with the progression and power of the player characters .
I like an organic or natural world .
But the natural world is n’t completely static , and an ambitious villain will most definitely progress in power too ; quite possibly at a faster rate than the PCs depending on how unscrupulous she is .
Memorable Name
Well you ca n’t have a terrifying villain with a hokey name , unless that ’s the atmosphere of the game .
If your villain has been designed properly , merely using the name in normal conversion should elicit emotional reaction from your players .
Cinema & Novels
Let ’s face it .
Roleplaying games are NOT movies or books .
That ’s a good thing , because playing an RPG is dynamic art that always creates a unique experience because you ( and the rest of your group ) are the one creating it .
It ’s just that some of the tools and techniques used in cinema and novels do n’t work as effectively when used right out of the box .
Presentation & Revelation
Directors and authors often center parts of their stories away from the protagonists and focus on the activities of the villain .
This is great because it allows them to develop the villain ’s character and compel the [ passive ] audience to connect with the adversary .
Game Masters do not have that luxury .
It is fairly difficult to switch away from the player characters during the game to narrate the devious actions that the villain is doing .
Besides killing the pacing , it also destroys the suspension of disbelief by showing things that is impossible for the characters to know ( and of course this information can then be metagamed ) .
However a clever GM can reveal the villain ’s machinations , history , and depth of character to the player characters through the accounts of interviewed witnesses , scrying , dream sequences , scenes of aftermath , and other recreations of the villain ’s actions .

Afghani taxi driver Mohammed Nadir Darwesh has walked free after a judge said it would be a farce to continue with his trial and threw out all the sex allegations against him .
The jury was discharged on the second day of the trial in Christchurch District Court when Judge David Saunders ruled it unsafe to proceed .
The trial had heard evidence from two 16 - year - old girls who said they accepted an offer of a free taxi ride , in daytime , from Christchurch 's Barrington Mall .
They were driven to the Pioneer Stadium carpark where the driver , Mr Darwesh , centrally locked the taxi doors and indecently assaulted them .
The credibility of the girls was clinically demolished in cross-examination by Mr Darwesh 's defence counsel Paul Norcross , who questioned them about their honesty and their past offending , and the reasons they had texted and called afterwards demanding $ 200 or they would go to the police .
One of the girls ended up breaking down in tears and storming from the witness box .
Mr Darwesh told police the girls called his cab and then offered sex for money and he declined , saying he was married .
He had given them $ 20 to get lunch , because it was Ramadan and as a Muslim it was better to help people .
But he suggested they get jobs rather than sell themselves .
He had kept the threatening text messages that arrived soon afterwards on his cellphone and was able to show them to police .
At the end of the crown case , Mr Norcross applied to have the case dismissed and Judge Saunders agreed , throwing out two charges of indecent assault and two charges of unlawfully detaining the girls to have sexual connection with them .
He said one of the girls said she could not remember being touched , and it was clear from the phone records that five text messages had been sent from the car during the time they said they were being detained .
These had not raised anyone 's alarm .
He said the veracity of one of the girls had been called into question by the defence counsel because of her prior history of dishonesty , her manner of giving evidence , and the threats she had made of accusing Mr Darwesh of rape .
" Only a jury returning a perverse verdict could really find him guilty in respect of these matters , " the judge told the jury .
" It would frankly be a farce to continue with the matter at this stage .
I see by the nods from some of you that you agree . "
He said he hoped that the jury would not feel that their time had been wasted .
Since the courts stopped holding depositions hearings last year , prior to trials , the taking of evidence had become the first time people saw " the true colours of people making these complaints " .

WASHINGTON – The Environmental Protection Agency is exploring whether to use the Clean Water Act to control greenhouse gas emissions , which are turning the oceans acidic at a rate that ’s alarmed some scientists .
With climate change legislation stalled in Congress , the Clean Water Act would serve as a second front , as the Obama administration has sought to use the Clean Air Act to rein in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases administratively .
Since the dawn of the industrial age , acid levels in the oceans have increased 30 percent .
Currently , the oceans are absorbing 22 million tons of carbon dioxide a day .
Among other things , scientists worry that the increase in acidity could interrupt the delicate marine food chain , which ranges from microscopic plankton to whales .
“ There are all sorts of evils associated with this , ” said Robert Paine , an emeritus professor of biology at the University of Washington .
The situation is especially acute along the West Coast .
Northwest winds during the summer cause upwelling , which brings deep water to the surface along the continental shelf from Queen Charlotte Sound in British Columbia to Baja California .
The water in the deep Pacific Ocean is already more acidic than shallower water is because it ’s absorbed the carbon dioxide that ’s produced as animals and plants decompose .
Some of the deep water in the Pacific has n’t been to the surface for 1,000 or more years .
By the end of the century , that deep water is expected to be 150 percent more acidic than it is now , and as it ’s brought to the surface by upwelling , it ’s exposed to even more carbon dioxide .
“ The immensity of the problem on the West Coast is of serious concern , ” said Richard Feely , an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle .
Scientists suspect that acidic water connected with upwelling killed several billion oyster , clam and mussel larvae that were being raised at the Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery near Tillamook on the Oregon coast in the summer of 2008 .
The hatchery provides baby shellfish to growers up and down the West Coast .
Feely said the oceans ’ acidity levels were higher than they ’d been at any time in the past 20 million years .
Based on “ pretty good ” evidence , Feely said , previous high acid levels in the oceans have caused mass extinctions of marine plants and animals , which can take 2 million to 10 million years to re-evolve .
“ The decisions we make now , over the next 50 years , will be felt over hundreds of thousands of years , ” he said .
The Clean Water
Act considers high acidity a pollutant , but the standard has n’t been updated since it was written in 1976 .
The act has been used previously to help combat acid rain and mercury emissions .
Originally , the Center for Biological Diversity , a San Francisco - based environmental group , asked Washington state to use the Clean Water Act to regulate emissions that add to the ocean ’s acidity .
Under the act , states have to update their lists of “ imperiled waters ” every two years and come up with cleanup plans .
In rejecting the request , officials at the state ’s Department of Ecology said that while they understood the concern about ocean acidification , there was n’t enough data about specific bodies of water in the state to justify any listings .
When the EPA agreed with Washington state , the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the federal agency to start using the Clean Water Act to control the oceans ’ rising acidity .
In late March , the EPA published a Federal Register notice seeking public comment on whether the Clean Water Act could be used .
“ It ’s not 100 percent clear where we go here , ” Suzanne Schwartz , the deputy director of the EPA ’s Office of Wetlands , Oceans and Watersheds , said in an interview .
“ This is not an easy issue .
We are trying to figure out how to proceed . ”
The public comment period lasts 60 days .
Schwartz said the EPA should reach some conclusions by November .
' My hair is completely white ' , reveals John Barrowman as he admits dyeing it black
John Barrowman maintains his youthful appearance by using Botox and hair dye
He 's already admitted using Botox to maintain his dashing looks .
And now Torchwood star John Barrowman has revealed he employs another tactic to help hold back the years .
The 42 - year - old says he regularly uses hair dye to cover up his ' white ' locks .
He claims he tried to revert back to his natural hair colour but said his partner , architect Scott Gill , persuaded him to continue dyeing it black .
' My hair 's only still the same colour because of the bottle , ' he said told Attitude magazine .
' I 'm completely white .
Scott and I tested it out a couple of years back .
I shaved my head and let it grow and no one saw it .
' I let it come out grey to see if it was time to let my hair go back to its natural colour .
He looked at me and said : " I 'm not so ready for that yet " .
And he 's older than me .
he 's 47 this year but looks like he 's 20 . '
The actor and singer , who has just released a new album , admitted in 2008 that he used Botox to maintain his wrinkle - free complexion .
He said he had the toxin injected around his eyes to banish the creases .
He said : ' I do n't swear by it , but I think it 's quite good .
The key is to not do the forehead .
Men need forehead lines and doing the forehead makes you look like Nicole Kidman !
' If you 're going to do anything , just do it round the eyes , that 's all men need . '
Barrowman also said that he and Scott had talked about adopting a child .
' I 'm always bringing it up , ' he said .
' I do n't know if he is ready or if he would do it .
I do n't know how I 'm going to get around it , but I 'm going to have to do it at some point .
' I think it 's important for gay men to adopt or to have their own kids , because then we can instill our own values in those children .
' Gay couples have a lot to offer .
I do n't care what anybody else says , any home that shows love and tenderness and care to a child is a home that deserves to have children in it . '
Barrowman and his partner Scott Gill married in a civil ceremony in 2006
Bats are nocturnal , but some need sunlight to set their internal compass .
" Recent evidence suggests that bats can detect the geomagnetic field , " wrote Max Planck Institute ornithologists Richard Holland , Ivailo Borissov and Bjorn Siemers in an article published March 29 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" We demonstrate that homing greater mouse - eared bats calibrate a magnetic compass with sunset cues . "
Previously , Holland showed that interfering with the magnetic field around bats impaired their long - distance navigation abilities .
Those findings suggested that while bats used echolocation for short - distance steering , they rely on some geomagnetic sense to guide nocturnal flights that take them dozens of miles from home .
The details , however , were hazy .
In the new study , Holland 's team captured 32 greater mouse - eared bats .
Half of them were placed inside a pair of giant , coiled magnets that created a geomagnetic field misaligned with Earth 's , temporarily scrambling their own geomagnetic sense .
All were released in an unfamiliar location 15 miles from their home cave .
Bats that were captured at night flew home unerringly , regardless of what the researchers had done .
They 'd already set their compasses by the sun .
But if the bats were captured and magnetically disoriented at twilight , when they would normally be flying around calibrating their compasses , they could no longer find their way home .
The bats appear to use the twilight as a point of reference while setting their compasses for the rest of the night .
How the compass works is still a mystery .
Some birds use sunset for navigational calibration , but the similarities likely end there .
While birds ' eyes contain geomagnetically sensitive molecules that are activated by photons , Holland has previously shown that bats do n't have this system .
Instead , some of their cells appear to be laden with magnetite .
Bats that fly only in the dead of night , such as vampire bats , could provide an interesting comparison , wrote the researchers .
" The cues used by the bats to indicate their position can only be speculated on at this stage , " they wrote , noting that ornithologists have argued over the bird compass for decades .
" For animals that occupy ecological niches where the sunset is rarely observed , this is a surprising finding . "

The Obama administration wants cities and states to push a more regional approach to economic development instead of using tax breaks and other incentives to poach jobs and businesses from each other , according to this story on Stateline.org .
The story notes that the administration believes the current system of economic development — where businesses often use the carrot of jobs and investment to play neighboring cities off each other in hopes of weaning tax breaks — is destructive to the recovery .
One example given is that of Ohio and Michigan , both of which have been smacked by the decline in auto manufacturing .
Rather than allow the states to fight each other to attract similar jobs or industries ( say , green - technology jobs ) the story notes the administration recently gave $ 25 million to an Ohio plant that will make batteries for electric vehicles built in Michigan .
“ Federal officials say that the northern Ohio - southern Michigan region is poised to repackage itself as a clean - energy center , ” Stateline notes .
Cities and states have tried for decades to end poaching via regional agreements , with limited success .
This Journal article about incentive “ clawbacks , ” noted that a group of cities in Northern Ohio put together an antipoaching agreement where cities share tax revenue to discourage poaching .
Various cities , states , counties and regional governments have passed similar measures .
Yet poaching continues , and the cottage industry of economic consultants that act as agents for companies seeking tax breaks .
This RTE post noted how officials in Ohio were inflamed when they heard that money from the $ 787 billion stimulus program might be used to lure Dayton , Ohio institution NCR Corp. to the Atlanta area .
The issue of poaching has gotten even more contentious as local governments grapple with the worst budget gaps in a generation .
Along with deep cuts in services , many cities and states have raised taxes to ease budget gaps — prompting others , including President Barack Obama ’s hometown , to whistle at out of state businesses .
Just one week after Oregon voters passed a broad tax increase on residents and businesses , Chicago mayor Richard Daley said he wanted to poach Oregon businesses .
“ It will help [ Chicago ’s ] economic development immediately , ” Daley told the Chicago Sun -Times .
“ You ’d better believe it .
We ’ll be out in Oregon enticing corporations to relocate to Chicago .
I ’ll be very frank .
I make no bones about that . ”
[ Update : I originally called the new space policy " visionary " in the title of this post , but after some thought I changed it .
It 's actually not visionary , it 's pragmatic , so I took the word out .
Other than that I have n't changed anything in this post since it originally went up . ]
President Obama gave a speech at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center today to outline his new , revamped space policy .
You may remember that his last revamping caused quite a stir , with people screaming that it would doom NASA .
I disagree .
Canceling Constellation still strikes me as the right thing to do , because it was becoming an albatross around NASA 's neck .
Mind you , this was also the recommendation of the blue ribbon Augustine panel .
You may also note that NASA astronauts are split over all this , with Buzz Aldrin , for example , supporting Obama , and Neil Armstrong and many others disagreeing .
It 's a mess , and hard to disentangle what everyone 's saying .
There 's been a huge amount of misinformation about it ( with -- shocking -- Fox news leading the way ; they spout so much disingenuousness , nonsense , self - contradiction , and outright stupidity that it makes me want to fly to their studios just to slap them ) .
But Obama 's plan seems pretty clear .
The New Space Policy Plan1 )
As before , NASA 's budget will be increased in the new plan .
Let me repeat that : NASA 's overall budget will go up .
And not just a little ; we 're talking $ 6 billion over the next five years .
A lot of that goes into scientific research .
So far from it being doom and gloom , that 's good news .
2 ) A new heavy - lift rocket will be developed .
Let me repeat that as well : funding is provided for NASA to create a new heavy - lift vehicle .
So yes , Constellation will be canceled , but a new system will be developed that ( hopefully ) will be within budget and time constraints .
3 ) The Orion capsule , based on Apollo capsule legacy , will still be built .
Initially it will be for space station operations as an escape module , but can be adapted later for crewed space missions .
4 ) He wants NASA to plan manned missions to near - Earth asteroids in the 2020s , and to Mars in 2030s , but no return to the Moon .
OK , so what do I think of all this ?
My opinion on the new space policy1 )
The increase in NASA 's budget is most welcome .
Some of this goes to climate change studies ( which the denialists will rant and scream about , but too bad ) .
Some goes to science , some to education .
All in all , given NASA 's minuscule budget , any increase rocks .
And a lot of this goes into space science .
2 ) This new rocket proposal makes me very happy .
As I have stated repeatedly , NASA keeps going from one project to another without a clear goal or a streamlined system of attaining it .
The Shuttle , as amazing as it is , was a terrible project once it was realized -- hugely over budget , hobbled massively from what it should have been able to do , and unable to provide cheap and easy access to space with a fast turnaround .
Ditto for the Space Station ; it became a political pork barrel project and instead of a sleek engineering wonder it became another bloated project with no clear goal .
Some people are complaining that we 've already sunk $ 10 billion into Constellation , and we should n't throw that money away .
I think that 's a red herring .
If Constellation was a waste of money , then we need to staunch that flow .
I 'm not saying it was , but I 'm pointing out that you need to show me that the system was not a waste of money first before complaining that we can't cancel it after spending that much .
As Elon Musk , head of SpaceX , said in a press release :
The President quite reasonably concluded that spending $ 50 billion to develop a vehicle that would cost 50 % more to operate , but carry 50 % less payload was perhaps not the best possible use of funds .
To quote a member of the Augustine Commission , which was convened by the President to analyze Ares / Orion , " If Santa Claus brought us the system tomorrow , fully developed , and the budget did n’t change , our next action would have to be to cancel it , " because we ca n’t afford the annual operating costs .
Mind you as well that this money already spent wo n't be wasted .
It 's not like we have a lot of rockets sitting around gathering dust .
That money was spent on developing technology , knowledge , and experience that will go into any new system created .
I 'll note that the cancellation of Constellation means a loss of many jobs .
This new plan should restore a lot of them .
I 'd be interested in seeing a balance sheet for that .
Another complaint with little or no merit ( coming from a lot of folks , including the insipid talking heads on that Fox link above ) is that once the Shuttle is over , we need to borrow a lift from the Russians to get to space .
As much as I 'd like to see us with our own , independent , and healthy space program , I do n't see riding with the Russians as entirely a bad thing .
It 's cheaper than the Shuttle , by a large amount .
The bad political decisions involving NASA for the past forty years have put us in this predicament , not anything Obama has done over the past 15 months .
And I 'll remind you that this predicament really started rolling when the Bush Administration and NASA decided to stop the Shuttle program with no replacement possible for at least four to five years after the last Shuttle flight .
Even if Obama had done nothing ; we 'd still need the Russians ' help to get into space .
And it 's only temporary .
Under Obama 's plan we 'll have a new rocket system around the same time Constellation would 've gotten going anyway .
As far as relying on private space , I have been clear about that : NASA should not be doing the routine , like going to low Earth orbit .
Let private companies do that now that the technology has become attainable by them .
NASA needs to innovate .
And I 'll note that NASA has relied on private space venture -- Boeing , Lockheed , and many others -- for decades .
This is hardly new .
3 ) As an adjunct to everything I just wrote above , the Orion legacy capsule project will continue , underscoring my point .
We 're taking the knowledge gained over the past few years and applying it to new technology .
I rather like Orion , and I 'm glad it 's not going away .
4 ) Well , here 's where I think the new policy falls short .
I strongly support missions to near - Earth asteroids .
These rocks are areal threat to life on Earth , and the more we know about them the better .
Getting to them via rocket is actually easier in many ways than getting to the Moon , so these kinds of missions are cost - effective , and we can learn vast amounts from them .
And we would also gain critical experience in visiting asteroids that could come in handy if one has our name on it .
I 'm not as gung - ho on getting to Mars because I think the engineering and knowledge needed to put humans on such a long trip is not where it needs to be yet .
So how do we get that knowledge ?
By going back to the Moon .
Obama specifically downplayed a return to the Moon , and it seems he said that we wo n't be doing that .
I think that 's a huge mistake .
Yes , we 've been there before , but that was a totally different set of missions .
That was a race to win , not to stay .
A lot of science was planned and obtained for the Apollo missions , but it was n't sustainable .
Stopping now -- especially with a heavy - lift vehicle on the horizon -- is a tremendous waste of an opportunity .
Going to Mars depends critically on knowledge learned on going back to the Moon and staying there .
So on this point I disagree with Obama 's new plan .
Conclusion Obama has clearly been listening to both supporters and critics ( imagine that ! ) .
It almost sounds like he 's been reading my blog ( I wish ) .
Bill Nelson , a Democratic Senator from Florida , was vocally opposed to Obama 's initial plan , but accompanied him to this speech .
That indicates to me that they have been talking -- certainly about the politics , but also about the nuts and bolts -- about all this .
Obama 's change in plans to continue Orion and more concrete plans for a heavy - lift vehicle clearly come from listening to his critics .
Certainly , this revamped policy the right political move for him ; Congresscritters from NASA centers were pretty unhappy about that first policy of privatization .
But it 's also the right thing to do .
Obama , in this speech , stated specifically he wants us to be the dominant world power in space .
He says that under this new plan , we will actually be sending more astronauts into space in the next decade than we otherwise would have .
If his plans are accepted by Congress , if they are funded at the levels requested , and if NASA can implement them , then I think the President is correct .
My overarching desire : that NASA have a clear goal , an actual set of specific , visionary destinations that will inspire the public and make us proud of our space program once again .
Part of that desire is for this to have political support and funding to make it possible .
Too often , NASA has been told to go do something but not given the money to do it , and that 's a major factor that we 're where we are right now .
Obama 's new policy , with one exception , will give NASA what it needs to be visionary again .
That one exception -- not returning to the Moon -- is a strong one for me , and I will see what I can do to get it put back in .
I 'm just one guy , but I 'll talk to folks and see what trouble I can stir up .
In the meantime , I 'll also caution that at this moment , these are just words from the President .
Good words , and hopeful ones , but just words .
It will take deeds to see this through : a clear plan by the White House , cooperation from Congress , and a commitment from NASA to see this policy through .
If those things can happen , then for NASA , for America , and for humanity , then the sky is no longer the limit .
Per ardua , ad astra .
After another tremendously busy year , virtual cobwebs have covered L2 Ork ’s front page .
It is time for another mega - post , a year in review , if you like .
2015 has been an exciting year .
Following my research leave in 2014 , things were slowly revving up , only to kick in the high gear with the onset of the spring 2015 semester .
With the highest enrollment yet , in January , 17 L2 Orkists performed as part of the Band Camp in the beautiful Fife hall in the new Moss Arts Center .
In March we had an opportunity to perform at University of Maryland Architecture ’s “ Great Space ” where we were also interviewed by UMD ’s Diamondback who published a really flattering article .
Spring was also a really busy time with the national SEAMUS 2015 3 - day conference taking place at Virginia Tech with 14 concerts , two listening rooms , two installation locations , and six paper sessions and panels .
L2 Ork peformed Between in ICAT ’s Cube in front of a standing room only audience as part of conference ’s opening concert .
The performance featured L2 Orkist Brock Allen on the sax and the rest of the L2 Orkists spread across two levels of catwalks .
It was also the first L2 Ork performance featuring the new Glasstra app for Google Glass that displayed network and FUDI - enabled GUI that was controlled via pd-l2ork , and a concealed Wiimote and Nunchuk that was used to conduct and switch between sections .
On April 9th , L2 Ork had its second visit to the Ferrum College for an evening - long performance , followed by the April 19th School of Performing Arts ’ Exposition scholarship fundraiser concert back at the Fife hall .
Around the same time L2 Ork did another photo session with the Spring 2015 generation of L2 Orkists guided by the talented eye of Cooper Long .
Finally , on May 4th , L2 Ork performed as part of the Spring 2015 DISIS event and the annual ICAT day where we premiered two new works , including a really cool Insomniac composition by the L2 Orkist Jacob Stenzel .
Summer was just as intense with two week - long Maker camps , the annual K - 12 instrument building camp and the inaugural teachers ’
Maker camp .
With the addition of new objects , such as the complete General MIDI implementation within pd- l2ork K12 module , this year kids have taken instrument building to a whole new level .
Speaking of which , Pd- L2 Ork development continues at a rapid pace with a number of releases , including most recently the 20151018 release that introduces rtcmix ~ external , Eric Lyon ’s fftease and potpourri libraries , as well as the new autotune ~ external .
There is also a major new version ( currently in the alpha stage ) we are hoping to release sometime this academic year .
This fall , we also participated in a number of performances , including Virginia Tech ’s Center for Human - Computer Interaction ‘s 20th anniversary celebration , as part of the Electro - Acoustic Barn Dance festival where we premiered a new work by Eric Lyon , and perhaps most excitingly a recent outreach performance made possible by one of the summer teachers ’
Maker camp participants , Stephanie Hufton at Botetourt County ’s Read Mountain Middle School , where L2 Ork performed in front of 300 incredibly enthusiastic middle school students and teachers .
The event was also covered by the regional Roanoke Times whose Saturday newspaper front page and online flattering coverage really made our day .
So , all this brings me to perhaps the most exciting announcement .
This summer , the international Alliance for the Arts in Research Universities , a non-profit organization with an amazingly exciting goal of establishing and validating the so - called transdisciplinary third space that in many ways defines L2 Ork and its mission , put out a call for national transdisciplinary exemplars , the pool of applicants included top national institutions .
Only six exemplars were selected by the national peer review to be showcased at the upcoming a2ru conference scheduled for November 8 - 11 , 2015 at Virginia Tech , and we are thrilled by the fact that L2 Ork was one of them !
And so this brings us to roughly today , even though there are a few more pending announcements in the pipeline I will leave for the next blog , so stay tuned for more updates soon !
All right , now that we are mostly caught - up , it ’s time to get back to preparations for the upcoming a2ru conference .
Hope to see you there !
Washington ( CNN ) -- Senate Republicans on Wednesday launched an attempt to amend or kill legislation expanding the recently enacted health care reform law -- part of a GOP pledge to use every parliamentary tool available to undermine the measure .
The amendments also are designed to force Democrats to cast unpopular votes in the run-up to this November 's midterm elections .
Senate Democrats easily defeated the first of the amendments , which challenged provisions in the bill involving changes to Medicare funding .
Also defeated were attempts to send the measure to committee for reconsideration -- which would effectively kill it -- and other amendments intended to strip provisions from the bill .
There were at least 11 other motions or amendments to be considered .
The Democrats ' so - called fixes bill was necessary to get a reluctant House of Representatives to pass the Senate 's health care reform measure Sunday night .
The House 's narrow approval of the measure allowed President Obama to sign it into law Tuesday , giving the president a victory on his signature domestic issue .
But in return , House Democrats are now expecting the Senate to sign off on the compromises included in the fixes bill .
The compromise package would add more than $ 60 billion to the overall plan 's cost partly by expanding insurance subsidies for middle - and lower - income families .
It would also expand Medicare 's prescription drug benefit while scaling back the bill 's taxes on expensive insurance plans .
While Obama is pushing to get the measure to his desk , Democrats have acknowledged they are concerned that the Republicans may succeed in changing the carefully balanced package .
Any changes would force the package back to the House for another vote .
Also Wednesday , Democratic senators complained that Republicans had shut down committee hearings for a second straight day as part of a strategy of obstruction in protest of the health care bill .
Sen. Carl Levin , D- Michigan , and Sen. Claire McCaskill , D - Missouri , told a news conference the GOP tactic was delaying work on vital issues .
" It 's unconscionable , " said Levin , who as chairman of the Armed Services Committee was supposed to conduct a hearing with a top U.S. military commander in Korea who had flown in for the hearing .
" Out national security cannot be held hostage to disagreements over a health care policy . "
McCaskill had planned an oversight hearing on problems with contracts to train local police departments in Afghanistan .
She said the Senate rule that allows the minority party to block committee action was " really dumb " and should be dropped .
" Disagree with us , debate us , vote no , " she said .
" But to use a rule to stop us from working -- that dog just does n't hunt from where I come from .
That does n't even makes sense .
That 's why people in American think we are clueless here . "
Levin said he " pleaded " with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to prevent the blocking of a second day of hearings .
A GOP objection Tuesday also closed down committee work .
" It seems to me this is an example of how the obstructionism around here has gotten mindless , " Levin said .
A GOP leadership aide would not directly respond to Levin 's charge but noted that Democrats canceled hearings Tuesday so that senators could attend the White House signing ceremony for the health care bill .
Among the amendments being proposed by Republicans is a provision to prevent the bill 's planned Medicare cuts from being used to finance other programs .
They also are proposing to eliminate new penalties being imposed on businesses whose workers use federally subsidized insurance .
Sen .
Tom Coburn , R - Oklahoma , has proposed that drugs for erectile dysfunction , such as Viagra and Cialis , be prohibited to sex offenders .
i Report : How will health care reform affect you ?
Sen . John McCain , R - Arizona , is pushing to strike so - called " sweetheart deals " such as an extra $ 300 million in Medicaid funds for the state of Louisiana .
Critics have labeled the deal the " Louisiana Purchase . "
Democrats have dismissed the GOP proposals as little more than politically motivated obstructionism meant to derail the deal .
Republicans are " not serious about helping this bill , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said Wednesday .
They are concerned only with " throwing roadblocks in front of anything we do . "
Reid said Senate Democrats " feel very comfortable and confident " that the package of changes as currently drafted will pass .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Maryland , said Tuesday he did n't think the Senate would change the bill , but if it did , the House would be prepared to vote on the revised bill and send it to Obama .
After a White House meeting Monday night with Senate Democratic leaders and Obama , a senior Democratic source said they believe some portions of the fixes bill may be ruled out of order because they violate the complicated legislative rules governing the process .
The source would not specify the potential problems identified at the meeting .
Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus , D - Montana , said one or two potential problems were identified , but he said they were minor .
Watch senators talk about opposition to reform
Once Republicans raise a point of order , it would be up to the Senate parliamentarian to rule on whether it is legitimate .
Democrats would have difficulty defeating a point of order because that would require 60 votes .
The Democrats lost their filibuster - proof 60 - seat majority in the chamber when Republican Scott Brown won the Massachusetts seat long held by Democrat Ted Kennedy , who died last year .
The loss of the 60 - seat supermajority was what prompted the complicated two - bill strategy being used by the Democrats .
If the House had made any changes to the Senate version of the bill , it would have had to go back to the Senate for another vote .
It would have stalled there , because Republicans have enough seats to filibuster it .
Democrats therefore approved the Senate bill without changes and proposed the fixes bill , which they are trying pass in the Senate through reconciliation , which allows bills affecting the budget to pass by a simple majority of 51 votes .
The points of order that Republicans are expected to raise would deal with aspects of the legislation that they say violate the strict rules on the reconciliation process .
In an ironic twist , many of the provisions of the fixes bill that Republicans are trying to kill were backed by Republicans during debate on the Senate health care bill .
For example , the fixes bill would eliminate a provision for the federal government to pay Medicaid cost increases for the state of Nebraska , a provision that was negotiated by Democratic Nebraska Sen .
Ben Nelson in exchange for his support .
Republicans cited the Nelson trade - off as an example of what they called unethical deal - making by Democrats to get the health care bill passed in December .

Updated Update :
This story has been updated to show that Larry Sanger now says that the images in question do not depict real people and to include additional legal clarification .
And it was later updated a second time with additional clarification about federal law 18USC 2258A , which requires electronic service providers to notify the NCMEC if they are made aware of child pronography .
Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger has reported the site 's parent organization to the Federal Bureau of Investigation , saying he believes the Wikimedia Commons " may be knowingly distributing child pornography . "
He says , however , that " the images did not contain actual people . "
And he acknowledges that in publicly explaining his report to the FBI , his use of the term child pornography " may have been misleading . "
In his report to the bureau , Sanger says that in his " non-lawyer 's opinion , " he believes that the images violate a US law against " obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children " ( 18 USC § 1466 A ( 2 ) ( A ) ) .
This law specifically says : " It is not a required element of any offense under this section that the minor depicted actually exist . "
A separate federal law ( 18 USC 2252 ) deals with " certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors . "
Earlier this week , Sanger disclosed his FBI report with a post to a public mailing list and later an open letter to a member of the Wikimedia Foundation 's board of trustees .
In the letter , he also says he notified his Senators and Congressional representatives over the images in question .
Sanger - who parted ways with Wikipedia in 2002 over what he calls " disagreements about editorial and management policy " - tells
The Reg that he filed his report through the FBI 's website .
" I believe Wikimedia Commons ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/), owned and hosted by the California - based Wikimedia Foundation , may be knowingly distributing child pornography , " reads his letter to the bureau and his Senators and representatives , before providing specific weblinks , one to a " pedophilia " category that includes a limited number of images .
" I do n't know if there is any more , but I would n't be surprised if there is - the content on the various Wikimedia projects , including Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons and various others , are truly vast . "
Wikimedia general counsel Mike Godwin did not respond to a request for comment .
But he dismisses Sanger 's claims with a public post to the web .
" As is commonly the case when non-lawyers attempt to invoke a statute without adequately researching the relevant law and legal categories , Sanger has confused and conflated a number of legal doctrines , " Godwin begins , saying that 18 USC 1466A is not a child - pornography statute but an obscenity statute .
He points to 18 USC 2252 and 2252A as the statutes covering child pornography .
He also defends the Foundation 's position by citing a court case , Miller v California , that he says emphasizes " the importance of community standards in defining what qualifies as obscenity . "
And yes , he points out that Wikimedia 's projects are not built by the Foundation itself but by web users , citing section 230 of the Communications Decency Act .
" Federal obscenity and child - pornography statutes make similar distinctions [ to Section 230 ] , " he says .
" As Sanger seems to have forgotten , the Wikimedia Foundation does not originate or develop Wikipedia content or Wikimedia Commons content .
This was true in Sanger 's day as well as is in the present day . "
Federal law ( 18 USC 2258A ) also says that if an electronic service provider is made aware of child pornography on its servers , it must report it to the CyberTipline operated by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) .
The law does state that electronic service providers must make a report to the TipLine if they 've been notified of an apparent violation of 18 USC1466A , the law that Sanger cites .
" Just based on the statute , Congress wants you to pick up the phone if you 're made aware of simulated child pornography , " says tech law blogger and Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman .
" The law [ 18 USC 2258A ] does n't mandate that they look for it or that they monitor for it , but if they become aware of it , they have to report it , " Michelle Collins , the vice president of the organization 's exploited children division , tells The Reg .
Justin Fitzsimmons , a senior attorney with the National District Attorneys Association , tells
The Reg that his reading of the statute is that it does apply to the Wikimedia Foundation .
This is not the first time the Wikimedia Foundation has been accused of hosting child pornography .
In May of 2008 , an unfinished story on Wikimedia 's own Wikinews project repeated a report that the FBI was investigating Wikipedia for hosting the image of a mid-1970s record album cover from German heavy metal band the Scorpions .
But the story was removed and the image remained , and in December of that year , the image turned up on a blacklist maintained by the Internet Watch Foundation UK , which meant that access to the site was filtered by at least six British ISPs .
In bizarre fashion , the filtering also resulted in Wikipedia admins banning large swaths of the United Kingdom from editing the site .
The IWF later pulled Wikipedia from its blacklist , and the site continues to host the album cover .
Famously , Larry Sanger founded Wikipedia in tandem with current site figurehead Jimmy " Jimbo " Wales - though , just as famously , Wales prefers to think of himself as the sole founder .
While the pair were working on Nupedia , a Wikipedia predecessor , Sanger sent a seminal email to the project 's staff .
" Let 's make a wiki , " he wrote .
" No , this is not an indecent proposal .
It 's an idea to add a little feature to Nupedia .
Jimmy
Wales thinks that many people might find the idea objectionable , but I think not . "
He now runs Citizendium.org , an online encyclopedia that does not allow anonymous editing and takes greater pains to avoid conflicts of interest , and WatchKnow.org , a teacher - edited non-profit directory of preK - 12 educational videos .
Sanger tells us he reported the Wikimedia Commons images to FBI reluctantly , but believes he ultimately did the right thing .
" If I do n't report this - and it 's been up for years , apparently - who will ?
As the co-founder of the project , I believe I have a special personal obligation to rein in egregious wrongdoing when I see it .
Or at least try , " he says .
" It bothers me that something I helped start has come to this . " ®
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) -
It would make a good gag for a comedy if it were n’t actually true : thieves have broken into a Dutch prison to steal the inmates ’ televisions .
Twice in the last six weeks , burglars broke into a minimum - security prison and stole TVs from cells while prisoners were on weekend furloughs , a spokesman for the justice ministry said on Wednesday .
The prison , in the town of Hoorn 42 km ( 26 miles ) northeast of Amsterdam , is for inmates near the end of their sentences .
The facility is what the Dutch government calls a “ very modestly protected environment , ” where prisoners transition back into society .
They are typically allowed weekend leave , which is when the burglars decided to take advantage .
The thefts happened on two separate weekends about a month apart in March and April .
The ministry spokesman said it has still not been able to confirm how the burglars gained access .
A spokeswoman for the public prosecutor ’s office in the region confirmed only that a break - in at the prison had been reported to police and added that no arrests had yet been made .

CNN Fails to Stop Fall in Ratings – from The New York Times
CNN continued what has become a precipitous decline in ratings for its prime - time programs in the first quarter of 2010 , with its main hosts losing almost half their viewers in a year .
The trend in news ratings for the first three months of this year is all up for one network , the Fox News Channel , which enjoyed its best quarter ever in ratings , and down for both MSNBC and CNN .
CNN had a slightly worse quarter in the fourth quarter of 2009 , but the last three months have included compelling news events , like the earthquake in Haiti and the battle over health care , and CNN , which emphasizes its hard news coverage , was apparently unable to benefit .

On St. Patrick 's Day — Wednesday , March 17 — millions of people will don green and celebrate the Irish with parades , good cheer , and perhaps a pint of beer .
But few St. Patrick 's
Day revelers have a clue about St. Patrick , the man , according to the author of St. Patrick of Ireland : A Biography .
" The modern celebration of St. Patrick 's Day really has almost nothing to do with the real man , " said classics professor Philip Freeman of Luther College in Iowa .
Who Was the Man Behind St. Patrick 's Day ?
The real St. Patrick was n't even Irish .
He was born in Britain around A.D. 390 to an aristocratic Christian family with a townhouse , a country villa , and plenty of slaves .
What 's more , Patrick professed no interest in Christianity as a young boy , Freeman noted .
At 16 , Patrick 's world turned .
He was kidnapped and sent overseas to tend sheep as a slave in the chilly , mountainous countryside of Ireland for seven years .
" It was just horrible for him , " Freeman said .
" But he got a religious conversion while he was there and became a very deeply believing Christian . "
St. Patrick 's Disembodied Voices
According to folklore , a voice came to Patrick in his dreams , telling him to escape .
He found passage on a pirate ship back to Britain , where he was reunited with his family .
The voice then told him to go back to Ireland .
" He gets ordained as a priest from a bishop and goes back and spends the rest of his life trying to convert the Irish to Christianity , " Freeman said .
Patrick 's work in Ireland was tough — he was constantly beaten by thugs , harassed by the Irish royalty , and admonished by his British superiors .
After he died on March 17 , 461 , Patrick was largely forgotten .
But slowly , mythology grew up around Patrick .
Centuries later he was honored as the patron saint of Ireland , Freeman noted .
2010 St. Patrick 's Day Shamrock Shortage
According to St. Patrick 's
Day lore , Patrick used the three leaves of a shamrock to explain the holy trinity : the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit .
Today , St. Patrick 's
Day revelers wear a shamrock out of tradition .
But people in Ireland hoping to wear an authentic shamrock may be out of luck this year .
" We have had a long and hard winter , which is still not fully over , " John Parnell , a botanist at Trinity College Dublin , noted via e-mail .
The growing season has also been affected , he said .
For instance , Trifolium dubium , the wild - growing , three - leaf clover that some botanists consider the official shamrock , is in short supply , according to media reports .
" It 's quite possible that the hard winter has hit this species ' abundance , as it's an annual which germinates in the spring , " Parnell said .
To make up for the shortfall , many sellers are resorting to other three - leaf clovers , such as the perennials Trifolium repens and Medicago lupulina .
According to the Irish Times , these plants are " bogus shamrocks . "
Parnell agreed that Trifolium dubium is the most commonly used shamrock today , which lends credence to the claims of authenticity .
However , he added , the custom of wearing a shamrock dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries , and " I know of no evidence to say what people then used . "
" I think the argument on authenticity is purely academic — basically I 'd guess they used anything cloverlike then . "
What 's more , botanists say there 's nothing uniquely Irish about shamrocks .
Most species can be found throughout Europe .
As for whether or not the U.K.'s cold winter is a sign of climate change , the answers is probably not , experts say .
" The current cold weather in the U.K. is part of the normal regional variations that take place in the winter season , " the U.K. 's Met Office said in a statement .
" It does n't tell us anything about climate change , which has to be looked at in a global context and over longer periods of time . "
No Snakes in Ireland
Another St. Patrick myth is the claim that he banished snakes from Ireland .
It 's true no snakes exist on the island today , Freeman said .
But they never did .
Ireland , after all , is surrounded by icy ocean waters — much too cold to allow snakes to migrate from Britain or anywhere else .
But since snakes often represent evil in literature , " when Patrick drives the snakes out of Ireland , it is symbolically saying he drove the old , evil , pagan ways out of Ireland [ and ] brought in a new age , " Freeman said .
The snakes myth and others — such as Patrick using three - leafed shamrocks to explain the Holy Trinity ( Father , Son , and Holy Ghost ) — were likely spread by well - meaning monks centuries after St. Patrick 's death , Freeman said .
St. Patrick 's Day : Made in America ?
Until the 1970s , St. Patrick 's Day in Ireland was a minor religious holiday .
A priest would acknowledge the feast day , and families would celebrate with a big meal , but that was about it .
" St. Patrick 's Day was basically invented in America by Irish - Americans , " Freeman said .
Timothy Meagher is an expert on Irish - American history at Catholic University in Washington , D.C .
He said Irish charitable organizations originally celebrated St. Patrick 's Day with banquets in places such as Boston , Massachusetts ; Savannah , Georgia ; and Charleston , South Carolina .
Eighteenth - century Irish soldiers fighting with the British in the U.S. Revolutionary War held the first St. Patrick 's Day parades .
Some soldiers , for example , marched through New York City in 1762 to reconnect with their Irish roots .
Other parades followed in the years and decades after , including well - known celebrations in Boston , Philadelphia , and Chicago , primarily for flourishing Irish immigrant communities .
" It becomes a way to honor the saint but also to confirm ethnic identity and to create bonds of solidarity , " Meagher said .
Wearing Green , Dyeing River Green on St. Patrick's Day
Sometime in the 19th century , as St. Patrick 's Day parades were flourishing , wearing the color green became a show of commitment to Ireland , Meagher said .
In 1962 the show of solidarity took a spectacular turn in Chicago when the city decided to dye a portion of the Chicago River green .
The tradition started when parade organizer Steve Bailey , head of a plumbers ' union , noticed how a dye used to detect river pollution had stained a colleague 's overalls a brilliant green , according to greenchicagoriver.com .
Why not , Bailey thought , turn the river green on St. Patrick 's Day ?
So began the tradition .
The environmental impact of the dye is minimal compared with sources of pollution such as bacteria from sewage - treatment plants , said Margaret Frisbie , the executive director of the advocacy group Friends of the Chicago River .
Her group focuses instead on turning the Chicago River into a welcoming habitat full of fish , herons , turtles , and beavers .
If the river becomes a wildlife haven , the thinking goes , Chicagoans wo n't want to dye their river green .
" Our hope is that , as the river continues to improve , ultimately people can get excited about celebrating St. Patrick 's Day different ways , " she said .
Pint of Guinness on St. Patrick's Day
On any given day 5.5 million pints of Guinness , the famous Irish stout brand , are consumed around the world .
But on St. Patrick 's Day , that number more than doubles to 13 million pints , said Beth Davies Ryan , global corporate relations director of Guinness .
" Historically speaking , a lot of Irish immigrants came to the United States and brought with them lots of customs and traditions , one of them being Guinness , " she said .
Today , the U.S. tradition of St. Patrick 's Day parades , packed pubs , and green silliness has invaded Ireland with full force , noted Freeman , the classics professor .
The country , he noted , figured out the popularity of St. Patrick 's Day was a good way to boost spring tourism .
Israeli structural biologist Michal Sharon has made some bold decisions in her young scientific career .
After productively using nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy to study protein structure during a Ph.D. , she switched to structural mass spectrometry for her postdoc in the United Kingdom .
Upon taking a tenure - track position at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot 3 years ago , she set out to create the first structural mass spectrometry lab in Israel .
And when she wrote the proposal that won a European Research Council starting grant , she let her scientific ambition run free , asking herself , " What will I want to investigate ... if money was not a concern ? "
Sharon " would go home to make dinner and then if necessary and things were going well return to the lab after the children were in bed , " writes her postdoctoral adviser Carol Robinson .
Sharon believes that many young women with families lack confidence in their abilities -- including their ability to couple a full commitment to science with family life .
They " do n't know if they are capable of leading a group [ or ] if they will be able to combine family and career , " she says .
Sharon -- who had two children before she finished her Ph.D. and has since added a third -- admits that she herself has experienced self - doubt .
But time , success , a supportive husband , and excellent role models have encouraged her to be ambitious in her science and at home .
" I do n't think that science should be done as the result of a sacrifice , " she says .
A Ph.D. and children
Sharon obtained a B.Sc. degree in chemistry from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1996 .
While doing a lab rotation in the lab of Jacob Anglister during the first year of her M.Sc. degree at the Weizmann Institute , " I discovered that I 'm attracted by technology and biophysical methods and that I enjoyed collecting data and then putting the small pieces of information together [ like ] a puzzle , " Sharon says .
Sharon joined Anglister 's lab for her master 's project and Ph.D. , studying the three - dimensional structure of a region in the HIV - 1 protein envelope that helps the virus enter human cells .
Sharon used molecular biology methods to express and purify the virus peptide and NMR spectroscopy to analyze its structure as it is bound to neutralizing human antibodies .
She wrote six papers describing the work .
" The structure led us to propose a mechanism for the receptor selectivity of the HIV virus " with potential therapeutic applications , she says .
Sharon had a son at the beginning of the second year of her Ph.D. and a daughter 2.5 years later .
" My Ph.D. was ... something like half a year longer " because of maternity leaves , she says , but " I do n't feel [ in the ] end that it stopped me at any stage . "
She finished the degree in the summer of 2003 .
Her key to balancing work and family during graduate school , she says , was good time management .
She left work earlier than she did before she had children , but she made up for the lost time by reading papers and writing e-mails after the children were asleep , by staying longer some days , and by coming into the lab on weekends .
She learned to value every minute of the work day .
" I write down a plan [ of ] what I need to do in the following week , and then I divide it [ into ] what should be done in each day . "
It 's " not the number of hours you are in the lab , but ... the work that is done , " she says .
A family experience abroad
" In Israel , if you want to have your independent career , you have to do your postdoc abroad , " she says .
" I felt it was quite a big decision to ... take my family with me and to move to another country . "
Despite her obvious ability , she considered working in someone else 's lab rather than pursuing a lab of her own .
Hadassa Degani , a female scientist who had been sitting on her Ph.D. committee , noticed " her hesitations whether to pursue an academic career , " Degani writes in an e-mail .
" At that stage she needed encouragement and support and reassurance of her high qualifications . "
Degani 's input was important in her decision to carry on with a postdoc abroad , Sharon says .
But most important was " a very supportive husband that really encouraged me all along ... [ and ] believes in me and my ability . "
Sharon 's husband , who manages adult education programs in the government sector , quit his job in Israel so that the family could move overseas .
Sharon went to work at the University of Cambridge in the lab of Carol Robinson ( now at the University of Oxford ) , who had pioneered new structural mass spectrometry methods that made it possible to study huge protein complexes .
The family was assisted in the move by Cambridge 's Israeli community .
" We had many phone calls , and they gave us a lot of advice , so our landing was very soft , " Sharon says .
In Robinson 's lab , Sharon studied protein - protein interactions within proteasomes , large multiprotein complexes that clear cells of unwanted proteins by degrading them into small peptide fragments .
" I was very fortunate during that period to have access to prototype instruments that were modified specifically for these needs , " Sharon says .
" It was very exciting because we could actually explore the capabilities and the limitations and applications " of the new approaches .
Sharon and her husband took turns dropping the children off at school .
After school , the children went to a club .
" I was working until 5:30 and then of course we had some time together and dinner together ... and when they went to sleep , I continued to do the things that I needed to do , " Sharon says .
Robinson writes in an e-mail that Sharon " would go home to make dinner and then if necessary and things were going well return to the lab after the children were in bed .
This I recognised as something that I had done when my 3 children were small and believe it demonstrates a strong will to succeed . "
Robinson , Sharon says , was " beyond being a ... perfect role model . "
She " was always very supportive , motivating , inspiring , and I learned a lot from her . "
Sharon also attended a professional development course organized by the University of Cambridge for female graduate students and postdocs and built a small support network .
Once in the United Kingdom , Sharon soon matured , Degani says , " gaining full confidence in her intellectual and scientific abilities " and demonstrating her determination to be a scientist .
" She embarked into a new field and was able to gain leadership in this field very fast . "
By the time Sharon finished her postdoc , in 2006 , she had published 15 more papers , seven as first author .
She had secured a postdoctoral fellowship from the European Molecular Biology Organization , a Wingate Scholarship , and a Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship from the Royal Society , which allowed her to develop an independent line of research in Robinson 's lab .
Sharon had her third child and took an 18 - week maternity leave , after which her mother - in - law came from Israel to help with childcare .
Sharon found a tenure - track position in Israel , and the family moved back there .
Science and family at home
Since 2007 , Sharon has been a senior lecturer in the Department of Biological Chemistry at the Weizmann Institute .
Today her lab counts four Ph.D. students , three postdocs , one technician , and a research associate .
She shares two postdocs with another lab .
She continues studying multiprotein complexes involved in the protein degradation pathway , focusing on how their assembly and architecture affect their function .
" We combine a biological lab that includes molecular biology and biochemistry with the analytical chemistry using mass spectrometry , " Sharon says .
Setting up the lab presented a double technical challenge .
First , the protein complexes she studies are large and dynamic , have transient interactions , and are present in low numbers within cells , all of which makes them hard to isolate in sufficient quantity and purity , Sharon says .
The second challenge was getting the structural mass spectrometry equipment running .
Leading a lab and raising children share many similarities , Sharon says .
" Often , things I 'm thinking about in relation to my work are similar to the things I think in relation to my kids , " like finding the correct balance between allowing them independence and providing close mentoring .
The most rewarding part of her job is discovering " one day that [ students ] have become independent and often they know things more than you .
...
It 's like having your child start walking . "
" Of course , it [ is ] a challenge to balance a career and children , " Sharon says .
It 's made easier by her supportive husband , a child - care provider , and a part - time house cleaner .
One issue many women scientists have to deal with is a constant feeling of guilt , Sharon says .
" If you 're not enough at work , you feel guilty about your work .
If you 're not enough with the children , you have guilt , " too , she says .
The most important thing , she says , is to maintain a sense of perspective .
" Generally , we should be more patient and ... forgive ourselves and accept that there will be times " when the focus is on work and times where the balance swings toward family .
Having a family helps her maintain that equanimity , she says .
" If something does n't go well in the lab , at the end of the day , you come back home [ and ] you have your children . "

( CNN ) --
Fresh on the heels of one budget airline announcing that it will ask passengers to pay extra to bring carry - on bags on board , another is considering charging them for using the lavatory .
Ryanair , which is based in Dublin , Ireland , and bills itself as " Europe 's first and largest low fares airline , " is mulling a plan that would require travelers to pay either 1 euro or 1 British pound ( about $ 1.33 or $ 1.52 ) for using the bathroom on flights lasting one hour or less .
The plan , titled " Ryanair Cost Saving Proposal , " was published in the airline 's inflight magazine .
The carrier said it is working with Boeing to develop a coin - operated door release so that when nature calls , passengers would need to deposit the change before being able to use the facilities .
The idea is to encourage people to use restrooms in airport terminals before boarding , Ryanair said .
If the airline were to proceed , the changes would be at least 12 to 18 months away .
As part of the plan , the airline is also considering removing two of the three lavatories on some of its planes so it could squeeze in up to six extra seats .
The move would help reduce fares by at least 5 percent , Ryanair said .
It 's not the first time the airline has broached the subject of a toilet fee .
CEO Michael O'Leary told the BBC in February 2009 that he was considering the charge .
How would it fly with passengers ?
One hint of how Americans might feel about it may come from an informal poll posted on TripAdvisor.com last summer in which one - fifth of the respondents said they would fly on an airline that charged a fee to access the bathroom ; 78 percent said they would not .
About 5,300 people answered the online survey question .
But the idea may be less shocking to travelers in Europe , where it 's not unusual to pay a small fee to use a public restroom .
Meanwhile , Ryanair announced Tuesday that it 's raising its checked luggage fee from 15 euros to 20 euros per bag for the peak vacation months of July and August .
" Ryanair is determined to incentivise passengers to travel light this summer , " spokesman Stephen McNamara said in a statement .
The airline urged its passengers to avoid the fees by bringing carry - on bags only .
Ryanair is already well - known for its fees and is up - front about them on its
Web site , which details charges for everything from online check - in to traveling with infants .
Customers have n't balked ; in fact , Ryanair 's passenger traffic grew 13 percent last month compared to the same time last year , the airline reported .
Low - cost carriers have embraced the concept of a la carte pricing , or keeping base fares at rock bottom levels while charging passengers for any extra services .
On Tuesday , Florida - based Spirit Airlines announced that it will charge its customers $ 20 to $ 45 for items they place in the overhead bins .

Scientists have made synthetic ‘ sea shells ’ from a mixture of chalk and polystyrene cups – and produced a tough new material that could make our homes and offices more durable .
A team of materials scientists and chemists have taken inspiration from sea shells found on the beach to create a composite material from dissimilar ‘ ingredients ’ .
Their technique could be used to make ceramics with high resistance to cracking – which could in turn be used in crack - resistant building materials and bone replacements .
Writing in the journal Advanced Materials , scientists from The University of Manchester and The University of Leeds report that they have successfully reinforced calcium carbonate , or chalk , with polystyrene particles that are used to make drinks cups .
They have developed an effective method of combining calcite crystals with polystyrene particles – and have found this makes the material more ductile compared to its original brittle form .
They report that the polystyrene also acts as a toughening agent , assisting the prevention of the growth of cracks .
Scientists also observed that when the reinforced material cracked , the polymer lengthened within the cracks – a well - known mechanism for absorbing energy and enhancing toughness .
Researchers say their method allows the properties of the new material to be tweaked by selecting particles of different shapes , sizes and composition .
Dr Stephen Eichhorn from The School of Materials at The University of Manchester , said : “ The mechanical properties of shells can rival those of man-made ceramics , which are engineered at high temperatures and pressures .
Their construction helps to distribute stress over the structure and control the spread of cracks .
“ Calcium carbonate is the main ingredient of chalk , which is very brittle and breaks easily when force is applied .
But shells are strong and resistant to fracturing , and this is because the calcium carbonate is combined with proteins which bind the crystals together , like bricks in a wall , to make the material stronger and sometimes tougher .
“ We have replicated nature ’s addition of proteins using polystyrene , to create a strong shell - like structure with similar properties to those seen in nature .
“ Further research and testing is still needed but our research potentially offers a straightforward method of engineering new and tough chalk - based composite materials with a wide range of useful applications . ”
The research was funded by grants from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) and was conducted in collaboration with Professor Fiona Meldrum in the School of Chemistry at the University of Leeds .

( Natural cures for arthritis )
Cardiovascular Problems
Fish oil helps to maintain a healthy cardiovascular system , and helps in treating those with cardiovascular disease .
The Omega - 3 acids help to regulate cholesterol in the body when taken regularly .
Neurodegenerative Diseases
Recent studies from Louisiana State University have shown that fish oil can help protect the brain from Alzheimer ’s disease , and other cognitive problems .
Fish oil helps to get rid of , and reduce formation of beta - amyloid plaque , which in a sense “ clogs up ” the brain in Alzheimer ’s patients .
Other diseases such as Parkinson ’s disease , seems to also be helped and prevented by fish oil .
Dr. Nicolas Bazan , Director of the Neuroscience Center of Excellence has released findings that fish oil helps by preventing a “ misfolding ” of a specific protein , which is caused by gene mutation in Huntington ’s and Parkinson ’s disease .
The best way to add fish oil to your diet is by adding more fish .
The more oily fish you consume , the more omega - 3 acids you have in your body .
It is difficult to get the recommended amounts of fish oil buy eating habits alone , however , so many fish oil supplements have been made available in the form of pill or liquid drops .

A new film about Jimi Hendrix is set to be made called Slide .
The drama will document Hendrix ‘s legendary “ lost weekend ” in September 1969 , where he was apparently the subject of a hoax kidnapping , orchestrated by his manager .
“ While we have to be speculative because no definitive version of the event exists , this takes it out of the realm of fiction for me , ” the films writer and director R H Greene told TwentyFourBit.com .

“ It ’s part of Jimi ‘s story , and I think it offers an opportunity to show him fully but from a unique angle .
That was my aim in writing it , and that ’s going to be my aim in making it . ”
While the actor who will play Hendrix is yet - to - be- announced , the casting process is underway and the film is set to go into production early next year .
Meanwhile , live recordings from Hendrix ’s 1967 and 1968 shows in Paris and Ottawa will be released on January 25 .
Opinions on the best sign for PIZZA are as varied as opinions on who makes the best pizza in town and what toppings are the most delicious .
The fact is there are several popular variations for this sign .
Depending on where you live a particular variation may be more popular than other variations .
If someone does n't like your variation , do what I do ... throw some pizza crust at him or her .
Um ... wait , what I meant to say is ask what variation they use .
After a while you will get a feel for what works in your area .
" Pizza ?
You like what kind ? "
Check with your local Deaf for the sign for " pizza " for your area .
If you are taking a class , remember this :
Your local instructor gives the grade , not me .
Here is a variation of pizza that is popular in Sacramento and elsewhere .
The sign looks as if you are shoving a piece of pizza in your mouth .
( Use a repeated movement ) .
Personally , I do n't like it because it is a very awkward sign to produce , but many people in my area are adamant that it is the " right " sign to use .
PIZZA :
Let 's get a side view on that so you can see the handshape better .
Remember , use a repeated movement .
PIZZA " Za ! " ( variation )
Another way to sign pizza ( that seems to be becoming more and more popular ) is to use the " double z " + " a " method .
Make a bent " v " handshape and then draw a " double z " in the air and end with an " a " handshape .
Like spelling " zza . "
My wife prefers this sign :
Here are the starting and ending handshapes :
Let 's take a close look at that " double z " movement so you can see the details .
Remember to end with an " A "
Pizza ( " P " variation )
Here is a highly recognizable sign that is easy to remember , and used widely .
You use a " P " handshape to draw a " Z " in the air .
The tip of the index finger is pointing toward the person to whom you are signing .
( In most sign language dictionaries , unless it says or shows otherwise , you can assume the sign points toward the watcher . )
Note : Some people might consider this to be an " English - like sign . "
Some people do n't even like pizza either .
No , really , I 'm serious .
Come on now do n't look at me like that !
I 'm not making this stuff up !
PIZZA : Double Z No " A " version :
A Deaf internet user wrote :
<< " I did n't see the sign for pizza that I 'm familiar with .
According to Martin Sternberg 's dictionary you can sign pizza by using the double Z and draw a Z in the air -- but it does n't end with " A " .
I use this one all the time . >>
Response :
Right on !
I love the double z moving in a " z pattern " ( with no " A " ) version of the sign for pizza .
I actually used to do the sign that way and then certain local individuals poked fun at me .
They said it looked like I was doing the sign for SNAKE .
Of course , being the sensitive soul that I am , my feelings were hurt .
I immediately stopped using that version , and I went to the nearest local pizza joint to console myself by eating 3 / 4 of a large pizza .
Variation 4
This is how currently I personally tend to do the sign " PIZZA . "
Spell out the word p - i - z - z - a very quickly .
For the two " z " letters you do a " double - z " movement that uses a " v " ( or bent " v " ) handshape and trace a " z " in the air .
I do it really fast and it takes about one - half of a second ( or less ) for whole sign .

Dr. Vicars ,
Around 1986 , in Oregon , I first learned the sign for pizza as :
Red + CL " large round flat surface " ( 2H , L bent ) .
My teacher was Anna Rinaldi , a Deaf woman .
I believe she was from the eastern part of the U.S .
Perhaps this is an old sign ?

Hi Lynne ,
Neat !
I 'd call that a " classifier " version of the sign for PIZZA .
The bent " L " hands would be good for showing the size of a pizza .
I just looked in some of my older sign language dictionaries and would you believe the sign for pizza is n't even listed ?!
So it is understandable that instructors would use a wide variety of combinations of signs and classifiers to express the concept .

I recently began teaching ASL I & II at the high school level .
I began learning sign some time ago ( late 70s , early 80s ) .
I took my classes at Santa Ana College under Herb Terreri ( recently retired after around 30 years ... )
Anyways , when I learned the sign for " pizza " I learned it as open - 5 w/ crooked fingers , palm up , touching the heal of the hand to the side of the chin ( like you 're eating a piece of pizza ) . (*)
My second level students learned the " double z " way [ incorrectly ] which I 'd never seen ( been out of touch for a bit , learning Spanish ) .
My point is , when they sign it , the sign looks like the sign for " snake " , not the way you demonstrate it ( side - to - side ) .
I 've also seen the initialized " P " triangled in the palm of the non -dominant hand .
I was just curious if you 'd ever seen the way I learned pizza (* ) ?
Thank you for your time !
Cynthia Kaniski ( name sign ... " C " like " twin " )
Hello Cynthia ,
Is this what you are describing ?
I have n't seen the method you describe .
Well , I maybe , sort of , in the back of my brain remember seeing it once .
But for a second opinion I asked my wife , Belinda , and she has n't seen it either .
( That does n't mean it is n't an " okay " sign , it just means it just is n't in much circulation . )
I had a hard time getting my wrist to bend like that and I reckon others might have the same problem .
Here in Sacramento ( where I 'm writing from ) there is a related version that seems to be quite popular .
That version uses a modified - bent " b " palm up near the mouth as if representing a slice of pizza .
The " b " is actually upside down , with the fingers pointing toward your mouth .
To make it work you have to turn your wrist at a bit of a weird angle , thus the sign is somewhat awkward .
I 'll see if I can do a picture of it and post it within a day or two to my " pizza " page .
I know what you mean about students " mis-learning " the double - z version of the sign .
Like you , I noticed a few students were signing " snake " instead of pizza .
That simply wo n't do .
Bill
Bill ,
Wow !
That looked great !
The picture you showed asking if that 's what I meant was exact !
It may be an old sign , my twin sister signs it the same way .
We started learning sign ages ago , and took college level sign classes in the mid-late 80's .
Thanks so much for your help !...
Cynthia

Hi !
I was reading the dictionary entry for " pizza " , and noticed , that among all the variations , the one I learned from my ASL teacher ( a Deaf lady ) in Oregon is n't there !
It was a motion like a palm - up 5 hand , but with the fingers angled slightly upward , held upward and to the side with a quick twist - like throwing pizza dough in the air :-) .
I wonder how many variations there really are ?

Awesome site , by the way :-)

Just 10 years ago , Superior Court Judge Barbara Rouse overturned a ban on tattooing that had been in effect in Massachusetts since the 1960s .
“ Tattooing is an ancient art form which has been practiced in virtually every culture , ’’ she wrote in her judgment .
Tattoos “ demonstrate commitment to other persons , to institutions , to religious beliefs , and to political and personal beliefs . ’’

I know , I know .
Odd question coming from a team that houses a guy that ended another player 's career and another player that consistently leaves his feet on checks .
Last night seemingly pushed my thought process over the edge .
I 'll openly admit that Pittsburgh is my # 2 team in the NHL .
They have been since I was a kid and I can even remember the days of Ken Wregget and Stu Barnes .
That being said , they are a VERY distant 2 in my book and that gap opened up a bit wider .
Nevertheless , I often turned a blind eye to what they do sometimes ( just like I do with the Wings at times ) but the repeated cross-checking by the Kid was the last I could stand .
I know it 's hockey and that rough stuff happens .
People get crosschecked , slashed , punched all the time .
But you do n't have to be a prick about it .
The way they conduct themselves sometimes though just makes it very hard to respect them .
There 's a world of difference between playing hard and playing dirty .
Let 's go to school ...
Example 1 :
Completely unnecessary hack on Zetterberg ( go figure ) that easily could have ended the playoffs for Zetterberg if it was a little higher .
Example 2 :
Max Talbot blatantly slashes the already injured foot of Pavel Datsyuk .
Talbot claims he was going for the puck ... which was about 5 feet away from Datsyuk .
Example 3 :
Gary Roberts punches Franzen in the head during the middle of a play .
Franzen had just returned from a head injury and it was clear Roberts was targeting the head .
Example 4 :
Complete cheap shot at a throat , not good .
Example 5 :
Well .
I do n't need to open the Matt Cooke book do I ? Marc Savard , Artem Anisimov , Bogosian ...
I 'm all for big clean hits or pushing and shoving when it 's warranted , but when you have guys that do crap like this , it gets ridiculous .
" If you 'd have asked me then , I would have described myself as done for .
As alone and forever a victim .
I could not accept this chapter of my life .
I do n't believe in abortion to be a safe haven .
Exploring other options , I started to work with Kirsh & Kirsh .
I found this instantly made me more enlightened , comfortable , and confident about my adoption plan .
Kirsh & Kirsh would n't leave me hanging without any services , support and wellbeing .
I was blessed to be a vessel for a wonderful family .
With a great community , love and future I am healing because I made the right choice for me , and my child .
Kirsh & Kirsh , are trusted hard working professionals and I also consider them friends .
Thank you . ” - Samantha W .
“ Kirsh & Kirsh are remarkable at what they do .
I suppose you can say they make you feel part of the family instead of a file number .
I highly praise Grant Kirsh for his outstanding generosity and humble approach to my sister 's case .
She was about 5 months along and unable to take care of her child .
Grant Kirsh came to her rescue and explained everything in detail .
He gave us his cell phone number and never was too busy to stay in touch .
He made my sister a # 1 priority - talk about excellent service !!!
Kirsh & Kirsh is the way to go .
Grant ensured the baby left the hospital in the arms of his new mamma and daddy instead of a foster care .
I say that there is no other agency or attorney to look for if you are considering adoption .
If you are looking for outstanding service , true care , uncountable sincerity and unbelievable partnership Kirsh & Kirsh Adoption is the way to go !!!!!! ” - Jenna M..
“ They say there is nothing stronger than a mother 's love .
That being said , what could be harder than the reality that one cannot provide a life for her child ?
In one of the most painful situations in my life I was faced with this reality ; I simply could not have another baby in my life .
I felt lost , with no idea of what to do to ensure that my baby could experience the life everyone deserves .
Shortly into my pregnancy , I knew that I had to find an adoptive family for my child .
I was referred to Kirsh & Kirsh by a friend , and nothing better could possibly have happened .
I was treated graciously , with care and consideration , and I soon found the perfect family to adopt my daughter .
My experience with Kirsh & Kirsh was beautiful and uplifting , during one of the hardest times in my life .
Simple words could n't possibly express my gratitude for these gentlemen and their practice , and everything they have done for countless women and families . ”
- Lindsey B .
" I really appreciate everything Grant Kirsh and everyone else at Kirsh & Kirsh have done for me .
They have helped me through two adoptions , and my experience with them has been wonderful !
They have been there for me in every way , by offering counseling and helping with every detail as far as any questions or concerns I might have .
Kirsh & Kirsh has made the process of adoption , worry free , I trust Grant Kirsh and Kirsh & Kirsh completely .
I would and have recommend other women who are pregnant and considering adoption to Kirsh & Kirsh .
If I ever have to go through with an adoption there 's no other law firm , hands down , I would go through , or any other lawyer I would even consider other than Grant Kirsh .
I 'm very pleased with working with them , and they have been a blessing with the whole process .
I can't thank Grant enough for everything he has done for me and he 's always been there for me and came through for me , with every question or request I 've asked from him and his firm .
I can't say thank you enough to him and his firm ! ! ” - Rachel A .
" Kirsh and Kirsh did an amazing job helping me through the adoption process .
It was a very emotional time for me and they did everything they possibly could to make sure I was okay .
They are very good at what they do as far as explaining everything in an understandable way , and making it less stressful and emotional than it needs to be .
I knew I could trust them to find my baby the best home possible and that 's exactly what they did .
They care about the women they work with on a personal level .
They strived to learn more about my family and I so that I could make the right decision .
I am confident in saying that they are a huge reason today why I know I made the best decision for my child and I would definitely recommend them to anyone needed this type of service and support .
Thank you Kirsh and Kirsh . ” - Lisa H .
" At 21 it 's hard to say you 're truly ready to take on the full responsibility of a child while trying to establish yourself as a an adult , and I was able to find my answers with Kirsh and Kirsh .
I found the parents I wanted to adopt through the vast profiles that were put together , and the assurance that all received extensive background checks put my mind at ease as I read several profiles .
I chose an open adoption and was able to develop a beautiful relationship with the couple I chose .
I cannot imagine a better adoption story than the one Kirsh and Kirsh helped me write through my pregnancy .
Grant Kirsh and the team created such a level of comfort throughout my experience , between the extensive profiling of all the eager couples and the caring nature of the Kirsh team , my pregnancy became a treasured time in my life . ” - Chelsey L .
" Kirsh and Kirsh is the reason I had such a stress free pregnancy .
They were always just a text or phone call away and I never felt alone .
They checked in on me and really made it to where I had a whole place of friends not far away .
Grant Kirsh always gave me such great advice and I could literally come to him at any time , day or night .
It was like working with a family and they got me through the toughest , yet so rewarding , choice I have ever made .
There 's not anyone better that I would recommend going through for adoption .
Everyone there is just so wonderful and caring .
I would choose them again in a heartbeat . ” - Janelle F .

Editors ' note : America 's 300 million - plus people are declaring their identity in the 2010 census .
This piece is part of a special series on CNN.com in which people describe how they see their own identity .
Terence Tao won a Fields Medal in 2006 and was named a MacArthur fellow the same year .
He is a professor of mathematics at UCLA , where he holds the James and Carol Collins Chair in the College of Letters and Science .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
When I was a child in Adelaide , Australia , I loved games with clear , unambiguous rules ; puzzles that were tough but fair ; and the clean , abstract , simplicity of numbers and symbols .
So it is perhaps not surprising that I have been drawn to mathematics for as long as I can remember .
For much of my childhood , playing with mathematical problems , equations and facts was one of my favorite activities ; I even went so far as to compete in international high school mathematics competitions , racing to solve tricky sets of problems in a few hours .
I still remember the realization in college at Flinders University in Australia that mathematics was not just an abstract game of symbols , but could be used as a tool to analyze and understand the modern world .
Why are some statistics trustworthy and some not ?
Why are some investment strategies sound , and others risky ?
How come a computer can search the entire internet for you in a matter of seconds , but cannot read a printed word if it is even just slightly distorted or blurred ?
How come our modern array of satellites can tell millions of drivers their location with amazing accuracy , but cannot correctly predict the weather a fortnight into the future ?
Knowledge of mathematics can answer these questions , and make the world comprehensible and orderly rather than mysterious and capricious .
Once I saw the power of this knowledge , and the satisfying feeling when everything " clicks " and one sees a confusing problem resolve itself into a clear solution , I was hooked for life .
I wanted to use mathematics to explore and understand as much of the world as I could .
In 1992 , when I was 16 , I moved to the United States to start working on my Ph.D. at Princeton University in New Jersey .
I alternated my time between Australia and the United States for many years , but by 1999 I had a permanent job in the United States , on the faculty of UCLA 's Department of Mathematics .
By 2002 , I was married to an American -- we were married in the United States -- and last year I became a U.S. citizen ( while retaining Australian citizenship ) .
Of course , my life is more than just my work .
I am a husband and a father and a proud citizen of two countries ; my homeland of Australia and my adopted country here in the United States .
I identify with them both .
I enjoy a good meal , a good vacation or a good movie , much as anyone else would .
But mathematics is both my profession and my hobby , and the place where it seems I am best able to make a contribution ; so if I had to answer the question " Who am I ? " I would have to say , " a mathematician . "

A legal challenge against controversial plans to carry out a mass cull of badgers in Wales in an attempt to control bovine TB was rejected by a judge today .
The Badger Trust , supported by the rock star Brian May , had aimed to overturn an order by the Welsh assembly government for the cull to take place but a judge dismissed the charity 's arguments .
May said he was disappointed but warned the battle would continue .
" This is a disappointment , of course , " the Queen guitarist said .
" But not just for thousands of innocent badgers .
The irony is that it is ultimately a tragedy for farmers , too – the very farmers who have been pushing for badgers to be culled .
" The decision to cull cannot lead to any significant long - term gain in the fight against bovine TB , even with the complete extermination of our native badgers .
" I believe all this will be seen in a few years time for what it is … a tragic wrong turn which did nothing to solve the problem of TB in cattle .
" For the sake of all involved , we will not be giving up the fight for what is right .
We are taking advice on appealing at a higher level . "
The Welsh rural affairs minister , Elin Jones , welcomed the court 's decision .
" Bovine TB is one of the biggest problems facing cattle farmers across Wales , and we have to tackle all sources of the disease .
We are dealing with an epidemic that has serious consequences for us all and we must stamp it out .
" Over the past three years , with advice from experts , we have put in place a comprehensive programme to eradicate TB across Wales .
This includes more testing of cattle , identifying and getting rid of the disease in cattle at an earlier stage and improving on farm practices .
" We need to read and digest this verdict .
In the meantime , we will continue with the preparations in the pilot area . "
The Badger Trust turned to the courts to try to force a judicial review of the Welsh assembly government 's TB eradication order , which allows a cull in parts of west Wales as early as next month .
A two - day hearing was held before Justice Lloyd Jones at the Swansea civil justice centre last month .
Sitting at the Cardiff civil justice centre today , Jones rejected the trust 's claim that the way the decision had been made was unlawful .
The Badger Trust had argued badgers should only be culled if :
• such culling would " eliminate or substantially reduce " the incidence of TB in cattle ;
• such culling is " necessary " to achieve the elimination or substantial reduction in question ;
• there are " no other satisfactory alternative " ways of achieving that elimination / substantial reduction ;
• the harm involved has been properly balanced against ( and justifies ) the potential benefit ;
• and the cull complies with the international Bern convention , which promotes the protection and conservation of wild fauna such as badgers .
He said it was not motorists ’ fault but blamed the town ’s pedestrians , many of whom were not able to look out for themselves as they walked around the town , which is more than 300 miles west of the Romanian capital Bucharest .
WASHINGTON , April 25 ( Reuters ) - Talks to provide Greece with emergency funding are going well and the country will be able to finance its public debt without problems , Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said on Sunday .
“ We are all confident that this will be done in time , and we will be able to continue to finance Greek public debt without any problem , ” he told reporters in Washington after meeting the International Monetary Fund and finance officials .
Asked about investors betting on a default by Greece , Papaconstantinou said : “ All I can say is that they will lose their shirts . ” ( Writing by William Schomberg ; Editing by Padraic Cassidy )

LONDON ( Reuters ) - British - based steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal topped the list of Britain ’s richest people once again as the wealthiest in the country saw their fortunes soar in the last year , the annual Sunday Times Rich List survey said .
The collective wealth of Britain ’s 1,000 most affluent people rose by 30 percent , boosted by the improved economic conditions over the last 12 months , the survey said .
Last year , Britain ’s wealthiest people saw their fortunes hit by the economic downturn , losing a total of 155 billion pounds with the overall number of billionaires falling to 43 from 75 .
This year that number rose to 53 , with the overall worth of those on the list seen at 333.5 billion pounds , a rise of more than 77 billion and the largest in the poll ’s 22 - year history .
Metals magnate Mittal , CEO of ArcelorMittal stayed at the top of the list with his personal fortune more than doubling to 22.45 billion from 10.8 billion .
Russian Roman Abramovich , the Chelsea football club owner who has steel and other investment interests , remained second with a fortune of 7.4 billion pounds .
The richest British - born billionaire , the Duke of Westminster , remained third on the list , with his largely property - based portfolio up four percent to 6.75 billion pounds .
Indian - born Anil Agarwal , chairman of mining group Vedanta Resources Plc was the highest climber on the list , moving to 10th from 60th with his fortune rising almost six - fold to 4.1 billion pounds .
The annual list is based on identifiable wealth , including land , property and other items such as art , racehorses or significant shares in publicly quoted companies , but does not include bank accounts ..
( CNN ) -- Richard
Heene , the man who pulled a hoax by saying his 6 - year - old son was drifting over Colorado in a balloon , must pay $ 36,000 in restitution , a judge has ordered .
As Heene completed his 90 - day sentence with home detention this month , his wife , Mayumi Heene , began serving her 20 - day sentence on weekends , according to a jail official .
Her time is not spent in a jail cell , but on a Saturday and Sunday work detail , a probation official said .
Prosecutors said the couple staged their son's disappearance on October 15 , 2009 , to generate publicity for themselves because they wanted to star in a reality television show .
Richard Heene pleaded guilty in November to a felony count of attempting to influence a public servant , while she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of making a false report .
The judge also sentenced the couple to four years probation .
Richard
Heene initially told authorities that his son , Falcon , was drifting over eastern Colorado in a homemade balloon that had come loose from its moorings in the family 's backyard .
Authorities raced to track the balloon while puzzling over ways to rescue the boy inside .
Their efforts received widespread news coverage that riveted people around the nation .
When the balloon came to rest in a field , however , Heene 's son was not inside .
The boy later was found hiding in the family 's house .
That night , during an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN's " Larry King Live , " the boy gave authorities what Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden called an " Aha ! moment . "
" You guys said we did this for the show , " Falcon said in the interview after his father asked him why he had not come out from hiding when he heard his parents calling for him .
Later in the interview , the Heenes said their son was simply confused .
Watch the " Aha moment " in the CNN interview
Authorities said Falcon 's mother later admitted that the whole thing was a hoax and that Falcon was safe in their home the whole time .

The BBC has enabled SWF Verification for its iPlayer streaming video service .
This content protection mechanism has locked out users who consume the iPlayer video content with open source software .
Adobe has publicly documented the Real - Time Messaging Protocol ( RTMP ) that is used by Flash for streaming video , but the company has fiercely guarded RTMP content protection measures , making it impossible to create a fully compatible open source RTMP client .
SWF Verification is one such security measure .
An RTMP streaming video server that has SWF Verification enabled will terminate connections from clients that fail to supply an authorization key .
The purpose of this restriction is to ensure that the content is only accessible to specific SWF files , thus preventing third - party software from downloading the video .
Although SWF Verification is principally intended to serve as a barrier to piracy , it also blocks regular users from legitimately viewing content with open source video players .
Fans of the popular XBMC media center application have discovered that the application can no longer be used to watch iPlayer content .
The Totem BBC plugin , which was developed by the BBC itself in collaboration with Canonical and Collabora , is also apparently blocked .
Although it 's technically possible to circumvent the blocks , Adobe has previously used DMCA takedown notices to stifle open source software projects that attempt to do so .
Because SWF Verification makes it impossible to view iPlayer with DMCA - compliant open source software , users will now have to rely exclusively on Adobe 's proprietary Flash plugin in order to view iPlayer content .

A leading internet service provider in the UK has declared that it will refuse to follow government orders to restrict , slow down or cut off its customers ’ internet access under rules set out in Lord Mandelson ’s ( pictured ) Digital Economy Bill .
The provider , TalkTalk , which has over 4 million internet users , has declared the legislation “ draconian ” and says it will not cooperate with its provisions .
Andrew Heaney , TalkTalk ’s director of strategy and regulation has said the company will repel any instructions to disconnect customers unless instructed to by the courts .
“ If we are instructed to disconnect an account due to alleged copyright infringement we will refuse to do so and tell the rightsholders we ’ll see them in court . ”
Heaney wrote on the company blog .
Heaney also makes it clear that TalkTalk will not turn over details of its customers ’ online activities to the government .
“ Unless we are served with a court order we will never surrender a customer ’s details to rightsholders .
We are the only major ISP to have taken this stance and we will maintain it , ” Heaney asserted .
Under the legislation , the government will impose a duty on ISPs to effectively spy on all their customers by keeping records of the websites they have visited and the material they have downloaded .
The bill states that ISPs who refuse to cooperate could be fined £ 250,000 .
Heaney described the provisions in the legislation as a pretext to communist China style internet censorship :
“ … many draconian proposals remain such as the responsibility on customers to protect their home networks from hacking at a collection cost of hundreds of millions of pounds a year , the presumption that they are guilty unless they can prove themselves innocent , and , as in China , the potential for legitimate search engines and websites to be blocked . ” he urged .
Heaney added that TalkTalk will “ continue to battle against these oppressive proposals ” , pointing out that the Digital Economy Bill measures will require secondary legislation before they can be implemented and made law .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
The TalkTalk director also highlighted the fact that the bill was passed under considerable influence from the record and film industries and that only five per cent of MPs even bothered to turn up to debate the bill in Parliament .
“ This is made all the more appalling by the ability of big music and film companies to influence government and the absence of any proper debate or scrutiny by MPs – only 5 % of MPs turned up for the brief debate yesterday and the other important parliamentary stages will be bypassed in the wash - up process , ” Heaney concluded .
The bill was universally lauded by the music industry , after it was rushed through the legislative procedure via the “ wash up ” process .
No wonder , given the fact that a key amendment of the bill was drafted by the BPI , which represents UK major record labels .
During the process , it was revealed that Stephen Timms , the minister for Digital Britain , was under the impression that “ IP address ” referred to “ intellectual property ” , rather than internet protocol , highlighting just how outmoded and ignorant of their actions ministers are on this issue .
The Digital Economy Bill became the Digital Economy Act overnight , as it was given Royal Assent and formerly passed into law .
The majority of the Act ’s provisions will come into effect in two months , with some effective immediately .
As previously indicated , the online infringement of copyright provisions of the Act will require secondary legislation before they can be implemented .
The British law firm Eversheds commented :
“ We can expect opposition to intensify as the clampdown on copyright infringement begins in earnest and consumers find themselves accused of breaking the law .
Meanwhile some commentators have already pointed out that technology savvy infringers can – and will – take steps to circumvent detection , leaving open the question , who is the government really targeting ? ”
Mass protests against the Act will continue with online campaign site 38 Degrees , working in conjunction with digital liberties watchdog The Open Rights Group .
Jim Killock , executive director of ORG called the passage of the bill “ an utter disgrace ” , adding “ This is an attack on everyone ’s right to communicate , work and gain an education .
Politicians have shown themselves to be incompetent and completely out of touch with an entire generation ’s values .
There are thousands of activists working with ORG planning to show up at hustings , demand answers from candidates , and who are willing to punish those who voted for this at the ballot box . ”

WHATEVER IMAGE THIS CONJURES IN YOUR MIND
WILL INVARIABLY BE TYPICAL OF SOMETHING
THAT YOU FIND ALREADY ON CABLE ACCESS
' We 've found Noah 's Ark !'... claim evangelical explorers on mission to snow - capped Ararat ( but British scientists say ' show us your evidence ' )
As believers in the literal truth of the Bible , they knew it was there .
Even so , the explorers who say they found seven large wooden compartments beneath snow and volcanic debris near the peak of Mount Ararat can be forgiven their excitement .
' It 's not 100 per cent that it is Noah 's Ark , but we think it is 99.9 per cent that this is it , ' said Yeung Wing - cheung , a filmmaker working with the 15 - strong team of fundamentalist Christians exploring the Turkish mountain .
This picture released by the evangelical group claims to show one of the explorers examining part of a structure which they claim might prove the existence of Noah 's Ark on Mount Ararat .
There are no external images of the site and the Hong Kong - based group refuse to say precisely where they made their discovery until the Turkish government designate it an archaeological site
The snow - capped peak of Mt. Ararat .
The discovery is said to have been made 12,000ft up the mountain which lies in eastern Turkey
GOD'S COMMAND
In the Bible , the story of Noah 's Ark appears in chapters six to nine of the Book of Genesis .
It tells how God , spurred by the wickedness and corruption of man , vows to send a great cleansing flood .
Deeming Noah to be the only righteous man worth saving , God commands him to build a vast ship , the ark - capable of saving himself , his family and a representation of the world 's animals .
When Noah has completed his task , and God has sent ' two of every sort ' of animal to the Ark , the flood waters rise until all mountains are covered and life ( except fish ) is destroyed .
When the flood subsides , the animals leave the Ark and God vows to never again send a flood to destroy man .
The story can also be found in the texts of Judaism and Islam .
Although considered a historical event , most scholars and archaeologists do not believe in a literal interpretation of the Ark story .
The vessel was said to measure ' 300 cubits , by 50 cubits , by 30 cubits ' , which translates to up to 515 ft long , 86ft wide and 52ft high .
They said wood taken from the site , which is more than 13,000 ft above sea level , dates to 2,800BC .
If it is the ark , the discovery would be the greatest in the history of archaeology and bear out one of the most famous stories in the Bible .
The team of Turks and Chinese researchers from Noah 's Ark Ministries International in Hong Kong say they made the discovery on Ararat - the biblical resting place of the ark - in October
At a press conference yesterday to announce the discovery , another team member , Panda Lee , said : ' I saw a structure built with plank - like timber .
' Each plank was about eight inches wide .
I could see tenons , proof of ancient construction predating the use of metal nails .
' We walked about 100 metres to another site .
I could see broken wood fragments embedded in a glacier , and some 20 metres long . '
The structure had several compartments , some with wooden beams , the team said .
The wooden walls of one compartment were smooth and curved while the video shown by the explorers revealed doors , staircases and nails .
The team said the wood appeared to be cypress although , according to the Bible , the ark was built from gopher .
The group ruled out identifying the find as a human settlement , saying none had been found so high up in that area .
They are keeping the exact location secret .
Four years ago and following a decade of research , U.S. national security analyst Porcher Taylor claimed a satellite image revealed a baffling ' anomaly ' on the mountain 's north - west corner that he believed to be the remains of the Ark .
But Mike Pitt , a British archaeologist , said the evangelical explorers had yet to produce compelling evidence .
He added : ' If there had been a flood capable of lifting a huge ship 4 km up the side of a mountain 4,800 years ago , I think there would be substantial geological evidence for this flood around the world .
And there is n't . '
Nicholas Purcell , a lecturer in ancient history at Oxford University , said the claims were the ' usual nonsense ' .
He added : ' If floodwaters covered Eurasia 12,000 ft deep in 2,800BC , how did the complex societies of Egypt and Mesopotamia , already many centuries old , keep right on regardless ?'
According to Genesis , the first book in the Old Testament , Noah was told to build the ark by God , who wanted to flood the world to punish sinners .
The story was widely seen as fact until the 19th century , when scientists began to question the evidence for a worldwide flood .
This photo , also put out by the evangelical group , is said to show part of a wall inside the structure found by the explorers .
One of the team said : ' It 's not 100 per cent that it is Noah 's Ark but we think it is 99.9 per cent that this is it '
In 2006 , U.S. national security analyst Porcher Taylor claimed this satellite image revealed a baffling ' anomaly ' on the mountain 's north - west corner that he believed to be the remains of the Ark
" Britain has a choice whether we opt in or not , " he said .
" A Conservative government 's default position will be that we should n't .
People should know that Labour has signed up to many such proposals in the past and that the Lib Dems , given their support for common EU policies here , would likely want Britain to sign up to the lot . "
Police shot man with 50,000 - volt
Taser after he suffered epileptic fit in gym
A police officer used a 50,000 - volt Taser gun on a man suffering an epileptic fit , it has been revealed .
A major investigation is under way after the 40 - year - old complained that he had been the victim of excessive force .
He had collapsed as he suffered a seizure at a gym and paramedics had been called to deal with the incident .
An investigation has been launched after a man was Tasered by police while suffering an epileptic fit ( file photo )
But they asked for police back - up after the man allegedly started biting and punching them .
When police arrived at the gym - which is in a secondary school in south Manchester - one officer discharged a Taser at least once into the man .
The man , who was physically restrained by officers , was transferred to hospital an hour after he first collapsed .
His condition was so bad he had to stay there for two weeks before being discharged .
He complained to Greater Manchester Police who referred the case to the Independent Police Complaint Commission .
The IPCC has launched a full investigation into the incident at the Powerleague Gym in Whalley Range , Manchester , in November .
Tasers were introduced in police forces in England and Wales in 2003 to deal with violent offenders .
Figures released last August showed they have been used 4,818 times .
But forces have been criticised for using the Tasers irresponsibly .
In 2006 , Brian Loan , 47 , died several days after being shot with a Taser in County Durham .
A coroner attributed his death to heart disease but his sister Barbara Hodgson refused to accept that the Taser was not to blame .
Records show police fired or threatened to fire Tasers against at least 142 under - 18s in the 20 months to the end of August 2009 .
The youngest person involved was a 12 - year - old boy who had threatened school staff with scissors .
Last year an 89 - year - old war veteran , apparently suffering from the onset of Alzheimer 's disease , was Tasered because an officer feared he might harm himself .
Police have also turned their Tasers on stray dogs , runaway sheep and even , accidentally , on themselves .
Oliver Sprague , director of Amnesty International , said last night : ' Amnesty has always insisted that Tasers should only be used in instances where there 's a threat of serious injury or loss of life .
' We 've also insisted that police officers take extreme caution when using this weapon against vulnerable groups - such as those with medical illnesses , children and the elderly .
' We are certainly concerned to hear that a person in apparent medical and emotional distress was subjected to the Taser . '
Scott Roeder was convicted of first - degree murder in January
A US court has sentenced an anti-abortion activist to life in prison for murdering the prominent abortion doctor , George Tiller , last year .
Scott Roeder , 52 , said he shot Dr Tiller at a church in Wichita , Kansas , to save the lives of unborn babies .
George Tiller was one of the few doctors to offer late - term abortions .
The case highlighted the bitter debate over abortion in the US .
The judge said Roeder would not be eligible for parole for 50 years .
Warren Wilbert , the judge at Sedgwick County court , said he gave Roeder the maximum sentence because he admitted stalking Dr Tiller for months .
A life sentence was mandatory , but the judge had the option of making Roeder ineligible for parole for 25 or 50 years .
Judge Wilbert also sentenced Roeder to serve an additional two years in prison for threatening two ushers at the church last May .
No remorse
In a statement to the court , Roeder said he did not regret killing Dr Tiller .
GEORGE TILLER
Profile : Dr George Tiller
" I stopped him so he could not dismember another innocent baby , " Roeder said .
" Wichita is a far safer place for unborn babies without George Tiller . "
The Tiller family 's lawyer , Lee Thompson , called the murder an act of " domestic terrorism " against a devoted family man who believed strongly in women 's rights .
" He respected and trusted the right of women to make their own decisions , " said Thompson .
" He gave his life to the rights of women . "
Dr Tiller 's clinic was one of only three in the US that offered late - term abortions - performed after 21 weeks - which are legal in Kansas .
His clinic was heavily fortified after a bomb attack in 1986 .
Dr Tiller also survived an attempt on his life in 1993 .
Mere posturing or testing the propaganda waters for consent to strike ?
Syria denies accusations made by the U.S. and Israel that it ’s sent long - range scud missile to Hizbollah in Lebanon and has expressed concern Israel “ might be preparing a military strike ” against them , Ha’aretz reports today .
Israel has been expressing fears of Syrian strike for months , to which Syrian President Bashar Assad has responded that it is “ its [ Israel ’s ] conduct which is leading the region to war ” by , according to Foreign Minister Walid Moallem , “ playing the role of thugs in the Middle East ” .
“ One day you threaten Gaza , next day you threaten Lebanon , later Iran and now Syria , ” he added .
Pres .
Assad has repeatedly conveyed his stance that “ any new Middle East war would be catastrophic for the region and beyond ” , according to Ha’aretz , and this is to be taken much more seriously from a quasi- feudal monarch than mere demagoguery from the leader of a ‘ liberal democracy ’ .
Andrew “ Abu Muqawama ” Exum at the Realpolitik - hawkish Center for a New American Society wrote , when these allegations were made public , that “ the next Israel - Lebanon war starts when either a ) Hizballah or Israel does something stupid or b) Hizballah acquires ‘ equilibrium - breaking ’ weaponry like powerful long - range rockets or anti-aircraft weaponry .
Israel might decide , in the event of the latter , that it must act preemptively and that the very fact that Hizballah possesses such weapons is casus belli enough ” .
( h/t : Tom Ricks )
He adds that we should “ hold our breath ” because “ this is how wars start ” , and I tend to agree .
That a war would begin again with something stupid and that stupid act would be a preemptive strike from Israel , but not investigating for “ the very fact ” of Hizbollah having such weapons ; only acting when it can ensure support from the U.S. Support from the U.S. and acting on credible evidence of Hizbollah possessing long - range weapons capable of reaching Tel Aviv are two completely different circumstances .
My strong differences with Professor Hans - Hermann Hoppe on the general topic aside ( along with many others neither here nor there ) , he ’s correct that the more monarchical a head of State — as opposed to the leader of a democratic republic — the more that leader has to lose by militarily engaging in international conflict .
Most importantly , neither are casus belli for military strike , e.g. the Bush Administration ’s invasion of Iraq .
Months after Israel ’s massacre on Gaza that claimed the lives of nearly 1,200 of its civilians using unlawful , atrocious means and chemical weapons , Pres .
Assad said , in an exchange with Seymour Hersh at The New Yorker , Israel was “ doing everything possible to undermine the prospects for peace ” , but continued to express their “ need to conclude a serious dialogue to lead [ the two countries ] to peace ” .
“ A senior Syrian official explained that Israel ’s failure to unseat Hamas from power in Gaza , despite the scale of the war , gave Assad enough political room to continue the negotiations without losing credibility in the Arab world , ” Mr. Hersh added .
“ Syria is eager to engage with the West , ” the official said , “ an eagerness that was never perceived by the Bush White House .
Anything is possible , as long as peace is being pursued . ”
Mr. Hersh met with the Syrian president , who “ said that if America ’s leaders ‘ are seeking peace they have to deal with Syria and they have to deal with our rights , which is the Golan Heights ' ” , which “ in 1967 , Israel seized the Golan Heights , about four hundred and fifty square miles of territory that is rich in Biblical history and , crucially , in water ” .
Mr. Hersh ’s report continued : “ ‘ If Israel wants a settlement that goes beyond the Golan Heights , ’ Assad said , it will have to ‘ deal with the core issue ’ — the situation in the West Bank and Gaza — ‘ and not waste time talking about who is going to send arms to Hezbollah or Hamas .
Wherever you have resistance in the region , they will have armaments somehow .
It is very simple . ’
He added , ‘ Hezbollah is in Lebanon and Hamas is in Palestine . ..
If they want to solve the problem of Hezbollah , they have to deal with Lebanon .
For Hamas , they have to deal with Gaza .
For Iran , it is not part of the peace process anyway . ’
Assad went on , ‘ This peace is about peace between Syria and Israel . ' ”
Since the Gaza Massacre , Israel has given no inclination of releases its occupation of the Golan Heights .
Israel ’s 2006 invasion of Lebanon ended with nearly 1,200 Lebanese casualties not belonging to Hizbollah — only 37 identified as soldiers or police officers — and 44 Israeli civilians .
The conflict ended with a ceasefire .
“ When Israel and the United States realized that Hezbollah could not be bombed into submission , they pushed a resolution , 1701 , through the United Nations , ” Jonathan Cook reported at AntiWar.com in 2007 , after Israel “ launched waves of air strikes ” , launching a conflict “ Haaretz newspaper went so far as to admit that this was ‘ a war initiated by Israel against a relatively small guerrilla group ' ” — Hizbollah .
In 2007 , “ reports have revealed that one of the main justifications for Hezbollah ’s continuing resistance — that Israel failed to withdraw fully from Lebanese territory in 2000 — is now supported by the U.N. ” , whose “ cartographers quietly admitted that Lebanon is right in claiming sovereignty over a small fertile area known as the Shebaa Farms , still occupied by Israel ” , he adds .
Israel “ argues that the territory is Syrian and will be returned in future peace talks with Damascus , even though Syria backs Lebanon ’s position ” and this is where we still stand almost four years after “ aerial bombardments ” rained on Lebanese civilians for over a month and “ Israel ’s use of cluster bombs has been described as a war crime by human rights organizations ” , Mr. Cook reported , and “ repeatedly hit Lebanese communities , killing many civilians , even though the evidence is that no Hezbollah fighters were to be found there ” .

The scanners show clear outlines of passengers ' anatomies A Heathrow Airport security guard was given a police warning after he was allegedly caught staring at images of a female colleague in a body scanner .
The 25 - year - old worker was quizzed by police over alleged remarks he made to his co-worker after she entered a scanner by mistake .
The incident took place at Terminal 5 on 10 March .
It is believed to be the first time an airport worker has been disciplined for abusing a body scanner .
The scanners show clear outlines of passengers ' anatomies .
They were introduced at Heathrow and Manchester airports to check for concealed weapons and explosives following the failed Christmas Day bomb plot by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to blow up a jet over Detroit in the United States .
' Appropriate training ' Director of Legal Enforcement and the Equality and Human Rights Commission , Susie Uppal , said the incident highlighted the risks to " privacy and respect for human dignity " that are posed by the use of full body scanners .
She said : " It is only through appropriate training and monitoring that we can ensure that the risk of breaches of discrimination and human rights laws by those who take and use the scanned images of passengers are minimised .
" The government has told us very little about what systems are currently in place to ensure that those employed to use the scanners are acting lawfully , with fairness and without discriminating . "
She added that the government needed to take urgent and decisive action to ensure that " incidents of this kind are not repeated " .
A Scotland Yard spokesman said : " Police received an allegation regarding an incident that happened at Heathrow Terminal 5 on March 10 .
" A first instance harassment warning has been issued to a 25 - year - old male . "

A 10 - year - old girl 's survival after an encounter with a box jellyfish in Queensland last year could be a one - of - a - kind story , experts say .
Rachael Shardlow was stung by the world 's most venomous creature while swimming 23 kilometres upstream from the ocean mouth in the Calliope River , near Gladstone , in December .
Rachael 's 13 - year - old brother , Sam , pulled her onto the riverbank .
She told him she could not see or breathe , and fell unconscious with the jellyfish 's tentacles strapped to her limbs .
Zoology and tropical ecology associate professor at James Cook University , Jamie Seymour , says the girl 's survival after such an extensive sting is unheard of .
" I do n't know of anybody in the entire literature where we 've studied this where someone has had such an extensive sting that has survived , " he said .
" When I first saw the pictures of the injuries I just went , ' you know to be honest , this kid should not be alive ' .
I mean they are horrific .
" Usually when you see people who have been stung by box jellyfish with that number of the tentacle contacts on their body , it 's usually in a morgue . "
Associate professor Seymour says the university is interested to see how long it takes for Rachael to recover , as well as whether there are any long - term effects .
" From our point of view it 's really useful information that you very seldom , if ever , get your hands on , " he said .
Rachael 's father , Geoff Shardlow , says his daughter has scarring as well as some short - term memory loss .
" We 've noticed a small amount of short - term memory loss , like riding a pushbike to school and forgetting she 's taken a pushbike , " he said .
" The greatest fear was actual brain damage [ but ] her cognitive skills and memory tests were all fine . "
Mr Shardlow says it is vital there are more jellyfish warning signs erected throughout central Queensland .
" He brings a winning attitude and has that experience and leadership qualities that a lot of guys look up to .
Whether it be during plane rides or practices , there are guys who are constantly picking his brain about the Stanley Cup run that they had in Detroit and then losing last year in the finals .
He is just a bundle of knowledge that everybody tries to extract . " -- Kevin Bieksa on Mikael Samuelsson
When you look up the term " late bloomer " there should be a photo of Vancouver Canucks forward Mikael Samuelsson next to the definition .
Why ?
Because the 32 - year old native of Mariefred , Sweden is a quintessential NHL late bloomer and his evolution as a hockey player gives testimony to his dogged determination .
Normally quiet off the ice , Samuelsson has a fire burning inside typical of many late bloomers who graduate from the school of hard knocks .
That fire burst forth when he got the news he would not represent Sweden at the 2010 Winter Olympics , ironically in Vancouver .
" I pretty much have one comment and maybe I 'll regret it , " an angry Samulesson said before going outside the bounds of a family newspaper , or web site , or TV show .
Originally drafted by the San Jose Sharks in the 1998 Entry Draft ( No. 145 ) , Samuelsson did n't see NHL action until he was 24 , playing in four games with the Sharks .
He subsequently saw spot duty with the New York Rangers Pittsburgh Penguins and Florida Panthers before finally established himself as a bona fide NHL forward with the Detroit Red Wings With the Wings in 2005 - 06 , at the age of 29 , Samuelsson established career marks with 23 goals , 45 points and an impressive plus - 27 .
During his four seasons in the Motor City , Samuelsson gained the confidence to play in all tight situations and be a difference maker in some of them .
" I took a step in Detroit , " Samuelsson said .
" It was quite an easy team to play for when you consider that I played with so many good players .
I realized that I could do things there that maybe I did n't realize before .
Detroit was a big part of my career .
" The Red Wings did n't put pressure on Samuelsson to pace the team .
Surrounded by high - end talent like Henrik Zetterberg Pavel Datsyuk , and Nicklas Lidstrom , the late bloomer was allowed to develop his game and soak up valuable lessons from a dressing room stacked with leaders and experience .
He gained confidence .
And though relegated to the Red Wings ' third line , Samuelsson 's work ethic and deadly shot earned him responsibility on the mighty Detroit power play .
He proved to be a valuable player in the club 's Stanley Cup championship in 2007 - 08 and their drive to the Stanley Cup Final last season .
In the belief that the powerful 6 - foot - 2 , 220 pound winger could emerge as a top six forward and bring a winning attitude to Vancouver , the Canucks wasted no time in signing Samuelsson to a three - year contract on July 3 , just two days after he became eligible for free agency .
Samuelsson is proving that the Canucks quick decision to bring him out West was not made in haste .
He is delivering as advertised .
In 47 games , he has scored 15 goals and 16 assists and is plus - 6 .
" Everything that I thought he was supposed to do for this team , he is doing , " teammate Ryan Kesler said .
" Mikael is a good top six forward that generates a lot of shots and has a good shot to score goals .
He is very good on the power play .
Mikael does n't say too much in the ( dressing ) room , but does his talking on the ice .
He is a proven winner at this level and he knows what it takes .
He has won the Stanley Cup .
" As in Detroit , the Canucks have not put pressure on Samuelsson to lead the team in offense .
" No , not at all , " Samuelsson said .
" I expect that from myself .
And I hope that I can continue to do that but they have n't said anything like that but have asked me to just go out and play my game .
That 's what I like to hear .
As long as I have confidence I know that I can do a lot out there .
" In addition to his contributions on the score sheet , Samuelsson brings a sense of calm to the team , something he witnessed consistently during his four years in Detroit .
His new teammates value that special quality .
" It 's great to have him on our team , " Vancouver forward Ryan Johnson said .
" He has a very calm , confident way about him which rubs off on a lot of players .
Mikael works hard and spends a lot of time on his game .
It 's great for the younger players to be around a guy like that .
He is a competitor and he has won the Stanley Cup .
It 's important to have a guy that has been there , has played in the big games and has played well in the big games . " " Michal has been extremely consistent for us , " agreed defenseman Kevin Bieksa .
" He brings a winning attitude and has that experience and leadership qualities that a lot of guys look up to .
Whether it be during plane rides or practices , there are guys who are constantly picking his brain about the Stanley Cup run that they had in Detroit and then losing last year in the finals .
He is just a bundle of knowledge that everybody tries to extract .
" Samuelsson 's quiet confidence is not just felt off the ice .
" Absolutely , " Bieksa said .
" Michal is a calming influence both on and off the ice .
On the ice he is very good at settling the puck down , holding it and having poise with the puck and making a play .
Off the ice he is a great teammate , always joking around and constantly bantering with somebody .
He sits across from me on the plane so we kind of go back and forth with the chirping .
He is a lot of fun .
" He is not much fun for opposing players , as Bieksa learned prior to the current season .
Samuelsson is a tremendous physical specimen whose sturdy ice presence is fuelled by a powerful lower body that resembles the physique of an international soccer star .
" He 's got the biggest calves in the league , " said Bieksa .
" He is very strong .
I remember when I used to play against him and we would battle all the time .
I used to hate playing against him .
He would never back down .
You can learn a lot from his example .
" One young player who is learning from the seasoned veteran is forward Mason Raymond , whose own confidence has soared during his pivotal third year in the league .
" Part of being a pro is being good every night and not having days off , " said the speedy Raymond , who has already set a single - season goal - scoring mark with half the schedule still left to play .
" Consistency is something I really try to focus on and of course playing hard every shift .
There are a lot of guys I can learn from on this team .
Michal is a guy that has won the Cup and he knows what it takes .
The more years you play in the league the more experience you get and you acquire a feel for what 's going to happen out there .
But any questions you have you ask .
You are trying to get better yourself every day and learn the tricks of the trade .
I am always trying to get better and improve in any area that I can .
" Is the Mikael Samuelsson experiment as a top line player working ?
The last word on the subject is reserved for coach Alain Vigneault , who has tested different line combinations all season in Vancouver .
" Considering our forward situation and all of the different people I have asked him to play with so far , Mikael has done extremely well , " Vigneault said .
" He is on the score sheet quite a bit and on most nights has been one of our better forwards .
" One who figures to be even better as he has something to prove to Sweden .
Here are two seemingly unrelated facts .
One : from the late 1940s through 1963 , we tested atomic bombs in the atmosphere .
Two : wine lovers are sometimes duped into spending exorbitant amounts for fake vintage bottles that were n’t from the year they were supposedly grown .
But Graham Jones at Australia ’s University of Adelaide thought he could use bomb information against counterfeit wines .
[ He talked about his research at the meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco . ]
Carbon dating works by comparing the amount of carbon 14 , which is a less common and less stable form of carbon , to the more abundant carbon 12 .
For thousands of years , the ratio between the two has been the same .
But those two decades of atomic bomb tests increased the C - 14 in the atmosphere .
And as growing grapes absorb carbon dioxide , they take in trace amounts of the heavier carbon isotope — which eventually show up in the wine .
The research team checked C - 14 levels in 20 Australian red wines with vintages from 1958 to 1997 .
They compared the wine ’s C - 14 to C - 14 in atmospheric samples from the same years .
And found a direct match — C - 14 levels could give away the vintage year for each wine .
So beware wine scammers .
Because even at the atomic level , in vino veritas .

In a perfect world ( Ancapistan / Libertopia ) , say libertarians who want to restrict immigration , we could have open borders .
For one thing , they say , all property would be privatized , so it would be up to individuals to decide who will be allowed to traverse their land , roads , and waterways .
Furthermore , they explain , there would be no massive welfare state encouraging the neighboring country ’s proletariat to immigrate for all the freebies .
There would be no arbitrary government rules about “ natural born citizenry ” which encourage pregnant mothers to try to birth their babies on American ( that ’s the country we ’re talking about here , after all ) soil thus securing the right to live in America for their child , and by extension ( since it ’s inhumane to break up the mother - child family unit ) their right to live there as well .
Now , I ’ve seen libertarians argue that the Mexicans ( let ’s face it , that ’s really whom we ’re talking about ) who cross the border illegally are mostly looking for the freebies , and I ’ve seen libertarians argue that the Mexicans who cross the border illegally are mostly looking for work which Americans do n’t want to do themselves ( like picking lettuce all day in fields of pesticide ) .
Who ’s right ?
I have n’t a clue .
I ’m sure the American welfare state is very enticing to the neighboring poor .
I ’m sure without it , there ’d be less immigration from Mexico .
But none of this matters to me .
I ’m not even going to make the pro-liberty argument which by definition is against government controlled borders .
What I want to do is concede all of the above arguments to the anti-immigration libertarians .
Let ’s assume that an enormous welfare state requires heavily regulated or possibly even closed borders .
I do n’t believe this to be the case , but let ’s stipulate that it is .
Now what ?
What are these libertarians implicitly assuming ?
That the government can efficiently and effectively manage the borders .
If there is one thing every libertarian should know about government it ’s that government cannot efficiently or effectively perform any “ service ” without resorting to totalitarian police - statism .
When the government minimizes costs ( do n’t laugh ) , it performs at woefully substandard levels .
Think of the levees around New Orleans which failed during Hurricane Katrina , for instance .
For adequate quality of service , for instance the Hoover Dam or those stretches of elevated interstate cutting through the marshes and swamps of Louisiana ( very fine work ) , the government has to overpay enormously .
The systemic defects inherent in government bureaucracy cannot be overcome , as they are due ( mostly ) to the absence of a profit motive .
The government simply cannot provide quality services at market prices ; often , the government cannot provide quality service at any price .
What the government can do , however , is provide brutality very cheaply , for a while .
So , while the government wo n’t be able to build proper border walls at a reasonable price , what it can do is man whatever type of walls it does build ( cheap , low quality walls , or massively overpriced , high quality walls ) with soldiers who have orders to shoot - on - sight and ask questions later , if at all .
Tossing several thousand mines outside those walls would n’t cost much either — we could describe it as brutally efficient .
Why not require every citizen to carry government identification cards and make the penalty for failure to comply ( accidental or intentional ) very severe ?
We have examples of countries which have managed to secure their borders effectively ( for the most part ) .
I ’ll name three : The former Soviet Union , North Korea , Cuba .
Governments which have n’t degenerated into police states just cannot accomplish it .
So I pose this question to those libertarians who claim that as long as we have a colossal welfare state , we must have strict immigration controls : what ’s your libertarian plan for accomplishing this ?
We ’ve probably used every superlative in the book to describe the Clutch Custom style by now .
Propriétaire Willie Knoll builds bikes that we just ca n’t tear our eyes away from .
As we ’ve come to expect from the Paris - based builder , this XS650 is low - key and refined .
But it ’s stacked with hand - made bits and pieces — details that M. Knoll prides himself on , but claims wo n’t be noticed at first glance .
For starters , the XS650 now packs an extra wallop thanks to an engine rebuild with a 750 cc big - bore kit .
Helping the extra cubic centimeters do their job are a pair of Dell ’ Orto carbs , K&N filters and classy Spark mufflers .
The front - end has been thoroughly re-engineered too , with a set of Yamaha SR500 forks mated to custom - made triple trees .
The front drum brake is also from an SR500 .
Like the stock XS650 rear hub , it ’s laced to a new 18 ” rim , wrapped in Avon Roadrider rubber .
To clean things up visually , Willie ’s cut the wiring right down .
( Since the XS650 has a kick starter , he ’s also eliminated the battery . )
The stock fuel tank has been re-tunnelled to accommodate the remaining electrical components .
The café - esque seat unit and cowl are hand - made , perched on top of a re-worked subframe .
Other one - off bits include new clip - ons , foot pegs , exhaust and headlight brackets and a very neat gas cap .
Minimalist lighting rounds off the package .
Willie has kept the finishes on the XS650 raw and industrial — with just a splash of color on the fuel tank and headlight lens .
We applaud Monsieur Knoll for his impeccable taste .
And we ’re intrigued to hear that what started out as a personal project is now for sale .
Would it fit in your garage ?

Chris Matthews vs Ron Paul
by Walter Block by Walter Block Recently by Walter Block : Is Libertarianism a Part of the Right or the Left ? Neither .
WeAreUnique
I found it exceedingly difficult to watch Chris Matthews ’ interview of Ron Paul .
The former would hardly let the latter get a word in edgewise .
Matthews kept interrupting the next President of the U.S.
He would barely allow him to finish a sentence .
But , that ’s not what I want to write about .
Instead , I want to discuss options for dealing with such boorish interviewers when we are next in Ron ’s position .
What should we do when we are faced with such a situation ?
1 . Talk faster .
Here , an attempt is made to at least get in something of substance before the inevitable next interruption occurs .
But there are problems with this technique .
For one thing , the Matthews of the world will just cut you off even more quickly .
For another , you lose your “ presence ” when you do this .
The audience will tend to dismiss you because you are being speeded up by the interviewer .
I recommend against this .
2 . Talk more slowly .
This attempt at passive aggressiveness has something to be said for it .
It makeSSSSS it crystal clear to everyone concerned exactly what is going on .
I was once interviewed on Canadian television by the talk show host and former premier of British Columbia , Dave Barrett , a bully of the Matthews stripe if ever there was one .
I pulled this technique on him .
I hardly spoke a word in the entire 30 - minute (? ) interview .
The upshot : the producers apologized to me , and forced Barrett to have me on his show again .
This time , chastened , he acted in a more civilized manner .
I sometimes think I should have refused to go on with him again , the better to underscore his barbaric behavior .
3. Keep talking .
Do not allow yourself to be interrupted .
You do n’t have to shout , although , if you have a booming voice ( I do n’t ) this will help .
In my soft voice , I just keep on going , even though the interviewer wo n’t shut up , either .
It is like a chicken race : who will be the first to veer away ?
Do n’t allow that to be you .
Keep talking , even if what you are saying is , in extremis , reduced to nonsense syllables .
Eventually , you will win , because this will make the interviewer look bad .
It is his show .
He is supposedly the professional .
Trust me , you will win this chicken race if you persevere .
4 . Change the subject .
The next time the interviewer asks you a question , say something along the following lines : “ That is a very interesting question .
I ’d really love to answer it .
However , I fear , based on recent experience , that no sooner do I get 5 words out of my mouth , you ’ll interrupt me , yet again .
So , let ’s talk , instead , about your compulsive need to hog the limelight .
Do n’t you think this interview would be more informative for your audience if you allowed me , oh , 10 full seconds to answer every question before you bully your way in , again ? ”
5. Counter - interrupt .
When he is in the midst of asking you a question , interrupt him , to show him and the audience exactly what he is doing .
I have never tried this , but , my thought is that if you engage in this behavior , your invitations to be on radio and television will decline .
6 . When the Matthewses of the world interrupt your answer to a given question , and quickly pose another one , say , quietly and calmly , “ I would like to fully finish my answer to your previous question . ”
( I owe this point to Dale Holmgren ) .
How might Matthews respond to this ?
One possibility is surrender on his part ; he could say , “ Ok , please elaborate . ”
Then , you ’ve won .
But he might use another ploy , saying something along the following lines : “ We do n’t have time for in depth responses , due to time constraints . ”
How to reply to this ?
You could acquiesce .
Or , you could be more assertive ; claim that you ’ll be brief , but insist that justice to the audience ca n’t be done with answers that are severely truncated .
7 . Be a gentleman .
Do exactly as Ron Paul did .
Do not counter - interrupt .
Allow yourself to be continually interrupted .
Do n’t speed up or slow down your normal rate of speaking .
Do not give the interviewer a lecture on good manners .
Which is best ?
I ’m not sure .
I welcome discussion on this point .
I think it is good to be armed with alternative techniques , responses .
However , I ’m not sure but think that Ron ’s response is best .
Be cool .
Be a gentleman .
Ron , after all , is by far our best spokesman .
He has probably brought more ordinary people to libertarianism than any other person in the entire history of the known universe , with the possible exception of Ayn Rand .
( Mises and Rothbard have undoubtedly brought more intellectuals to libertarianism than anyone else . )
On the other hand , we learn methodological individualism from our study of Austrian economics .
In this vein , it is possible that what works best for Ron will not be the ideal response for all of the rest of us who are trying to promote liberty and rational economics , in support of Ron .
The Best of Walter E. Block
Tuesday , April 27th 2010 , 4:30 PM EDT
Did you ever wonder where those clockwork CO2 spikes come from ?
After all , they accompany every interglacial .
See : Physorg.com
- Even soil feels the heat : Soils release more carbon dioxide as globe warms for a helpful hint - 99.5 % comes from natural sources .
In the above referenced web - article , these scientists have bumped their estimated current microbial contribution to atmospheric CO2 from 85 to 98 petagrams .
Our anthropogenic contribution is less than a tenth of that at ~ 6 - 7 petagrams .
The total of all natural emissions is estimated at some 2,000 - 2,200 petagrams .
Now in this article they seem to suggest that our 6 - 7 petagram ( sub 0.5 % ) contribution has unfortunately and deleteriously triggered this microbial increase of 13 petagrams ( from 85 to 98 ) .
In fact , most all studies regarding Soil Respiration engage the very same broken blame - game .
However , if we humans were never here at all , the consequently expanded microbial contribution can be roughly estimated to become 127 petagrams .
Microbes would have geometrically filled our void for an increase of ~ 42 petagrams .
And expanded proliferations of insects and mammalia would have contributed to a yet much larger delta .
So what would these Theologians suggest this far greater contribution would have “ unfortunately and deleteriously triggered ?
” Well , regarding any prior interglacial , they would have to say this greater level would have triggered yet more proliferation of life .
What an irony it is that our under- contribution of Vitamin C( O2 ) to this interglacial is what has negatively impacted the current levels of bio-diversity .
However , for this interglacial , their theological position is that we sinners are here , and even though our presence has likely lowered the total level of atmospheric Vitamin C( O2 ) , the Earth - Carbon - Cycle now contains a poisonous 0.5 % contribution from us that must be stopped !
So which is it ?
We humans are emitting too much Vitamin C( O2 ) so as to poison the Earth , or not enough Vitamin C( O2 ) to fully support the proliferation potential of all other forms of life .
The theologians can argue that both are true – at the same time !
Apparently to them anthropogenic Vitamin C( O2 ) is poisonous while natural Vitamin C( O2 ) , inhibited by humans , is also damaging the environment .
“ Mother Nature will know her own carbon ” must be their thinking .
We are truly sinners !
AGW
Theology is full of such absurdly circular arguments .
And cause is often confused with , or even made to follow , effect .
The AGW Theory , if I can be so kind as to call it a continuing theory has never yet prevailed with a single testable prediction .
But amazingly , it has not suffered discernible setback from at least five major embarrassing predictive failures .
The most recent failure is the global temperature prediction since 1998.AGW
Theory firmly predicts that global temperature must rise in response to the continued ( naturally and steeply ) growing atmospheric CO2 concentration .
But since 1998 global temperatures are flat to down .
So the Theory is wrong .
How many more failures will they get a “ pass ” on ?
How long will we wait for them to get one right ; which they most likely never will unless by accident ?
There has never been a scientific theory so replete with failure that was n’t summarily thrown out as rubbish .
AGW
Theology is completely wrong at its foundation and builds to absurdity from there .
Our anthropogenic Vitamin C( O2 ) emission has no negative impact on climate or anything else .
But it greatly benefits life ’s proliferations .
And if any evidence actually showed a legitimate problem with elevated atmospheric Vitamin C( O2 ) ( for which there is no evidence ) , then why would n’t we look to address some portion of the 99.5 % that is being spewed by Mother Nature .
Is it really so that we have just the right size , but massively growing , Earthly populations of microbes and insects ?
A 5 % hit to them would be …well …a 5 % hit .
A comparable CO2 reduction produced by humans would have us all living in caves .
And in neither case would anything constructive be produced .
If you ask the AGW Theologians how it could be that global temperature is flat to down over the last 12 years while anthropogenic emission is sharply up during the same period , they shrug it off as “ natural variability that has overtaken our CO2 ” .
And go on to say “ but be assured , our CO2 emission is dangerous and has to be reduced at any cost ” .
Really ... well just what are these “ natural variables ” that have overwritten the pivotal role of CO2 ?
CO2 is n’t so pivotal .
You just said so .
Other unknown variables are more important .
You just said so .
And “ at any cost ” you say ?
How can one continue to defend a CO2 reduction imperative based on such conflicting and hyperbolic statements ?
Every day new information and understanding accumulates regarding climate change .
And all the mounting evidence continues to point away from CO2 having any role to play in modifying the climate of the Earth .
We simply do n’t yet know what the fundamental causes of climate change are .
But we do know that rising temperature is what drives atmospheric Vitamin C( O2 ) upward .
And we do know that Vitamin C( O2 ) stimulates all forms of life .
So that leaves us with the strongest position that exists in support of AGW Theology : “ How else do you explain it ? ”
But this has become one of only two remaining supporting positions .
And it is not , of course , any evidence at all .
We just do n’t know what the causes are .
However , theologians have often invoked this expression for centuries .
The only other remaining supporting position is the result that stems from their General Circulation Models of the climate ( GCMs , also known as Global Climate Models ) .
However , the Earth ’s climate is properly described in scientific terms as a “ coupled , non-linear , chaotic system ” .
This is essentially techno - speak for “ utterly impossible to model ” .
And that is true .
It is impossible to model .
So when your enormously expensive , but utterly feeble , model disagrees with observational fact , what do you do ?
Vigorously defend the model , as that is your future career and where all the money is available to reap .
And it gets worse .
It is widely known and accepted that water vapor is a vastly more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 .
And it is also widely known and accepted that water vapor in the atmosphere exists in vastly greater quantity than CO2 .
So water vapor is clearly a real , real important issue to any GCM that will become useful in its predictive performance .
However , the Modelers are forced to admit that they have no capacity to model water vapor or cloud formation or cloud dissipation , as these issues are far beyond their capability .
They do n’t know if more CO2 leads to more water vapor or less .
They do n’t know if more CO2 leads to more clouds or less .
And they do n’t know if more clouds lead to higher temperatures or lower .
Nonetheless , every GCM makes the simplistic and observationally erroneous assumption that a little increase in CO2 will trigger a large increase in water vapor and that this will lead to appreciable warming .
Well , why would you make that assumption ?
How can you stick by it when 12 years of steep CO2 increases has lead to flat - to - down temperature since 1998 ?
And when you recognize that 99.5 % of the increase is natural , and the increase is benefiting all forms of life , why would you target the sub - 0.5 % that is anthropogenic ?
Well , as stated above , follow the money .
You might think that such nonsense cannot be , but it is .
Here is another climate modeling dichotomy .
We are inundated with media driven concern over the catastrophic climatic events that AGW will bring on to us – floods , hurricanes , tornadoes and all manner of extra violent storms .
There is no observational evidence for support of any of this , but let ’s set that “ reality ” aside .
Meteorologically we know that the vigor of all storms is largely driven by the size of the temperature gradient .
When a cold pressure front slams into a hot one , storms develop and their vigor is a strong function of the temperature difference between the two fronts .
We see this happen on a daily basis .
But the GCMs all predict that the temperature differences will be smaller under the AGW Theology .
The greenhouse heating effect ( according to the GCMs ) is stronger at polar regions than equatorial ones such that the global difference should be diminished .
And the greenhouse heating effect ( according to the GCMs ) is stronger at night than during the day such that this temperature difference should also be diminished .
There is no observational evidence for support of these diminished - gradient predictions , but let ’s set that additional “ reality ” aside ( so much for the predictive value of the GCMs ) .
So why do n’t the Modelers step in and say , hold on here , storms wo n’t get worse , they ’ll get better .
Well , the Modelers simply have no idea whatsoever if storms will get better or worse or stay the same , because their models are not even close to being capable of modeling what is impossible to model .
Nonetheless it is so that their feeble models do predict that the vigor will go down .
If they admit that their models predict storms will be fewer and less vigorous , the hysteria is diminished and so will their funding .
And they know that they really do n’t have a clue as to what might be so .
They could admit they do n’t know at all .
But that wo n’t inspire more funding .
So the Modelers choose to ignore the discrepancy altogether and let the hysteria continue , as that is in their continued funding interest .
They simply have no idea because it is not possible to model a coupled , non-linear , chaotic system .
However , in spite of the impossibility of it , we have spent $ Billions on many , many GCM attempts .
But make no mistake , the General Circulation Models all predict that storms will be fewer and less violent while hysteria of cataclysmic and more violent storms continues .
Now that is a dichotomy that should clearly indicate to all the incompetence of GCMs and the conflict - of - interest that surrounds the current modeling effort .
So there you have it .
The current support for AGW Theology rests on two dubious pillars of profound strength : 1 ) the theological conundrum “ how else do you explain it ” .
And 2 ) incomplete , broken and impossible models that attempt to model something which can not be modeled .
It ’s not going to be easy to change direction .
The effort on GCMs goes way back – to the days when we thought we could model what we cannot .
There are literally thousands of scientists whose careers are tied to the effort ’s continuation .
In fact there are many hundreds of scientists who have never known another career at all outside of climate modeling .
Should the effort continue ?
I think it ’s become too big to stop so I doubt it can be .
However , we have to at least recognize that it ’s going to take a lot more time and money before the effort has anything predictive to contribute , if ever .
And GCMs certainly provide no evidence today of what may be so in the future .
So as we unfortunately continue to allow AGW Theology to force the contemplation of massively consequential actions to address climate change , should n’t we require that at least some of the new observational ( non-modeling ) information and understanding support the AGW Theory .
None of it does .
And by none , I mean categorically not any of it .
These circular arguments and cause / effect confusion all arise from forcing a bankrupt AGW Theology into an entirely implausible explanation .
This confusion needs to stop at our earliest awakening – if not sooner .
OK … we had an idea .
In retrospect it was childishly over - simplistic and just plain wrong .
To prove the felonious idea we attempted to model the impossible and have found that it is not possible .
So let ’s stop , take a deep breath , and figure out where to go next ; preferably before we throw ourselves on to our own sword as the AGW Theologians insist .
Many AGW arguments stem from the Eco-Theology belief that we humans are sinners who must punish ourselves .
I can not help but disagree .
Many of the rest of the arguments largely surround money and political power .
I have to strongly disagree with these motivations too .
The remaining AGW arguments are just innocently misguided .
The whole of the AGW Eco-Theology is a ridiculously upside - down charade that is broken at its very foundation .

Doctors find cyst with teeth , hair in 18 - year - old
While his friends would be out playing football and cricket and just running around , Belcon had to sit on the sidelines .
He would have difficulty breathing after participating in anything strenuous .
Again , this was dismissed as him being overweight .
It was only by sheer chance that during a surgery at the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex ( EWMSC ) , Mt Hope , doctors found a cyst that was crushing his lungs , “ the size of a basketball . ”
“ I was always a little fat and thought that was the reason for my short breath .
Right now I ’m doing an electrical course with the Civilian Conservation Corps , but in January I started working with my dad part time doing construction .
That was when it became more difficult for me to breathe , ” Belcon told Sunday Newsday .
“ I started coughing a lot , but I said that it was all the dust at the construction site .
My dad told me to go to the hospital to check it out , but I just dismissed it .
Then I started coughing up blood and my dad insisted that I go and see a doctor , ” Belcon said .
Belcon visited the San Fernando General Hospital where doctors did an x-ray , which revealed a large mass in his chest .
Unable to diagnose the mass , Belcon was sent to EWMSC where doctors were also unable to say what the mass was , which by all indications of the x-ray looked to be a tumour .
A biopsy was done and the results came back as non-cancerous , so Belcon was discharged and told to return on March 23 , which he did .
The next day he was scheduled for surgery .
The doctors performing the surgery were expecting a cyst , but it was unlike any that they had seen .
The sheer size of it was surprising , but what was found within was even more so .
There was hair and teeth and what looked like eyes of an underdeveloped foetus , but doctors are yet to confirm this .
The teen and his family believed it was his “ underdeveloped twin ” and are still unable to understand how this came to be or how he lived so long with this condition without further complications .
Belcon ’s aunt , Lisa Peters , with whom he had been staying in Tunapuna because of the close proximity to the hospital , said the family still found the whole surgery and discovery “ unbelievable . ”
“ We all thought that it was a tumour but nothing like this .
It took me by surprise , it took his mother by surprise and she is still in shock .
It ’s the strangest thing , ” Peters said .
Even Belcon remained bewildered as he showed the Sunday Newsday the long , red scar running down the centre of his chest .
“ Feel here , do you feel that ? ”
Belcon asked as he pointed to a spot on his chest .
“ That is the steel they used to hold my chest together . ”
His lungs were also underdeveloped because of the weight of the growth and he now uses a spirometer to practise his breathing exercises to strengthen his lungs .
“ I did not get to see what they took out , but the doctors said it was big like a basketball .
In a photo they took the doctor pointed out teeth and hair .
I used to weigh between 180 to 190 pounds before the surgery , and my chest was puffed out in front and my breasts were bigger , ” Belcon said .
He now weighs 160 pounds .
Head of the cardiothoracic team who performed the surgery , Mr Ian Ramnarine , said while this condition , called teratoma , was rare , it was well recognised in the medical world .
A teratoma is an encapsulated tumor with tissue or organ components resembling normal derivatives that can come from any cell site such as the hair , teeth skin .
The tissues of a teratoma , although normal in themselves , may be quite different from surrounding tissues , and may be highly disparate .
Teratomas have been reported to contain hair , teeth , bone and very rarely more complex organs such as eye , torso , and hands , feet , or other limbs .
Usually , however , a teratoma will contain no organs but rather one or more tissues normally found in organs such as the brain , thyroid , liver , and lung .
“ When you are a foetus , the cells are primitive cell types which can develop into any kind of tissue such as hair and limbs and so on , which is what we found in the cyst .
These are normal cell types that can develop in unusual places , ” Ramnarine said .
The doctor said he had never seen a teratoma of this size before , adding that these usually occurred in the ovaries , testes and chest .
He said the medical team , which included junior doctors Nahmorah Bobb and Raakesh Goalan , found teeth and hair in the cyst , and what looked like eyes , but they were awaiting a full report before confirming this .
“ This one was very unusual because of its size .
It was one foot long and weighed eight pounds .
It had occupied more than half of his chest and had pushed his heart all the way to the left .
It took five hours to remove the cyst .
The right lung was very small , less than a quarter the size of the left lung .
?????????? ??? ???? ????? ?????????? ????????????? , ????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????? - ?????????? ?????????? , ???????? , ?????????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ???????? ? ???? ????????. ?? ????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ????????? ? ?????? ?? ??????? ????????
“ His lungs were underdeveloped because the size of the teratoma prevented it from developing properly .
It would seem that this was inside him when he was born , ” Ramnarine said .
The doctor said one of the dangers of Belcon living with the cyst was that if it had remained unchecked and had changed , it could have turned cancerous .

Yu said Beijing was " deeply concerned " about the situation in Kyrgyzstan , which borders its troubled Muslim region of Xinjiang in the northwest .
" China ... hopes the country will restore peace soon and maintain stability , " Jiang told reporters at a regular news briefing .
" China hopes that relevant issues will be settled in a lawful way . "
China 's official news agency Xinhua gave full coverage to the unrest , which ended with the leader fleeing the capital of the strategic Central Asian state .
Opposition protesters seized the presidential administration late Wednesday and announced on state radio that they had formed a provisional government with former foreign minister Roza Otunbayeva at its head .
Media coverage
Jiang said her ministry was following developments in the country closely , after the 60 - year - old Bakiyev fled the capital aboard a small plane .
She said there had been no reports of Chinese casualties from the unrest , in which scores of people are reported to have been killed in ferocious clashes in Bishkek and other cities .
As unrest swept the country , Chinese netizens passed around messages via the microblogging service Twitter that linked to video footage of the violence and news reports that the country 's interior minister had been killed by rioters .
Many of China 's largest online news providers , including Sina , Sohu , and Baidu ran coverage and carried netizens ' comments on the riots , which were the culmination of spiralling protests in the Central Asian republic .
" I support this , " wrote Sohu user " It is nearly destroyed . "
" The new revolution has triumphed ... Down with corrupt governments ... Down with social injustice , " the user wrote , in the comment most highly rated by readers .
" If a government gets corrupt it does n't need to be overthrown by others .
It has become so rotten that a gust of wind will blow it over , " wrote a user from the northern province of Shaanxi whose comment was in the top five as rated by readers .
And a user from Beijing said that democracy is a strong force in the world .
" Those who support it will flourish , while those who oppose it will perish , " the comment said .
Blame for U.S .
Meanwhile , official media carried a commentary saying that Washington was likely behind the uprising against Bakiyev .
" There are likely to be foreign forces at work behind these events , " wrote Ma Fengshu , a Russian affairs expert at Shanghai Jiaotong University , in an analysis that was widely available to Chinese netizens .
" I would guess that the most likely candidate would be the United States , because ... President Bakiyev came to power with U.S. support during the Tulip Revolution ... but [ later ] asked the U.S. to close its military airbase . "
" Kyrgyzstan is beginning to move closer to Russia , in the face of a number of social and economic pressures , " Ma wrote .
" The U.S. did n't get what it was hoping for from its support of Bakyev , so it is understandable that it has now thrown its support behind the opposition . "
He said the country has scant natural resources and has been hit hard by the global economic recession .
But he added , perhaps echoing sentiment in Beijing about Communist Party rule in the troubled Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region : " Kyrgyzstan 's ethnic make - up is complicated , and failure to manage conflict between different ethnic groups could also induce unrest . "
Xinhua news agency quoted the health minister of the interim government as saying that 74 people had been killed and 530 others injured in the unrest .
Official Chinese media also reported that Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin has " recognized " Otunbayeva 's government .
Kyrgyzstan , which shares a 533 - mile ( 858 - km ) border with China , is also a gateway to other energy - rich Central Asian countries where China , Russia , and the U.S. are competing fiercely for dominance .
It is a predominantly Muslim country , but has remained secular .
The U.S. Embassy denied reports in the Kyrgyz media that U.S. citizens were being evacuated to the Manas air force base , where about 1,200 U.S. troops are stationed .
Americans in civilian clothing were seen entering the base early Thursday .

A two - hour , 32 - minute audio tape of a Tim Ball lecture ( finally available here ) features one of Canada ’s most compromised climate change deniers ( see especially here , here or here ) making sweeping and silly pronouncements , getting caught out in misrepresenting data and , finally , attributing all climate science to a socialist plot by an aging Canadian businessman and United Nations supporter .
The audio , recorded April 7 , 2010 at a meeting of the University of Victoria Young Conservatives Club , is crackly and begins badly ( most people will want to start around the nine minute mark ) .
It starts with Ball going on at length about his bona fides as an environmentalist and touting his life - time total of “ peer - reviewed ” publications at 23 .
( This , presumably , would include the four [ 4 ] publications listed on the ISI Web of science and 19 others that were , perhaps , checked over by Christopher Walter , the Third Viscount Monckton of Brenchley , before being typed up for printing in a journal , website or daily paper not generally read among diligent academics . )
Dr. Ball falls into his usual truthiness with comments like this ( at around the 34:00 minute mark ) :
“ These guys ( the scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) can’t tell you the weather 10 days from now but they ’re telling you what it ’s going to be like 100 years from now .
How does that work ?
They try to argue that one is climate and one is weather , well I ’m sorry climate is made up of weather , climate is the average of the weather .
If you ca n’t get the weather right the climate is n’t going to be right . ”
… after which , he adds , in reference to the science contributors to the IPCC process , “ They ’ve been wrong on every single projection they have made since they brought out their first report in 1992 . ”
Every single projection : can you imagine ?
At around 1:02 , Ball gets caught cooking his data , at first extrapolating ice core data from Greenland to argue that the world is cooling and then admitting that such a sweeping contention is unsupportable on this dataset .
He says :
“ Ice core from Greenland that shows you the variation in temperature over the last 10,000 years . …
Here ’s the current temperature over here and what you see is that for most of the last 10,000 years the world has been warmer than it is at the present .
You could in fact argue that the world has cooled down for the last 3,000 years . ”
Student : “ Is this a representative : does that say everything about the whole world ? ”
Ball : “ That ’s a good question … All you can say is that it is representative of Greenland and possibly the northern hemisphere .
You really should n’t extrapolate this beyond the northern hemisphere . ”
Oops .
A geographer with no background in atmospheric physics , Dr. Ball has nevertheless distinguished himself as , at the very least , an avid hobbyist - as someone who has read enough about climate science to have begun to understand the overwhelming case for concern about anthropogenic warming .
If you ’re looking for an explanation as to why he is not convinced , however , he ’s happy to explain ..
First , he puts up a slide with a quote attributed to the one - time Petro - Canada CEO and longtime United Nations supporter Maurice Strong : “ Is n’t the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse ?
Is n’t it our responsibility to bring that about ? ”
( I have no idea as to the authenticity or this quote .
It ’s all over the internet , but I have never seen it in context . )
At 1:11:00 , Ball goes on to proclaim that Strong is the single - minded , single - handed leader of a world - wide scientific conspiracy .
Ball says of Strong :
“ He set up the United Nations Environment Program , out of which came the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , and the whole idea of climate as a vehicle for shutting down industrialization . ”
A couple of minutes later , at 1:14:46 , a student challenges :
“ So we have a lot of climate scientists graduating from UVic , so I ’m just wondering at what point somebody comes up to you and says here ’s your indoctrination to destroy all the industrialized countries in the world through promoting climate change .
It seems a little crazy .
That just sounds more like a conspiracy theory to me . ”
Ball : “ Yes , of course , I have always been accused of being a conspiracy theorist .
I prefer to call it a cabal .
C - A - B - A - L : it ’s a group of people who have a particular political agenda … and they use a vehicle to achieve that .
That ’s certainly what ’s gone on with the IPCC . ”
So , there you go : the entire world climate science community is populated by patsies who have been recruited by an 80 - year - old former oil executive with a secret plan to shatter civilization .
That explains everything , then , does n’t it ?
For decades , geeks were ostracized , picked on , laughed at and punished by the sun ’s harmful UV rays .
But there is only so long that a people can be kept down before they rise up against their oppressors ; and , indeed , the dawn of the 21st century has seen the ascendancy of geeks and geek culture .
We now celebrate that rise to power–and let ’s face it , nerds pretty much run everything now –with w00tstock , a special event for geeks of every stripe .
Television host / special - effects artist Adam Savage ( “ MythBusters ” ) , actor / author / blogger Wil Wheaton ( “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” , “ Stand By Me ” ) and music - comedy duo Paul and Storm ( hey ; that ’s us ! ) present a night of songs , readings , comedy , demonstrations , short films , special guests , and other clever widgets born from and dedicated to the enthusiasms , obsessions , trials and joys of geek pride .
This is the dawning of the Age of Geekdom–and its voices will ring true at w00tstock .

Adam Savage has spent his life gathering skills that allow him to take what ’s in his brain and make it real .
He ’s built everything from ancient Buddhas to futuristic weapons , from spaceships to dancing vegetables , from fine art sculptures to animated chocolate — and just about anything else you can think of .
The son of a filmmaker / painter and psychotherapist , Adam has been making his own toys since he was allowed to hold scissors .
Having held positions as a projectionist , animator , graphic designer , carpenter , interior and stage designer , toy designer , welder , and scenic painter , he ’s worked with every material and process he could get his hands on — metal , paper , glass , plastic , rubber , foam , plaster , pneumatics , hydraulics , animatronics , neon , glassblowing , mold making and injection molding , to name just a few .
Since 1993 , Adam has concentrated on the special - effects industry , honing his skills through more than 100 television commercials and a dozen feature films , including “ Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace ” and “ Episode II : Attack of the Clones ” , “ Galaxy Quest ” , “ Terminator 3 ” , “ A.I. ” and the “ Matrix ” sequels .
He ’s also designed props and sets for Coca - Cola , Hershey ’s , Lexus and a host of New York and San Francisco theater companies .
Not only has he worked and consulted in the research and development division for toy companies and made several short films , but Adam has also acted in several films and commercials — including a Charmin ad , in which he played Mr. Whipple ’s stock boy , and a Billy Joel music video , “ Second Wind , ” in which he drowns .
Today , in addition to co-hosting Discovery Channel ’s “ MythBusters ” , Adam teaches advanced model making , most recently in the industrial design department at the San Francisco Academy of Art.
Somehow he also finds time to devote to his own art — his sculptures have been showcased in over 40 shows in San Francisco , New York and Charleston , W.Va .
Wil Wheaton ’s successful acting career began in 1986 with acclaimed roles in “ Stand By Me ” and “ Toy Soldiers ” .
He continued to build his resume through his teen years as series regular “ Wesley Crusher ” on “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” and opposite Robin Williams in “ Flubber ” .
But Wil is much more than just an actor ; he ’s an author , blogger , voice actor , Columnist for the LA Weekly and Suicide Girls , widely - followed Twitter user , and a champion of geek culture .
Wil currently splits his time between acting and writing .
He has recently appeared as serial killer Floyd Hansen on “ Criminal Minds ” , comic book publisher Miles Sklar on “ NUMB3RS ” , and as the voice of Ted Kord , the Silver Age Blue Beetle , on “ Batman : The Brave and the Bold ” .
He ’s published three acclaimed books : “ Just A Geek ” , “ Dancing Barefoot ” , and “ The Happiest Days of Our Lives ” .
His latest book is “ Sunken Treasure ” .
All of his books grew out of Wil ’s immensely popular , award - winning weblog , which he created at WIL WHEATON dot NET and currently maintains at WIL WHEATON dot NET : in Exile .
While most celebrities are happy to let publicists design and maintain their websites , Wil took a decidedly different turn when he started blogging in 2001 .
He designed , coded , and maintained WWdN entirely on his own , until he “ blew up ” his sites ’ database in 2005 and moved his blog to the TypePad service .
In 2003 , Forbes.com readers voted WWdN the “ Best Celebrity Weblog . ”
Wil ’s blog was chosen by C|Net for inclusion in their 100 most influential blogs , and is an “ A ” lister , according to Blogebrity.com .
In the 2002 weblog awards ( the bloggies )
Wil won every category in which he was nominated , including “ Weblog of the year . ”
In 2007 , Wil was nominated for a Lifetime Achievement Bloggie , alongside Internet powerhouses Slashdot and Fark .
In the 2008 weblog awards , Wil was voted the “ Best Celebrity Blogger , ” and in 2009 Forbes named him the 14th most influential web celebrity .
This is all amusing to Wil , who does n’t think of himself as a celebrity , but is instead , “ just this guy , you know ? ”
WIL WHEATON dot NET : In Exile started out as a backup blog for WIL WHEATON dot NET .
Until
Wil gets busy repairing and rebuilding WWdN , it ’s his home away from home , where he is not a number , and is a free man .
Paul and Storm
Paul and Storm have been writing and performing funny songs together for a long , long time , starting with their stint together in a cappella band Da Vinci ’s Notebook .
Their music tends to make people laugh and feel good , and Paul and Storm believe that this makes their pursuit noble , right and just .
BONUS : their live show is better than 1,000 Fonzies , and more spellbinding than Mr. T on a unicycle .
Anyone with ADD will appreciate the broad range of territory that Paul and Storm cover in their music …
Chicken nuggets .
Love .
Boxing nuns .
Relationships .
Pirates .
Friendship .
If James Taylor were on fire .
Catchy melodies and well - constructed music underpin the comedy , and in live performance their harmonies draw comparisons to the Everly Brothers , while their stage presence evokes the Barenaked Ladies .
They will do nearly anything to win the hearts and minds of their audiences , and often throw Twinkies , Moon Pies and / or other snack cakes into the crowd to help seal the deal .
Occasionally , panties are thrown back .
Paul and Storm often tour in support of Jonathan Coulton , and their music is often heard on the “ Bob and Tom ” syndicated morning radio show , and has been featured on “ The Drew Carey Show ” , Comedy Central , XM Satellite Radio ’s “ Dr. Demento ” show , on the popular web cartoon site Homestarrunner.com , and throughout the YouTubes and internets .
High - Speed Rail to Improve Social Cohesion and Economic Competitiveness
March 14th , 2010 by Zachary Shahan
High - Speed Rail ( HSR ) attracts a lot of positive attention because of its speed , of course .
But is this speed only about saving time and having fun ?
No .
It is about expanding economic competitiveness and improving social cohesion as well .
Research from Europe shows that we can praise HSR for doing just these things , .. there , at least .
But how does this research transfer to the US situation .
In the unveiling of the recent HSR budget allocation , Obama stated , “ In France , high - speed rail has pulled regions from isolation , ignited growth , remade quiet towns into thriving tourist destinations . ”
This statement is backed up by a report from the European Union ’s ESPON 2013 program .
But the report found much more than that .
The report , titled “ Trends in Accessibility “ , found that “ Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) per capita was strongly linked to the potential accessibility in 7 out of 10 European regions ” — meaning that “ regions with high accessibility are most often more economically and competitively successful than remote and isolated regions ” — and that the development of new HSR infrastructure in recent years has greatly benefited the potential accessibility of numerous European regions and cities .
Basically , you need good transportation connections to be economically competitive .
With trains , automobiles and planes each having their own advantages and disadvantages , creating a good multi-modal network ( a network that includes good road , rail and air options ) is the most effective tool for creating a more economically competitive nation , region or city .
And with rail not getting the attention it deserved for awhile ( neglected for roads and air transport ) , investment in it now is bringing high rewards .
Europe as an Example
For Europe , the EU comes to this simple but important conclusion : “ Low level of accessibility remains for many regions due to disparities in multimodal accessibility ( as combined working of air , rail and road transport ) that continue to exist in Europe .
This affects the competitiveness of these places . ”
Investment in HSR in Europe has increased accessibility and improved economic competitive in regions beyond its traditional core area ( e.g. Tours , Lyon and Marseilles in France and Berlin in Germany ) , but those regions it has not yet reached remain at a disadvantage .
And as I wrote about yesterday , countries across Asia and the Middle East ( and led by China ) are looking to improve their economic situation through a massive cross-continental HSR project ( potentially the largest infrastructure project in history ) .
They see the clear advantage in having better HSR connections .
Connecting to Europe via fast rail is an important goal for them .
In addition to connecting and improving economies , improved accessibility ( spurred on by HSR investments ) has also helped to connect people , to create more social cohesion , and to stimulate social capital in Europe .
This is a less tangible benefit but one that is , nonetheless , very important .
Now , Transferring this Knowledge to the US
Of course , I can hear the cries now — “ the US has a totally different transportation history and transportation structure than Europe ! ”
Yes , this is exactly the point .
The US has a history of heavily favoring road and air transport .
That has resulted in some major benefits , but also in some major cons or costs .
I think it ’s time for the US to realize that it needs to develop better rail networks , and better multi-modal transportation networks overall , to improve its economic competitiveness and social cohesion .
Luckily , I ’m not the only one and the federal government has dished out billions of dollars to stimulate exactly this .
Nonetheless , cities and regions taking the lead on this themselves could benefit considerably from it .
Mixed with other factors , of course , it could help them to be leaders within the US economy and I think it could help the US economy as a whole to be more competitive in the global marketplace .
Some stimulus money from the federal government is not going to be enough to get the US rail network up to a high standard .
Local and regional government as well as the private sector need to invest in it as well .
On top of that , making sure investments transfer into truly better accessibility and really improve the places they serve is a complicated matter .
The details of good HSR investments and practices is something I hope to come back to in numerous future articles over the coming months .
For now , I think it is important to realize that HSR can definitely translate into a better economy and a more connected society .

According to new age beliefs , your aura is like a magnet picking up vibrational energies that are all around you in an energy field .
This field around your physical body is known as your aura .
It is important to cleanse your aura freeing it of foreign vibrations and negative energies .
Your aura can experience and exhibit stress , fragmentation , and a loss of luminosity .
There are physical and mental ways to cleanse your aura .
Take a look at the various ways .
Mental Cleansing
One of the best ways to cleanse your aura is to visualize it and mentally rid yourself of the negativity that may be swirling around you .
Sit in a quiet , distraction - free zone in your house .
Stay seated comfortably in a position you can relax in for about 15 minutes while practicing breathing exercises .
Remain conscious of what you are doing .
Be aware of your inhales and exhales .
You can even meditate .
Once you find yourself beginning to totally relax , form a white light in your mind and have it surround you .
Allow it to flow throughout you , from the tips of your toes to the top of your head and visualize it moving up and down your back .
Comb Your Aura
Another visualization exercise that is combined with a physical action is to comb your aura .
The way to to do this is to wash and dry your hands thoroughly .
Spread your fingers into a comb and comb through the space surrounding your body starting at your head continuing downward to the toes .
Afterward , clean your hands again with running water allowing all combed up energies to be washed away .
Cleanse with Water
Water has wonderful aura cleansing and energy healing properties .
You can either physically wash with water or just visualize water washing over you cleansing your energy .
While in the shower or under an outdoor waterfall , allow the water to flow generously over every inch of your body : head , face , arms , torso , legs , and feet .
As you watch the water disappear down the drain breathe freely and imagine all your troubles and stress flowing away from your mind along with the water .
Treating yourself to a salt water soak is a good way to give your aura a really good cleanout .
Salt has wonderful healing properties for the body .
An Epsom salt soak or a swim in salt water does wonders for your aura .
The cleansing properties of the rain on the earth are likewise beneficial for cleansing auras .
Walk outdoors in the rain , look up to the sky as you breathe the humid air and allow the raindrops to caress your face .
A word of warning , do not do this during an electrical storm .
That is not the energy rejuvenation you are looking for .
You can also meditate that a waterfall is flowing over you , instead of water , white light envelopes you and washes away negativity , pain , grief or sadness and cleanses you , refreshing you , making you sparkle .
Allow the cleansing to make you feel whole and full of light and beautiful energy .
Wind , Sun , and Play
The word " aura " in Latin and ancient Greek means wind , breeze or breath .
Likewise , you can use the wind to help cleanse your aura .
When it is windy out , try simply standing outside facing the wind , arms outstretched .
Close your eyes and let the wind whip around you , removing and transforming challenging and stuck energies into pure positivity and exhilaration .
Free your mind and run freely and playfully in the wind .
Feel free to give your body a spin on a grassy lawn or meadow .
This is particularly effective on a sunny day , the sun can be energetically purifying as well .
Feather Whisk
Another physical tool you can use to cleanse your aura are feathers , particularly owl or turkey feathers .
Using a single feather or a feather whisk , make sweeping motions through the space surrounding your body .
Begin at your feet and work upwards , much like a bird would fly from the ground to the top of a tree .
Ask a friend to assist by sweeping your backside or any areas around your physical being that you cannot reach easily .
Smudge Your Aura
The smudging ritual is a Native American one , where smoke from dried white sage or other herbs is used to cleanse the aura .
Light the end of the smudge stick or bundle and wait until the flame goes out .
The stick will be left smoldering and producing smoke .
Encircle the stick around your body , reaching up and down and front and back as far as you can .
The smoke will cleanse your energy as it penetrates your energy field .
Herbs that are helpful to use for aura cleansing can include sage , lavender , sweetgrass , or other smudging herbs .
You can also gently breathe in some of the smudged air .
Protect Your Aura
Once you have cleansed your aura , you need to protect it from negative energy .
One way to protect yourself is to make sure you surround yourself with more positive people than negative ones .
Find positive people who always have a smile to offer and have kind souls .
These people can help offset negativity in your aura .
If you still feel like you have negative energy , look inward .
Start paying attention to your thoughts .
Are there a lot of negative feelings ?
Focus on the bright side of things .
If you are having a really bad day , it is OK to express your feelings , but do not wallow .
Make your day better .
Fill it with something fun , exciting , or fulfilling .
If you notice that a negative thought is trying to creep in , confront it with a positive one .
If you keep practicing this , you will be able to conquer the effects of negative thinking .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Reagan ’s deepest and most profound legacy to the right wing today , to the Tea Party , to the populist right is a selection of wry quips about the inefficacy and incompetence of government told with a grandfatherly charm .
“ In this present crisis , government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem ! ” he said .
“ Government is the problem ! ” the placards at populist right wing gatherings now read .
This grotesque anti-government view regularly embraced and advocated by the populist right is incoherent , ignorant , and idiotic .
It is the intellectual equivalent of blaming “ The Man ” or “ Them ” for all problems .
While a ( sometimes even paranoid ) distrust of centralized power has always been part of American politics , the populist right today has elevated this sentiment to their core principle .
It ’s great efficiency as a rallying cry is that it papers over differences between the few but influential libertarian - minded who oppose government power on principle and the more numerous right wingers who see liberal government as an attack on their culture .
What they both agree on ( while a Democrat is in charge at least ) is that the government is the problem .
This political coalition is animated primarily by anti-government rhetoric .
While on some level it is a mere ideological trope , fervently believed only by the ignorant , used to rally the base to a revolutionary fervor and to create party unity , it has taken on the patina of truth in the eyes of so many it must be challenged .
Government is not inherently bad , inefficient , incompetent , destructive of liberty , or even liberal .
Instead government is probably the single most influential force for good in our daily lives , acting in ways barely noticed even as its absence and failures would be and are noticed .
Friedrich Hayek , that great right wing theorist , said in his speech accepting the Nobel prize for economics , that the government had erred in attempting to engineer society .
The proper role of government , Hayek believed , was that of a gardener tending her garden rather than of an engineer creating a machine .
The populist right has bastardized this critique of Hayek ’s and taken to demonizing the gardener while praising the garden as the greatest great thing since great things began to get greater ( as Sean Hannity often says . )
What is lost in the populist right wing view is that our society , our economy , our nation , this greatest great thing ever , would not exist without the government tending it .
I have been challenged – with apparent seriousness – to name anything the government ever did that was worthwhile .
In fact , the greatest product of the government is America itself – which , though like a garden has many individual parts , is given coherence by the gardener .
The government has 4 main roles in shaping our nation :
1. Government acts as a check on corporations .
Corporations exist to make profits – and as such externalize as many costs as they can ; history has demonstrated that given the choice between doing the moral thing and doing the profitable thing , corporations will do the profitable one .
This is n’t to say they are evil – it is merely to acknowledge their nature .
Thus , given a choice between polluting the communal air and taking expensive steps to reduce that pollution , corporations have chosen to pollute .
The costs of their actions are diffused while the benefits and profits are concentrated .
Given the vibrancy of America ’s market economy and the growing power of corporations , this is perhaps government ’s most important role : to ensure that corporations have the incentive to make the moral choice .
Most often this is accomplished with regulation , which though demonized by the populist right , is essential to America ’s vibrant society and free market .
Regulation is what allows us to open a can of beans without finding a human finger , to buy a standard mortgage and know our rights are still protected to some basic degree , to eat poultry without worrying too much over food poisoning , to buy a car and know it has met certain safety requirements , to breathe fresh air and to drink clean water .
We can do all of this because of government regulation acting as a check on corporate greed .
2. Government underwrites social order .
While the government is not present at every moment in our lives , it underwrites a certain type of order and undertakes to ensure that certain elements of a partially unspoken social bargain are upheld .
For example , the government provides courts of law to resolve disputes and employs people to prosecute crimes .
It has undertaken various steps to prevent terrorist attacks .
It maintains regulations as above .
When there is a crisis , the government assumes greater powers and responsibilities to protect the status quo and restore order .
3. Government makes long - term investments in the nation .
While corporations and individuals control most investments , the government has , since its inception , funded various long - term projects from investments in infrastructure to space travel to education to medicine to military technology .
These investments have led to everything from sending men to the moon to creating the internet .
4. Government provides certain services .
From subsidies for the elderly ( Social Security ) to disability and unemployment benefits to disaster relief to cheap postage , to – soon – a transparent and standardized marketplace for health insurance – the government provides a selection of valuable services that are important yet under - served by the marketplace dominated by corporations looking for large , quick profits and non-profits that are often underfunded .
The internet itself is a great example of the role government plays in our lives .
It was based on technology created by government scientists .
It was enabled by government regulators who prevented AT&T from blocking access to their infrastructure which would have choked off the internet before it began .
Access to the internet making it more widespread has been enabled by government programs as well as individual and corporate decisions .
( For a neat list of how the government affects everyone on a daily basis , take a look at this article by Douglas J. Amy . )
This view of government is inherently liberal , even as the goods provided can be more broadly appreciated .
Without government , there would be no rule of law , no free market , no corporations ( which are government - created entities ) , no property , no freedom of speech or religion or assembly .
Individuals without the protection of government have the freedom their power allows them to seize .
With the careful use of government though , restrained and judicious , individuals can be empowered .
Liberalism , like the conservatism of William F. Buckley , Friedrich Hayek , Edmund Burke , Dwight Eisenhower , and even Ronald Reagan , is not about extending the role of government everywhere .
It is the path between seizing the commanding heights of the economy and the anti-government hysteria of the populist right in which the government is used to empower individuals :
Liberalism in a market - state must exhibit a preference for the individual over the corporation and government and must empower individuals against bullying and coercive measures of these large institutions .
Sometimes that means the government must be constrained ; and sometimes that means it must use its power to balance against other forces such as large corporations .
Government , used wisely , is good and the creator of free markets and the guardian of individual freedoms .
This is n’t just a liberal idea or a conservative one .
It is an American idea – indeed , the base of our American system .

I have used the terminology this way so it may better function as a response to the populist right which generally speaks of “ the government ” when they mean only the federal government .

The talking heads on all the major news shows keep telling us that the U.S. economy is experiencing a recovery .
Usually the term “ recovery ” is accompanied by a qualifier such as “ jobless ” , but they continue to use the word recovery anyway .
We are told that the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression is behind us and that the great American economic machine is roaring back to life and everything will be back to normal soon .
So why does it seem like things keep getting worse ?
Why does it seem like the American Dream is out of reach for more Americans than ever ?
Why does it seem like economic pain is spreading to more families and more businesses ?
Well , maybe it is because things are getting worse .
Gallup ’s underemployment measure hit 20.0 % on March 15th .
This was up from 19.7 % two weeks earlier and 19.5 % at the start of the year .
While the U.S. unemployment rate has leveled off ( for now ) , the truth is that job seekers are increasingly finding that all they can get is part - time work .
In the vast majority of cases , part - time work will not pay the mortgage or even really feed a family .
All of this economic pain is causing havoc in many American households .
In fact , 1.2 million U.S. households have been lost during the recent recession as economic pain has forced many Americans to move in with relatives .
It can be an extremely humbling thing to have to turn to relatives for help , but that is what an increasing number of Americans have been forced to do .
But now there are indications that things may soon get worse for the U.S. economy .
The Federal Reserve is pulling its emergency financial supports from the U.S. financial system , and this is leading some economic analysts to speculate that deflation could be on the horizon .
Already there are signs that the American economy is slowing down .
The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that consumer borrowing declined by $ 11.5 billion in February .
But it just is n’t consumer borrowing that is slowing down .
The biggest banks in the U.S. cut their collective small business lending balance by 1 billion dollars in November 2009 .
That drop was the seventh monthly decline in a row .
As the U.S. economy slows down , the U.S. government is going to look to U.S. taxpayers to pick up the slack .
According to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , the United States will soon have to make difficult choices between higher taxes and reduced social spending .
Higher taxes or reduced government spending ?
Maybe both ?
Either of those alternatives is not good for the U.S. economy .
And the burden of taxation is falling on an increasingly smaller pool of taxpayers .
It turns out that about 47 percent of all Americans will pay no federal income taxes at all for 2009 .
The 47 percent who pay no taxes either earned too little or they had so many credits or deductions that they were able to avoid taxes altogether .
It must be nice for them .
Meanwhile , the faith of the American people in the financial system continues to wane as more evidence of corruption keeps coming out .
In fact , there are new allegations that JPMorgan Chase has been involved in gold price fixing .
Many have suspected for a long time that there was some really funny business going on with gold prices , but the latest bombshells that have been dropped by whistle blowers are absolutely mind blowing .
But it is about time that we learned more about what is going on at these major banks .
After all , they know so much about us .
For example , it has come out that the data mining operations of the major credit card companies are becoming so sophisticated that they can actually predict how likely you are to get a divorce .
Is n’t that lovely ?
Big Brother is watching .
And this is only just the beginning .
With the stated intent of combating illegal immigration , Senators Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham are creating new legislation that would institute a national identification card .
Will we all soon be forced to take a national identification card with us wherever we go ?
Will we all soon be forced to show “ our papers ” whenever we are confronted by authorities ?
Let ’s hope not .
But things are getting really crazy out there .
So many of the things that we used to take for granted are quickly disappearing into thin air .
What in the world is happening to America ?
Washington ( CNN ) -- Benjamin Franklin gets a facelift as the Treasury Department unveils a new $ 100 bill Wednesday , the first remake of the denomination since 1996 .
The new design for the $ 100 note made its debut during a 10:30 a.m. ceremony at the Department of the Treasury 's Cash Room attended by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
" The $ 100 note is the highest value denomination of U.S. currency in general circulation , and it circulates broadly around the world , " according to a statement from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing .
The denomination is popular when large amounts of cash need to be carried internationally .
Anti-counterfeiting measures are the main reason the United States has been making changes in currency .
The currency changes started in 1996 with the $ 100 bill , followed by a new $ 20 bill in 2003 .
The $ 50 bill got an overhaul in 2004 , and the $ 10 was redesigned in 2006 .
The $ 5 bill was upgraded in 2008 .

After a year - and - a - half long financial autopsy , the Senate investigations subcommittee today is exploring the demise of the Washington Mutual , once among the US ’ largest thrift banks with more than $ 330 billion in assets and the largest bank failure in American history .
The hearing will include testimony from former WaMu executives like CEO Kerry Killinger , president Stephen Rotella , past risk officers , and the former president of the Home Loans division at the heart of WaMu ’s stunning meltdown .
The beginning of the end , as the Senate ’s investigation suggests , came in 1999 , when WaMu snapped up a subprime lender named Long Beach Mortgage Company .
Long Beach was a major player in the booming securitization business — the origination of loans to be bundled into bonds backed by those pools of loans .
These mortgage - backed securities were then sold to Wall Street banks and the two government - sponsored housing corporations , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
In 2006 , Long Beach injected a staggering $ 30 billion in subprime loans into the securitization machine , a sixfold increase from only three years before .
And by churning out subprime loans to less qualified homeowners , Long Beach fit perfectly into WaMu CEO Killinger ’s goal , echoing that of executives like Citigroup ’s Sandy Weill , of making WaMu into a supermarket bank , a one - stop shop for customers of all stripes .
Another key date , as the Senate investigation shows , was 2005 , when WaMu and Long Beach , as shown in an internal WaMu PowerPoint presentation , settled on a strategy called “ gain on sale . ”
That strategy essentially stressed how much more profit could be made on riskier loans as opposed to government - backed , fixed interest - rate loans , and that these riskier , more profitable products — home equity , subprime , and option adjustable - rate mortgages — could be a cash cow for WaMu .
This cutthroat , purely profit - driven philosophy meant WaMu and Long Beach increasingly pushed their employees , in the early 2000s , to focus more on volume than quality — selling more and more loans with little regard for the underwriting or potential success of those loans .
“ WaMu built its conveyor belt of toxic mortgages to feed Wall Street ’s appetite for mortgage backed securities , ” Levin said .
“ To keep the conveyor belt running and feed the securitization machine on Wall Street , Washington Mutual engaged in lending practices that created a mortgage time bomb . ”
The scope of that fraud is staggering .
As an April 2008 memo from a WaMu internal fraud investigator says , a sales employee “ admitted that during that crunch time some of the Associates would ‘ manufacture ’ asset statements from previous loan docs , ” and that the pressure to churn out more loans was “ tremendous . ”
Salespeople were told to do “ whatever it took ” to pump out more loans to feed WaMu ’s securitization frenzy .
“ In WaMu ’s loan business , volume was king , ” Sen. Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , chair of the investigations subcommittee , said .
The full - steam - ahead mentality to subprime lending , both in WaMu ’s prime lending operation and Long Beach ’s subprime machine , inevitably led to shoddier and grossly fraudulent practices within WaMu .
So bad was the fraud that when another internal WaMu review analyzed the loans sold by two top offices , both in southern California , the audit found 58 percent and 83 percent of the loans , respectively , sold by the two offices were marred with fraud .
Yet , as Levin pointed out , “ virtually none ” of the recommendations to rein in such fraud included in that review were ever implemented .
Moreover , WaMu ’s bank regulator , the Office of Thrift Supervision , said Long Beach loans “ have horrible performance ” ; between 1997 and 2003 , Long Beach recorded among the highest net credit losses in the nation , according to the OTS .
In the fall of 2006 , WaMu ’s capital markets chief , David Beck , told the head of the Home Loans divisions that “ LBMC paper is among the worst performing in the [ market ] . ”
“ Audit after audit detailed problems , ” Levin said .
In 2005 and 2006 , Long Beach was forced to repurchase more than $ 875 million in loans , lost $ 107 million on defaults for the few loans still on its books , while also spending $ 75 million to compensate for a shortfall in repurchasing reserve , Levin said .
In 2007 , WaMu shut down the troubled Long Beach and made it a direct subsidiary of WaMu .
The damage , though , had already been done , and both Long Beach and WaMu ’s prime and subprime assembly line and shoddy lending practices sowed the seeds of the $ 300 - billion bank ’s demise .
Not only did the losses incurred by Long Beach damage the bank , but the collapse of the securitization machine meant WaMu ’s housing profits all but dried up .
At the same time , WaMu ’s stock plummeted 88 percent throughout 2008 , leading federal regulators in September 2008 to seize the bank and arrange a shotgun marriage with JPMorgan Chase .
( That tailspin did n’t stop Killinger from making , between 2003 and 2007 , anywhere from $ 11 million to $ 20 million each year . )
“ Because volume and speed were king , loan quality fell by the wayside , and WaMu churned out more and more loans that were high risk and poor quality , ” Levin said .
“ Washington Mutual was taken in by the short - term profits that ever poor quality mortgages generated on Wall Street . ”
That ’s a very brief overview of the Senate investigation subcommittee ’s findings , but there ’s far , far more to their hearing on WaMu , which is going on throughout the day .
Check back for more updates on WaMu , including testimonies from the president and CEO of WaMu during its subprime heyday .
The wait has been painful , but come August , it 'll be over — the wait , anyway .
The Venture Bros. is returning and creator Jackson Publick has let slip a sneak peek at what 's to come .

Over on his blog , Publick drops a whole mess of science .
Namely that the show will be back at some unspecified date in August — which he knows sucks .
" Do n't blame the network , " Publick writes .
" They could n't get it on much sooner than that if they tried .
Why ?
Because we suck . "

He adds , " we think you 're going to really dig these next eight episodes .
We seem to have re-embraced the show 's sci- fi / comic book / adventure roots , and as much as it was a struggle to write them , they 're a whole lot of fun .
Lots more development of Hank and Dean , lots of new characters , and lots of old faces returning both triumphantly and trivially . "

The Martin Jetpack can have you in the air , flying 100 km per hour , and getting 50 km out of its 5 gallon tank .
Your own personal flying machine .
Jet packs … they had one in Lost in Space .
In the 1960s .
Yes , it was just a TV show , but surely there should be some sort of Moore ’s Law type of rule between the worlds of cheesey movie and TV sci- fi and real life , that dictates that by now we should all be jetpacking it here , jetpacking it there , jetpacking it everywhere .
But no .
We ’re flat bang in a cesspool of jetpacklessness , mightily let down by the boffins .
Or are we …
Cut to New Zealand , present day , real life .
New Zealand , the land of sheep , rugby and chilly bins , and crazy extreme sports where you jump off high things , and roll down large hills in big plastic balls .
Or , live the jetpack dream .
Inventor Glenn Martin has been in research and development on his jetpack for 30 years .
In 1998 he founded the Martin Aircraft Company , with an aim of building “ a jetpack that could fly 100 times longer than the 26 seconds of the Bell Rocket Belt ” .
The Bell was first flown in 1961 , and is the device that really did popularise the jetpack in the 1960s and 70s , and even made an appearance at the 1984 Olympic Games opening ceremony .
Indeed , it is the very model that appeared in Lost in Space .
A thrilling concept was the Bell , but at 26 seconds the thrill passed all too quickly .
In 2005 Martin built his 9th prototype , and it is this model that you can buy and fly .
It was at this point that Martin achieved the target flight time , and had the device at a point at which it could be commercially built .
How does it work ?
The Jetpack has no rotors , and is designed to be torque neutral .
It runs on a low vibration , V4 two stroke , 2 litre engine , giving 200 hp @ 6000 rpm – a motor developed from the ground up for the jetpack .
There are two hand controls , one controlling pitch and roll , the other controlling yaw and the throttle .
Safety features include a internal roll cage , a carbon kevlar hoop for side impact protection , and the structure extends below the level of the spine to prevent injury from a hard landing .
Oh , and the machine has a Ballistic Parachute system , just in case of ‘ catastrophic failure ’ .
It runs on standard petrol , and the 5 US gallon tank should carry you about 50 kilometres , at a speed of just over 100 kilometres per hour
Video demonstration
Video demonstration of the Martin Jetpack ?
Done .
It ’s a controlled indoor demonstration , I suspect the Martin Jetpack Company is still a little way off from demonstrating the jetpack at full speed in an outdoor environment .
UPDATE 30 MAY , 2011
This week the Martin Jet Pack was taken up to 5000 feet – here ’s the video of the flight :
Who can fly the Martin Jetpack ?
First thing you need to know is that in order to buy a Martin Jetpack , you are required to complete the Martin Aircraft Company approved training program before you can pick up your wondrous new toy .
Secondly , there is a body weight requirement .
You must weigh more than 63.5 kg and less than 108.9 kg .
Whether or not you need a licence is dependent upon regulations for ultralight aircraft in your particular country .
And you have to think that if this mode of transport does take off , governments worldwide will want to be stepping upo the regulatory aspects , for reasons of safety , and of potential revenue from licences .
If you ’re thinking of getting a Martin Jetpack can I suggest that your research involve more from the Iron Man end of the spectrum than the Greatest American Hero .
Actually , it ’s a condition of purchase that you do a flying course , so you can go back to watching Iron Man as a movie instead of a documentary .
Price and availability
Further to the paragraph above , “ Who can fly the Martin Jetpack ” , the first answer is , those with a good bank balance .
James Bowker , the Martin Aircraft Company ’s Simulation Engineer , tells me that “ we estimate the initial sale price for the recreational version of the Martin Jetpack will be around US $ 100,000 .
We will be ready to take orders soon with deliveries from 2011 ” .
You must pay a 10 % deposit upfront to book your production slot , as apparently is standard in aviation circles , and then make progress payments throughout the manufacturing process .
All going well , oder taken , production line fine - tuned , the company would expect the price to drop , “ from an initial cost will be about the same as a high - end motorcycle or car .
As volume increases this will drop to be similar to a mid-range motorcycle or car . ”
And the the time period from order time to delivery ?
Approximately 12 months .
The future of jetpacks
How do Martin see the future of jetpacks ?
From their website :
“ Some people will use these for work ; most of us will not be able to do this for some time .
The automobile has too many advantages for most people , some still ride motorcycles , but the majority prefer the comfort of a car .
In addition , with the current air traffic control system commuting would not be possible .
The US FAA is currently developing a “ highways in the sky ” technology ; basically 3D highways based on automated GPS tracks .
Initial tests have been positive but the full system is not likely to be implemented for at least 10 years . ”
If I learnt nothing else from researching this , I found it incredibly interesting that the US FAA is looking at getting ready for a Blade Runner - type transporting future .
Specifications
We 'll be honest with you -- it literally pains us to write this .
If you 're the queasy type , we 'd probably suggest scrolling on down and continuing about your day .
For the hardcore still with us , the story goes a little something like this : a Denver - area man headed out to his local Apple store to pick up an iPad for a colleague ( read : not even for himself ) , and in an interview , he admits to not even really understanding the fascination with Apple 's new product .
After doing his good deed and plopping down the plastic , he casually curled the strings atop the Apple bag around his hand as he headed for the exits .
Unfortunately , a pair of thugs met him along the way , yanking the bag , the iPad and all of the flesh surrounding his pinky finger as they bolted for a getaway .
Currently , police are investigating surveillance footage in hopes of tracking down the crooks who pulled off the stunt ... and , uh , a bit more than they likely bargained for .
Video after the break if you 've still got the stomach .

PAN - Querétaro pagará multa en abonos Querétaro , Qro. El gobierno estatal acordó con el Partido Acción Nacional ( PAN ) que éste pagará en plazos ( a más tardar en cuatro años ) la multa de 6.2 millones de pesos que el Instituto Electoral de Querétaro le impuso por rebasar el tope de financiamiento privado en las campañas electorales de 2009 , que era de 6 millones de pesos .
El dirigente estatal del PAN , Ricardo Anaya , sostuvo que su partido no puede pagar la multa en una sola exhibición , pues recibe cuatro millones de pesos al año por concepto de prerrogativas estatales .
Aunque el IEQ impuso la multa , el gobierno estatal es el recaudador y distribuidor de los recursos públicos ; por ello la administración estatal cobrará la sanción .

Ordinary Outcomes of Extraordinary Recklessness

" Not only are new buyers taking out bigger mortgages , but existing owners have increased their mortgages to turn capital gains into cash which they can spend .
Housing booms tend to be more dangerous than stock market bubbles , and are often followed by periods of prolonged economic weakness .
A study by the IMF found that output losses after house - price busts in rich countries have , on average , been twice as large as those after stock market crashes .
The economic damage this time could be worse than in the past because house prices are more likely to fall in nominal , not just real terms .
The whole world economy is at risk .
" New , riskier forms of mortgage finance also allow buyers to borrow more .
According to the ( National Association of Realtors ) , 42 % of all first - time buyers and 25 % of all buyers made no down - payment on their home purchase last year .
Indeed , homeowners can get 105 % loans to cover buying costs .
And increasingly , little or no documentation of a borrower 's assets , employment and income is required for a loan .
" Interest - only mortgages are all the rage , along with so - called ' negative - amortisation loans ' ( the buyer pays less than the interest due and the unpaid principal and interest is added on to the loan ) .
After an initial period , payments surge as principal repayment kicks in .
In California , over 60 % of all new mortgages this year are interest - only or negative - amortisation , up from 8 % in 2002 .
The national figure is one - third .
The new loans are essentially a gamble that prices will continue to rise rapidly , allowing the borrower to sell the home at a profit or refinance before any principal has to be repaid . "
The Economist ( London ) , June 18 , 2005
The first thought that the above quote might provoke is - why would I begin a weekly comment by quoting an economic analysis that is nearly 5 years old ?
Two reasons .
First , it should be evident that the recent credit crisis did not emerge as some unpredictable surprise , but was instead the very ordinary outcome of extraordinary recklessness .
Though the mounting problems in 2005 were utterly ignored by the stock market for more than two years after this analysis was published , the fact is that even with the recent rebound , the S&P 500 remains below where it was in mid-2005 .
Overvaluation and reckless lending do not always translate into near - term market weakness , but they invariably haunt investors in the form of poor long - term returns .
Second , I 've chosen a 5 - year old analysis of mortgage lending specifically because the Alt - A ( no documentation ) and Option - ARM ( negative amortization ) loans discussed by the Economist commonly sported reset dates 5 years into the loan terms .
So the observation that " payments surge as principal repayment kicks in " is not an event that was occurring then .
Rather , it is an event that has just begun to occur with loans now hitting their resets .
And while current ARM interest rates are only about 4.5 % , these mortgages now demand a combination of interest plus principal repayment , on a loan balance that is most likely well above the current market value of the home .
This is likely to be onerous relative to a previous payment that was less than the interest alone .
Below is a slightly different schedule we 've seen .
It does n't show the first round of sub - prime resets that ended in early 2009 , and is based on different classifications , but is largely consistent with the overall profile we can anticipate .
I should note parenthetically that as you read reports about the mortgage and credit markets during the next few months , it will be extremely important to pay attention to the time period being discussed .
For example , we are seeing articles with very recent datelines that are drawing conclusions based on relatively pleasant data from the fourth quarter of last year , which reflects the end of the reset lull that was completed with the low in September .
To reiterate what the reset curve looks like here , the 2010 peak does n't really get going until July - Sep ( with delinquencies likely to peak about 3 months later , and foreclosures about 3 months after that ) .
A larger peak will occur the second half of 2011 .
I remain concerned that we could quickly accumulate hundreds of billions of dollars of loan resets in the coming months , and in that case , would expect to see about 40 % of those go delinquent based on the sub - prime curve and the delinquency rate on earlier Alt - A loans .
Notably , by 2005 , the credit score allowed on Alt - A loans fell to about 620 , which is consistent with sub -prime .
And not surprisingly , the later in the housing bubble the loan was made , the higher the delinquency rate has been right out of the gate .
The earliest data we will observe in terms of Alt - A and Option - ARM loans will be driven by the relatively small initial round of resets that began in November of last year .
That implies that any data prior to February is relatively clean of these effects .
What we are interested in is the extent to which we observe a spike in 30 - day delinquencies in data beginning about the February - March time frame .
The size of the delinquency effects is likely to increase through the year , back off in the first half of 2011 , and then reach their final peak in late 2011 .
Emphatically , we do not need to work through the whole reset cycle in order to accept market risk .
But significant damage in the stock market is often taken in the " recognition phase " where troubling reality departs from optimistic expectations .
On that front , I am doubly concerned here because on the basis of an ensemble of fundamental measures ( normalized earnings , revenues , book values , dividends ) , the only points between the pre-Depression period and the late - 1990's when the market has been so richly valued were November - December 1972 ( before a 2 - year market loss of about 50 % ) , and August - September 1987 .
The hostile yield trends I noted last week ( The Rubber Hits the Road ) only amplify that concern .
The Strategic Growth Fund is fully hedged at present , and would be even on the basis of current valuations and yield pressures alone .
We now have our put options in a " staggered strike " configuration , which essentially uses about 1 % of assets to raise the strike prices of our protective index puts .
This is the most defensive position the Fund has held since the 2007 peak .
Importantly , the added risk of this position , relative to that of a " plain vanilla " fully - hedged stance , is only about 1 % in option premium .
As always , the primary risk when we are fully hedged is the potential for our stocks to behave differently than the indices we use to hedge ( this difference has also driven the bulk of the Fund 's returns since its inception ) .
Given that we currently observe conditions that have previously been followed by market declines of 10 % or more within a period of several weeks , I view a very tight defense as important , but I do n't expect that we will maintain this level of defense for a significant length of time .
We are not relying on a decline , but we certainly are defending against the potential .
As I 've noted before , getting past the window of the next few months will relieve a great deal of the " two data sets " uncertainty that we have faced recently .
We are far less concerned about the possibility of marginal new highs in the indices over the near - term than we are about the likelihood of unsatisfactory long - term returns , and the potential for an abrupt " air pocket " based on valuations , overbought conditions , and yield pressures , not to mention the very palpable risk to the " all clear " thesis that investors not only take for granted , but have now priced stocks to depend on .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks was characterized by now strenuous overvaluation , strenuous overbought conditions , and hostile yield pressures .
Under those conditions , even positive market breadth has not typically been sufficient to produce positive market returns , on average .
As usual , however , every Market Climate we define contains both positive and negative returns , so it is important to recognize that our investment stance here is based on the average outcome that has accompanied similar historical conditions , and is not based on a specific forecast of where the market is going in this particular instance .
Even in post - war data featuring no major credit strains , the record of outcomes has been decidedly poor when we 've observed similar overvalued , overbought and hostile yield conditions , but as always , we deal with average return / risk profiles , not specific forecasts .
Nothing would make life easier here than to get a second wave of credit strains out of the pool of potential outcomes .
It is unfortunate and at times uncomfortable that we can't rule this out , because I would much prefer to behave as if we were in a normal postwar recovery .
Granted , it would n't change our current position any , given the valuations and yield pressures we observe , but it would allow us more flexibility to accept market risk than we 've had in recent quarters .
Needless to say , I am looking forward to the clarity that the coming months should bring , regardless of the extent to which a second round of credit strains proves to be a concern .
For now , we would be defensive on the basis of valuations , overbought conditions , and yield pressures alone , but our vigilance is amplified by the possibility that the data may depart shortly from the comfortable recovery path that investors now assume .
In bonds , the Market Climate last week was characterized by relatively neutral yield levels and unfavorable yield pressures .
We continue to carry an average duration of about 4 years in the Strategic Total Return Fund , primarily in straight Treasury notes .
I continue to expect that in the event of fresh credit strains , safe haven demand for Treasury securities will tend to outweigh the effects of substantial deficits and new supply over the intermediate term .
Longer - term , I expect that we will tend to accumulate commodities and inflation - protected securities on substantial price weakness .
Despite near term pressures on the U.S. dollar ( which tend to boost commodities ) , I expect that we 'll have enough safe - haven demand and fresh deflation concerns to establish longer - term exposures at better valuations than we see at present .

Hikikomori asked what they would do if their parents , for most their only source of income , were to die overwhelmingly gave responses such as “ commit suicide ” or “ starve to death . ”
An Osaka University researcher studying the uncertain number of hikikomori Japan harbours soon discovered many hikikomori regarded the only way out of their miserable parasitism was death .
He found that amongst the “ first generation ” hikikomori , now aged 40 - 45 , many will over the next decade face the prospect of losing their parents as they begin to succumb to old age , and perhaps more importantly their pensions will no longer exist to support them .
Asking these hikikomori what they would do were their parents to pass away , he found the majority of answers were along the lines of “ commit suicide ” or “ starve to death , ” with only a small minority prepared to finally enter society as working adults .
Indeed , he claims that cases of hikikomori suicide for this reason have begun to come to light , not welcome news for a nation experiencing record levels of suicide .
Generally , the only way hikikomori are thought to be able to sustain themselves is through lavish parental indulgence , as Japan ’s benefit system is inadequate to sustain such indolence for any great length of time .
With Japan ’s ballooning population of pensioners desperately concerned about whether they will be able to extract enough taxes from the shrinking younger generations to support their lavish pensions , it seems media hysteria about hikikomori , NEETs and freeters is only set to grow .

EXCLUSIVE : By all appearances , Zachary Adam Chesser was the boy next door .
He played football and was on the crew team at one of the best high schools in the country .
He even studied Japanese .
He was hardly the sort of boy you 'd expect would suggest on a radical Islamic website that the creators of the edgy cartoon series " South Park " will be targeted for death .
But Chesser also had a dark side .
He was a " loner , " a former classmate said , one who frequently drew pictures of Satanic figures in his notebooks and had just a few friends , most of them male .
" He was definitely sort of weird , " the classmate told FoxNews.com .
" He was very into violent industrial music , borderline Satanic bands and stuff like that .
He had dark undertones in his interests . "
Two years later , Chesser is literally a changed man .
He now uses an alias and has a new set of hobbies .
He now likes to be called Abu Talhah Al - Amrikee , and his primary interest in this world appears to be Islamic radicalism .
Last week , Chesser , 20 , posted a warning on the website RevolutionMuslim.com following the 200th episode of " South Park , " which included a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad disguised in a bear suit .
The young man , who just two years ago was studying foreign languages at George Mason University , wrote on the site that Trey Parker and Matt Stone , the cartoon 's creators , " will probably end up " like Theo van Gogh , a Dutch filmmaker who was murdered in 2004 after making a film critical of Islamic society .
" It 's not a threat , but it really is a likely outcome , " Chesser told FoxNews.com from his home in Centreville , Va .
" They 're going to be basically on a list in the back of the minds of a large number of Muslims .
It 's just the reality . "
Comedy Central declined to comment for this story .
However , in a June 22 , 2009 , interview , Doug Herzog , the president of MTV Networks , admitted that Comedy Central caved to political and commercial pressure when the channel censored a 2006 episode of South Park featuring Mohammed — and he said if given a chance to do it over again he ’d do it differently .
“ The real story was the story you know , which is that the guys wanted to depict Mohammed and the network would n’t let them .
And that was the whole story , " Herzog told conservative writer Ben Shapiro , who posted excerpts of the interview Friday on BigHollywood.com .
" And while I think if we had to do it all over again we would do it differently , that was the decision we made at the time .
And I regret it somewhat but I ’ve made worse decisions in my life . ”
What seems to bend reality is what has happened to Chesser .
The school he attended , Oakton High School in Fairfax County , Va. , was ranked the 103rd best high school in the country by Newsweek in his graduating year and was ranked 88th by US News & World Report the year before .
Among the schools alumnae is 1984 graduate Michaele ( Holt ) Salahi , better known as the White House dinner party crasher .
Chesser 's background offers nothing to suggest that he would recently have eloped and married a Muslim woman he met in college , a woman who has given birth to their baby boy , according to neighbors .
While there is no evidence that Chesser became radicalized while at George Mason , there were " dark overtones in his interests " for years , dating back to his years in middle school and high school .
Chesser 's longtime classmate , who requested anonymity , said he did not overtly express an interest in converting to Islam while in high school .
But given Chesser 's past as a loner who sought to create conflict , she said she was hardly surprised to learn what 's become of him .
" I was initially pretty surprised because you never suspect someone you 've known for so long to put out something like that , " she said in reference to Chesser 's web posting .
" But once I thought about it , I was n't really surprised .
There was definitely a ' loner thing ' about him .
He had an interest in being controversial and saying crazy things . "
Chesser 's interests -- hardcore industrial music , Goth and Satanic materials -- appear to have translated " pretty well to violent extremism , " the classmate said .
[ UPDATE :
In the original publication of this article on April 23 , it was reported that Chesser lives with his mother , brother , wife and son in Centreville .
Chesser 's mother , Barbara Chesser , says her son , daughter - in - law and grandson live in another town in Fairfax County .
She says that her son has not lived with her since August 2008 and that her daughter - in - law and grandson have never lived with her . ]
His parents are divorced , but they maintain an amicable relationship .
His involvement in Revolution Muslim is largely unknown in his hometown , neighbors told FoxNews.com .
" They 're very isolated people , " said a neighbor who requested anonymity .
" His mother is very friendly , though .
They say ' hi ' when I see them , but they do n't get personal with anybody . "
The neighbor , a devout Christian , said she was scared and surprised to learn that Chesser has posted messages calling for the murder of Jews and , most recently , the deaths of Parker and Stone .
" You have me sweating here , " she told FoxNews.com .
" I think he 's really brainwashed to even think something like that .
His family is not violent at all .
" I am so shocked .
I really think he had to have been brainwashed into something like that .
Zac was a very nice boy .
I would never have even associated him with something like this , to do anything harmful . "
She said she will maintain more of a distance from the Chessers now , " because we 're Christians … .
It 's kind of sad that American people are falling into this .
It 's sad that he would be influenced to try to hurt people . "
Richard Kolko , a spokesman for the FBI , declined to confirm or deny that the bureau is investigating Chesser 's post or Revolution Muslim .
He said the FBI will continue to investigate threats made on the Internet to determine if potential exists for those threats to be carried out .
NYPD Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has said law enforcement officials in New York , where the group is based , do not consider last week 's posting " as is currently assessed " to be a crime .
But the Anti-Defamation League 's Center on Extremism has had the group on its radar since its inception in 2007 , Director Oren Segal told FoxNews.com .
" This is just the latest in a long line of threats coming from Revolution Muslim , " said Segal , who noted a poem posted on the site in October asking God to kill all the Jews .
While the group has only about 12 members , Segal said a " leadership vacuum " has allowed Chesser to become an emerging figure in the fringe fundamentalist organization , which has staged protests at New York mosques .
And he said he is worried that Chesser 's post may incite others to violence .
" The group itself is a relatively small group , but the reach this group has by posting materials online is virtually limitless , " Segal said .
" You never know who is going to react to this type of material or carry out some sort of attack based on what they 're reading .
Frankly , I do n't think we have the luxury to dismiss this type of rhetoric . "
He said the ADL has learned that Chesser is interested in starting a Revolution Muslim chapter in nearby Washington .
Ibrahim Hooper , a spokesman for the Council on American - Islamic Relations , characterized Revolution Muslim as a loosely - organized group with such outrageous beliefs he believes it may be a " setup " to smear Islam .
" They say wild and irresponsible things periodically , " Hooper told FoxNews.com .
" There 's a strong suspicion that they 're merely a setup to make Muslims and Islam look bad .
They say such wild and crazy things that you have to wonder . "
Chesser , for his part , declined to indicate exactly what led him to join the group .
A faculty member for George Mason University 's Muslim Student Association said he had no knowledge of Chesser , who began attending the school in fall 2008 before dropping out in his second semester .
Reached by FoxNews.com via e-mail on Thursday , Chesser said one of his goals in writing for the group is to " raise awareness of the correct understanding of key Islamic beliefs . "
But he also warned : " If you kill us , then we kill you . "
" I seek to help the world understand that neither the Muslims in general nor the mujahideen including Al Qaeda are abject to peace , but that this peace come with the following conditions : a complete withdrawal of non-Muslim forces from Muslim lands , an ending of the propping up of the apartheid regime of Israel , and a ceasing of the propping up of the brutal dictators we currently have who refuse to rule by divine law , " Chesser 's e-mail read .
" I also seek to help the world understand that there will be no peace until the above conditions are met .
Basically the formula works like this … if you kill us , then we kill you .
If you do not kill us then we can have peace .
9/11 had nothing to with freedom or democracy .
It had to do with the murder of hundreds of thousands of Muslims around the world by American and other powers . "
In a separate post on RevolutionMuslim .
blogspot.com , which now serves as the group 's main website since RevolutionMuslim.com has been shuttered , Chesser quoted Usama bin Laden when referencing why reactions are required when anyone insults or belittles the Prophet Muhammad .
" As Usama bin Laden said with regard to the cartoons of Denmark , " Chesser wrote , " ' If there is no check in the freedom of your words , then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions . ' "
Junior Kyle Singler announced Monday night that he will remain at Duke for his senior season , ending weeks of speculation about his NBA future .
Singler , a 6 - foot - 8 swingman , was projected to go anywhere from the middle of the first round to the beginning of the second in the upcoming NBA Draft .
By choosing to return for a fourth season in Durham , Singler will hope to improve his potential draft position and make himself a certain lottery pick .
And as far as his team is concerned , Singer ’s return — coupled with that of Nolan Smith and the addition of Seth Curry , Kyrie Irving and the rest of a highly touted recruiting class — the Blue Devils figure to be the favorite to defend their national title next season .
“ I love being here at Duke and am excited about next year , ” Singler said .
“ I had two great options in front of me , but I did not want to miss out on all of the great things to come in a senior season . ”
Singler averaged 17.7 points and 7.0 rebounds per game in 2009 - 2010 and peaked during Duke ’s NCAA Tournament run .
The junior played some of his best games in the postseason , earning Final Four Most Outstanding Player honors for his performance in Indianapolis as Duke won its fourth national championship .
And Coupons To Help You Afford It .
Losing weight is n’t a hard process if you know the right way to do it .
However , there is a lot of confusion and misinformation out there about what you should do to lose weight .
The truth is that sustainable weight loss requires a combination of the right diet and exercise .
And it can be expensive to eat right .
You can make it easier with some bodybuilding .com coupons from CouponFly.org , but even then , it can make your budget tight .
Supplements can help your weight loss results , but they are not replacements ( at least , according to science ) .
We ’ll show you how and when you should eat , exercise , and take supplements .
As a thank you for reading , we ’ll even supply you with some recommendations for delicious hot beverages to enjoy on your weight loss journey .
If you find it easier to exercise while listening to music , here are some top-rated picks for headphones .
Let ’s take a look at what you ’ll have to do to achieve your weight loss goals .
Diet
Diet is the most important part of weight loss .
It can also be the most difficult aspect of your routine to master .
Even professional athletes are constantly refining their diets to find the perfect balance for their body .
However , as a beginner , even a small amount of effort will help .
Generally speaking , you want to get most of your calories from whole foods .
Avoid anything processed if you can .
Whole foods tend to give you much more nutrients for fewer calories .
You should aim to consume a large amount of protein .
Eat about 1 gram of protein per pound that you weigh in order to preserve and build up your lean muscle mass .
This lean muscle mass will raise your metabolism , allowing you to burn more calories at rest .
It will also make you look much better as the pounds come off .
The rest of your calories should come from unsaturated fats and a good amount of complex carbohydrates from sources such as potatoes and brown rice .
You will need to eat fewer calories than you are using throughout the day , but you should n’t allow your calorie count to get too low .
Allow for no more than a 500 Calorie deficit per day .
Eating 200 Calories fewer per day should be ideal .
Exercise
Many people are under the impression that they should avoid lifting weights and only do cardio when trying to shed fat .
In fact , the fastest way to lose fat is through a combination of cardio and resistance training .
It ’s also important to lift heavy when losing weight .
Your goal should be to find a weight for each exercise that you can lift no more than eight times per set .
Three sets for a particular exercise should suffice .
Although eating too few calories may make it so that some people ca n’t put on muscle , if you are a true beginner , you may find that you can build muscle even when eating in a caloric deficit .
It is also important to do enough cardio when losing weight .
You should be able to do some amount of cardio every single day , even if it is a little bit .
Do as much as 45 minutes of low - intensity cardio after your lifting session .
You should also do some high - intensity interval training on some of the days that you do n’t lift .
This type of exercise entails performing a brief period of intense cardio followed by a slightly longer period of low - intensity cardio .
You then alternate your high - intensity and low - intensity segments a few more times for the rest of the session .
Since interval training can be very demanding , you should limit yourself to two HIIT sessions a week .
There are many components to a good weight loss program .
Diet , cardio and resistance training are all vital elements that will put you on the fast track to your perfect body .
You should also remember that fitness is a lifelong process .
Do n’t beat yourself up if you miss a workout or have a cheat meal .
If you ’re putting in the effort , you ’re ahead of everyone who ’s still sitting on the couch .
Perhaps the most important step of the process is to find a way to keep yourself accountable without using shame as a tactic .
There should n’t punishment for ‘ screwing it up ’ , you should find ways of positive reinforcement for encouraging the habits and behaviours that you want .
One way that ’s really helpful is to share with others what you are doing .
Perhaps you find a friend to go for walks with , or you set yourself up a blog to chronicle your journey .
You will find that other people will be there to cheer you on and you ’ll be more motivated to keep going !
PORTLAND , Me .
First through the door of the Portland Community Health Center on Thursday morning was a stick figure of a man , oblivious to the homemade signs and the White House advance team across the street .
He had a bald eagle drawn on his sweatshirt , a street - hard weariness in his eyes , and a throbbing pain in his right hand .
Sarah Andel , a nurse practitioner , knew this man , James Hierl : how he lived in a shelter ; how his depression made eating seem futile .
As she held his numbed hand , working to remove a painful wart with a blade , she coaxed and coddled him :
You have to eat ; you have to see your psychiatrist ; and please , James , eat .
“ You ’re going to come back in a week , ” Ms. Andel said , as her patient headed for the door , finger bandaged , cheeks concave , looking older than his 53 years .
“ O.K. , James ? ”
Mr. Hierl gave a hesitant nod .
Soon he was out on Park Avenue , where a line was forming outside a brick bandbox called the Portland Expo .
The reason : President Obama was to speak there in the afternoon about new health care legislation that , among other things , will provide a huge increase in money — $ 11 billion — to community health centers like this one .
David Letterman was suffering from both a hoarse voice and a cold last night , and his main guest , comedian Chris Rock , saw that as an opportunity to mercilessly mock the talk show host 's messy personal life :
" Dave , what the hell happened to your voice ? "
Rock asked .
" You 're still doing the show ?
You 're a rich man , you could just go home ! "
Then Rock sniped , " Wife still mad at you , ai n't she . "
Rock also joked that Letterman had " fired all the cute girls " that used to be backstage .
Now it 's just " a bunch of fat old guys , " he lamented .
Of course , Letterman had a comeback for that .

David Cameron is using his election campaign to plug firms which back his cynical National Insurance policy .
He has been pictured at firms such as Jewson , run by bosses who support his plan to halt an NI rise .
Meanwhile , a new poll shows the Tory lead has slipped to 3 % .
The Tory Party has always looked after its big - money backers .
But it has rarely done it as blatantly as David Cameron has over the past two weeks .
Since the election battle began , the Tory leader has been seen at B&Q , Warburtons , Bestway , Fuller ’s brewery and Jewsons – and has often been ­pictured with the relevant company ’s logo clearly visible .
Nothing unusual there .
Apart from the fact the chief executives of all these firms have publicly backed the Tories ’ cynical attempt to win votes by promising to halt a scheduled rise in National Insurance .
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne has also got in on the act by visiting the headquarters of easyJet , whose founder Sir Stelios Haji - Ioannou also supports Mr Cameron ’s NI policy .
Labour MP Stephen Pound yesterday said such an obvious payback for the bosses ’ support was cynical in the extreme .
He added : “ We have always said that David Cameron is a salesman but jetting off around the country promoting Tory donors and endorsers is taking things a little too far .
“ It goes to show that he who pays the piper calls the tune . ”
But one advertising expert said Mr Cameron ’s efforts to associate himself with the firms was unlikely to sway voters .
Dave Trott of CST Advertising said : “ Short of wearing a flat cap and walking around with a whippet , there is no way he could be more obvious about what he is attempting to do .
There is no one on the planet that does not know all that stuff is just a cheap PR stunt . ”
Mr Cameron kicked off his campaign at a B &Q store in Hayes , West London , on Thursday 1 April .
The DIY firm is owned by Kingfisher whose chief executive Ian Cheshire and deputy chairman John Nelson have both backed the Tory policy to halt NI hikes .
On Tuesday 6 April Mr Osborne visited an easyJet hangar in Luton .
Both Sir Stelios and chief executive Andy Harrison support ­Conservative tax policies .
The day after , Mr Cameron held a ­question and answer session with staff at Bestway Cash & Carry in Cardiff before travelling to ­Warburtons ’ bakery in Bolton for another photo opportunity .
The boss of Bestway , Zameer Choudrey , was one of the original signatories to a letter to the Daily Telegraph on March 28 endorsing the Tory NI policy .
Since 2005 , he has donated £ 138,852 to the Conservative Party through his business .
Warburtons chief executive Richard Warburton is also among the business leaders to back the Conservative plans .
This week the Tory leader chatted to staff at Fuller ’s brewery in West London and was photographed against a backdrop featuring the company ’s logo .
On the same day , Monday 12 April , he went to a Jewson store in Reading .
Michael Turner , the chief executive of Fuller , Smith & Turner Plc and Peter Hindle the boss of Jewson both endorse the Tory tax policy .
And during his manifesto launch yesterday Mr Cameron name - checked Sainsbury’s .
The boss of the chain , Justin King , also backed calls to halt the NI rise .
Mr Osborne claims he will fund the £ 6 billion cost of halting the NI increase by reducing government waste .
But Labour says his “ back of the envelope ” figures do not add up .
The party has worked out the Tories would have to find £ 12 billion efficiency savings on top of the £ 15 billion already being planned by the Government .
It warned that the gap would have to be filled either by a VAT rise of 5 % or savage public service cuts , both of which would hit pensioners and the poor hardest .
Independent expert Gerry Grimstone said : “ Incoherent attempts to deliver efficiences will damage the services people rely on in times like these . ”
The Conservatives yesterday said of Mr Cameron ’s appearances : “ It is hardly surprising since the evidence shows huge numbers of businesses are backing our National Insurance policy . ”
Bestway said : “ David Cameron was in the area and he decided to call in at a Bestway as he wanted somewhere he could hold a meeting . ”
Warburton said : “ We were asked to host a meeting .
If any other party wanted to visit our bakery we ’d be happy to host them . ”
Cities and local governments around the world are beginning to realize that it takes more than a traditional website to get discovered .
Millions of people around the world are touring the planet or searching for businesses through free geospatial tools like Google Earth and Google Maps .
Imagery , terrain , and 3D models all help these virtual visitors to formulate a picture in their mind .
The City of Fredericton uses Google Earth for city planning and other official uses .
They had access to 3D building data so when they learned about Google 's Cities in 3D Program they offered to contribute their data to Google in the hope that it might appear in Google Earth .
In addition to Google Earth , 3D data contributed to Google is used to display 3D buildings in Google Maps , which will benefit anyone trying to find a specific location in the City .
If you 're a city or local government , have access to 3D data , and would like to " get on the virtual map " , we encourage you to learn more by visiting our Cities in 3D Program website .

Fredericton & Cities in 3D Program
Rob Lunn , GIS Coordinator for the City , told us that he discovered the Google Earth 3D building models and SketchUp utility at the GeoWeb Conference in 2008 .
City employees were already using Google Earth for work or personal purposes .
Rob Lunn said , " I knew there was a program to upload data to Google and getting data to Google was a big initiative for us .
We wanted to find avenues to release available data and information to be public at large and the Cities in 3D Program seemed like a perfect solution . "
" We decided to go through the Cities in 3D Program because of time and having Google folks involved helped speed it up .
We want our city to be discoverable through Google as well as through our local website .
But if there are people going straight to Google , we want them to discover it there too . "
History of Sharing
The City of Fredericton has a partnership with the local Military in New Brunswick , Canadian Forces Base Gagetown .
The CFB Gagetown is one of the largest military bases in Canada .
" We provided data for creating models ( building footprints with heights , DEM , aerial photography , oblique angle aerial photography collected by a firm with an ultra light plane and street level photography ) and they built up the data sets .
The group is the Army Learning Support Center for Tactics School and one of the largest bases in Canada , " says Rob Lunn .
This high - tech military group took this model and integrated it into a first person tactics game .
They wanted a real life model for training purposes .
" We also meet PSAB ( Public Sector Accounting Board ) legislation for tracking assets .
From a city perspective , we have to know the tree cover , quantity of trees , park benches , how many meters of sidewalks , how many meters of sewer pipes , etc .
We truly have to know what we have because they have to be accounted for .
There 's an expense and you have to replace the sidewalk , etc .
We have to have a good understanding of what we own . "
Fredericton in Google Earth
" Of course , we 're interested in promoting Fredericton and have people discover the 3D models , that 's wonderful for us .
For staff it is important to be able to see the impact that buildings or other structures ( e.g signage ) have on the streetscape .
Right now , we 're using the models more for tourism and economic development , but plan to expand into more areas .
What motivated us to contribute our data was the opportunity to make the information available to a wider audience through a tool ( Google Earth ) that they are already using .
Over 100 photo - textured 3D buildings in Fredericton were added to Google Earth in January 2010 .
The buildings included government offices , commercial buildings and parking structures .
To visit Fredericton , download Google Earth and search for " Fredericton , Canada " and make sure the " 3D Buildings " layer is checked .

The “ truly outstanding beard ” photo set first appeared on all about beards on September 24 , 1997 .
In the years that followed , the “ truly outstanding beard ” photos generated more reader response than any others in the history of the all about beards site .
As the very first featured beard , Dennis the “ truly outstanding beard ” will always be number one !
Back in 1997 , it was exceedingly rare to see a full beard so dense , with such tremendous coverage , and such an astonishingly luxuriant mustache .
That ’s why so many people reacted to the sight of Dennis ’ beard with utter astonishment .
With the greatly increased prevalence of beards in the mid-to - late 2010s , even bigger beards have become more common , although they certainly remain the exception rather than the rule .
So while the photos of Dennis the “ truly outstanding beard ” may not have the same impact today that they had in 1997 and several years afterward , many all about beards readers still view his beard with the respect that a legendary beard deserves .
Dennis ’ “ truly outstanding beard ” remains one of the all - time greats .
The “ truly outstanding beard ” photos were taken exclusively for all about beards .
Before digital cameras and smartphone cameras became ubiquitous , photos were taken with cameras using something known as film .
The film had to be taken somewhere for processing and was returned as a set of negatives and prints or a set of slides .
A friend of Dennis and fan of all about beards shot the photos on film and contacted all about beards , volunteering to send color prints that could be scanned for use on the site .
And the rest is beard history !

UPDATE 8:53 PM : Quotes from Lappy , via the Flyers .
“ They do n’t want any bleeding in [ my brain ] .
If you start bleeding in your brain it ’s not good , " he said .
" We ’re hockey players and take pride in playing through injuries , but that ’s one thing I just ca n’t afford to do for the sake of my family .
Trust me , I want to be out there .
I ’m mad about that . "
“ I ’m not mad about the play .
That ’s the play I make a living with , and I ’m going to do that play again , " he said .
" I did it 10,000 times in my career and I ’m going to do it again .
It ’s a matter of bad timing , I guess .
Right now , I ’m going to be a cheerleader , and if my teammates need anything I ’m going to do it for them .
I ’ll be right there cheering them on to the Stanley Cup Finals . ”
“ I have a family to think about .
I ca n’t be selfish about that one .
The ending of that injury , if it goes wrong , there ’s no worse and you ’re dying on the ice .
That ’s one thing I do n’t want to put my family through and I ’m not willing to take that chance .
[ Flyers trainer ] Jim [ McCrossin ] and the organization wo n’t take that chance , either . ”
UPDATE 6:30 PM : Anthony SanFillippo of the Delco Times passed along the news to us that Laperriere will be out for at least a month .
Holmgren has said it 's likely he 's done for the year .
According to SanFillippo , Jon Kalinski and Andreas Nodl will likely both be in for the Flyers , though that is not set in stone just yet .
Losing Simon Gagne and Jeff Carter was a big blow , but this is quite possibly one of the biggest .
Ian Laperriere is out indefinitely with a brain contusion and a slight concussion , according to the team .
Who knows if that means the rest of the season or not , but he obviously wo n't be around for the start of the second round .
He saw several doctors over the course of the last few days , and Paul Holmgren said the most recent visits " erased any optimism " the team had about his status .
We all know how tough Lappy is , but the way he was hit with that puck could sideline anybody .
You can't fault the guy here at all , and we know this must be really bad if it 's keeping him out of the lineup in the playoffs .
It 's a crushing blow to this team .
We wrote the other day how important blocking shots and playing solid team defense were in the Devils series .
In that sense , losing Laperriere is one of the worse possible losses for the Flyers in these playoffs .
Is it the end of the road ?
No , it 's not .
We do n't know exactly when Lappy will return , but if he 's out for the entire second round or even the entire season , the Flyers can still beat whoever they face .
But whether that team is the Caps or the Bruins , the Flyers are going to really have to cut down on the penalties now , considering Laperriere is the heart and soul of the penalty killing unit .
This could n't happen to a more likable guy .
It 's really a shame .
Let 's hope the team rallies around it .
The Venting Machine

This particular product is almost too ridiculous to mock .
Upon first seeing it , it may be difficult to believe this actually exists .
Sadly for all of us , it ’s quite real .
In short , the As Seen On TV Hat is a hat ( or visor ! ) with a shade attached to it .
Insert a media player like an iPod or iPhone into the front of it , connect your headphones , and you can view your video in quiet , private comfort .
You know , when described that way , the As Seen On TV Hat does n’t sound so bad …
Ah .
Yes .
Look at that thing !
It ’s like something out of science - fiction .
It would fit perfectly into a dystopian future where humanity is addicted to television1 , oblivious to the world around them .
What sort of features does The As Seen On TV Hat have ?
In addition to providing the choice between a hat or a visor , there ’s also the adjustable HD lens .
This is more commonly known as a magnifying glass .
And better yet -
No .
No , I ’m sorry , I have to stop .
I simply ca n’t waste any additional words trying to detail the stupidity .
Instead , allow me to simply present some pictures from their commercial .
This is how they recommend using the As Seen On TV Hat .
Avoid the wonders of nature !
Get noticed at the gym !
Laugh like a lunatic at the airport !
Or just wear the world ’s most ridiculous hat to the beach !
Maybe the vendors know exactly what they ’re doing .
Perhaps they ’re trying to sell gag gifts or trick grandmothers into buying a worthless product for their iPod- loving gran-WAIT !
Hang on a second !
Is this guy on their site using the As Seen On TV Hat while riding a real bike ?
Ok , they ’re in on the joke .

This is a guest blog by Chris Hazard of Hazardous Software Inc. , the makers of the upcoming time travel RTS , Achron .
Feedback is a part of every day life .
It occurs when the output of something is put back in as input .
Positive Feedback
Imagine that you 're going to a local sporting event on the weekend , and because of a parade you decide to leave extra early .
By doing so , you 've avoided the parade and gotten a better parking spot , which allows you and your friends to get out of the parking lot right after the game concludes and you go to a restaurant afterward and there 's no wait .
Alternatively , imagine you 're running terribly late , you call your boss on the way to the airport because you forgot to bring some important documents to a big meeting and then get into an accident , paying more attention to your call than the road .
You 've now missed your flight , forgotten the documents , and now your boss may rethink that promotion he was about to give you .
Feedback at its finest .
Yes , this was a true Tyson ad campaign .
Feedback at its finest .
Yes , this was a true Tyson ad campaign .
Both of these examples demonstrate positive feedback .
Positive feedback occurs whenever something , good or bad , is amplified .
Negative feedback occurs when something is dampened .
Examples of negative feedback are the wind resistance on a car increasing as you go faster , requiring the engine to work harder to increase your speed , or progressive taxation , where you 're taxed at a higher percentage when you make more money .
Positive and negative feedback are both very important in games too .
Positive feedback , when done right , quickly separates player by their skills and strategies chosen .
A good player may obtain the best items and use them to quickly defeat a less - skilled player who will not have obtained good items .
If positive feedback is too strong , however , the results may be random .
Imagine a first person shooter where you start off with BB guns and there is a single rocket launcher on the level ( with infinite ammo , of course ) .
If a good player makes one mistake , a less - skilled player may still dominate the game .
Negative Feedback
Negative feedback is also important in game design .
Think of the racing games you may have played .
If you 've noticed that the computer players tend to perform better when you 're winning , this is a typical example of negative feedback .
This particular scenario is often referred to as the " elastic band " ; imagine a rubber band keeping the computer players with a certain distance of the lead .
When negative feedback is done right , the player does n't really notice and the game remains engaging and competitive .
When negative feedback is overdone , it can have many bad consequences .
Too much negative feedback can prolong an inevitable loss and frustrate good players by punishing their successes .
If the negative feedback is too strong , it can even yield perverse incentives where good players may intentionally play poorly at the start of the game in order to gain a long - term advantage .
Positive Feedback In Repeated Rounds of Rock , Paper , Scissor
Keeping feedback in mind when designing a game is important , but it does n't end there .
We can actually measure the effects of feedback !
Let 's start with a simple rock - paper - scissors game , where players repeatedly play against each other .
Each round , players always start over , so there are n't really any dynamics to speak of from a game theoretic perspective ( unless we want to model both players modeling each other as non-perfect random number generators , dealing with Bayes - Nash equilibria , but that 's a topic for another discussion ) .
Now let 's make the game a little more interesting .
Suppose that each game is now a series of rounds of rock - paper - scissors that continues until one player has won 4 more rounds than the other .
When a player wins a round , the player gets a powerup that is used during a draw ( when both players play the same move ) .
Whenever a draw occurs , the player with the most powerups wins that round .
Powerups are not lost .
What does this game look like dynamically ?
Let 's first take a look at it in a spreadsheet .
The horizontal axis is each of the game states from player 1's perspective based on the number of points advantage it has over player 2 .
Here we 're looking at the relative strengths of the players , so if both are tied , they still remain in the center .
To read the graph , first look at the current game state , then look up to see the probability that the next game state will be , as represented by the vertical axis .
To begin the game , players start at 0,0 and have a 1/3 probability of each staying tied or either player having a one point advantage .
If we look at the expected value of the relative power of player 1 for each of the game states and smoothly connect the dots , it looks like the following figure .
The X axis represents the current state : how many more wins the player has than the opponent .
The curve F ( X ) represents the expected state after this round finishes .
The X axis represents the current state : how many more wins the player has than the opponent .
The curve F ( X ) represents the expected state after this round finishes .
This figure is known as a Cobweb diagram .
You start at a state on the horizontal axis , trace your finger vertically up to the point on the curve for that point on the horizontal axis , then trace your finger horizontally to the diagonal line , and then trace your finger vertically up or down to the curve again .
The lower - left corner means a loss and the upper - right corner means a win .
If you keep tracing your finger , you 'll trace out the dynamics of the game .
When you have real games that may have hundreds or thousands of discrete states and continuous positions , a continuous curve is much easier to visualize .
Games that have probabilistic results , like our rock - paper - scissor variation , do not yield such clean results either .
This curve is the expected value of the game dynamics , and so a particular game may not follow it exactly ; this game begins at a fixed point , but once a player wins or loses , it jostles away from the center .
You could plot a colored region around the line to show all possibilities .
Fixed points are very interesting properties of feedback systems .
A fixed point occurs whenever the output is exactly what is put in .
The above figure has 3 fixed points , represented where the " next player relative power " function crosses the diagonal line .
Examining these points can tell us how the system will behave .
By looking at the slope of the line at a fixed point ( the derivative of the feedback function , or , in terms of feedback , the maximum component of the gradient with multiple variables ) , we can tell whether it is repelling or attracting .
If the magnitude of the slope is less than 1 , it is attracting , as can be seen on the two endpoints of winning and losing .
If the magnitude of the slope is greater than 1 , the fixed point will repel .
If the slope of the fixed point is 1 , it will neither attract nor repel .
Fixed points that move the output toward the extremes yield positive feedback , whereas fixed points that move the output closer to the center yield negative feedback .
Further , the sign of the slope tells whether the value will flip back and forth or stay on one side .
This rock - paper - scissors variation , is dominated by positive feedback , as all 3 fixed points move the output toward the extremes , without flipping to another side of any fixed point .
Now , let 's take a look at a game that is n't so orderly .
In this game , both of the fixed points are repelling .
Even more , the fixed point in the upper right will cause the relative power to flip sides .
This means that a player will build up power slowly and then lose it quickly .
If the power is influential to the player winning , then this can be a fun gameplay aspect .
Instead , if a good player does n't want to do any better because he / she knows that the power will be lost , a player may just sit there waiting for a particular opportunity to arise .
An example of this is if a player lost all ammo and weapons if they picked up one clip too many .
Mathematically speaking , game dynamics like this are chaotic , which may be a good or bad thing depending on the specific game and circumstance .
Obviously figuring out these graphs and dynamics for nontrivial games is n't nearly as easy as figuring it out for a simple rock - paper - scissors variation .
The trick is to abstract away what relative power means , which can be a heuristic metric that combines player health , items , weapons , positioning , etc .
The game 's AI can be used to plot an approximation of this graph .
The AI starts off with each possible relative power configuration ( sampling and techniques such as design of experiment can be important here , especially if you have a lot of items ) , and plays until it has attained a new relative power .
These data points can be combined visually to see an approximation of the feedback in your game .
The approximation will be as accurate as the AI is at behaving like humans , so you need to take care when analyzing the actual data .
This model may be extended to encompass player skill as well by having some or all of the probabilities be a function of player skill .
Thanks Chris for your awesome post .
I had been aware of the basic concept of feedback but it 's great to see how it can be analyzed in a quantitative framework .
If you have n't heard of Achron yet , I recommend checking it out .
A lot of people have thought about adding time travel as a mechanic to games but I do n't think anyone has gotten it right for a multiplayer RTS before .
These guys are even going so far as to embrace the grandfather paradox as a feature .

This is a little gallery of children 's drawings copied and painted realistically by Dave Devries as part of a project called Monster Engine .
What 's Monster Engine ?
The opposite of an angel caboose , silly !
Eleven years ago Dave Devries started the Monster Engine project with one single question :
What would a child 's drawing look like if it were painted realistically ?
The process is simple .
I project a child 's drawing with an opaque projector , faithfully tracing each line .
Applying a combination of logic and instinct , I then paint the image as realistically as I can .
My medium is mixed -- primarily acrylic , airbrush , and colored pencil .
Dave admittedly does a great job , but I 'm still convinced most of these kids are , or will soon be , serial killers .
Do n't get me wrong , I 've been known to crush a box of Count Chocula in my day , but -- you see where this is going ?
I hate myself already .
Hit the jump for a whole bunch more .

Iain Bruce , The Real Venezuela : Making Socialism in the 21st Century ( London : Pluto Press , 2008 ) , 240 pages , $ 27.90 , paperback .
“ When Chávez speaks , we listen .
But we do n’t listen to those around him . ”
This comment by a community activist interviewed by Iain Bruce , and integrated into his wonderful exploration of the Bolivarian Revolution from below , points to an essential characteristic — the unique link at present ( “ por ahora ” ) between Hugo Chávez and the exploited and excluded of Venezuela .
Bruce deliberately chooses to look at one side of this dialectical relation , the side of the urban poor , workers , and peasants .
As he indicates in his Introduction , “ readers may be relieved to find only occasional mention of Chávez or the upper echelons of the Bolivarian movement in the central pages of this book .
The aim is to look at the experience of ordinary Venezuelan women and men , and to listen to their voices , as a way of getting inside the process . ”
As a result , Bruce helps us to distinguish speeches from reality , and we get to see what is really happening .
We share not only the exhilaration but also the frustration of those below .
The Real Venezuela began in September 2004 with Iain Bruce ’s arrival in Venezuela as BBC correspondent .
In the course of a year , he visited communities and workplaces to file his regular reports .
Like so many others who have come to Venezuela and were excited by what they heard and saw , he decided to write about it .
But there are several unique points about his account .
First , he is an excellent journalist , filmmaker , and interviewer , able to tell fascinating and important stories through the people themselves .
Second , he came back to Venezuela as an independent observer in 2007 , and returned to the very same experiences he had visited when employed by the BBC ; so , rather than single snapshots , we see glimpses of a process and the pace of change ( or lack of same ) .
Third , compared to many other observers , Bruce is politically sophisticated and able to identify the significance in these minute particulars , not only for the Venezuelan process but also , indeed , for any attempt to build socialism in the twenty - first century .
The first voices Bruce introduces are those of the urban poor in the barrios of Caracas .
Here , as so many know , are great stories of change — the social missions providing access to education and medical care , the land committees , the water tables , and all those institutions that emerged , beginning in 2003 .
We hear about the changes these developments have meant in people ’s lives and how the people themselves identify those changes with Hugo Chávez .
Yet Bruce also reveals that there was a tradition of self - help in these communities , and that they struggled together to build their homes and communities in the “ hills . ”
This , then , was one component of the urban movement — that “ impressive history of self - help initiatives . ”
To that was added a constant “ stream of demands and complaints ” to those above and “ a dynamic of rapid response to each and every opportunity opened up to it from above . ”
Consider , for example , the way people responded to Chávez ’s call for all public institutions to support “ the organised communities ” in regularizing land ownership .
Urban land committees emerged throughout Caracas and other cities , bringing together ( and , indeed , organizing ) their communities .
Here was a basis for subsequent urban organization — e.g. , the health committees and then , later , the communal councils .
The needs driving the urban poor , the enormous social debt inherited from decades of economic deterioration ( plus the neoliberal policies of the 1990s ) , Bruce proposes , is the sea in which Chávez swims .
It is “ one of the secrets of President Chávez ’s political success — for he has shown he knows exactly how to engage with , and build upon , this pre-existing pattern of popular action . ”
That sounds a bit like a classic description of a charismatic populist leader .
But it is a characterization with which Bruce is not comfortable .
Indeed , he comments that many left approaches to the relationship between Chávez and the people are “ haunted by the spectre of populism . ”
Something different is occurring — perhaps captured in Chávez ’s well - known statement : “ if we want to put an end to poverty , we have to give power to the poor . ”
Bruce stresses that “ we need to try very hard to understand both sides of this combination , ” this nexus of centralized policies issuing from Chávez and the “ diverse field of initiatives bubbling up from below , ” and “ we need to try to understand what happens when the two intersect . ”
We begin to understand this as we listen to the successive voices of those who have thrown their efforts into the new cooperatives , development poles like the Fabricio Ojeda Endogenous Development Nucleus , the land occupations of the latifundia , the factory occupations , the famous example of “ co- management ” in ALCASA ( the state aluminum plant ) , and the communal councils .
How can you not be inspired by these stories of people who have never worked before , and are now taking pride in their jobs , people who feel that they are in charge ?
( “ Nobody is the chief here .
We are the owners of our own decisions . ” )
These are the accounts of people looking to a future with hope for their children , community members explaining how and what they learned in the process of participatory budgeting , workers ( in , for example , ALCASA ) enthusing about co-management : “ This is socialism of the twenty - first century .
… It ’s a new , humanist system . ”
But it is also a story of obstacles .
Significant obstacles , including private ownership , a dysfunctional legal system , an old bureaucracy , a new bureaucracy , disinterested and uncommitted Chavist officials , inefficiency , and enemies within .
We hear about these obstacles in the initial accounts of the protagonists in 2004 , but their existence is undeniable from the reports
Bruce hears upon his return , two years later .
Nowhere was there a defeat more obvious than in the case of ALCASA .
Describing the end to co-management in this state company , the workers attributed much of the reversal to the opposition of the managers .
“ The mafia of the old management , ” said one , “ try their hardest to keep as much as possible for their mates in the private sector . ”
But the problem was also that ALCASA had been left alone to make it — rather than being given attention and encouragement at the beginning of the process , which would have then spread to other state sectors .
Instead , it was treated as an orphan .
“ We were left on our own , ” commented another worker , “ isolated and blockaded like Cuba , except our gusanos [ worms ] were still on the inside , not outside . ”
Although not as dramatic , Bruce discovers similar setbacks elsewhere : agricultural cooperatives that did not survive because of lack of support , land titles not delivered , legislation not forthcoming ( as well as inadequacies of the actors themselves — e.g. , “ deeply rooted individualist habits and prejudices ” within peasant cooperatives ) .
He highlights a mix of advances and retreats .
Sometimes the response to the obstacles presented by indifferent and antagonistic officials and managers was to find new ways to fight ( as in the case of the community of Galipan ) .
In other cases , the hopes raised by Chávez were crushed by the lack of progress or opposition .
Describing the demise of many land committees in one community , an activist commented , “ No one is going to waste their time if there is no respuesta [ response ] . ”
As one militant from ALCASA put it , “ when you start to give democracy and power to working people they start to demand results from you .
When they do n’t get results , when you ca n’t solve their problems , you tend to react by withdrawing support from those committees .
So they got marginalized and the workers going to them became disillusioned ; they could n’t see the point and stopped going along . ”
But this was a state company — in a state dominated at the top by Chavists .
The State , the State !
Everywhere we come back to the obstacles within the existing state .
Here is the dilemma that Bruce communicates : tension between popular movements and popular power , on the one hand , and , on the other hand , a state from which there is often “ no respuesta . ”
Protagonistic democracy ( rather than representative democracy ) and new productive relations under the control of popular power , Bruce understands , suggest a vision of socialism “ strikingly different ” from the visions that dominated the twentieth century .
1
Yet we see a realization of that vision coming up against the existing state .
“ Is it possible , ” he asks , “ to envision the emergence of new state structures defending a new set of social interests , alongside or even within the old state which defends the old class interests ? ”
That , indeed , is the critical question emerging from Bruce ’s look at “ the real Venezuela . ”
But it is a question that transcends the Venezuelan case .
“ The central problem for the Bolivarian movement — and perhaps for most conceivable revolutionary processes in today ’s world — is right here : how do you get around the existing apparatus , when you first came to power through it ( that is , you were elected into office ) ? ”
What is the appropriate relationship between this new popular power and the old state — not only in Venezuela but anywhere ?
Here is “ one of the central dilemmas posed by the Bolivarian experience in Venezuela , and potentially by almost any other imaginable transition towards socialism in the twenty - first century . ”
Should the emerging forms of popular power , communal councils and workers councils , “ the seeds of a different kind of state … be regulated , institutionalised , even initiated by laws and regulations emanating from the old state machine ? ”
The answers to this question “ go to the heart of what any socialist democracy worth the name might really look like . ”
2
These are absolutely critical questions .
Of course , all states are not equal , and the Venezuelan state — a rentist state that stands above society and has bred a deep culture of corruption and clientalism — is a particularly hard nut to crack .
3
Precisely because of the character of that state , so much of the Bolivarian Revolution has involved bypassing its organized structures ( as in the case of the missions ) .
4
Is the existing apparatus of the Venezuelan state , then , the obstacle to the realization of socialism for the twenty - first century in Venezuela ?
Certainly , we must be aware ( as Bruce is ) of the obstacles presented by the continuing strength of capital in particular sectors , such as import processing , finance , and the media , as well as the continuing subversion by imperialism and the threat of its intervention ( direct or by proxy ) .
However , insofar as we can listen to the voices of the people through Bruce ’s reporting , this conflict between state and popular power is what they identify as thwarting them !
What stands between them and the realization of the goals of the Bolivarian Revolution , their own experiences tell them , are the bureaucrats and the office - holders — the people they have learned not to trust .
It is why they listen to Chávez but “ not to those around him . ”
But for how long ?
If the real steps toward realization of that vision of socialism for the twenty - first century are frustrated by state / party bureaucrats and officeholders , at what point do grassroots activists conclude that they are wasting their time ?
At what point does apathy set in , even with respect to Chávez ( who , after all , has chosen state ministers and party leaders ) ?
Bruce ends with an expression of hope that the new party insisted upon by Chávez , the United Socialist Party , will satisfy the communities and militants “ fed up with the delays and diversions thrown up by so many officials and bureaucrats , and hungry for an effective expression of their own power and interests . ”
Unfortunately , thus far , that new party has exhibited a powerful tendency to reproduce the verticalism of the state — to become a transmission belt going in the wrong direction .
Nevertheless , something significant is missing from this picture : the other side of the combination of Chávez and the exploited and excluded .
Missing is the response of Chávez to the initiatives , demands , and complaints from below .
To understand the combination , we can’t consider only the voices of the urban poor , workers , and peasants .
We also have to consider Chávez ’s voice and actions , the impulse he gets from below — because that impulse is what keeps people listening to him .
For example , Chávez ’s decision in April 2008 to nationalize Sidor , the large steel firm in the industrial center of Guayana , was a response to the demands of the steelworkers in the midst of a dispute with the company that had been the beneficiary of privatization under a previous government .
Chávez ’s announcement of the nationalization electrified the organized working class in Guayana and elsewhere in Venezuela .5
As Bruce points out , within a few months , the Sidor “ workers themselves had begun to relaunch the discussion about what a socialist company should look like , and how the employees could exercise democratic control within it . ”
But this was really only the beginning of a new dynamic .
The next step occurred with the convening of the workers in the state sectors ( including ALCASA ) of the region in May 2009 , in conjunction with the Ministry of Labor , to begin the development of a socialist plan for Guayana .
Following discussions in their worktables , the reports from the tables began .
And the demands multiplied and became more and more powerful : nationalize the private companies which were supplying inputs ; introduce workers ’ control ; get rid of the managers opposed to workers ’ rights .
The excitement among the workers was contagious ( even for those watching on television ) .
Chávez , present for the reports , sat there , poker - faced , and took notes .
When the reports were completed , the workers got their respuesta .
Chávez announced that the firms in question would be nationalized ; said Guayana would lead in developing a new socialist direction for the country ; and called on the workers to devise a socialist plan within a few months for the heavy industries of the region .
As might be expected , the workers were ecstatic — cheers , tears , hi-fives , and the spontaneous singing of the national anthem was their response to Chávez ’s respuesta .6
Yet this is not the whole story .
The workers did meet and came up with their proposed plan within two months .
Then it all came to a halt .
Once again , the gusanos on the inside paralyzed the process .
And there it could have remained ( depending upon the response of the workers ) .
In July , however , Chávez breathed new life into the socialist plan for Guayana : once again he overruled his local officials .
He convened a televised cabinet meeting , endorsed the plan , and declared that Venezuela now has state capitalism — and you ca n’t have socialism without workers control .
There is a dialectic at work in Venezuela .
The dialectical relationship between Chávez and the masses has driven the process within Venezuela forward so far ; whether it continues , will depend on the initiatives of both sides .
That means the necessity from the top and the bottom to struggle against the obstacles ( many of them there because Chávez has relied upon particular people , to date ) .
Iain Bruce ’s great accomplishment in The Real Venezuela is that he does exactly what he set out to do : “ to look at the experience of ordinary Venezuelan women and men , and to listen to their voices , as a way of getting inside the process . ”
He thereby provides us with essential insights into the consequences of not struggling to go beyond those barriers .

In looking at the viability of the cooperative model , for example , he asks at one point : Could this cooperative survive without the support of PDVSA ( the national oil company ) ?
“ Then again , why should it have to ? ”

5 . Chávez ’s decision in this case involved overruling the local governor and the soon - to - be - former Labor Minister , who had taken the side of the capitalist owners .
6 . The video records placed on the Web by the government information outlets ( and available on YouTube ) naturally present only Chávez ’s speech and the reaction ; this reinforces a picture of gifts from above , rather than demonstrating Chávez ’s response to the demands of workers .
The typical home user running Windows faces the " unreasonable " task of patching software an average of every five days , a security and vulnerability research company said today .
" It 's completely unreasonable to expect users to master so many different patch mechanisms and spend so much time patching , " said Thomas Kristensen , the chief security officer of Secunia .
The result is that few consumers devote the time and attention necessary to stay atop the patching job , which leaves them open to attack .
According to Secunia , of the users who ran the company 's Personal Software Inspector ( PSI ) the last week of January , half had 66 or more programs from 22 or more different vendors on their machines .
PSI is a free tool that scans PCs to produce a list of vulnerable software , but does not itself initiate updates .
Instead , users are directed to the approprite vendor patch site .
Nearly 2 million copies of the tool have been downloaded since Secunia debuted it in 2007 .
After comparing the software portfolios on each machine with the bugs Secunia tracked during 2009 , Secunia determined that the typical user faced nearly 300 vulnerabilities during the year , and with the number of vendors represented on the PC , had to deal with approximately 75 patch incidents annually .
That averages out to a patch action every 4.9 days .
" It surprised us that there were so many applications on the systems , " said Kristensen , " and that then there were so many updates they had to do in a year . "
Also important , he said , was that the typical user had to master 22 different patch mechanisms , one from each of the 22 software makers whose programs were on her PC .
" That 's why we called for software vendors to create a unified patching standard last year , " said Kristensen , referring to a pitch Secunia made at the RSA Conference in 2009 .
The company 's offer did n't go over well .
" A few vendors said ' We want to hear more , ' but a lot just ignored us or turned down the idea outright . "
Rather than wait on software makers to come up with a single patch mechanism -- something unlikely in any case -- Secunia has stepped up to produce a patching tool that will eventually handle 70 % to 80 % of the software on consumers '
Windows machines .
In the next six weeks , Secunia will release a technical preview of PSI 2.0 , which will include automatic updating functionality similar to what Microsoft provides for Windows and other software .
Before the end of the year , Secunia should have PSI 2.0 wrapped up .
" Updating is complicated , and we need to get it out to users so they can give us feedback , " said Kristensen .
PSI 2.0 will be free to consumers .
PSI 2.0 is based on technology in Secunia 's Corporate Software Inspector with Microsoft 's Windows Server Update Services ( WSUS ) , which entered beta in January .
" We want to promote patching , " Kristensen said when asked why Secunia is expending resources on a product it 's giving away .
People know Microsoft 's patch service , Windows Update , but that 's not the only updating mechanism they have to deal with , he continued .
" They have to patch Adobe software three , four times a year , and QuickTime , which is frequently exploited .
That 's why we think this will make a difference . "
Secunia has published a white paper that details its PSI scan findings ( download PDF ) .

Yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Tuesday announced his entry into politics by naming his party , the Bharat Swabhiman , but insisted he wo n’t contest elections .
“ I will join politics to cleanse the system , ” Ramdev said .
Ramdev , whose real name is Ramkishan Yadav , said his party would field candidates in all the 543 Lok Sabha seats in a bid to build a corruption - free India .
“ We will have 7 - 10 lakh members in every district in a year or two , ” he said , adding , “ I will never contest elections and never take up any political position . ”
He said the next general election would be a watershed event , “ when all the corrupt politicians will be wiped out ” once the Bharat Swabhiman andolan becomes a force to reckon with .
“ One of the main objectives of the movement is to end corruption and to bring back more than Rs300 lakh crore of black money from abroad for the country ’s development , ” he said .
Baba Ramdev said the recent arrests of self - claimed spiritual gurus on criminal charges were “ a very big conspiracy ” even if some of them were indeed guilty .
LOUISVILLE , Ky. – Home - school mom Susan
Mule wishes she had n’t taken a friend ’s advice and tried a textbook from a popular Christian publisher for her 10 - year - old ’s biology lessons .
Mule ’s precocious daughter Elizabeth excels at science and has been studying tarantulas since she was 5 .
But she watched Elizabeth ’s excitement turn to confusion when they reached the evolution section of the book from Apologia Educational Ministries , which disputed Charles Darwin ’s theory .

“ I thought she was going to have a coronary , ” Mule said of her daughter , who is now 16 and taking college courses in Houston .

Christian - based materials dominate a growing home - school education market that encompasses more than 1.5 million students in the U.S.
And for most home - school parents , a Bible - based version of the Earth ’s creation is exactly what they want .
Federal statistics from 2007 show 83 percent of home - schooling parents want to give their children “ religious or moral instruction . ”
“ The majority of home - schoolers self - identify as evangelical Christians , ” said Ian Slatter , a spokesman for the Home School Legal Defense Association .
“ Most home - schoolers will definitely have a sort of creationist component to their home - school program . ”
Those who do n’t , however , often feel isolated and frustrated from trying to find a textbook that fits their beliefs .
Two of the best - selling biology textbooks stack the deck against evolution , said some science educators who reviewed sections of the books at the request of The Associated Press .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I feel fairly strongly about this .
These books are promulgating lies to kids , ” said Jerry Coyne , an ecology and evolution professor at the University of Chicago .
The textbook publishers defend their books as well - rounded lessons on evolution and its shortcomings .
One of the books does n’t attempt to mask disdain for Darwin and evolutionary science .
“ Those who do not believe that the Bible is the inspired , inerrant Word of God will find many points in this book puzzling , ” says the introduction to “ Biology : Third Edition ” from Bob Jones University Press .
“ This book was not written for them . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The textbook delivers a religious ultimatum to young readers and parents , warning in its “ History of Life ” chapter that a “ Christian worldview … is the only correct view of reality ; anyone who rejects it will not only fail to reach heaven but also fail to see the world as it truly is . ”
When the AP asked about that passage , university spokesman Brian Scoles said the sentence made it into the book because of an editing error and will be removed from future editions .
ADVERTISEMENT
The size of the business of home - school texts is n’t clear because the textbook industry is fragmented and privately held publishers do n’t give out sales numbers .
Slatter said home - school material sales reach about $ 1 billion annually in the U.S .
Publishers are well aware of the market , said Jay Wile , a former chemistry professor in Indianapolis who helped launch the Apologia curriculum in the early 1990s .
“ If I ’m planning to write a curriculum , and I want to write it in a way that will appeal to home - schoolers , I ’m going to at least find out what my demographic is , ” Wile said .

In Kentucky , Lexington home - schooler Mia Perry remembers feeling disheartened while flipping through a home - school curriculum catalog and finding so many religious - themed textbooks .
“ We ’re not religious home - schoolers , and there ’s somewhat of a feeling of being outnumbered , ” said Perry , who has home - schooled three of her four children after removing her oldest child from a public school because of a health condition .
Perry said she cobbled together her own curriculum after some mainstream publishers told her they would not sell directly to home - schooling parents .
Wendy Womack , another Lexington home - school mother , said the only scientifically credible curriculum she ’s found is from the Maryland - based Calvert School , which has been selling study - at - home materials for more than 100 years .

Apologia and Bob Jones University
Press say their science books sell well .
Apologia ’s “ Exploring Creation ” biology textbook retails for $ 65 , while Bob Jones ’ “ Biology ” Third Edition lists at $ 52 .
Coyne and Virginia Tech biology professor Duncan Porter reviewed excerpts from the Apologia and Bob Jones biology textbooks , which are equivalent to ninth - and 10th - grade biology lessons .
Porter said he would give the books an F .
“ If this is the way kids are home - schooled then they ’re being shortchanged , both rationally and in terms of biology , ” Coyne said .
He argued that the books may steer students away from careers in biology or the study of the history of the earth .
Wile countered that Coyne “ feels compelled to lie in order to prop up a failing hypothesis ( evolution ) .
We definitely do not lie to the students .
We tell them the facts that people like Dr. Coyne would prefer to cover up . ”

Adam Brown ’s parents say their 16 - year - old son ’s belief in the Bible ’s creation story is n’t deterring him from pursuing a career in marine biology .
His parents , Ken and Polly Brown , taught him at their Cedar Grove , Ind. , home using the Apologia curriculum and other science texts .
Polly Brown said her son would gladly take college courses that include evolution , and he ’ll be able to provide the expected answers even though he disagrees .
“ He probably knows it better than the kids who have been taught evolution all through public school , ” Polly Brown said .
“ But that is in order for him to understand both sides of that argument because he will face it throughout his higher education . ”
Schimpansen mit Bewusstsein für den Tod Matthias Gräbner
Unsere nächsten Verwandten gehen ähnlich mit dem Tod naher Angehöriger um wie der Mensch - oder auch ganz anders
Pansy starb nicht allein .
Die Affendame , mit über 50 Jahren in ihrer Schimpansengruppe schon eine Greisin , hatte sich schon für einige Tage unwohl gefühlt .
Schon im November war ihr Verhalten zunehmend von Lethargie geprägt gewesen .
Unmittelbar nach einer Mahlzeit hatte sie sich direkt auf den Boden gelegt , wo die anderen drei Gruppenmitglieder sie fanden und umsorgten .
Obwohl das „ Speisezimmer “ nicht zu den üblichen Nacht - Rastplätzen zählte , bereitete die auch schon fast 50 - jährige Blossom ihr hier ein Nest .
Wenn der Tierarzt zum Abend wieder das Gehege verließ , fand sich auch der Rest der Gruppe an Pansys provisorischem Nest ein , das die alte Dame sehr selten verließ .
Am 7 . Dezember , um drei
Uhr nachmittags , stand Pansy noch einmal auf .
Mit viel Anstrengung erklomm sie eine Plattform , auf der sich das Nest ihrer Tochter Rosie ( 20 ) befand , um sich darin niederzulegen .
Eine Stunde später begann ihr Atem unregelmäßig zu werden .
Die anderen drei Gruppenmitglieder fanden sich an ihrem Nest ein , wo sie Pansy in den zehn Minuten bis zu ihrem Tod eine ausführliche Fellpflege angedeihen ließen .
Sobald die Schimpansin gestorben war , hielten ihre Vertrauten mit ihrer Tätigkeit ein .
Ihre Tochter Rosie jedoch wich der toten Mutter zunächst nicht von der Seite .
Alle drei verbliebenen Affen legten sich rund 90 Minuten später schlafen - und schliefen auch ungewöhnlich unruhig ein .
Nachdem Pfleger am nächsten
Tag den toten Körper abtransportiert hatten , blieb die ganze Gruppe außergewöhnlich still .
Nachdem die Plattform , auf der Pansy starb , gereinigt worden war , weigerten sich die Schimpansen heftig , diese zu betreten - obwohl sie zuvor stets darauf geschlafen hatten .
Lieber blieben sie auch nachts in dem dem Tagwerk vorbehaltenen Gebiet .
Erst nach Ablauf von fünf Nächten fasste sich als erste Pansys Tochter Rosie ein Herz und richtete auf der Plattform wieder ihr Nest ein ( Video ) .
Was die Forscher hier in der Winter - Unterkunft eines Safariparks beobachtet und in der Fachzeitschrift Current Biology beschrieben haben ( vgl .
“ Pan thanatology . ” James R. Anderson , Alasdair Gillies and Louise C. Lock .
Current Biology , Vol. 20 No. 8 , April 27 , 2010 ) , zeigt , so die Interpretation , dass Schimpansen noch mehr mit uns gemein haben , als man bisher annahm .
Sie besitzen offenbar eine mit der Selbstwahrnehmung eng verknüpfte Wahrnehmung für den Tod .
Mumifizierte Kinder
Das zeigt auch eine zweite Studie , die dieselbe Fachzeitschrift in ihrer aktuellen Ausgabe veröffentlicht ( vgl .
“ Chimpanzee mothers at Bossou , Guinea , carry the mummified remains of their dead infants ” Dora Biro , Tatyana Humle et al .
Current Biology , Vol. 20 No. 8 , April 27 , 2010 ) .
Parallelen zu menschlichem Verhalten sind hier allerdings nicht so leicht erkennbar - und das ist gut so , bewahrt es uns doch davor , unseren äffischen Verwandten auch noch menschliche Motive zu unterstellen .
Schimpansin mit totem Kind ( Foto : Dora Biro )
Subjekte der Beobachtung waren in diesem Fall Angehörige einer teilisoliert lebenden Schimpansengruppe im afrikanischen Guinea .
Die Forscher beobachteten hier , wie zwei Affenjunge an einem Atemwegsinfekt starben - und vor allem wie ihre Mütter damit umgingen .
Beide trugen die toten Schimpansenbabys nämlich noch Monate mit sich herum .
In dieser Zeit mumifizierten die toten Körper , was das Verhalten ihrer Mütter nicht beeinflusste .
Sie trugen ihre Kinder stets mit sich herum , pflegten ihr Fell , verscheuchten Fliegen und behandelten sie insgesamt als gewöhnlichen Teil ihrer Tages - und Nachtaktivitäten .
Mit der Zeit und in dem Maße , wie die Kinder größer geworden wären , ließen sie auch die Körper mehr und mehr „ gehen “ .
Sie erlaubten Schritt für Schritt auch anderen Gruppenmitgliedern ( die sich von den mumifizierten Babys trotz ihres starken Geruchs und ungewohnten Aussehens auch gar nicht abgestoßen fühlten ) , mit den toten Kindern zu „ spielen “ .
Die Forscher meinen , darin ein ganz außergewöhnlich starkes Band zwischen Schimpansenmüttern und - kindern zu erkennen .
Zudem fragen sie sich , inwieweit den beiden Müttern der Tod ihrer Kinder bewusst war .
Denn zwar behandelten sie beide wochenlang , als lebten sie noch - doch um sie beispielsweise zu tragen , benutzten sie Techniken , die bei lebenden Jungen nicht funktioniert hätten .

Flipping the bird , or sticking out the middle finger , is perhaps the oldest insulting gesture on earth .
The move dates back to ancient Greece and was adopted by the Romans as digitus impudicus – the impudent finger .
A zillion middle fingers later , an Oregon man is suing suburban Portland cops ( .pdf ) over his use of the gesture , claiming civil rights violations .
Twice he flipped them off for no apparent reason while driving and was pulled over each time – resulting in what he said was a " bogus " traffic citation that was later dismissed , and a tongue lashing he still remembers .
" The guy flew into a road rage , " Robert Ekas , a retired Silicon Valley systems analyst , said in a telephone interview Tuesday .
Lawrence Wolf , a Los Angeles criminal defense attorney , said there was no law against flipping off cops .
And in most instances when it leads to an arrest or conviction , the charges are dismissed .
But the gesture invites police confrontation , he said .
" It 's certainly not the smartest thing one can do , " Wolf said .
American University legal scholar Ira Robbins has written a definitive paper on flipping the bird : " Digitus Impudicus : The Middle Finger and the Law . " ( .pdf )
" The pursuit of criminal sanctions for use of the middle finger infringes on First Amendment rights , violates fundamental principles of criminal justice , wastes valuable judicial resources , and defies good sense , " Robbins wrote .
In November , a Pittsburgh man was awarded $ 50,000 after he was wrongly cited for disorderly conduct after flipping off an officer .
Ekas , in both instances , flipped off officers while they were driving a Clackamas County patrol car .
" It seemed like the right thing to do , " said the 46 - year - old , who is seeking damages and police reform amid allegations he was unlawfully stopped .
" The long and the short of it , I was pulled over because I gave them the finger . "
A federal judge will entertain Clackamas County 's motion on March 15 to have the civil rights lawsuit tossed .
The county denies the allegations . ( .pdf )
Ekas said his actions , which occurred with his teen - aged son in the car both times , were a form of protest against the agency he claims is abusing its citizenry .
" That 's why they get the finger , " he said , noting he wants a jury trial .
Wolf , meanwhile , suggested if Ekas ' case makes it to trial , the officers are likely to testify that they were concerned " about his sanity . "
The jury , he said , is likely to say , " ' Give me a break ' and then go home . "

( WOMENSENEWS ) –American women turn on the TV to prime - time dramas and see powerful mature women everywhere .
They are surgeons on " Grey ’s Anatomy , " district attorneys on " Law and Order " and high - powered cops , lawyers and politicians .
Katie Couric and Diane Sawyer anchor the newscast , often spotlighting Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s state visits .
Television has even seen female presidents of the United States , something yet to be achieved in reality : Cherry Jones on " 24 " and Geena Davis on the short - lived " Commander - in - Chief . "
Is n’t that just so empowering ?
No , says Susan J. Douglas in " Enlightened Sexism : The Seductive Message That Feminism ’s Work Is Done , " published by Henry Holt this month .
Douglas says TV is such a powerful medium that it can shape people ’s real - world views , creating the false impression of equality .
When that happens , the door is open to more sexism .
The implications of TV ’s take - charge women , she writes , is that sexism is dead , so now it ’s fair game to caricature and lampoon women as shrews and bimbos in fare such as " Real Housewives " and dating shows where women viciously vie for the favor of male contestants .
Douglas told Women ’s eNews she coined the term " enlightened sexism " when she began noticing a wedge between programming geared towards her cohort versus her students and daughter .
On one hand , there were highly successful , ambitious female characters .
On the other , particularly in reality TV , there were young women who were " shallow , materialistic , obsessed with guys they barely knew , involved in cat fights . "
On one hand , women had " made it . "
On the other , that idea was being exploited to put women back in their place .
Neither extreme reflected what Douglas saw as women ’s actual lives , where inequalities are reflected in everything from the workplace to impossible beauty standards .
Sexism Despite Broken Barriers
Douglas joins other authors of recent books –including Barbara Berg ( " Sexism in America " ) and Jessica Valenti ( " The Purity Myth " ) –focused on the continuation of sexism despite the breaking of some major barriers .
Douglas argues that young women live in a " Girl Power " bubble , where progressive policies in school and an upbeat youth culture shield them from the realities awaiting them in a workplace , where their salaries falter and subtle sexism abounds .
At this moment , she says , young women may experience an " aha " moment .
Three writers at Newsweek detailed such a moment last month in a cover story , " Sexism at Work : Young Women , Newsweek , and Gender . "
The piece cited Douglas and Berg , among other writers , who helped confirm the trend they had diagnosed .
The writers thought their employer had not entirely eliminated sex discrimination from the workplace , but at the same time they found themselves refraining from diagnosing the problem outright .
" This was n’t something any of us noticed in school because women were excelling so much and we were surrounded by female educators , " Newsweek Senior Writer Jessica Bennett , 28 , told Women ’s eNews .
Bennett is one of the authors of the cover story .
" It was n’t until we set foot in the work force " that they caught on to anything amiss .
Eventually , after reading about a landmark Newsweek sex- discrimination lawsuit in the 1970s , they decided to go public about their feelings , with their editors ’ consent .
Since then , the writers say they ’ve been getting responses from women in all careers , from classrooms to courtrooms to construction sites .
" Most of what we ’re hearing has been people telling us it resonates for them , " said Newsweek Assistant Editor Jesse Ellison , 31 , another author of the story .
Similar Findings
NPR Ombudsman Alicia C. Shepard shared similar findings about NPR in an April piece entitled , " Where are the Women ? "
In it she says that though NPR has been an industry leader in staffing , with a nearly 50 - 50 balance of female and male correspondents and hosts , women are the minority of commentators and news sources ( 26 percent ) .
" NPR needs to try harder to find more female sources and commentators , " Shepard wrote .
Douglas hopes those " aha " moments reflected by the Newsweek cover story and NPR piece will become more frequent and that young women , whether they label themselves feminist or not , will resist negative media depictions and organize around workplace issues such as child care and maternity leave .
" We have the worst public policies in the Western industrialized world for women , children and families , " she said , speaking of subsidized day care and mandatory parental leave .
" It ’s just pretty scandalous .
If more and more young women knew this , they would get active . "
Two studies by the women ’s business advocacy group , Catalyst , Inc. , based in New York , bolster the premise that real women still face a battle for equity .
" Pipeline ’s Broken Promises " –also cited by the Newsweek authors–finds that even women with MBAs , with CEO - level ambitions and without family obligations faced routine salary discrepancies .
On average , women made $ 4,600 less than men after receiving the same degree , according to the study , which surveyed over 4,000 male and female graduates of full - time MBA programs .
Women perched at the top are often precariously balanced according to Catalyst ’s other recent study , " Opportunity or Setback , " something TV shows do n’t often show .
The study reports that since the beginning of the current economic downturn top female executives were more than three times as likely to have lost their jobs because of company downsizing or closure than male peers : 19 percent of women in this category versus 6 percent of men .

There are a couple more pieces written by people who got iPads that are n't included for reasons stated below , but they 're decent , so check them out :
Omar Wasow - The Root -
This is more of an essay than a review .
Andy Ihnatko - Chicago Sun-Times -
He actually has five different separately headlined pieces , but they 're not linked together , so while a lot of ground is covered , it 's impossible to read as a coherent review .
Why are there no Gay Muslims ?
This affects me severely .
I am not gay but I try hard not to label myself and when I see things like this happen , I am outraged .
Oh , I know there are in - the - closet Gay Muslims and other gay Muslims in secular countries but you do n’t see too many of them .
I also know discussing this issue without discussing Islam in itself is hard , but my issues with my former religion Islam will reveal themselves in subsequent posts .
Islam tries to pretend to be a religion of peace , it really does .
This is what you hear from all those nice people who are committing doublethink 24/ 7 .
This is also what you hear from those fundamentalists on TV in the news .
So whose actions show what Islam really is ?
What ’s going on here ?
What is the problem ?
I will answer my opening question soon enough .
First we must take a look at these questions .
Muslims , especially those living in Secular countries believe the Quran is unchanged , pure , full of nothing but peace —
“ It ’s a way of life , not a religion — , ” is what you ’ll often hear .
With the fundamentalists , they are actually following the words of the Quran .
Yes they are justifying their actions by this holy book .
And it was n’t until I officially left Islam ( and I never even really believed so imagine the pious believer ) that I could see this .
The violence is in the Quran , in the actions of the prophet .
That is what inspires such hatred — which I can clearly see is what Islam is all about .
The Quran does n’t even actually say anything about Gays being punishable by death .
I will bore you with at least one reference from the Quran regarding Gays .
“ We also sent Lut : He said to his people : “ Do ye commit lewdness such as no people in creation ( ever ) committed before you ?
For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women : ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds . ”
Qur’an 7:80 - 81
And yet severe punishment is given for the simple act of having sexual relations with a man …for being Gay .
This includes both consensual homosexuality and homosexual rape .
God really gives a flying crap about who you do , of course .
What else has he got to do all day sitting on his throne , after all ?
I mean
He might appreciate the little excitement he gets every time a homosexual act is committed :
From the Hadith :
“ When a man mounts another man , the throne of God shakes . ”
But no !
God is benevolent , all - kind , all merciful — that is until you do something he disapproves of .
Then you die .
Another Hadith goes on to say :
“ Kill the one that is doing it and also kill the one that it is being done to . ”
And this is carried out .
Here ’s how it works .
Basically , the Shafi’i School of Thought ( one of the schools of religious law in Sunni Islam ) requires that there be 4 witnesses to the ‘ crime ’ of homosexuality before a person can be found guilty .
Here is what MissionIslam had to say about this matter :
Al - Fatiha estimates that 4,000 homosexuals have been executed in Iran since their revolution in 1979 .
10 public executions of homosexuals have been performed in Afghanistan by the Taliban army .
That is a sad matter indeed .
These people are killing innocents in the name of their God .
All because God gives a crap about what you happen do in private within your bedroom .
It is n’t repression of freedom , homosexuality , women , or anything for that matter that ’s made any society a better one !
After all , what has it done for Islamic territories ?
Are they better than any western countries ?
The answer is a deep and resounding no .
I could go on , but I will digress no further .
There is no true freedom in Islam though it is promised , there is no real peace — though that is supposedly the gist of the faith .
Now look up at that picture of two boys being hung for being gay .
They are so young !
I am only 17 years old but I object severely to this injustice !
Even I can see that it is wrong .
So do not with your supposed words of peace and understanding , dear Muslims , try to convince me that we must kill them .
Not only that but kill them in the worst ways possible !
This the reality of it and such hatred stems from a religion of Peace .
So , you tell me :
Why are there no Gay Muslims ?
The TexAgs political message board is probably not the best place to go for nuanced , sophisticated discussion of the day 's issues , unless you think Fox News is fair and balanced .
But things can get lively .
Like recently , when a poster named dermdoc put up an item headed " Laid off my first Obama voting employee today . "
Our reimbursement rates are spiraling downward , taxes are projected to go up with Obamacare , so I did it .
This is for you crag .
On another note , my internal medicine doc for 20 years is retiring over this Obamacare crap .
I am really starting to get pissed ......
Firing people for their political views -- it 's the American way .
As you can imagine , fellow Aggies were quick to condemn him ... for not laying off more of those godless Democrats , more or less .
" Good for you doc ! " said one .
" I would love to be able to fire Obama voters .
Youre helping them more than hurting them .
Conservatives are not the only ones who need to realize that elections have consequences .
Its time to grow up and live in the real world , " said another .
Some did complain that it was unseemly , and possibly illegal .
To which the answer came from " aTm2004 " --
" To those of you complaining ... STFU .
DermDoc is a business owner and had to make a business decision .
As somebody said , elections have consequences and the person they voted for , and whose policies they support , directly led to their job loss . "
Dermdoc did express one regret about his action .
" I 'll probably have to see some foreign med school grad with a hyphenated last name , " he wrote .
" This sucks . "
Yes , something definitely does suck .
But we think it 's you , dermdoc .
Zhang Ruifang , a 100 - year old woman , from China ’s Henan Province , has a strange horn coming out of the left side of her forehead .
This reminds me so much of the horned lady , but Zhang ’s horn is much more … horn - like .
The 1 - century - old woman says her bizarre horn started growing last year , and now measures between 5 and 6 cm in length .
Although the horn causes her no pain , I can only imagine how unhappy this poor woman is with her situation .

A description of a 95 - million - year - old amber deposit -- the first major discovery of its kind from the African continent -- is adding new fungus , insects , spiders , nematodes , and even bacteria to an ecosystem that had been shared by dinosaurs .
In addition , the amber deposit may provide fresh insights into the rise and diversification of flowering plants during the Cretaceous .
The new paper , published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , reconstructs an ancient tropical forest uncovered in present - day Ethiopia and is the work of an international team of 20 scientists .
" Until now , we had discovered virtually no Cretaceous amber sites from the southern hemisphere 's Gondwanan supercontinent , " says author Paul Nascimbene of the Division of Invertebrate Zoology at the American Museum of Natural History .
" Significant Cretaceous amber deposits had been found primarily in North America and Eurasia . "
" The first angiosperms , or flowering plants , appeared and diversified in the Cretaceous , " says first author Alexander Schmidt of the University of Göttingen in Germany .
" Their rise to dominance drastically changed terrestrial ecosystems , and the Ethiopian amber deposit sheds light on this time of change . "
While some of the authors worked on the geological setting and the fossils entombed within the amber , Nascimbene , along with Kenneth Anderson from Southern Illinois University , studied the amber itself .
They found that the resin that seeped from these Cretaceous Gondwanan trees is similar chemically to more recent ambers from flowering plants in Miocene deposits found in Mexico and the Dominican Republic .
The amber 's chemical designation is Class Ic , and it is the only Ic fossil resin discovered thus far from the Cretaceous .
All other documented Cretaceous ambers are definitively from non-flowering plants , or gymnosperms .
" The tree that produced the sap is still unknown , but the amber 's chemistry is surprisingly very much like that of a group of more recent New World angiosperms called Hymenaea , " says Nascimbene .
" This amber could be from an early angiosperm or a previously - unknown conifer that is quite distinct from the other known Cretaceous amber - producing gymnosperms . "
Other team members discovered 30 arthropods that had been trapped in the amber from thirteen families of insects and spiders .
These fossils represent some of the earliest African fossil records for a variety of arthropods , including wasps , barklice , moths , beetles , a primitive ant , a rare insect called a zorapteran , and a sheet - web weaving spider .
Parasitic fungi that lived on the resin- bearing trees were also found , as well as filaments of bacteria and the remains of flowering plants and ferns .
In addition to Schmidt , Anderson , and Nascimbene , authors include Vincent Perrichot of the Université Rennes in France ; Norbert Vávra and Matthias Svojtka of the Universität Wien in Austria ; Kebede H. Beletef of the Golden Prospect Mining Company in Ethiopia ; Robert Bussert of the Technische Universität Berlin in Germany ; Heinrich Dörfelt of the Friedrich - Schiller - Universität Jena in Germany ; Saskia Jancke , Barbara Mohr , and Eva Mohrmann of Museum für Naturkunde zu Berlin in Germany ; André Nel and Patricia Nel of Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in France ; Eugenio Ragazzi and Guido Roghi of University of Padova in Italy ; Erin E. Saupe and Paul A. Selden of the University of Kansas in the U.S. ; Kerstin Schmidt ; and Harald Schneider of the Museum of Natural History in the U.K .
Update : The Account Manager is no longer maintained .
Building on this experiment , we have conceived BrowserID .
Please consider using it instead .
Last month Mozilla Labs announced a new concept series on online identity .
As part of this exploration , we developed the Account Manager .
The Account Manager makes it incredibly easy for users to create new accounts with optional randomly generated passwords , and log into and out of them with just a click .
As a web developer , adding support for this feature could take as little as fifteen minutes of hacking ( in fact , we ’ll mention the first 5 people to add support – read below to learn more . ) .
We want to make signing into websites easier for all Firefox users , and are looking to ship this feature as soon as possible in Firefox .
As part of that process we ’re looking for feedback to refine the specification .
Now is a really good time to get involved in defining the spec .
There are three things that you can do right now :
Read the draft specification .
Join our discussion group .
Come to our in - person meet - up on May 20th .
This feature is currently available as an experimental add - on , available on the Account Manager homepage .
Here ’s a video where you can get a basic idea of how Account Manager works today :
How Does It Work ?
The Account Manager specification proposes two small changes to Web sites :
Bill O'Reilly cites a poll taken by the New England Journal of Medicine and here 's his headline on how physicians feel about the health care bill .
46.3 % May Leave Medical Profession
Here 's what the poll actually says :
Health Reform and Primary Care Physicians 46.3 % of primary care physicians ( family medicine and internal medicine ) feel that the passing of health reform will either force them out of medicine or make them want to leave medicine .
Given the amount of false information being put out there about what is in the bill and the fear mongering that 's been done by the Republican Party and the media , I 've got to wonder if the poll is really a good indication of what these doctors might do once it passes .
I also do n't know what line of work those doctors think they would have to turn to if they 're not happy with the bill after it passes given the shape our economy is in .
I 'm not counting on Bill O'Reilly to give us any sort of in depth analysis that 's anything but hype to scare the crap out everyone on those numbers any time soon .
It will be nice to hear from someone who is not a ClusterFox fear monger on those numbers once more people have a chance to take a look at the poll .
UPDATED : John Amato :
Well , well , well .
The New England Journal of Medicine says they never produced a health care survey .
For example , on Fox & Friends , co-host Brian Kilmeade said : " The New England Journal of Medicine has published a report and did a survey , and they said the impact of reform on primary care physicians , 46 percent , they say , feel reform will force them out or make them want to leave medicine . "
This is false .
Media Matters for America contacted the New England Journal of Medicine , which confirmed it neither conducted nor published the " survey . "
NEJM spokesperson Jennifer Zeis told Media Matters that the study had " nothing to do with the New England Journal of Medicine 's original research . "
She also made clear that the study " was not published by the New England Journal of Medicine , " and said that " we are taking steps to clarify the source of the survey . "
The " report " that right - wing media are citing actually appeared in Recruiting Physicians Today , which is an employment newsletter produced by " the publishers of the New England Journal of Medicine . "
According to Zeis , that report actually " was written by the Medicus Firm , " the medical recruitment firm that conducted the " survey . "
UPDATE : Following inquiries from Media Matters , the " NEJM CareerCenter " website has now posted the following statement , making clear that Recruiting Physicians Today is a " free advertiser newsletter " whose content is " produced by physician recruiting firms and other independent groups involved in physician employment " and that Medicus was responsible for conducting and publishing the " survey " in question ... read on

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - Space Exploration
Technologies successfully test fired its Falcon 9 rocket this weekend , clearing a milestone toward the inaugural flight of a privately developed spaceship to fly cargo , and possibly astronauts , into orbit , the company said .

Saturday ’s 3.5 - second ‘ static ’ firing of the Falcon ’s nine kerosene and liquid oxygen - burning motors took place on a refurbished oceanside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida .
It followed an earlier firing test aborted last week due to an improperly configured valve .
The successful test by California - based SpaceX clears the way for Falcon 9’s debut mission -- a demonstration flight which could take place as early as April 12 from the same launch site , just south of the space shuttle launch pads at the Kennedy Space Center .
President Barack Obama has proposed adding $ 6 billion to space agency NASA ’s budget over the next five years to help private firms like SpaceX develop spaceships that can ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station , which he wants to continue until at least 2020 .
With the NASA shuttle fleet retiring due to safety and cost concerns , the U.S. agency has turned over space station crew transport to the Russian government at a cost of about $ 15 million per seat .
Obama plans to hold a summit in Florida next month to discuss the U.S. space plans and industry .
SpaceX , owned and operated by Internet entrepreneur Elon Musk , already holds NASA contracts worth nearly $ 1.9 billion to develop and fly Falcon 9 rockets and Dragon capsules for space station cargo resupply missions .
Virginia - based Orbital Sciences Corp has NASA contracts of similar value for its Taurus II - Cygnus system , which is scheduled to debut next year .
SpaceX says it needs about three years to develop a launch escape system for Dragon and other upgrades to have Falcon 9 ready for passenger service .
“ What we are going through right now is the equivalent of ‘ beta testing ’ , ” Musk , SpaceX ’s founder and chief executive , wrote in an email after last week ’s aborted test .
“ The beta phase only ends when a rocket has done at least one , but arguably two or three consecutive flights to orbit , ” he said .
First , here are more numbers from the Iowa Department of Public Health 's report on marriage licenses issued from April through December 2009 .
Click the link to view the full report at Todd Dorman 's blog .
More same - sex marriages involved women ( 1,138 ) than men ( 645 ) .
Polk County , including Des Moines and most of its suburbs , issued 410 licenses to same - sex couples , more than any other Iowa county .
Johnson County ( Iowa City ) and Scott County ( Quad Cities ) tied for second with 208 licenses .
Pottawattamie ( Council Bluffs ) was a close fourth with 204 , followed by Linn ( Cedar Rapids area ) with 94 .
Most of the counties that recorded issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples were along or near Iowa borders , or contain college towns .
The statistics do n't show how many couples traveled here from other states to get married .
You may recall that last April , some Iowa Republicans denied that county recorders were obliged to implement the Varnum v Brien ruling .
They worked with the Iowa Family Policy Center to collect thousands of signatures on petitions urging county recorders to refuse to issue licenses to same - sex couples .
Although some recorders were hesitant to comply with the ruling , in the end no county recorder resigned or promised to deny marriage licenses to same - sex couples .
That deprived social conservatives of a martyr for their cause .
According to the Iowa Department of Public Health 's report , only 17 of Iowa 's 99 counties recorded issuing same - sex marriage licenses in 2009 .
Perhaps some of the 901 licenses that did n't record the couple 's gender represented same - sex marriages in smaller counties , however .
Iowa Republican politicians , including all three candidates for governor , remain united in opposition to the Varnum v Brien ruling .
Bob Vander Plaats has the most extreme position in the gubernatorial field .
He would issue an ( illegal ) executive order to halt same - sex marriages until Iowans have had a chance to vote on the issue .
It takes talent to be so far out of the mainstream that Representative Steve King finds your legal arguments flawed .
King considers gay marriage part of a socialist agenda and has warned against Iowa becoming " the gay marriage Mecca , " but even he knows the executive order plan is a non-starter .
Gubernatorial candidate Rod Roberts mentioned " the traditional definition of marriage " in his early advertising and has urged Iowans to vote against retaining the Supreme Court justices who will be on the ballot this November .
He wants to use the normal process for amending the constitution to restrict marriage to opposite - sex couples .
Just yesterday he said that as governor he would refuse to sign a state budget unless the state legislature passed a constitutional amendment on marriage .
( Roberts seems to have gotten that idea from Chris Rants , who dropped out of the governor 's race earlier this year . )
The Republican front - runner , former Governor Terry Branstad , tends to avoid talking marriage unless asked about it .
It 's easy to understand why when you consider how incoherent his views are on this issue .
He has defended the concept of judicial review and seems not to have a problem with homosexuals in committed relationships , yet he would use our state 's constitution to deny those couples civil marriage rights .
During the 2010 legislative session , which ended last week , not a single Republican lawmaker spoke out against efforts to overturn the Supreme Court 's ruling .
Several Republican legislators advanced boneheaded ideas to limit judicial independence as well .
Republicans tried and tried but could n't get enough Democrats to join their attempts to pass a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage .
Iowa Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal and Iowa House Speaker Pat Murphy deserve huge credit for holding their caucuses together , especially in an election year that could be challenging for Democrats .
I believe that Curt Hanson 's victory in last year 's Iowa House district 90 special election helped reassure wavering Democrats too .
Governor Chet Culver strongly praised the legislature 's restraint at a March 31 press conference :
" We stood firm for the civil rights of every Iowan by saying loudly and clearly that any and all efforts to add discriminatory amendments to our state constitution have no place in our state constitution , " Culver said in assessing the 2010 legislative work product .
Culver said he personally believe [s ] marriage should be between a man and a woman and there has been no change in that position since the Iowa Supreme Court unanimously decided on April 3 , 2009 , to strike down a state marriage law – paving the way for civil marriages between two people of the same gender .
" Regardless of our personal views , we have a line that needs to be drawn between the executive branch and the judicial branch and I think Iowans are ready to move on and accept that unanimous decision , " he told reporters .
" I think the overwhelming majority of Iowans do not want to amend our constitution in such a way that ’s discriminatory .
I think that ’s the bottom line , " Culver added .
" I think Iowans want to move forward and the Supreme Court has spoken loudly and clearly and I think it ’s time to move on . "
Todd Dorman zinged Culver for clinging to his personal opposition to same - sex marriage " like some sort of political security blanket . "
But Dorman also advised the governor 's critics to
take note of the fact that some political leaders do n’t feel the need to enshrine their personal discomforts in the laws or constitution of our state .
There is a difference between your personal views and the responsibilities of governing a whole state .
So even while clutching his blanket , Culver is showing some grown - up leadership .
Better late than never .
Contrast that with the guys gunning for him , who would meddle with the constitution , tinker with the courts and throw around illegal executive orders just to get their way .
Culver was n't out in front on marriage equality .
While Gronstal , Murphy and Attorney General Tom Miller strongly praised the Iowa Supreme Court 's ruling the day it was announced , the governor waited four days before releasing a statement affirming his personal opposition to gay marriage even as he declared , " after careful consideration and a thorough reading of the Court 's decision , I am reluctant to support amending the Iowa Constitution to add a provision that our Supreme Court has said is unlawful and discriminatory . "
While I 'd never hold Culver up as a profile in courage on marriage , he deserves more credit than some supporters of equality give him .
Many governors would have happily demanded to " let the people vote " on marriage as a way to divert public attention from the economic recession and state budget crunch .
If Culver had urged legislators to take up this issue , I suspect several more Democrats would have joined Republicans to force a vote on a constitutional amendment during the 2009 or 2010 sessions .
Jason Hancock argued at Iowa Independent this week that the gay marriage issue " appears to be on the back burner " now .
I largely agree with his post .
The Republican Party of Iowa and its candidates are likely to highlight other issues in most of the battleground legislative districts .
Vander Plaats appears likely to lose the gubernatorial primary to Branstad .
I remain somewhat concerned about next year 's legislative session , since the Republicans have a chance to win back the Iowa House and several seats in the Senate .
If Democrats end up with only 28 or 29 of the 50 Iowa Senate seats , instead of the current 32 , a handful of Democrats might sign a Republican petition to force a marriage vote in the chamber .
Taking the optimistic view , some Democratic senators who signed the Republican petition this year , when it clearly was n't going anywhere , might not help Republicans on procedural matters in 2011 .
Gronstal would lay down in front of a truck to stop a marriage vote from coming to the floor .
One thing is certain : the religious right will keep up its demagoguery on marriage .
The Iowa Family Policy Center is still claiming , absurdly , that homosexuality is more dangerous and " destructive " to society than smoking .
You really can't reason with these people , but I 'll keep trying .
Social conservatives will also push the " let us vote " framing in many legislative races this fall .
Graham Gillete just posted a fantastic rebuttal to their arguments at the Des Moines Register 's blog :
There is much hot air about how letting the Supreme Court ruling stand without a Constitutional question being put to the voters is tantamount to creating a judicial oligarchy .
They argue the people should decide .
When you take two steps back from this argument , it is laughable .
The Iowa Legislature passed a law that defined marriage as one man and one woman .
The people never voted on it .
Last April , the Court found this legislative action to be in conflict with the Iowa Constitution .
It is not that the question of marriage is so big that it demands a vote of the people .
What is at stake is bigger than marriage , something more important than an issue to be decided by a simple and single vote of the people . [...]
Our state and national constitutions were established on the most basic of underpinnings , we are equals .
We are entitled to the same rights and protections under the law .
There is no litmus test to determine who among us is ‘ more equal , ’ who among us is be entitled to own property , speak freely , or get married .
I got to marry the person I love , the person I chose to marry and the person who chose to marry me .
No law or constitutional amendment can be written to say two other people can be denied the same ability because they share the same type of human plumbing , for doing so would violate the most basic tenet of our state and national constitutions .
We are equals .
Our sex , sexual orientation , religion , color , political belief and any other thing that makes us who we are cannot change that fact .
If our Legislature passes a law that says differently , it violates our Constitution and should be struck down .
If a ballot measure is passed by the electorate that says one segment of our population is not entitled to the same rights as another , the Court should invalidate it .
If we say that it is OK for one couple to marry because they are straight , but it is unacceptable for another to marry because they are gay , we invalidate the very Constitution which created Iowa and the one that formed the greatest country on earth .
Gillette's whole piece is worth your time , so do click over .
Here are some other good reads published recently in connection with the Varnum v Brien anniversary .
Iowa Independent profiled two of the plaintiffs in the case , Kate and Trish Varnum .
The Burlington Hawk Eye wrote about two men who got engaged last Easter , shortly after the Supreme Court ruling , and are getting married on May 1 .
The Des Moines Register published this article about Loren Olson , who married his husband last year and is writing a book about coming out later in life .
Two more Varnum v Brien plaintiffs , Larry Hoch and David Twombley , authored an op-ed in the Des Moines Register expressing their feelings about being married .
Excerpt :
It has been an extremely humbling experience to have been a part of this historic advancement for civil rights for all lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender Iowans .
Neither of us has ever been activists for any cause , having gone about our daily lives as productive , responsible citizens .
To finally have the right to marry the person we love is incredibly meaningful to us .
As for our feelings as a married couple , it is hard to explain the new and closer relationship we now feel .
How could anyone want to deny us the growing love for each other we have experienced ?
Living together or having a civil union ( we had a civil union in Vermont in January 2002 because at that time no other state offered any recognition of a dedicated same - sex relationship ) is not the same as being a married couple .
Being married says to our society that we are committed to one another , for better , for worse , etc .
Our marriage in no way takes anything away from any other marriage .
Indeed , our commitment to a marriage strengthens the whole concept of marriage .
Being married has been such a good thing for both of us ; we have become better people as a result .
Being married expands self - worth , as one learns to care and support the other marriage partner , and to know that a marriage requires team - work to make this relationship work .
Our only regret is that we could not have gotten married decades earlier .
We are grateful that many other gay and lesbian Iowa couples will now be able to get married .
Thank you , Iowa , for making this possible .
Reading those words reminded me of this observation from Rev. Jane Willan of the United Church of Christ in Burlington :
" Straight weddings are often like that : a photo op , " Willan said .
" Weddings for gay couples are very , very different , and I did n't know that until I stepped into my first one . "
Willan said the same - sex couples she has wed have been less concerned about their attire and the catering and more interested in making their vows .
" If that 's not faith in the gospel , I do n't know what is , " Willan said .
It astounds me that anyone thinks loving couples who want to get married pose a threat to the institution of marriage .
Almost any cover of a tabloid or gossip magazine will confirm that Bleeding Heartland user sgarystewart is right : the biggest threat to marriage is and always has been infidelity .
No blog post can make the case for marriage equality better than the television commercial One Iowa ran across the state last April :
I like the way that commercial placed marriage equality within the long tradition of diverse people finding freedom in Iowa under our state 's Constitution .
One Iowa announced this week that the commercial " received a Gold Pollie Award from the American Association of Political Consultants in the category of Best TV Spot for a statewide initiative campaign .
The Pollie Awards are hailed as the ' Oscars of Political Advertising . ' "
Speaking of awards , Iowa Independent won one for its coverage of the Iowa Supreme Court ruling on April 3 , 2009 .
Click through for links to all eight Iowa Independent stories posted that day .
I decided to steal their idea , so here are links to all the Bleeding Heartland posts about marriage from April 2009 :
Share any relevant thoughts or same - sex wedding stories in this thread .
I 've only attended one same - sex commitment ceremony , which took place several months before the Varnum v Brien ruling .
More than 750,000 tickets have been sold for the tour 1980s pop star Rick Astley was a surprise guest at the Manchester MEN Arena on the first night of Peter Kay 's sold - out tour .
Astley , 44 , played hits including Never Gonna Give You Up as well as a medley of songs by Manchester bands , including The Smiths .
Kay said on his website that the " amazing " Astley " went down a storm " .
The 36 - year - old comedian has returned to touring after seven years for his The Tour That Does n't Tour Tour .
I 'd just like to thank everybody who came or is coming to see the show , it would n't be possible without you - well it would but I 'd just be stood there on my own
Peter Kay Astley will also open the show for the further 19 dates Kay will play in Manchester between now and 22 May .
" The morning after the first night before - well I 'm speechless and if the rest of the tour is anything like last night it is going to be an unbelievable journey , " Kay said .
" I 'd just like to thank everybody who came or is coming to see the show , it would n't be possible without you - well it would but I 'd just be stood there on my own . "
' Straightforward observations ' Simon Donohue , writing in the Manchester Evening News , praised " the familiar and nostalgic observations of ordinary life which make Kay so endearing for so many " .
After seven years away , he 's back with the same brand of straightforward home - spun observations he 's always peddled
Comedy website Chortle " Nan , we were told , had been asking her grandson about modern curios such as Facetube and a film called ' abattoir ' , " he added , saying " fans wo n't be disappointed " .
Comedy website Chortle , meanwhile , described Peter Kay as " a great entertainer but a mediocre comic " .
" After seven years away , he 's back with the same brand of straightforward home - spun observations he 's always peddled , although they did n't seem to make quite the same connection with the audience as they once did , " it added .
Kay had originally said he planned to perform only in Manchester , saying " I do n't want to be away from home " , but changed his mind .
The tour - which will reportedly gross an estimated £ 26 m in ticket sales - will take in venues including London 's O2 , the Glasgow SECC and the Sheffield Arena .
More than 750,000 tickets have been sold .
The tour will conclude with a further 10 nights at the MEN in October 2011 .

If an airplane is cruising along and raises the flaps on its wings a degree or two , it will tilt upward .
If it raises the flaps twice as much , it will tilt upward about twice as much .
But if it tilts upward too far — generally more than 15 degrees — the airflow over the wings becomes chaotic , and anything can happen : the nose might jerk up , or it might jerk down ; one wing could dip , or the plane could start to spin .
In technical terms , within the normal operational range , airplane control is linear ; outside that range , it ’s nonlinear .
Engineers prefer linear systems because they ’re much easier to work with mathematically , but unfortunately , we live in a largely nonlinear world .
So a lot of research is aimed at finding linear characterizations of the behavior of nonlinear systems .
That research usually requires a great deal of mathematical insight and trial and error , and even when it ’s successful , the results may be impossible to generalize to other cases .
Pablo Parrilo , the Finmeccanica Career Development Professor at MIT ’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems , has developed a new set of techniques that make it easier to get a handle on nonlinear systems .
Moreover , in many cases , his techniques provide algorithms — step - by - step instructions — for analyzing those systems , taking away much of the guesswork .
“ The impact he ’s had has been huge .
Huge , ” says Russ Tedrake , a robotics researcher at MIT ’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab .
Tedrake has adapted Parrilo ’s techniques to create novel control systems for walking and flying robots , and major engineering companies have used them in the design of aircraft and engines .
Quantum information theorists have used them to describe the mysterious property known as entanglement — in which the states of subatomic particles become dependent on each other — and biologists have used them to make sense of the complicated chemical signaling pathways found in cells .
“ It ’s a great step forward , ” says John Harrison , a principal engineer at Intel who has used Parrilo ’s techniques to verify that Intel ’s chips will do what they ’re supposed to .
“ It ’s really a whole new weapon in the arsenal of nonlinear reasoning . ”
Connecting the dots
The set of linear problems is relatively narrow and well - characterized , while the set of nonlinear ones is huge and varied .
Most people were exposed to both types in algebra class .
A mathematical function with two variables is linear if its graph is a straight line ; it ’s nonlinear if its graph is a curve .
The equation y = x , for instance , is linear ; the equation y = x2 — whose graph is a parabola centered at the origin — is not .
With more than two variables , nonlinear equations can get immensely complicated .
The three - dimensional graph of a three - variable nonlinear equation could look like a mountain range , with erratic undulations and depressions .
And the nonlinear equations that arise in engineering and physics might be more complex still , with 10 or 15 variables .
Sometimes , however , it ’s enough to know something about the broad topographical features of a nonlinear function without getting too bogged down in the details .
In the case of a three - dimensional graph , a depression — a part of the graph that looks like a bowl — could have important real - world implications .
The point at the bottom of the bowl might represent the state of some physical system , and the slope of the bowl ’s sides would indicate that the system tends to move toward that state .
Suppose , for instance , that a plane flying in direction A at altitude B and velocity C needs to change course so that it ’s flying in direction X at altitude Y and velocity Z .
The first state of the plane can be thought of as a point in three - dimensional space — A , B , C — and the desired course correction — X , Y , Z — as a second point .
If you have a nonlinear equation that describes the behavior of planes in flight , the question becomes , Does the second point lie at the bottom of a bowl ?
Square one
Parrilo provides a way to answer that type of question without actually solving nonlinear equations .
To see how his approach works , consider the equation x2 - 2xy + y2 < 0 .
Can you find values of x and y that make that equation true ?
You can ’t .
You may remember from algebra class that x2 - 2xy + y2 is another way of writing ( x - y ) 2 .
Since the square of a negative number is positive , and the square of a positive number is positive , ( x - y ) 2 is always positive .
Parrilo has developed a battery of techniques for rewriting complicated nonlinear equations — much more complicated than x2 - 2xy + y2 < 0 — as “ sums of squares ” — where a “ square ” is an expression like ( x - y ) 2 .
A sum of squares is always greater than or equal to zero .
But that means that wherever it equals zero , it has reached a “ global minimum ” — the bottom of a bowl .
Parrilo ’s approach works only with particular types of equations .
But generally , the properties that make equations susceptible to his approach are properties common to mathematical models of physical systems .
“ He ’s very much a theorist , ” says Tedrake , “ but he ’s thought a lot about the details that make that theory work . ”
Harrison agrees .
In 1994 , he explains , Intel released a Pentium chip whose circuit design was slightly incorrect : under certain circumstances , it actually gave the wrong answers to some calculations .
Since then , Harrison says , Intel has performed “ formal verification ” of some of its designs .
“ We create a formal model of the design and really prove as a mathematical theorem that it satisfies some property . "
Using Parrilo ’s techniques , Harrison has developed software that proves those theorems automatically .
“ I spent some time before I discovered Pablo ’s work casting around trying to find techniques , ” Harrison says .
“ There ’s a literature that goes back 50 years , and I spent a long time combing through this literature , trying to see if any of these so - called constructive results were useful as real algorithms .
And generally the results were very disappointing . ”
Parrilo ’s method , by contrast , “ is really remarkably good , ” Harrison says .
“ It ’s really great . ”

I am a big Joe Biden fan .
The vice president is an indefatigable defender of U.S. interests abroad .
So it pains me to say that on his recent trip to Israel , when Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu ’s government rubbed his nose in some new housing plans for contested East Jerusalem , the vice president missed a chance to send a powerful public signal :
He should have snapped his notebook shut , gotten right back on Air Force Two , flown home and left the following scribbled note behind : “ Message from America to the Israeli government : Friends do n’t let friends drive drunk .
And right now , you ’re driving drunk .
You think you can embarrass your only true ally in the world , to satisfy some domestic political need , with no consequences ?
You have lost total contact with reality .
Call us when you ’re serious .
We need to focus on building our country . ”
I think that  rather than fuming and making up  would have sent a very useful message for two reasons .
First , what the Israelis did played right into a question a lot of people are asking about the Obama team : how tough are these guys ?
The last thing the president needs , at a time when he is facing down Iran and China  not to mention Congress  is to look like America ’s most dependent ally can push him around .
And second , Israel needs a wake - up call .
Continuing to build settlements in the West Bank , and even housing in disputed East Jerusalem , is sheer madness .
Yasir Arafat accepted that Jewish suburbs there would be under Israeli sovereignty in any peace deal that would also make Arab parts of East Jerusalem the Palestinian capital .
Israel ’s planned housing expansion now raises questions about whether Israel will ever be willing to concede a Palestinian capital in Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem  a big problem .
Israel has already bitten off plenty of the West Bank .
If it wants to remain a Jewish democracy , its only priority now should be striking a deal with the Palestinians that would allow it to swap those settlement blocs in the West Bank occupied by Jews for an equal amount of land from Israel for the Palestinians and then reap the benefits  economic and security  of ending the conflict .
DUBLIN , Ireland —
Police officers , government officials and bishops of the Catholic church in Ireland have been harshly censured in a report on clerical child abuse over three decades in the Archdiocese of Dublin .
Coming just a few months after an equally harsh report on the ill - treatment of children in Church - run industrial schools , the latest revelations have shocked Catholics and non-Catholics alike throughout the island .
An official commission investigated 320 allegations against a sample of 46 out of 183 priests from 1975 to 2004 .
It found that several cardinals and bishops protected criminal priests while taking no action to protect children .
Responding to the report , Ireland ’s Justice Minister Dermot Ahern said that “ the era where evil people could do so under the cover of the cloth , facilitated and shielded from the consequences by their authorities , while the lives of children were ruined with such cruelty , is over for good . ”
He added : “ The bottom line is this : A collar will protect no criminal . ”
In one of the most telling comments , the religious affairs correspondent of Irish national broadcaster RTE said on the main evening news that the report “ represents the failure of civil Ireland , in the independent republic of Ireland , to stand up to the royalty of Ireland , the Catholic Church . ”
Deference to the clergy in this once devoutly Catholic country caused the police to conclude that the crimes of the Catholic Church were outside their remit .
The driving force behind the report is Archbishop Diarmuid Martin , who came from Rome in 2003 to take over the archdiocese and handle the growing scandal .
Yesterday , at a news conference , holding his hand over his heart , and with tears in his eyes , Martin apologized as a man and a bishop .
“ How do I feel when I have to unveil here before you the revolting stories of the sexual assault and rape of many young children and teenagers by priests of the archdiocese ? ” he said .
“ To each and every survivor my apology , my sorrow and shame for what happened . ”
The report of the commission found that the protection of pedophile priests was facilitated by “ the structures and rules of the Catholic Church . ”
Government prosecutors and police facilitated the cover - up by allowing the church institutions to be beyond the reach of the normal law enforcement processes .
Over the period the welfare of children was not even a factor to be considered .
“ Instead the focus was on the avoidance of scandal and the preservation of the good name , status and assets of the institution and of what the institution regarded as its most important members — the priests . ”
The commission concluded that Archbishop John Charles McQuaid , who ruled the Dublin archdiocese from 1940 to 1972 , did not apply canon law where such allegations were concerned .
His dealings with a Father Edmondus in 1960 “ were aimed at the avoidance of scandal and showed no concern for the welfare of children . ”
Archbishop Dermot Ryan , who served from 1972 to 1984 , “ failed to properly investigate complaints ” against six priests and ignored the warning of a psychiatrist in the case of another priest who subsequently seriously assaulted a young teenager .
Archbishop Kevin McNamara , who served from 1984 to 1987 , restored to the ministry a priest , Father Bill Carney , who had pleaded guilty to charges of child sex abuse .
Cardinal Desmond Connell , who held office from 1988 to 2004 , while “ appalled ” was slow to realize that it could not be dealt with “ by keeping it secret and protecting priests from normal civil processes . ”
Ireland ’s most senior police officer , Commissioner Fachtna Murphy apologized for the acts of officials who regarded priests as above the law .
He said he was “ deeply sorry ” that children who sought assistance did not always receive the response or protection to which they were entitled .
The report was also critical of three auxiliary bishops of Dublin , Dermot O’Mahony , James Kavanagh and Donal Murray for dealing “ badly ” with complaints .
Bishop Murray , now Bishop of Limerick , said last night he would not resign .
His failure to reinvestigate earlier suspicions against an offending priest was described as “ inexcusable . ”
The traditional deference to the clergy in Ireland that facilitated the cover - up has diminished after a series of scandals over clerical abuse in recent years in an increasingly secular Ireland .
This was illustrated at Bishop Martin ’s press conference when writer Nell McCafferty asked angrily why people should still call bishops “ Your grace ” and priests “ Father . ”
The director of Amnesty Ireland , Colm O’Gorman , who once sued the Catholic Church for abuses he said he suffered as a teenager , said the report revealed that “ bishops in Dublin colluded with child abusers , protecting them and hiding them , enabling them to prey on the innocent ( who ) were deliberately sacrificed to protect the Church . "
The West Coast is a big place — especially when it comes to beer .
People from elsewhere often talk about the West Coast as if it's one entity — as if there 's a coherent " West Coast culture " and " West Coast attitude " and , without question , " west coast - style beer . "
And what could be more " West Coast " than IPA ?
Over the coming weeks , I 'm dedicating my fridge space ( and liver capacity ) to prove that the west coast is a big place — especially when it comes to beer — and when you actually compare most of the IPAs of , say , California , to the IPAs of Washington state or Oregon , prominent stylistic differences emerge .
American craft brewers across the country have put their stamp on IPA — we hope to discover how it varies geographically .
There are outliers , of course , but as we tasted 30 IPAs for this week 's article , it became clear that California IPA tends to be bright and brisk , with more lemon and dry herbal bitterness than grapefruit or tangerine .
At their best , California IPAs clean and crisp — totally refreshing .
( At their worst , they get a wee bit metallic . )
Some have malt profiles that lean toward a traditional English style .
Moving into the double - and imperial - range , the maltiness and earthiness of these beers get heavier .
For the most part , California IPAs are n't fruit bombs — the hops tend to be more toward the bittering end .
How do they differ from the beers of other states ?
Stay tuned .
For now , check out the best and brightest of California 's IPAs .

More like an English - style IPA , this beer is n't piney or fruity .
It 's more malty and quite dry , with mostly earthy bittering hops .
Be sure to let it warm up slightly .
Or seek out Anderson Valley 's excellent Anniversary Imperial IPA .
**3/4
Left Coast Hop Juice San Clemente , 9.4 % ABV
This double IPA 's aroma reminded us of pina coladas and pineapple upside - down cake .
There 's a hint of pomelo and dry grapefruit , but this is mostly a heavyweight malty , creamy beer , with more bittering hops than fruitiness .
**3/4
Nectar Ales Nectar IPA Paso Robles 6.8 % ABV Nectar
Ales is part of the Firestone Walker Brewery , but East Coasters may have easier access to the Nectar beers than the FW ones .
It 's too bad -- this IPA did n't impress us as much as the Firestone Union Jack .
It has some nice caramelly flavors that come through as it warms , but some tasters found the hop flavor a little metallic and harsh .
This beer has a lemon - pith and piney bite and very little sweetness .
It 's pretty refreshing , but some might find it unpleasantly bitter .
**1/2
Left Coast India Pale Ale San Clemente , 6.9 % ABV
The nose on this is a little vegetal , and some tasters noticed a hint of asparagus flavor in addition to soil , grass , and pine .
Our resident homebrewer noted that this one had some estery , fruity yeast flavors that were a little bit off .
**1/2
Sierra Nevada Torpedo Chico , 7.2 % ABV
This Extra IPA was just a little too harsh some of our tasters .
It 's a super - dry , peppery beer with a hint of bagel - like malt that comes out as it warms , but not very much creaminess .
This beer is dry - hopped with Citra hops , which have a hint of apricot - like flavor , but we wished for a hint more sweetness and fruit .
We 'll stick with Sierra Nevada 's Pale Ale . **
Moylan's IPA Novato , 6.5 % ABV
This malty beer tasted a bit like toasted rye bread , and some tasters wished for more fresh hop flavor .
There 's a bitter edge but not much of the brightness we had elsewhere .

LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) --
A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck northwest Mexico on Sunday afternoon , killing at least one person and shaking buildings as far away as Los Angeles .
The quake , upgraded by the U.S. Geological Survey from an initial magnitude 6.9 reading , was centered 16 miles south by southwest of Guadalupe Victoria in the Mexican state of Baja California .
The Associated Press reported one death in Baja California state capital Mexicali , while various news accounts said some buildings in the city were damaged .
The earthquake hit at 3:40 p.m. local time and was located 20 miles underground , according to the USGS .
It is illegal to take organs without consent Organs may have been removed from deceased people without their consent after a data - handling error by the NHS .
The blunder meant 800,000 people on the UK donor register may have had their wishes about the use of organs for transplant wrongly recorded .
The Sunday Telegraph reported that 45 of them have now died - and 20 families let organs of relatives be taken based on incorrectly stored information .
NHS Blood and Transplant said it was urgently investigating .
Many donors give consent for some organs to be used for transplant but not others , such as eyes .
But the details of many donors ' preferences were accidentally deleted in 1999 .
It is horrific that such sensitive details were handled in such a careless way
Patient Concern
It first came to light in 2009 when NHS Blood and Transplant wrote to donors , reiterating what they had agreed to donate .
But many wrote back saying the information was incorrect .
Joyce Robins of pressure group Patient Concern told the Sunday Telegraph : " This government has got an absolutely dreadful record when it comes to data , but it is horrific that such sensitive details were handled in such a careless way . "
' Small proportion ' NHS Blood and Transplant has since corrected 400,000 flawed records - but hundreds of thousands of people must now be contacted to confirm which organs may be taken .
Until consent is given from those affected , no organs will be removed .
It is against the law to take organs from the dead without their prior consent , or that of their family after death .
A spokeswoman for NHS Blood and Transplant said : " We are aware of issues with the records with a small proportion of the people who signed up to the NHS organ donor register .
" We are taking it very seriously and are urgently investigating the situation .
" Our priority is in ensuring that the families of those who may have been affected are contacted . "
Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb described the data error as " a shocking failure of proper controls " .
" The Liberals Democrats believe in reforms to provide for assumed consent so as to increase organs available for transplant .
" But for so long as the opt - in consent system is in place it is critical that everybody has confidence in the current system , " he said .

The British and American strategy — tracking insurgents by abetting them — seemed to follow a convoluted logic : that of a fighter who , trying to zero in on his opponent , waits for a few good shots to the nose .
When Fulton traveled to New York with his handlers , he provided valuable inside information about the IRA ’s new tactics .
But as each such step offered insight , it demanded another step , and another .
The information came at a high price .
In Newry , for instance , not long before Fulton ’s trip to New York , a policewoman named Colleen McMurray and her colleague , Paul Slaine , were driving past the canal that runs through the center of town .
Across the water , an IRA man triggered a flash unit , and a hidden rocket — called a “ doodlebug ” — burst from the grill of a car he had planted .
It slammed into McMurray ’s car , injuring Slaine — he lost both legs in the attack — and killing McMurray on the spot .
As Fulton and I surveyed the bloody plain of his career , he said that McMurray ’s death was the only one he truly regretted .
I asked why , and his hands traced the universal hourglass symbol for “ woman . ”
It seemed almost as though he did n’t want to say it aloud : he had constructed a moral code as a bomber and spy , some unspoken list of atrocities he refused to commit , and apparently it included killing a woman .
Other people paid a price , too .
Consider the case of Eoin Morley , a member of Fulton ’s bomb squad .
After six years as a low - level IRA man , Morley quit and turned away from the IRA .
Maybe he did it for the love of his girlfriend , and for her tiny children from a previous relationship .
Maybe he did it because of an intra-IRA dispute .
Maybe he did it because he already felt old at twenty - two .
That Easter Sunday night , Morley and his girlfriend put the children to bed and then turned their attention to a sink full of dishes .
She washed , he dried .
Someone knocked at the door .
His girlfriend dried her hands , crossed the room , and opened the door .
Two armed , masked men burst past her and grabbed Morley .
They dragged him out into the garden and forced him to lie down .
One of the masked men — Fulton , sources say — raised a high - powered assault rifle and shot Morley twice .
The first bullet entered the back of his left thigh .
Automatic rifles tend to rise as they ’re fired ; the second bullet thumped into Morley ’s lower back .
As quickly as they had arrived , the men disappeared .
An ambulance took Morley to the hospital .
His mother , Eilish , having gotten word of the incident , arrived soon after .
Shootings were a way of life in Northern Ireland , and she expected him to rise from his bed and walk out — just like his relatives , just like his friends , just like Lazarus .
But then a nurse burst into the waiting room and said , “ Would you come quickly ? ”
Eilish moved to the door of the surgery theater , but someone stopped her at a red line painted on the floor .
She was n’t sterilized and might infect the patient .
Her son lay on a table in the center of the room .
A doctor approached and said , “ We could n’t save him .
It ’s only a matter of minutes . ”
She suspects now that the doctor kept her behind the line not because of infection but to spare her the sight of her son ’s body laid bare , bristling with instruments , tubes , wires .
When James Laski finished serving his 11 - month prison stint on corruption charges in 2008 , he knew his political career was over .
But the former Chicago city clerk had every reason to believe his rap sheet was no barrier to another coveted , high - profile job : Chicago radio broadcaster .
For Chicago politicians , it seems , breaking the law can serve as prelude to a seat before the microphone .
When Mr. Laski begins his new weeknight show on WGN - AM on April 12 , he will become the third convicted or indicted Illinois politician with a regular presence on local radio .
Cliff Kelley , convicted in 1987 of accepting bribes while alderman of the 20th Ward , is an integral part of WVON - AM , commanding four hours every weekday afternoon on that African - American - oriented station .
Rod R. Blagojevich , the impeached governor whose federal corruption trial is set for June , has a two - hour Sunday show on WLS - AM .
Chicago is not the only place where disgraced politicians have reinvented themselves over the airwaves .
But the city is brimming with tainted politicians turned professional talkers .
Washington State National Guard recruiters repeatedly forged re-enlistment papers in a desperate attempt to hold on to soldiers in the run-up to the Iraq war surge , a local news channel ’s investigation has found .
In one case , a soldier found himself fighting against deployment to Iraq after re-enlistment papers with his signature on it appeared — even though he never signed any such papers , reports Chris Ingalls at KING channel 5 news in Seattle .
ADVERTISEMENT
And in another case , a sergeant who had signed up for a one - year tour of duty was shocked to discover his enlistment papers stated he had signed up for two years .
Former soldier Michael Patrick sounded the alarm when he discovered forged re-enlistment papers with his name on them .
“ Sounds crazy , ” Michael Patrick told KING 5 .
“ Sounds like something from a movie . ”
The Washington National Guard soon determined that Sgt. Wendy Schaefer , a recruiter , had paid soldiers and civilians out of her own pocket to sign up recruits .
She also promised the Guard would pay $ 1,000 for each enlistment .
According to Guard documents , Schaefer “ created an environment that may have caused some of these ‘ paid assistants ’ to fabricate documents in order to get money . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The documents we received in the Patrick case do not explain how anyone would possibly think they could get away with signing over a soldier ’s life , ” Ingalls reported .
In another instance , Sgt. Keith Jackson says he was confronted by his superiors with enlistment papers showing he signed up for a two - year tour of duty , when he says he signed up for a one - year tour .
“ I did n’t sign it , ” he told KING 5 .
“ That is n’t my signature . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ While the Guard denies the forgery it granted Jackson an honorable discharge soon after KING 5 first told his story , ” the channel reports .
In neither case has anyone in the Guard been disciplined .
Sgt. Schaefer told KING 5 in an email that she left the Guard with her record intact .
And the soldier who forged the signature in order to collect money from Schaefer has never been held to account either .

Well , you are tired of 8.00 am to 5.00 pm job .
That is the first step to start your business .
A painting company is a suitable investment as the industry is worth billions .
Furthermore , it is a recession - proof industry ; customers require regular repainting of their homesteads , business , fences , and newly constructed structures .
This guide will highlight the essentials for establishing your painting company :
Brand Name
Choose a unique name for your business .
It will help your organization stand out from the crowd .
Also , select a logo and business contacts ; these details should appear on your marketing campaigns , flyers , and business cards .
Customers use the details to reach you when they are vetting painters Pittsburgh , or want to hire you .
Register a Brand Name
File the paperwork of your company .
Customers prefer using a registered painting company to an unlicensed organization since you have to satisfy numerous regulations before the local authorities allow you to start operating .
For example , you have to complete a painters ’ course or hire a licensed professional in your team .
Furthermore , a registered brand is often more credible since the company will strive to satisfy clients ’ requirements .
File LLC Paperwork
A limited liability company ( LLC ) means that the business and the owner are two independent entities .
As such , if a client sues the company , you would be shielded from personal liability .
File for Insurance
A good painter ’s insurance offers compensation for equipment damage and staff injuries in the line of duty .
The insurance can also compensate damages on your clients ’ property , such as paint spills on furniture and carpet .
File for Employer Identification Number ( EIN )
The EIN is necessary for tax - compliant businesses ; for filing tax returns .
Business Account
Get a bank account where your clients will be depositing funds for assigned contracts .
The account will also help you process taxes , salaries , and determine whether your enterprise is profitable .
Tools and Equipment
Purchase crucial painters ’ accessories such as safety gear , brushes , electronic sprayers , ladders , and cranes , among other supplies .
The tool selection will help you accomplish your projects hassle - free .
A liberal named John Sumner , who goes by the pseudonym Devilstower , has weighed into the debate originally inspired by my article  Liberal Delusions about Freedom . 
Sumner ’s article ,  What Conservatives Mean When They Say  Libertarian ’ ,  which appeared yesterday on the liberal website Dailykos.com , reveals a lot about the liberal mindset as well as the reasons why America today is suffering so many economic woes .
Sumner takes me to task for singing the praises of our American ancestors , who chose a federal government without such statist programs as income taxation , Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , welfare , public ( i.e. , government ) schooling , food stamps , corporate bailouts , foreign aid , a central bank , paper money , drug laws , and many , many more .
Sumner thinks that that type of society was absolutely horrible and cites the terrible things that were taking place in the United States in 1880 , the year I pointed to in my article  Up from Serfdom . 
Sumner ’s response contains all the standard stuff that has long been taught in America ’s government - approved schools , where Sumner just happens to work as a substitute teacher .
You know , like the stuff that suggests that our American ancestors hated their wives and children , as reflected in their sending them into dangerous factories to work long hours .
You know , like the stuff that suggests that liberals love the poor , needy , and disadvantaged while advocates of the free market just love the rich , greedy , and selfish people in life .
You know , like the stuff that suggests that without the coercive apparatus of the welfare state , poor people and old people would just be dying in the streets .
As I have long pointed out , the problem with liberals is their dismally poor understanding of economics , and Sumner ’s article is just the most recent example of this phenomenon .
Permit me to explain why .
In their purported concern for the poor , liberals never ask the important question :
What is it that causes wealth and prosperity to come into existence ?
The only question they ask themselves is ,  What is the cause of poverty  ?
But the latter is a ridiculous question because poverty has always been the natural state of mankind .
Throughout history , most people have been poor .
Thus , the real question is :
What are the causes of wealth ?
What is it that enables societies to break free of the chains of poverty ?
Why are some societies wealthier than others ?
You would think that those would be important questions for a liberal , especially since liberals have long purported to be concerned about the poor .
Alas , those questions are unimportant to liberals .
Sumner , not surprisingly , does n’t raise the questions either .
Instead , he points out all the bad things that were taking place in , say 1880 , and then concludes that all those statist programs that our American ancestors rejected , and which are so beloved to Sumner , should be embraced .
In other words , he ’s suggesting that the absence of the statist programs is the cause of the bad living conditions in American society that he laments .
But his logic and his conclusions are faulty and fallacious .
No one denies that economic conditions were bad for many people in 1880 .
No question about it .
No dispute there .
But in focusing on those bad conditions , Sumner makes a common mistake .
He is comparing those conditions to conditions in which we live today or at least to some sort of ideal economic utopia .
In doing that , he misses the important point , which is this :
What were conditions for ordinary people prior to the Industrial Revolution ?
Answer :
As Hobbes put it , life was nasty , brutish , and short — that is , much , much worse than it was in 1880 America .
Capitalism and the His ... Best Price : $ 2.55 Buy New $ 24.00 ( as of 10:40 EST - Details )
As bad as things were in 1880 America , it was a golden era compared to the pre-industrial age .
This point was made as long ago as 1954 in a book entitled Capitalism and the Historians , which was edited by libertarian Nobel Prize - winning economist Friedrich Hayek .
As Austrian economist Murray Rothbard stated ,  Hayek contributed to and edited a series of essays that showed conclusively that the Industrial Revolution in England , spurred by a roughly free - market economy , enormously improved rather than crippled the standard of living of the average consumer and worker in England .
In this way , Hayek led the way in shattering one of the most widespread socialist myths about the Industrial Revolution . 
So , does that help clarify why I would refer to 1880 as a golden era ?
Not because of the bad things that were still existing ( duh ! ) but rather because for the first time in history , massive numbers of poor people actually had a decent chance to survive and even prosper .
In fact , in the 1880s there are countless stories of poor people actually becoming wealthy people !
Imagine that !
And why was this so ?
That ’s the critical question , the one that liberals never ask .
They just assume that wealth is a given , that there is this big economic pie , and that the state should confiscate the pie and redistribute it in the interests of making everyone have an equal share of the pie .
What liberals fail to recognize , however , is that in doing so , they begin a process that ends up condemning people to a life of massive poverty , starvation , famines , and short life spans that characterized the pre-industrial age .
To explain why I consider 1880 to be a golden era , especially for the poor , let ’s consider a modern - day example , one that a good liberal like John Sumner would consider to be a model society : the socialist paradise of North Korea .
In that country , everyone is equal in terms of economic condition .
The state owns everything , and everyone works for the state .
There are no profits , speculators , or entrepreneurs .
Greed and selfishness have been stamped out of society .
Total government ownership and total government control .
Everyone works for the benefit of the collective .
In other words , a liberal dream !
Oh , did I mention that there is also horrific poverty , famine , and starvation in North Korea ?
Let ’s assume , just for the sake of argumentation , that each year some 10 percent of the North Korean population is dying from malnutrition or illness .
Now , suppose we asked Sumner to give us his recommendation for ending poverty in North Korea .
What would he say ?
He would say :  Adopt a welfare state and a controlled economy !
Create bureaucratic departments , modeled on the IRS and U.S. welfare agencies , whose job it is to confiscate wealth from the rich and give it to the poor !
Do you see the problem though ?
Sumner would be doing what liberals always do : they assume that there is a pie of wealth to confiscate and redistribute .
That ’s their solution to ending poverty .
But he would be missing the obvious point :
They already have total socialism in North Korea , which is precisely why there is no pie for Sumner to confiscate and redistribute .
Everyone has nothing .
So , obviously the standard liberal statist solution for ending poverty is n’t going to work in our North Korea hypothetical .
Instead , we have come up with another solution .
Let ’s try a free - market - oriented solution , similar to the one that our American ancestors adopted and embraced .
( I say oriented  because freedom is n’t really freedom when government is permitting people to exercise it . )
Let ’s assume that the North Korea authorities place 60 percent of the land and buildings in North Korea under private ownership .
They also enact a law that permits 60 percent of the North Korean populace to engage in any economic enterprise they want , without any permission or interference from the state .
The people in that sector will be free to engage in any mutually beneficial exchange with anyone in the world .
There will be no income tax , and people will be free to accumulate unlimited amounts of wealth .
There will be no economic regulations whatsoever , including price controls , minimum - wage laws , and anti-speculation laws .
There will be no Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , or any other government welfare plan .
No central bank and no paper money ; the market will determine the media of exchange .
No one will be coerced into helping another person but will be free to do so if he wishes .
There will be no restrictions on emigration or immigration .
After 10 years , Sumner and I make a visit to North Korea .
We discover that there is now an enormous difference between the liberated sector and the government - owned sector .
In the liberated sector , there are no more famines , no more starvation .
People ’s real standard of living is soaring .
That ’s not to say though that things are easy in the liberated sector .
There is still much poverty given that it was only 10 years ago that people had absolutely nothing and were on the verge of starvation .
People are having to work long hours in difficult working conditions , and that includes spouses and children .
But everyone knows that those conditions are a blessing , compared to what is still happening in the government - controlled sector , where everyone is suffering much more horrific poverty and where 10 percent of the populace continues to die , year after year .
Now , I would call that a golden era , one in which 60 percent of the population was not only being saved but actually prospering .
What would Sumner say in response ?
He would say ,  Why , that ’s just the most ridiculous thing I ’ve ever heard !
That ’s no golden era because the people in the government - owned sector are still suffering and dying .
Hornberger must think that all that misery and death is a good thing .
And look at how much poverty there still is in the liberated section . 
Even worse is what Sumner would propose .
Furious over the fact that people in the free - market sector now have more wealth than people in the government - owned sector , he would propose statist programs that would restore government control and ownership over the free - market sector .
As a good liberal , what would matter to him is that everyone should be made equal , even if everyone is made equally poor .
Would his criticism leveled at me be valid ?
Would I really be praising the government - owned sector when I referred to this period as a golden one ?
Of course not !
What I would be praising is that libertarian economic means — i.e. , the free market — have been used to bring 60 percent of the population out of horrific poverty and given them a chance to survive and even to prosper , especially as the generations progress .
What would be my solution to the bad things still remaining ?
That ’s obvious — I would expand private - property , free - market principles to the 40 percent sector , enabling everyone in North Korean society to experience the benefits of the unhampered market economy .
And this is precisely what was going on in the United States throughout the 1800s , notwithstanding the fact that there were a large number of people to whom free - market principles were not being applied , such as the slaves .
But for the sector that was liberated , it was the most phenomenal era in history , insofar as living standards were concerned .
People were actually going from rags to riches into one , two , or three generations .
The proof of the pudding was the thousands of penniless immigrants who were fleeing the lands of government control and regulation to come to the land of little or no income taxation , regulation , or welfare .
They just wanted a chance to make it , all on their own .
Did I mention that 19th - century America was not only the most prosperous nation in history but also the most charitable nation in history ?
In a land with no income tax and no welfare state , it was voluntary contributions that built the churches , opera houses , museums , and so much more .
So , what was the obvious solution to those Americans who were not permitted to experience the benefits of economic liberty ?
Expand it to them !
What was the solution to the restrictions on liberty still being enacted in the 19th century ?
Repeal them !
In fact , the best thing Americans could ever do today is enact a constitutional amendment for economic liberty similar to the one our American ancestors enacted for religious liberty :  No law shall be passed respecting the regulation of commerce or abridging the free exercise thereof . 
The worst thing that could have ever happened was to return to the old , bankrupt idea of government ownership and control .
But that ’s precisely where liberals took us , with their socialistic welfare state .
Gripped by envy and covetousness and unable to control themselves as they saw the enormous wealth coming into existence because of the free market , liberals ( or progressives  as some of them like to call themselves ) brought into existence in the 20th century a massive confiscatory and redistributive socialist system , one that has been taking our country down the road to serfdom , impoverishment , and loss of liberty , the road that humanity has traveled throughout the ages .
Liberals have long justified their socialist and interventionist schemes under the pretense of loving the poor , needy , and disadvantaged .
And their favorite justification whenever their programs go awry is ,  But we have good intentions . 
But good intentions are irrelevant .
All that matters is reality , especially in terms of the immorality and destructiveness that have accompanied socialism and interventionism .
Sumner piously points out that 1880 , the year that I used as an example of economic liberty , was characterized by the Chinese Exclusion Act .
Of course , that could n’t be true given that the Act was n’t enacted until 1882 .
( Oh well , what ’s a couple of years ? )
But his real point in bringing it up was to imply that the period was n’t really golden because there was an immigration restriction on Chinese immigrants .
But let ’s use Sumner ’s example to show the rank hypocrisy with which liberals have long suffered .
He complains about a law that excluded Chinese from freely immigrating to America , and rightfully so .
Yet , look at what 20th - century liberals have done for decades :
They ’ve used immigration controls to exclude not only Chinese but also Mexicans , Nicaraguans , Africans , Haitians , and , well , the poor of just about every country in the world .
Is n’t it the liberals — the lovers of the poor — under liberal icon Barack Obama who are continuing the building of that fortified fence along our southern border , to keep the poor from coming here and trying to sustain their life through labor ?
Is n’t it the liberals who are conducting those raids on businesses all across the land , rounding up poor people who just want to work and improve the lot of their families , deporting them to their home countries where they can experience a life of hardship and poverty ?
In fact , was n’t it under the regime of liberal icon Bill Clinton that U.S. forces were attacking defenseless poor people , including women and children , who had escaped socialist and communist tyranny in Cuba and were trying to make it to the United States ?
Did n’t liberals forcibly repatriate those refugees to Cuba ?
Oh well , maybe Sumner would argue that is was for their own good , since in Cuba there is free education , free health care , and free everything else in that paternalistic society .
Please , Sumner , remind me again how much you liberals love the poor , because I ’m tempted to say that an era in which there is only one group of people who are being excluded is golden compared to the massive numbers of poor people that you liberals have been excluding from our country for decades under the guise of immigration controls .
In fact , would you , as a good , poor - person - loving liberal , explain something to me that I ’ve always had trouble understanding .
As you know , the premier icon for you people is Franklin D. Roosevelt .
You liberals say that his enactment of Social Security , the crown jewel of the socialistic welfare state , showed how much he loved the poor , needy , and disadvantaged .
Well , if that ’s the case , would you please explain to me FDR ’s attitude toward German Jews during the 1930s ?
Would you please explain to me why he refused to permit them to come to America when Hitler was willing to let them go ?
Were n’t they poor ?
And while you ’re at it , can you please explain to me why he refused to let those poor Jews traveling on the SS St. Louis to disembark at Miami Harbor in the infamous voyage of the damned ?
You see , I ’m having a difficult time understanding why a man who purports to love the poor would do that to poor Jews .
And I ’m also having a difficult time understanding why you liberals would extol a man who did that sort of thing to poor Jews .
Please provide me with your best explanation on this , because I ’m tempted to conclude that Roosevelt ’s Social Security plan had nothing to do with any purported love of the poor but instead everything to do with the love of power and with making as many people dependent on the federal government as possible .
Oh , and while you are at it , would you explain to me something about FDR ’s protg , the liberal icon Lyndon Johnson , who brought Medicare and Medicaid into existence because of his purported love for the poor , needy , and disadvantaged ?
LBJ , as I hope you know , killed some million Vietnamese people , most of whom were poor , in an illegal war that was based on nothing but lies .
He also sent some 58,000 of my generation to their deaths in Vietnam , many of whom were poor because that ’s who they were drafting to fight in that war .
Would you be so kind as to reconcile that one for me , because I ’m getting real tempted to conclude that LBJ ’s Medicare and Medicaid plans were nothing more than a political power grab designed to put more Americans under the yoke of federal power and dependency ?
While we ’re on the subject , I also have a question about liberal icon Bill Clinton , another purported lover of the poor , needy , and disadvantaged .
During the entire 8 years he was in office , he killed hundred of thousands of Iraqi children with the brutal sanctions that he enforced against that country .
His U.S. Ambassador to the UN , Madeleine Albright , another liberal icon , said that those deaths were worth the attempt to oust Saddam Hussein from power .
That ’s always been difficult for me to swallow .
How can the deaths of poor , innocent children ever be worth a political goal such as regime change , especially given that Saddam had once been the partner of the U.S. government ?
Of course , I ’d be remiss if I failed to mention the vicious attack by liberal icon Janet Reno ( and Bill Clinton ) on the poor people inside the Branch Davidian compound at Waco , including innocent children , given that today is the 17th anniversary of that horrific slaughter .
Oh , one final thing , Sumner .
Please do n’t lump conservatives with libertarians , especially since there ai n’t a dime ’s worth of difference between liberals and conservatives .
Both of you are statist to the core , and both of you are lovers of big government , big spending , big debt , and big inflation .
And both of you are taking our nation down the road to serfdom , bankruptcy , and moral debauchery .
The only solution to the woes that you statists , both liberals and conservatives , have foisted onto our nation lies with libertarianism .
Our American ancestors discovered the truth , and lots of Americans are now re-discovering it , which is precisely why you statists are so terrified .
The Best of Jacob G. Hornberger
Glenn Beck and other far right multi-millionaires are claiming that the US is hot on the path towards socialism .
Part of their claim is that the US is much more generous and supportive of our working and poor people than other countries .
People may wish it was so , but it is not .
As Senator Patrick Moynihan used to say “ Everyone is entitled to their own opinions .
But everyone is not entitled to their own facts . ”
The fact is that the US is not really all that generous to our working and poor people compared to other countries .
Consider the US in comparison to the rest of the 30 countries that join the US in making up the OECD – the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
These 30 countries include Canada and most comparable European countries but also include some struggling countries like Czech Republic , Greece , Hungary , Korea , Mexico , Poland , Slovak Republic , and Turkey .
See www.oecd.org
When you look at how the US compares to these 30 countries , the hot air myths about the US government going all out towards socialism sort of disappear into thin air .
Here are some examples of myths that do not hold up .
Myth # 1 .
The US government is involved in class warfare attacking the rich to lift up the poor .
There is a class war going on all right .
But it is the rich against the rest of us and the rich are winning .
The gap between the rich and everyone else is wider in the US than any of the 30 other countries surveyed .
In fact , the top 10 % in the US have a higher annual income than any other country .
And the poorest 10 % in the US are below the average of the other OECD countries .
The rich in the U.S. have been rapidly leaving the middle class and poor behind since the 1980s .
Myth # 2 .
The US already has the greatest health care system in the world .
Infant mortality in the US is 4th worst among OECD countries – better only than Mexico , Turkey and the Slovak Republic .
Myth # 3 .
There is less poverty in the US than anywhere .
Child poverty in the US , at over 20 % or one out of every five kids , is double the average of the 30 OECD countries .
Myth # 4 .
The US is generous in its treatment of families with children .
The US ranks in the bottom half of countries in terms of financial benefits for families with children .
Over half of the 30 OECD countries pay families with children cash benefits regardless of the income of the family .
Some among those countries ( e.g. Austria , France and Germany ) pay additional benefits if the family is low - income , or one of the parents is unemployed .
Myth # 5 .
The US is very supportive of its workers .
The US gives no paid leave for working mothers having children .
Every single one of the other 30 OECD countries has some form of paid leave .
The US ranks dead last in this .
Over two thirds of the countries give some form of paid paternity leave .
The US also gives no paid leave for fathers .
In fact , it is only workers in the US who have no guaranteed days of paid leave at all .
Korea is the next lowest to the US and it has a minimum of 8 paid annual days of leave .
Most of the other 30 countries require a minimum of 20 days of annual paid leave for their workers .
Myth # 6 .
Poor people have more chance of becoming rich in the US than anywhere else .
Social mobility ( how children move up or down the economic ladder in comparison with their parents ) in earnings , wages and education tends to be easier in Australia , Canada and Nordic countries like Denmark , Norway , and Finland , than in the US .
That means more of the rich stay rich and more of the poor stay poor here in the US .
Myth # 7 .
The US spends generously on public education .
In terms of spending for public education , the US is just about average among the 30 countries of the OECD .
Educational achievement of US children , however , is 7th worst in the OECD .
On public spending for childcare and early education , the US is in the bottom third .
Myth # 8 .
The US government is redistributing income from the rich to the poor .
There is little redistribution of income by government in the U.S. in part because spending on social benefits like unemployment and family benefits is so low .
Of the 30 countries in the OECD , only in Korea is the impact of governmental spending lower .
Myth # 9 .
The US generously gives foreign aid to countries across the world .
The US gives the smallest percentage of aid of any of the developed countries in the OECD .
In 2007 the US was tied for last with Greece .
In 2008 , we were tied for last with Japan .
Despite the opinions of right wing folks , the facts say the US is not on the path towards socialism .
But if socialism means the US would go down the path of being more generous with our babies , our children , our working families , our pregnant mothers , and our sisters and brothers across the world , I think we could all appreciate it .
• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
A diplomatic row has erupted between Spain and Venezuela after a Spanish judge accused officials in Caracas of plotting with rebel groups to kill Colombian President Álvaro Uribe and other political officials .
Spanish National Court Judge Eloy Velasco charged on Monday that the government of Hugo Chávez had been working as an intermediary between the Basque separatist group ETA and the Colombian guerrilla group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) .
The groups were allegedly plotting against prominent political figures living in or traveling through Spain .
Venezuelan officials have dismissed these allegations as “ biased and unfounded . ”
Spanish officials ordered that 12 supposed members of ETA and FARC stand trial for conspiracy to commit murder and conduct terrorist acts , reports The Wall Street Journal .
" There is evidence … showing the cooperation of the Venezuelan government in the illegal collaboration between FARC and ETA , " according to the indictment ....
The indictments also bring fresh attention to Spain 's National Court , whose judges act on their own investigations and are independent from Spain 's executive and legislative branches .
Some judges have gained international attention , and criticism , for their handling of global cases involving other governments , including an investigation into allegations of US torture at Guantanamo Bay .
Although Mr. Chávez has yet to comment on the allegations , throughout Caracas the charges have been met with widespread contempt .
“ We do not house guerrillas , nor do we have a pact with guerrillas , ” said Venezuelan Congressman Hayden Pirela in an article by Iran ’s Press TV .
According to Judge Velasco ’s 26 - page report , however , up to six ETA members traveled to Venezuela to train FARC members how to use C4 explosives in cellphone bombs , reports The Guardian .
In at least one instance , members from the Venezuelan military may have been present for the demolitions training .
The report also says that ETA members may have traveled through Venezuela en route to FARC training camps in Colombia .
A Venezuelan agriculture ministry official , identified as Arturo Cubillas Fontán , is alleged to be the ETA 's ringleader in Latin America and the link man with FARC .
Government officials in Caracas counter that many of the accusations in the report come from information that was obtained from a computer that used to belong to Raul Reyes , FARC ’s former No. 2 , who was killed by the Colombian military in March 2008 , reports the Latin American Herald Tribune .
In its communique , the Venezuelan government calls it “ surprising that the judge resuscitates the worn - out farce of the computer , which has already become a part of Colombian political folklore . ”
The dispute is likely to strain leaders in Venezuela , Spain , and Colombia .
Venezuela ’s ailing economy and electricity shortages have already dealt a serious blow to Chávez ’s popularity .
In Spain and Colombia , it will test the diplomatic work of leaders who ’ve been working to build stronger ties with Venezuela .
Although Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero has demanded an immediate explanation of the alleged terrorist links from Venezuela , the Spanish leader says he is still awaiting a response .
The Olive Press , an online Spanish newspaper , reports that Mr. Zapatero said : “ The government of Spain will decide what to do when it receives that explanation . ”
Spain 's foreign minister said Tuesday morning that Venezuela had pledged to cooperate with the Spanish court and investigate the matter , the Associated Press reported .

John McLaughlin and The 4th DimensionTo
The One2010
It 's seems like a while since John McLaughlin recorded in such a stripped down context with a working band .
Recordings such as Industrial Zen ( Verve , 2006 ) and Floating Point ( Abstract Logix , 2008 ) found the English guitarist in rich compositional form and displaying outstanding chops , but neither project led to the formation of a live band .
McLaughlin has been molding the 4th Dimension into a formidable live unit since around mid 2008 , so it is fitting that this latest incarnation of McLaughlin 's continuing musical exploration finds its way onto record .
At just over 40 minutes , the length of an old LP , the succinctness of the recording is perhaps also cause for celebration in times when the 70 minutes plus that is often thrust on the consumer can frequently result in too much stodge and not enough lean meat .
The six originals here are refreshingly lean and direct , and the energy of the album sounds as if there was little in the way of overdubs .
With a formidable rhythm section in drummerand bassist Etienne M'Bappé ( the latter having replaced Hadrien Feraud ) driving the unit , the stage is set for some of McLaughlin 's most extended and firey yet controlled soloing in years .
Keyboardistalso shines on this recording , and his playing is particularly sympathetic to the leader 's musical mindset .
Few have delved as deeply into McLaughlin 's music as Husband , as evidenced on his outstanding piano solo recording , A Meeting Of Spirits : Interpretations Of The Music Of John McLaughlin ( Alternity Records , 2006 ) .
The two Yorkshiremen complement each other perfectly , especially on the two slower numbers , " Special Beings " and " Lost and Found , " where the emotional content of the music reigns over technical prowess .
The first of these two numbers recreates the atmosphere of the gorgeous " New York On My Mind " from John McLaughlin , Electric Guitarist ( Columbia , 1978 ) , beautifully laid back at the outset yet emotionally cutting .
Husband and McLaughlin both take extended improvisations which seem effortless , yet which are totally absorbing .
The momentum rises and falls continuously , yet almost imperceptibly , with Husband handing the lead to McLaughlin and vice - versa , like a juggling act with complete trust in each other .
Tender , joyous and exuberant in turn , this is one of McLaughlin 's most striking compositions .
Tender is also an apt word to describe " Lost and Found . "
M'Bappé 's deep , elastic bass sound guides the song , with McLaughlin meditating on his beloved guitar synthesizer .
In truth , he has rarely sounded more heartfelt on this instrument , displaying the soft lyricism of a flute .
Husband 's minimal piano penetrates the reverie in dramatically beautiful manner , and his dabs develop into a teasing run which ends disappointingly abruptly , for this was surely going somewhere quite sublime .
Then again , you can't have your 40 minutes and eat it .
There is an air of familiarity about this music , but a lot of that simply has to do with the distinctiveness of McLaughlin 's sound and his trademark melodic approach to music making .
The pacey " Discovery " sounds like it has been part of McLaughlin 's canon since forever , and the quoting of " Lila 's Dance " in " To The One , " from the 's Visions Of The Emerald Beyond ( Columbia , 1975 ) is not a cheap nod to the legion of Mahavishnu fans , but a spontaneous return to a much loved piece of music , something which McLaughlin has always done , particularly in a live setting .
Simply listening to his improvisations throughout the six originals leaves no doubt that he is in inspired creative form .
In fact , according to McLaughlin the music is inspired by the spirituality of saxophonist 's A Love Supreme , ( Impulse ! , 1965 ) , a seminal influence on the young guitarist , who when he first heard it had yet to leave his native shores to embark upon his legendary musical adventure that would lead him to trumpeter , the Mahavishnu Orchestra , and beyond .
McLaughlin declares that To The One is about two aspects of his life , music and spirituality , but when has there ever been a time in McLaughlin 's 40 year recording career when there was a division between the two ?
Tracks : Discovery ; Special Beings ; The Fine Line ; Lost and Found ; Recovery ; To the One . Personnel : John McLaughlin : guitar ( 1 - 3 , 5 ) , guitar synthesizer ( 4 , 6 ) ; Gary Husband : keyboards , drums ( 5 , 6 ) , additional drums ( 1 , 3 ) , additional percussion ( 1 ) ; Etienne M'Bappé : bass guitar ; Mark Mondesir : drums ( 1 - 4 ) , additional percussion ( 5 ) .
( I am sitting on a well - known whale - watching beach gathering data on migration numbers .
I have a pair of binoculars . )
Tourist : “ When are you going to put up the flags ? ”
Me : “ Oh , no , I am not a lifesaver . ”
Tourist : “ Of course you are .
Who else sits on a beach with binoculars ? ”
Me : “ Actually , I am recording how many whales go by . ”
Tourist : “ Whales ?
There are no whales here .
This is a swimming beach . ”
( I gesture to a pod of six whales passing around 50 meters away . )
Tourist : “ Oh , my goodness , killer whales !
My children are on the beach !
They could come right out of the water and steal my children ! ”

I recently went to Finland to drive the all - electric Think City plug - in car ( thinkev.com ) , which is already on European roads and coming to the U.S. later this year .
To help it have a soft landing , Think CEO Richard Canny ( who spent 25 years at Ford ) put together these nine myths about electric vehicles ( EV ) .
I 've had my own version , but Richard 's list is quite different and well worth sharing .
He 's not an objective party , of course , but he has hands - on experience .
Here are Canny 's nine electric vehicle myths :
1 . You are just moving the pollution out of the cities to the countryside .
Busted : Electric vehicle motors are three - to - five times more efficient than gasoline - powered vehicles .
While it 's best to power EVs from renewable energy sources ( which are growing quickly ) , the efficiency of EVs makes them cleaner , producing less carbon , under any situation -- even when they are charged using coal - fired electricity .
2. Customers will never buy a car with less than a 200 - mile range .
Busted : So - called " range anxiety " diminishes when people get used to driving EVs on a daily basis .
It 's just like charging a cell phone overnight .
You plug it in , and in the morning it 's ready to go , fully charged .
As more EVs hit the road , businesses and cities will add charging points to encourage EV use .
EVs can also be fast - charged ( our system goes from zero to 80 percent charged in just 15 minutes ) to help cover those rare situations when an EV will be needed to cover more than 100 miles in a single day .
3 . The battery wo n't last .
Busted : EV batteries are designed to last at least 10 years and more than 100,000 miles .
There are cars on the road in Europe with batteries approaching the 10 - year mark .
Some EVs have been on the road in Europe with packs approaching the 10 - year - old mark , and modern lithium - ion batteries will definitely meet or exceed that target .
4 . You 'll need to build a lot more power plants .
Busted : Actually , there 's enough off - peak electricity in the U.S. to power 79 percent of U.S. driving demand .
As more EVs are deployed , it 's important to ensure that the smart - charging ( time - based charging management ) and vehicle - to - grid connectivity progresses as well .
A connected network of millions of micro-energy storage devices ( which is what EVs will become ) provides significant opportunities to improve the stability and performance of electric grids and better balance peak demand .
5 . We 're going to run out of lithium - and is n't it poisonous ?
Busted : Lithium carbonate today comes from dried salt lakes in South America ( Chile , Argentina and Bolivia ) and China .
There are also other huge sources for lithium , although these are more expensive to develop .
Lithium can even be extracted from salt water and projects are under way to do this .
The industry will not have a shortage of lithium for the next decade .
It is also possible that new battery technologies will be based on other light metals like zinc or nickel .
Lithium from used batteries will be recycled in dedicated recycling plants .
Lithium batteries contain no poisonous heavy metals like lead in lead - acid batteries or cadmium in NiCd batteries .
6 . The infrastructure has to come first .
Busted :
The best way to deploy EVs is to get cars on the road first , then add infrastructure .
If there are no EVs to use those plugs and parking spots , people see it as wasteful .
We think infrastructure is a small part of good policy at a federal , regional and local level to support EV early adopters .
7 . They 're not safe .
Busted : Highway - certified EVs meet all the same safety and crash test requirements as regular production cars with some important extras .
8 . The technology is too complicated .
Busted : A modern electric car has only about five main moving parts compared with hundreds in an internal - combustion engine .
There are no regular visits to the dealership for an EV .
No oil changes , no filters -- even brake pads last two - to - three times longer than in conventional cars , because EVs use regenerative braking to recapture the energy that would otherwise be lost while braking .
Your first trip to the dealership with an EV for scheduled maintenance is at 40,000 miles to check the brake pads .
Eventually , you 'll need new wiper blades and tires .
But that 's about it !
9 . Fast charging EV batteries in 15 minutes will wear them out quickly .
Busted : Modern prismatic lithium batteries can be developed with fast - charging in mind .
The critical technology is in the cell design to manage battery temperature during charging .
Limiting fast charging to the zero to 80 percent range also protects battery life .
We think that 95 percent or more of all EV miles will be driven on cars charged during overnight off - peak periods when electricity is cheaper and readily available .
Fast charging locations provide reassurance and peace of mind for those occasional days where more than 100 miles are required .

Hello , Jeff - I am 100 % sure that Mrs. Adablo 's work , at Tyson , where she worked on the assembly line slaughtering cattle , most assuredly led to her death from a form of CJD / Mad Cow Disease .
There really needs to be an epidemiological follow up of workers who work in slaughtering plants .
My guess is Mrs. Adablo is not the first worker .
I would bet the farm that if such a health followup were carried out that we would also see many deaths from ' Alzheimers ' Disease as well as Mad Cow .

I see Linda Andablo died on February 6 , 2010 - quite a while ago - I wonder what has gone on behind the scenes between 2/6 and now . . . . . they ( USDA , etc. ) have had a long time to make mischief !
do you know if any of the TSE experts ( including those in UK ) are or have participating in an autopsy or examining sections of the brain ?
Do you know if her brain is being examined for NV CJD ?
Her employment at the slaughterhouse particupating in euthanasia and exposed to " brain mist " and potentially prion infected brains , spinal cords , etc. creates quite a problem for the USDA spin factory . . . ?
They cannot admit she had nv CJD because it would acknowledge infected animals are being processed at abattoirs . . . . but she is too young for sporadic . . . . .

Irma Linda Andablo CJD
Victim , she died at 38 years old on February 6 , 2010 in Mesquite Texas .
She left 6 Kids and a Husband .
The Purpose of this web is to give information in Spanish to the Hispanic community , and to all the community who want 's information about this terrible disease . - Physician Discharge Summary , Parkland Hospital , Dallas Texas Admit Date : 12/29/2009 Discharge Date : 1/20/2010 Attending Provider : Greenberg , Benjamin Morris ; General Neurology Team : General Neurology Team Linda was an Hispanic female with no past medical history presents with 14 months of incresing / progressive altered mental status , generalized weakness , inability to walk , loss of appetite , inability to speak , tremor and bowel / blader incontinence .
She was , in her usual state of health up until February , 2009 , when her husbans notes that she began forgetting things like names and short term memories .
He also noticed mild / vague personality changes such as increased aggression .
In March , she was involved in a hit and run MVA , although she was not injured .
The police tracked her down and ticketed her .
At that time , her son deployed to Iraq with the Army and her husband assumed her mentation changes were due to stress over these two events .
Also in March , she began to have weakness in her legs , making it difficult to walk .
Over the next few months , her mentation and personality changes worsened , getting to a point where she could no longer recognized her children .
She was eating less and less .
She was losing more weight .
In the last 2 - 3 months , she reached the point where she could not walk without an assist , then 1 month ago , she stopped talking , only making grunting / aggressive sounds when anyone came near her .
She also became both bowel and bladder incontinent , having to wear diapers .
Her ' " tremor ' " and body jerks worsened and her hands assumed a sort of permanent grip position , leading her family to put tennis balls in her hands to protect her fingers .
The husband says that they have lived in Nebraska for the past 21 years .
They had seen a doctor there during the summer time who prescribed her Seroquel and Lexapro , Thinking these were sx of a mood disorder .
However , the medications did not help and she continued to deteriorate clinically .
Up until about 6 years ago , the pt worked at Tyson foods where she worked on the assembly line , slaughtering cattle and preparing them for packaging .
She was exposed to brain and spinal cord matter when she would euthanize the cattle .
The husband says that he does not know any fellow workers with a similar illness .
He also says that she did not have any preceeding illness or travel .
What is Creutzfeldt - Jakob Disease ?
Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) is a rare , degenerative , invariably fatal brain disorder .
It affects about one person in every one million people per year worldwide ; in the United States there are about 200 cases per year .
CJD usually appears in later life and runs a rapid course .
Typically , onset of symptoms occurs about age 60 , and about 90 percent of patients die within 1 year .
In the early stages of disease , patients may have failing memory , behavioral changes , lack of coordination and visual disturbances .
As the illness progresses , mental deterioration becomes pronounced and involuntary movements , blindness , weakness of extremities , and coma may occur .
There are three major categories of CJD :
In sporadic CJD , the disease appears even though the person has no known risk factors for the disease .
This is by far the most common type of CJD and accounts for at least 85 percent
In hereditary CJD , the person has a family history of the disease and / or tests positive for a genetic mutation associated with CJD .
About 5 to 10 percent of cases of CJD in the United States are hereditary .
In acquired CJD , the disease is transmitted by exposure to brain or nervous system tissue , usually through certain medical procedures .
There is no evidence that CJD is contagious through casual contact with a CJD patient .
Since CJD was first described in 1920 , fewer than 1 percent of cases have been acquired CJD .
CJD belongs to a family of human and animal diseases known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( TSEs ) .
Spongiform refers to the characteristic appearance of infected brains , which become filled with holes until they resemble sponges under a microscope .
CJD is the most common of the known human TSEs .
Other human TSEs include kuru , fatal familial insomnia ( FFI ) , and Gerstmann - Straussler - Scheinker disease ( GSS ) .
Kuru was identified in people of an isolated tribe in Papua New Guinea and has now almost disappeared .
FFI and GSS are extremely rare hereditary diseases , found in just a few families around the world .
Other TSEs are found in specific kinds of animals .
These include bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , which is found in cows and is often referred to as " mad cow " disease ; scrapie , which affects sheep and goats ; mink encephalopathy ; and feline encephalopathy .
Similar diseases have occurred in elk , deer , and exotic zoo animals .
What are the Symptoms of the Disease ?
CJD is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia .
Initially , patients experience problems with muscular coordination ; personality changes , including impaired memory , judgment , and thinking ; and impaired vision .
People with the disease also may experience insomnia , depression , or unusual sensations .
CJD does not cause a fever or other flu - like symptoms .
As the illness progresses , the patients ' mental impairment becomes severe .
They often develop involuntary muscle jerks called myoclonus , and they may go blind .
They eventually lose the ability to move and speak and enter a coma .
Pneumonia and other infections often occur in these patients and can lead to death .
There are several known variants of CJD .
These variants differ somewhat in the symptoms and course of the disease .
For example , a variant form of the disease - called new variant or variant ( nv - CJD , v-CJD ) , described in Great Britain and France - begins primarily with psychiatric symptoms , affects younger patients than other types of CJD , and has a longer than usual duration from onset of symptoms to death .
Another variant , called the panencephalopathic form , occurs primarily in Japan and has a relatively long course , with symptoms often progressing for several years .
Scientists are trying to learn what causes these variations in the symptoms and course of the disease .
Some symptoms of CJD can be similar to symptoms of other progressive neurological disorders , such as Alzheimer 's or Huntington 's disease .
However , CJD causes unique changes in brain tissue which can be seen at autopsy .
It also tends to cause more rapid deterioration of a person 's abilities than Alzheimer 's disease or most other types of dementia .

The great IP crunch of 2010
September 21 , 1999
Web posted at : 12:29 p.m. EDT ( 1629 GMT )
by Mark Frauenfelder
( IDG ) -- Bank panics .
blackouts .
food riots .
doomsayers have n't had so much fun since , well , since Y1K .
So what will they do when Y2 K has come and gone ?
Most likely they 'll set their sights on technology 's next day of judgment : the Great IP Crunch of 2010 .
That 's the year the Internet Engineering Task Force predicts that every available Internet Protocol address will be taken , making new connections to the Net impossible .
How could such a thing happen ?
Before you accuse the Internet 's creators of shortsightedness , recall that the Arpanet ( the predecessor of the Internet ) was designed simply to help researchers at U.S. universities share precious computing resources , not to provide every PC , cell phone and toaster oven on the planet with its own node .
How were Vint Cerf , Jon Postel and Danny Cohen supposed to know that the system they sketched out on a piece of cardboard would one day be carrying everything from international currency transactions to Marilyn Manson videos ?
It 's a testament to their genius that the Internet Protocol they designed 20 years ago still holds up under the billions of bits sent today .
But there 's only so much the Internet can take .
Experts say that by 2010 the current Internet Protocol , IP v4 , will reach the end of its tether .
First , some background .
IP is the set of rules the Internet uses to send data from one computer to another .
IP v4 , the current Internet Protocol , uses 32 - bit addresses .
Problem is , you can juggle 32 bits into only 4 billion or so combinations .
That means only 4 billion or so addresses , which means only 4 billion or so computers on the Net. Period .
Of course , back in the old days , 4 billion addresses seemed like an inexhaustible supply .
When a company needed addresses for its network , the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority often gave it far more than it actually needed .
Companies like IBM ( IBM ) , AT&T and MIT each received 17 million IP addresses .
Only in the past several years has it become clear that the addresses are running out – about half of them have already been allocated .
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority is now a lot more careful in assigning IP addresses but the end is in sight .
What happens then ?
Enter IPv6 . ( IPv5 was a short - lived experimental protocol . )
IPv6 is the proposed replacement for IPv4 .
It has been in development by the Internet Engineering Task Force for about four years .
IP v6 offers many improvements over IP v4 , most notably its much larger number of potential addresses .
How many addresses can you get from IPv6 's 128 - bit header ?
Here 's one way to look at it : Imagine 1 trillion Bill Gateses standing in a circle ( not a pretty picture , but play along for a moment ) .
Now ask each one to convert his fortune into pennies and toss them in a collective pile .
If each penny contained 1 trillion tiny computers and each computer had its own IP address , you 'd still have used only a fraction of IPv6 's potential space .
There 's more – IP v6 offers things like quality of service , encryption and authentication , all of which were welcome improvements to IP v4 four years ago .
However , these days a number of IP v4 add - on applications do a fine job of making up for many of the protocol 's shortcomings .
Essentially , there are now only three reasons to switch to IP v6 : more addresses , better routing and autoconfiguration .
First , autoconfiguration .
Whenever a company adds a new computer to its network , that computer has to be set up with an IP address , DNS server , default router and so forth .
All of this information has to be manually entered either by the user , by a system administrator or through the use of DHCP ( Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ) , which automates much of the assignment procedure but requires its own maintenance .
In these days of massive company mergers , it 's not uncommon for a company to switch ISPs , which requires that every node be reassigned a new IP address .
With IPv6 , getting on the network is as simple as plugging a cable into your computer 's Ethernet port .
The second real advantage IPv6 has over IP v4 is the way it handles routing – how data packets hop from node to node as they travel to their final destinations .
A router controls traffic on a network or at an ISP , and it must maintain a table of all available routes so it can send data packets on their way .
As more organizations come online , the routing tables grow .
" [ IP v4 ] allocates and manages routing tables in ways that do n't scale well with the Internet 's growth , " says Richard Draves , who leads the Systems and Networking research group at Microsoft ( MSFT ) Research .
IP v6 , on the other hand , hierarchically assigns addresses , which makes routing more scalable .
But the most urgent reason to move to IP v6 is still the address problem .
With addresses in short supply , many companies can't get enough to assign to all the computers on their network .
When a firm has more computers than IP addresses , it uses a NAT ( Network Address Translation ) box to create a temporary connection between a computer and the Internet .
NAT systems are currently in widespread use around the world .
According to Martin McNealis , IP product - line manager at Cisco ( CSCO ) 's IOS Product Marketing division , NAT boxes are actually preferred over IP v6 by most Cisco customers .
Why ?
For one thing , everyone 's still using IPv4 .
" There 's an old maxim that says , ' Things that work persist , ' which is why there 's still Cobol floating around , " says Vint Cerf , who created TCP / IP with Robert Kahn in the 1970s and is now a senior VP at MCI WorldCom .
Clearly , switching over to IPv6 is not simple , especially for large sites with custom Internet software written for 32 - bit IP addresses .
Steve Deering , lead designer of IP v6 , compares the problem of upgrading that software to the Y2 K problem .
But instead of changing two - digit years into four - digit years , programmers have to sniff out 32 - bit address fields and change them to 128 - bit fields .
It 's a messy job , and another reason why many companies are dragging their feet in the switch to IPv6 .
But all things considered , Cerf and Deering say it 's well worth the trouble .
Cerf is almost religious in his belief : " Some of us feel NAT boxes are sort of an abomination because they really do mess about with the basic protocol architecture of the Internet . "
The more NAT boxes that are patched into the Internet , the less the Internet behaves as it was designed .
NAT boxes tremendously complicate the system .
" They introduce all sorts of problems into the Net , " says Deering , who also cochairs the IETF 's Internet Protocol Next Generation working group and is a technical leader at Cisco Systems .
Imagine , Deering says , having to go down to the post office to borrow a street address each time you wanted to send or receive mail .
NAT should be viewed only as a stopgap , Draves says .
" If the Internet came to rely on NAT fundamentally , the Internet would end up being much less maintainable overall and much more fragile . "
To help push IPv6 forward , the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority on July 19 gave regional registries around the world the go - ahead to begin assigning numbers based on the new standard .
So far , the majority of the organizations that requested IP v6 numbers are research departments and universities .
The only commercial ISPs to ask for such address blocks are two Japanese firms , Internet Initiative Japan and Nippon Telegraph & Telephone .
ISPs outside the U.S. may be more keen on switching to IPv6 than those in the U.S. because they 've had a tough time getting enough IP v4 addresses .
But if the number of mobile Internet devices takes off , more U.S. commercial companies may start clamoring for IP v6 addresses .
NAT does n't work well with mobile devices , and if the world is flooded with hundreds of millions of handheld Web browsers , there 'll be little choice but to switch to IPv6 .
Of course , if everyone waits until the last minute , it could end up costing much more not just to engineer the transition , but in the cost of the disruption to what has become a crucial part of our economic and social infrastructure .
At a meeting in July to launch the IPv6 Forum , a pro-IPv6 consortium of service providers and carriers , President Latif Ladid issued a warning : " Y2 K will be peanuts compared with moving from IP v4 , " he said .
" If nothing is done , in 10 years ' time it will be 10 times more expensive . "
Asking the Experts
Steve Deering
Lead designer of IPv6 ( and self - professed pessimist )
A : " It 's quite possible it wo n't happen .
It 's conceivable that we will just continue to do short - term hacks and band - aid whatever is required to keep living with IPv4 .
I think that would be very unfortunate for the health of the Internet . "
Vint Cerf
Cocreator of TCP /IP
A : " At some point there will be a critical mass of v6 users , and there will be a lot of pressure for everybody to become compatible with that .
" I imagine we may not ever be entirely free of v4 but what may happen is that the NAT boxes will be pressed into service to allow something to use a v4 address over a v6 protocol , as opposed to the inverse . "
Martin McNealis
IP product line manager , Cisco Systems
A : " At this point it is still very much ' to be decided . '
It depends on who you talk to .
It 's by no means a given that IPv6 will be the next - generation Internet infrastructure anytime soon . "
Rich Draves
Systems and Networking research group leader , Microsoft Research
A : " I would say I 'm pretty confident , but not extremely confident [ that we 'll migrate to IPv6 ] .
There 's a possibility that we wo n't .
I think that would be an unfortunate outcome ; the Net would end up becoming more fragile and less functional . "
Things are n't looking too good for the Republican Party 's messaging machine when a Republican law maker is having to run away from Dana Bash of all people and even former Rudy Giuliani staffer and Wingnut false equivalency king John Avalon is admitting Sarah Palin is inciting violence given the real threats to members of Congress this week .
Dana Bash tries to get Rep. Steve King to respond to why he thought it was alright to do this :
Iowa Congressman Steve King is showing his displeasure with passage of the health care reform bill .
During a protest at the capitol , on Sunday , the western Iowa Republican held up a poster of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
He first gave a " thumbs down " sign .
Then , King wiped his hand across her face .
That was followed by a slapping motion in front of Pelosi 's picture .
Here was King 's response to Bash before the coward ran away from her .
King :
Well that would be an exaggeration , but this is a melodrama .
( crosstalk )
Bash :
Tell me what your goal was with this .
King :
My goal is to inspire people to stand up for the Constitution , to stand up to fiscal responsibility and to stand up for the rule of law .
Bash added that he said he condemns any acts of violence .
What a guy .
I can't imagine how anyone might take him slapping Pelosi 's picture as condoning an act of violence toward her , can you ?
The Democrats problem with their messaging on this is that the Republicans " owned this " way before the events of this week .
The fact that they did n't speak out more forcefully before now have aided in allowing this crap to go on for the last year .
I want to see Bachmann and King at minimum along with a list of others censured by the House for their actions .
Rumproast has a post up that demonstrates why no one should ever take Sarah Palin seriously as a Presidential candidate ever again .
Sadly it 's so close to the truth it 's almost hard to tell it 's satire , but she 's every bit as dangerous as the likes of Steve King or Glenn Beck or most of the GOP these days for that matter .
We 've already had a church shot up , police officers in a shoot out with some nut who thought the government was going to take his guns away , a guard killed , an abortion doctor killed and an IRS building with a plane flown into it .
Now it 's members of Congress being threatened .
How many more people have to die before the right wing talkers , Fox News , right wing blogs , the astroturf Tea baggers movement and the Republican Party will ever say that this needs to stop and quit ratcheting up the hate ?
These people are leading our country down a very dangerous path .
It 's time for every person on any side of the aisle to say that this is not the country we want to live in where anyone has to be afraid to walk the streets or what might happen to their children or their family because of how they voted on a health care bill .
It 's time to tell the Republican Party to grow up and show some common decency .
I know that 's asking a lot , but maybe if enough people let them know how they 're acting is unacceptable in a civil society , they 'll get the message .
Steve King and the rest of the Republican Party should not be allowed to run away from this .
Last month I joined Mozilla as a UI engineer on the Fennec ( Mobile Firefox ) project .
Firefox is already available for Nokia 's Maemo platform , and now a group of Mozilla programmers are porting it to Android .
This Tuesday they asked for feedback on an early preview build .
Until now , the only people working on Firefox for Android were back - end ( platform ) developers .
This week was the first time most other people – including me – got to try it out .
We front - end developers and designers are now starting to adapt the user interface to Android .
For now it uses the look and feel of Firefox for Maemo .
Because we are an open source project , we like to share our work even at this early stage of development .
While I was n't directly involved in the Android development effort , I spent some of my spare time this week talking to users via Twitter and our Android feedback group .
Here 's what I heard , in rough order of importance to users , plus some information on our future plans .
1
Zoom and multi- touch : Pinch zoom gestures are coming !
We are reviewing a patch for animated multi-touch ( pinch ) zooming on Qt - based devices , and testing similar code on Android .
( Maemo devices have no multi- touch , so we use their volume buttons to zoom .
That code has n't been ported to Android , so only double - tap zoom was working in the preview build . )
We also had some requests to fit text to the screen when zoomed in , like the Android browser .
Today Brad Lassey and Ben Stover released the Easy Reading add - on that does exactly that .
We might make this a built - in option in Fennec once it is fast and reliable enough .
Menu and Back buttons :
The preview build did not handle Android 's standard hardware buttons , but code is now checked in to support the back button and the menu and search buttons .
We 'll continue to refine the way Fennec uses these buttons .
Size : A ten megabyte download ( over 30 MB installed ) is not huge for a desktop browser , but it 's hefty for a mobile app – especially on Android , where apps are saved to limited onboard memory .
Shrinking Fennec is possible , but not trivial .
Some of the library and toolkit code in our build is probably unused and could be removed .
And we could try minifying our Java­Script source , like many websites do .
Michael
Wu hopes current efforts like Omnijar and Thumb - 2 ( bug 563751 ) will cut the installed size approximately in half .
Users also reported that our Fennec build did not work with the feature in some custom Android ROMs to move apps to the SD card .
Mozilla 's Android devs are working on a fix for this .
It will be nice someday when app storage on Android is as plentiful as it is on other mobile platforms .
Hardware compatibility :
There are a lot of different Android phones out there .
Some of them wo n't run Fennec because they still have Android 1.5 or 1.6 .
We hope this will be fixed by the hardware vendors soon , since we currently rely on some Android 2.0 APIs .
Other devices failed for different reasons , possibly related to insufficient RAM or incom­patible OpenGL APIs .
We will need to optimize Firefox 's memory footprint on Android , and test on a wider selection of devices , perhaps with help from Firefox users .
Here 's a list of supported hardware .
Keyboard problems :
There were many problems with the software keyboard working intermittently or not at all , especially in landscape orienta­tion .
There were also prob­lems with Shift and Alt keys on some hardware keyboards .
I have n't heard any news about of these bugs , but we know we need to fix them quickly .
Speed : Strangely , we had some users calling Fennec slooooooow and others calling it fast as hell ( and those tweets were sent just one minute apart ) !
Once a page is loaded , Fennec is pretty speedy .
It 's faster than the Android browser in some areas , and slower in others .
But it 's definitely choppy while a page is still loading or complex scripts are running .
To fix this , our next major release of Fennec will include Elec­trolysis .
This gives Firefox a multi-process architecture much like Google Chrome , and ensures that the browser always stays responsive .
Electrolysis requires many changes to our code , so it may be a couple of months before it appears in usable Fennec builds .
In the mean­time , Mozilla is working on many other performance improvements .
This work will also speed up Firefox for desktop computers – I 've been using the FF4 nightly builds , and they are already much snappier than the Firefox 3.5 I was using before .
We 've also checked in some simple changes to improve perceived speed , like better feedback when pages start loading .
Crashing bugs :
Users were generally forgiving of crashes and other obvious bugs , to be expected at this stage of development .
We will of course fix any such bugs as fast as possible .
Add-ons :
We 're just starting Fennec 1.1 beta testing , and most of our add - ons are not yet updated for version 1.1 .
Unfortunately , this meant that many add - ons were not available to our first Android previewers .
This should be fixed over the next few weeks .
Add-ons are easily Firefox 's biggest advantage over other mobile browsers .
For the first time I can easily customize my phone 's browser exactly how I want .
I 've already written two Fennec add - ons , Read Later and Show Image Title .
And there are many great add - ons from other devel­opers to choose from .
User interface : Feedback on our UI was generally positive .
Most users said panning to reveal the toolbars felt natural and easy .
I think Madhava and Sean have done a great job with the design .
This will get even better as we take advantage of Android features like the hardware buttons , integration with other activities , voice input , and the notification bar .
Flash :
The Flash plugin is not yet included in our Android builds , but it will be supported eventually .
Firefox for Maemo already works with Flash , although enabling it does cause performance problems on some sites .
( We are working on fixing that with major changes to our graphics code . )

Laura Hall , 20 , was issued with a Drinking Banning Order - nicknamed Booze Asbos - which bars her from entering any pub , club , off - licence or bar .
The two - year order also bans Hall from buying alcohol at any other establishment or shop , carrying it in an unsealed container or drinking it in a public place .
Last orders : Laura
Hall was fined £ 75 after being found drunk near her home in Droitwich , Worcestershire
Police applied to magistrates after Hall was convicted of breaching an Asbo imposed for drink - related anti-social behaviour .
She has been convicted of a series of public order offences , and had flouted bans from pubs and clubs through local Pub - Watch schemes in her home town of Bromsgrove , Worcestershire .
Kidderminster Magistrates ' Court heard yesterday that Hall faces a £ 2,500 fine if she breaks the conditions of the order .
Sergeant David Roberts , of West Mercia Police , said : ' There have been some Drinking Banning Orders issued already but this is the first to be issued on a nationwide basis .
' It bans Laura Hall from drinking or buying alcohol in any licensed premises across England and Wales .
The conditions will also help to protect the public from the anti-social effects of Laura 's behaviour . '
Officers applied for a DBO rather than another Asbo because Hall would be at risk of prison if she breached it again .
' We want to rehabilitate her rather than send her straight to jail , and hope the banning order will help Laura address her problems , ' he said .
Under the terms of the order , Hall must attend an approved alcohol - misuse course .
If she completes it without breaching any of its terms , the DBO could be lifted after 12 months .
Since their introduction in September , police and local authorities can ask magistrates to impose the orders on anyone responsible for alcohol - fuelled crime or anti- social behaviour to stop them drinking or entering licensed premises .
They can not be issued to anyone with mental health problems or alcoholics .
But Rachel Seabrook , spokesman for the Institute of Alcohol Studies , said : ' I think most of the disorder problems we see around alcohol reflects a lack of police enforcement powers and policing laws .
' I am not opposed in principle but I do have doubts about whether it's a realistic thing to enforce .
How can a police officer in , say Wales , know whether this women has been banned if she turns up in his town ? '
A study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that female binge drinking had almost doubled over the last decade .
According to Government statistics , the number of women involved in alcohol - related crime rose 30 per cent between 2005 and 2007 .
The former president feels threatened with death .
But today , his supporters gather in Jalalabad , in the south .
The interim government wants to implement policy reforms to reduce the powers of the " dictatorial " presidency .
Quiet acceptance of the new order from Russia , the United States , Europe , OSCE , China .
Bishkek ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) -
The interim leader of Kyrgyzstan , Rosa Otunbaieva ( see photo ) , has asked the deposed president , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , to leave the country , assuring him his " personnel security " .
Bakiyev has fled south , where he attempts to regain power through appeals and complaints .
Yesterday , through some media , he launched accusations that the new government would " kill " him if he returned to Bishkek , while at the same time proposing a " dialogue " with what he calls " the opposition " .
For today , in Jalalabad , his feudal stronghold , a meeting between all his supporters is planned .
Bakiyev came to power in March 2005 after a revolution tainted by violence .
But now he has become unpopular for his authoritarian rule , cronyism and corruption , having impoverished the country .

It could soon be illegal to sit or lie on public sidewalks anywhere in San Francisco , a law Mayor Gavin Newsom says would make city life safer for pedestrians and merchants , but that homeless advocates and others say would amount to profiling against the poor .
Newsom will introduce two separate versions of a sit / lie law today at the Board of Supervisors .
One version would prohibit sitting or lying on public sidewalks in about 20 commercial corridors throughout the city and is modeled on a similar law in Seattle that was upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Court of Appeals .
The other would prevent the behavior everywhere , including in residential neighborhoods , and is believed to be a first nationwide .
" He 's not wedded to any particular approach , " said the mayor 's spokesman , Tony Winnicker .
" Obviously , we do want one to pass the board , and we 're introducing them with the hope and expectation the board will pass a meaningful sit / lie ordinance . "
Police Chief George Gascón has been pushing for a sit / lie ordinance in the Haight after learning of bands of thugs blocking sidewalks and bullying merchants , pedestrians and neighborhood residents .
Newsom , who bought a home in the Haight recently , was convinced to support an ordinance after walking along Haight Street with his infant daughter and seeing someone smoking crack and blocking the entrance of a business .
But many say the mayor 's sudden conversion to the idea has gone too far .
Public Defender Jeff Adachi said his office probably would challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance in court .
During a heated , five - hour Board of Supervisors public safety committee hearing on the issue Monday , Adachi showed photographs of behavior that would be illegal under Newsom 's proposed law : a well - heeled tourist sitting on her luggage as she waits for a cab , a little boy sitting on a sidewalk clutching his skateboard , and tourists sitting on a curb and gazing up at the sights .
Common sense included
Assistant Police Chief Kevin Cashman said all of those people would be warned first to move and that none of them would probably receive a citation .
" Obviously common sense is going to be part of the training with enforcement of this statute , " he said at the hearing .
That prompted homeless advocates to say that was their point : that only certain people would be subject to the law .
Cashman countered that many " open- minded , forward - thinking cities " have sit / lie ordinances including Seattle , Santa Cruz and Austin , Texas .
" The goal is not to arrest people - the goal is to change behavior , " he said .
Both versions of Newsom 's legislation were being finished by the city attorney 's office Monday , and neither that office nor the mayor 's office would release drafts .
According to a draft obtained by Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi late last week , the legislation would restrict sitting or lying on public sidewalks between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. and require that a first - time violator be warned by a police officer before receiving a citation with a $ 50 to $ 100 fine .
The second violation would be considered a misdemeanor and come with 10 days in jail or a fine of $ 300 to $ 500 , or both .
Each subsequent violation would be subject to up to a $ 500 fine and 30 days in jail .
Other restrictions
According to last week 's draft , the legislation also would restrict someone from placing or leaving an object on a sidewalk " unless the object is in hand or within two feet of the person 's nearest foot . "
It would also require that people who are stationary keep their animals on a leash and ensure their animals are not " more than two feet from the person as measured laterally from the animal 's neck to the person 's nearest knee . "
The legislation related to business corridors would affect about 20 busy areas ranging from 24th Street in Noe Valley to Broadway in North Beach to Castro Street .
Exceptions would be made for people sitting in wheelchairs , sitting or lying down because of a medical emergency , patronizing a business with a permit to operate on the sidewalk , sitting on a bench or attending a parade , festival or demonstration .
Winnicker cautioned that any of those details could change before the mayor submits the legislation at today 's Board of Supervisors meeting .
First Subprime , Now Europe Revenge of the Rating Agencies
Many observers assign a large part of the blame for the 2008 financial crisis to the " big three " credit rating agencies , which gave their AAA seal of approval to worthless investments .
Now those same agencies are helping to bring the euro zone to its knees -- and no one is trying to stop them .
This 6 - foot - tall ( 2 meter ) gazebo was built with D - shape 3 - D printing technology .
The monolithic sandstone structure was made of about 200 thin layers and is shown unfinished ( left ) and after a week of finishing by hand .
It was designed to look like a micro-organism called Radiolaria .
The structure in the background , overhead , is the printing device .
Future astronauts might end up living in a moon base createdlargely from lunar dust and regolith , if a giant 3 - D printing device can workon the lunar surface .
The print - on - demand technology , known as D - Shape , couldsave on launch and transportation costs for manned missionsto the moon .
But the concept must first prove itself in exploratory testsfunded by the European Space Agency ( ESA )
" We will make very basic printing trials in a vacuumenvironment to verify if this is possible , " said Enrico Dini , chairman of MonoliteUK Ltd and creator of D - Shape .
Dini's D - Shape has created full - size sandstone buildingson Earth by using a 3 - D printing process similar to how inkjet printers work .
It adds a special inorganic binder to sand so that it can build a structurefrom the bottom up , one layer at a time .
The device raises its printer head by just 5 to 10 millimeters for each layer , moving from side to side on horizontal beams aswell as up and down on four metal frame columns .
Finished structures end madeout of a marble - like material that 's superior to certain types of cement .
Thebuildings do not require iron reinforcing .
Such a concept might help future lunar colonists live offthe land , as well as provide thick - walled structures that protect against solarstorms or micrometeorites .
Space agencies have already begun testing other technologiesmeant to minewater and oxygen from the lunar regolith .
NASA scientists have also playedwith possible recipes for a sort of lunarconcrete based on moon dust .
But D - Shape offers the added attraction of having asomewhat straightforward building process that does not require huge amounts ofconstruction machinery or many robot laborers .
Making the device work in a lunar environment may yetprove tricky .
A first challenge involves making D - Shape function within thevacuum environment on a moon that lacks any meaningful atmospheric pressure .
But Dini remains self - admittedly optimistic by nature .
" I 'm not a scientist and I 'm not a technician — I 'man inventor , " Dini told SPACE.com .
He spent five years " facingunexpected issues and finding unexpected solutions " when he first designedD - Shape , before heeding the call from ESA .
Dini's Monolite has teamed up with an Italian aerospacefirm called Alta , which has a large vacuum chamber in its Pisa facilities .
Theyhope to build a small structure perhaps just 3 feet ( 1 meter ) on each sideduring the vacuum trials .
Other partners working on the ESA project includeFoster + Partners , a UK architecture firm , and Scuola Superiore Sant ?
AnnaPerceptual Robotics Laboratory , an Italian lab that specializes in robotics andautomation .
A second challenge comes from the cost of running D - Shapetrials by using expensive lunar regolith simulant .
Dini has tried developing apossible alternative to NASA 's JSC - 1 simulant that might work for his research .
Structures built from such material will have to undergo resistance testing .
Even a functional D - Shape that works with lunar regolithwould still face building limitations based on the amount of binder that arocket could carry to the moon .
Yet success would mean transforming lunardust into part of the solution , rather than just a problem for astronautsand robotic explorers .
NASA researchers have experimented with a different typeof on - site manufacturing device that could someday createspare parts or new materials for the International Space Station .
D- Shape couldalso end up deploying beyond Earth for additional testing , if all goes wellwith the first phase .
The most important trialswill be done in outer space , " Dini said .
1 . Does the president have inherent powers under the Constitution to conduct surveillance for national security purposes without judicial warrants , regardless of federal statutes ?
The Supreme Court has never held that the president has such powers .
As president , I will follow existing law , and when it comes to U.S. citizens and residents , I will only authorize surveillance for national security purposes consistent with FISA and other federal statutes .
2 . In what circumstances , if any , would the president have constitutional authority to bomb Iran without seeking a use - of - force authorization from Congress ?
( Specifically , what about the strategic bombing of suspected nuclear sites -- a situation that does not involve stopping an IMMINENT threat ? )
The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation .
As Commander - in - Chief , the President does have a duty to protect and defend the United States .
In instances of self - defense , the President would be within his constitutional authority to act before advising Congress or seeking its consent .
History has shown us time and again , however , that military action is most successful when it is authorized and supported by the Legislative branch .
It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action .
As for the specific question about bombing suspected nuclear sites , I recently introduced S.J. Res. 23 , which states in part that any offensive military action taken by the United States against Iran must be explicitly authorized by Congress . 
The recent NIE tells us that Iran in 2003 halted its effort to design a nuclear weapon .
While this does not mean that Iran is no longer a threat to the United States or its allies , it does give us time to conduct aggressive and principled personal diplomacy aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons .
3 . Does the Constitution empower the president to disregard a congressional statute limiting the deployment of troops -- either by capping the number of troops that may be deployed to a particular country or by setting minimum home - stays between deployments ?
In other words , is that level of deployment management beyond the constitutional power of Congress to regulate ?
No , the President does not have that power .
To date , several Congresses have imposed limitations on the number of US troops deployed in a given situation .
As President , I will not assert a constitutional authority to deploy troops in a manner contrary to an express limit imposed by Congress and adopted into law .
4 . Under what circumstances , if any , would you sign a bill into law but also issue a signing statement reserving a constitutional right to bypass the law ?
Signing statements have been used by presidents of both parties , dating back to Andrew Jackson .
While it is legitimate for a president to issue a signing statement to clarify his understanding of ambiguous provisions of statutes and to explain his view of how he intends to faithfully execute the law , it is a clear abuse of power to use such statements as a license to evade laws that the president does not like or as an end - run around provisions designed to foster accountability .
OTOH , if you call it " serialized data " , it sounds less scary , and most people will realize they do this often .
( YAML , Data : : Dumper , etc , are all examples of creators of compound aka serialized data ) .
None of your examples have me get worried and regard compound data as something evil .
Your article just says " Yup , compound data has its uses .
At other times , it 's not the right thing . "
But that 's true for almost anything .
Sorry , but this smacks of : I just got bitten by something , so now I 'm gonna demonise it .
Are hashes evil ?
They consists of keys and values .
Floats ?
Exponent and characteristic .
Integers ?
Magnitude and sign .
Bytes ?
Many bits .
Strings ? ... Objects ? ... I ca n't use my new vacuum cleaner in it 's box , but I 'm glad it came in one .

Howdy !
Those are all red herrings .
Hashes are not scalar data ; they are a collection of values indexed by key .
Hashes using the old sub - key thingy that predated references would be an example , but not because they are hashes .
The scalar data types are usefully atomic .
If you need to work with the sub -parts of the underlying representation , you get to disassemble them yourself .
Strings , per se , are only compound insofar as you define the values to be so and need to work with individual parts .
Objects , more or less by definition , * can * have numerous attributes , but the parts are explicit and individually addressable ( for most sane implementations ) .
I see the point ; it needs to be applied judiciously .
yours ,
Michael
The string scalar DSN data type is usefully atomic .
If you need to work with the sub -parts of the underlying representation , you get to disassemble them yourself .
Seeing as you can swap in DSN for a scalar data type , what you said of scalar data types applies to DSNs as well .
By your logic , the problem is n't the compoundness of DSNs , it 's the lack or perceived lack of tools to manipulate DSNs .
Sorry , but this smacks of : I just got bitten by something , so now I 'm gonna demonise it Yes , it 's called evolution .
Intelligence is the ability to identify , formulate and resolve problems .
So this post was made to identify and formulate a problem in hopes that it is not repeated .
And yes , I did get bitten by the DBI API and now I have to go redo something so it works with Rose .
Continuing ,
Let me present the definition of compound data to you once again : A compound datum is an apparently atomic data item that it really not atomic .
Are hashes evil ?
They consists of keys and values .
evil ?
You brought demons in the picture , not me .
The point at hand is " apparently atomic " .
they are not apparently atomic .
you dissected hashes into their parts yourself .
Now , if instead of this hash : %a = ( a => 1 , b => 2 ) ; [ download ]
You did this : my $ vals = " a: 1 , b:2 " then you would have an apparently atomic data item that it really not atomic , because you would have to do string - twiddling to extract relevant subparts .
Floats ?
Exponent and characteristic .
Seems atomic to me .
And the subparts you mention , can they be easily accessed / used ?
Integers ?
Magnitude and sign .
or 32 bits ( grin ) .
my $ int = Integer -> new ( magnitude => 12 , sign => '+' ) ; [ download ] ah , perfect decomposition !
My post did not say it listed all examples of compound data .
And if there are more , then fine .
Besides , the focus was on software and system design , not language elements .
Bytes ?
Many bits .
Again , complex data is not ' compound data ' .
Compound is a specific term referring to a specific mistake in software and system design .
Strings ?
Yes , they are complex , but only compound when mis-used .
Objects ? ...
Yes , an object is atomic , not apparently atomic .
It may have subparts , but each has a well - defined means of accessing / changing it .
I can't use my new vacuum cleaner in it 's box , but I 'm glad it came in one .
You are confusing a complex of objects with compound data .
The vacuum cleaner 's relation to the box was meaningful and useful .
Packing multiple datums into a string is counter - productive to flexible software and system design as was demonstrated .
The mantra of every experienced web application developer is the same : thou shalt separate business logic from display .
Ironically , almost all template engines allow violation of this separation principle , which is the very impetus for HTML template engine development .
-- Terence Parr , " Enforcing Strict Model View Separation in Template Engines "
You are confusing a complex of objects with compound data .
No I 'm not .
You are making an artificial separation where none exists .
Take urls .
These are both complex and compound .
And simple .
Whilst there are ( many ) modules like URI * that allow you to treat these as objects and access all their internal bits separately , the vast majority of modules that use urls as inputs ( eg.LWP * ) , take them in their simple string form .
Why ?
Because they do not care what is inside , and do not want to have to deal with it .
For most applications of those latter modules , the user will be supplying a ' simple string ' , picked out of a text file ( log file ; html ; whatever ) , and all they need or want to know is , can I reach it ?
If they had to tease apart the myriad forms of url / uri/urn formats in order to populate a ur* object in order to pass it to LWP *-- that would promptly just stick all the bits back together again -- it would be an entirely unnecessary waste of time & resources .
Complexity without merit or benefit .
Same goes for file systems entities .
We pass open a string , not some kind of FileSystem : : Object .
Because for the most part , they are simply an opaque scalar entity we use .
Not pick apart and fret over .
And the same goes for your example of DBI data source names .
At the DBI level , and below , they are simply opaque entities to be gathered and passed through uninspected .
Requiring some kind of object be used for them would create unnecessary and useless complexity .
They do not even have a consistent constitution .
Your example breaks them down as dbi dbi mysql database host port [ download ]
And then as __PACKAGE__->register_db ( driver => ' pg ' , database => ' my_db ' , host => ' localhost ' , usern + ame => ' joeuser ' , password => ' mysecret ' , ) ; [ download ] but you 've lost two parts ( dbi / port ) and gained two parts ( user / pass ) .
And then you get something like DBD :: WMI , which does n't need and cannot use most of those -- either set of 5 .
And DBD ::SQLite that also has no use for most of those fields .
And these came into being long after the DBI / DBD interfaces were designed and implemented .
Rather than something to be " avoided " , DBI 's use of a string for the data source name is the sign of a well - though through , flexible interface .
One that recognises that you cannot fit the world into labelled boxes , and that in many situations , there is no purpose in trying .
You should be celebrating the vision and skill of those authors for designing an interface so flexible it can accommodate future developments without requiring constant re-writes as time passes and uses evolve .
Not decrying them .
Consider :
Will your interfaces survive so long , so well ?

You did this : my $ vals = " a: 1 , b:2 " then you would have an apparently atomic data item that it really not atomic , because you would have to do string - twiddling to extract relevant subparts .
I do n't see why searching through an associative array stored as " a: 1 , b:2 " makes the type not atomic when the example you used for an atomic type ( {a= > 1 , b= > 2} ) is an associative array that requires searching through a list of buckets then through a linked list .
It 's the same thing with compound data and database normalization .
What 's atomic / normalized in one situation is compound / denormalized in another .
Even if the data look exactly the same .
And you can't tell without context .
Sure , you should stop and think about the level of atomicity at which to store some data , but there is no hard rule .

Enoch was right !
Enjoy the last years of Rome .
Very good topic !
In the database world , everyone knows that one should not store " compound data " in a single column - at least , everyone is supposed to know .
But people do n't often talk about the same thing ( at least not as explicit or as often ) outside of the database world .
Good reminder !

So , what happens if you 've been using DBI and you have all your connect data in configuration files with DSN strings and then you decide you want to start using Rose :: DB : : Object ?
You have to find some way of getting the chocolate back from chocolate milk --- you have to break down the compound data in the dsn in order to get out the sub-elements .
First of all , it 's not the fault of DBI that you decided to store DSN strings in your configuration file .
If you had stored it as ( for instance ) : driver = mysql host = localhost username = joe password = s3c41 + port = 3306 [ download ] it would trivial to construct a dsn , and to parameter list for Rose : : Db:: Object .
You could also share the configuration file with applications written in a different language .
Second , if you 're switching your API from DBI to Rose :: Db:: Object , I 'd think you 'll have a change a lot of your code anyway .
Parsing out a dsn string should n't be that much more work .
I have to agree that this is really not as tragic as you make it out to be .
There are severe tradeoffs between the use of intermediate objects designed for inter- package compatibility ( DBI , and Rose : : DB : : Object ) , and the use of simple serialized strings .
I think the example of ' open ' is particularly instructive as a counterargument to your critique .
Try opening a file in Java .
You first have to create a Buffer object around a Reader object which wraps a File object .
You will write this code millions of times in your lifetime , and you will always wonder why , especially if you use languages like perl , ruby , or python which allow you to just open a string path .
Getting the different parts of the DBI connect string is not nearly as energetically expensive as getting the chocolate back out of chocolate milk .
Nor is it too much work for people who use both DBI and Rose : : DB : : Object to store their connect strings as serialized YAML , JSON , etc. to be used by code to construct the arguments suitable for the context that they are to be used in .
Now , if it is the case that there are more than 10 people out there that wish there was a compatibility layer on DBI that allowed it to take the same arguments as Rose : : DB : : Object ( and there may very well be , so speak up if you are reading this ) , they should decide which of them wants to get involved with the DBI codebase to provide this functionality .
It would probably not be that hard to override DBI connect to take the same connect params as Rose : : DB : : Object , nor would it be hard to create a separate CPAN module that can take a central hash argument ( such as might be retrieved from a YAML , JSON , etc. serialized configuration file ) , and provide methods to construct dbi_connect_string , or rose_db_object_connect_params , etc .
A long while ago , I pledged Magnatune to pay 10 % of its sales due to Rhythmbox ( a fantastic music player for Linux ) , back to the GNOME Foundation .
Today , I wrote the check .
Rhythmbox has really excellent integration with Magnatune ( for four years now ! ) , which makes for a wonderful marriage between open source and open music .
The latest versions support Magnatune memberships , for all - you - can - eat music support on Linux .
Read more about it here .
Let me break down the numbers :
Sales from Rhythmbox overall :
$ 7159 total sales
905 album sales
of which :
Ubuntu changed the ref= on RB sales coming from their distro , so they get credit ( and paid ) for their sales .
Ubuntu's RB was responsible for :
$ 1017 in total sales
131 album sales
( fyi , that means an average " pay what you want " of $ 7.76 per album )
So that leaves for RB / GNOME :
$ 6142 in total sales
774 total sales
( fyi , that means an average " pay what you want " of $ 7.93 per album )
Also FYI this means that RB has raised $ 3579.50 for independent musicians ( because we pay out 50 % of what comes in to musicians , and the 10 % RB payout is coming out of Magnatune 's half )
What this means is that I 've now sent a check for $ 614.20 to GNOME Foundation .
Many , many thanks for Adam Zimmerman for writing and maintaining the excellent Magnatune features in Rhythmbox .

Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) is leaving Congress not because of the health care fight but because of the exertion that would be required to hold onto his district , friends said .
Stupak wo n't seek reelection
Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) , who played a central role in the health reform fight as the leader of anti-abortion Democrats , announced Friday afternoon that he will not run for reelection , saying he wanted to spend more time with his family .
Without Stupak on the ballot , the seat becomes an immediate pickup opportunity for Republicans .
At a press conference in his home district this afternoon , Stupak attributed the exertion of traveling back and forth from Washington to his sprawling Upper Peninsula district as a primary reason for his retirement but also said that he had completed much of what he aimed to do in Congress .
Advertisement
“ I ’ve accomplished what I want to do .
Either I run again and I ’d be there forever or it ’s time for me to make the break ; it ’s time for me to move on , ” Stupak said .
But Republicans immediately attributed Stupak 's decision to step down as a direct consequence of his health care vote .
“ After selling his soul to Nancy Pelosi , it appears that Bart Stupak finally found the courage to tell her no , " said Ken Spain , communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee .
" The political fallout over the Democrats ’ government takeover of health care has put the political careers of many Democrats in jeopardy , thanks in part to Stupak ’s decision to abandon his alleged pro-life principles . "
Republicans believe that other anti-abortion Democrats , like freshman Reps .
Steve Driehaus ( D - Ohio ) and Kathleen Dahlkemper ( D - Pa. ) , will also face serious trouble because of their support for the health care legislation without strict anti-abortion provisions .
Stupak plans to continue to live in the district , the Democratic official said .
He said that he will continue to serve the people of the 1st District , just not as their congressman .
A Stupak friend told POLITICO that the congressman made the final decision during a conversation with his family while in Indianapolis to root for Michigan State in its Final Four basketball game .
Attempting to change his mind , President Barack Obama called Stupak on Wednesday and asked him not to retire .
Stupak , 58 , also resisted entreaties from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. John Dingell ( D - Mich . ) , the dean of the Wolverine State delegation .
The Upper Peninsula seat gave President Obama just 50 percent of the vote and supported former President George W. Bush in 2004 with 53 percent .
But Stupak had never faced difficulty winning reelection , always prevailing with at least 57 percent of the vote , since he was first elected in 1992 .
This year was shaping up to be a different story , with Stupak becoming a leading target on both his left and right flanks .
Abortion rights supporters were rallying behind former Charlevoix County Commissioner Connie Saltonstall after Stupak insisted on ant - abortion language being inserted in the health care legislation .
The Tea Party Express caravan stopped in Stupak 's Upper Peninsula district last night to protest his health care vote as part of a concerted attempt to oust the incumbent .
The group had named Stupak as one of its leading targets .
The friend said he believes Stupak would have won , adding : " More than 95 percent of the opposition from left and right has come from outside of his district . "
And Republicans have rallied around surgeon Dan Benishek , a tea party favorite , who received very little attention until Stupak voted for the health care legislation even without the anti-abortion language in the bill .
Benishek is expected to raise more than $ 100,000 this quarter , according to GOP sources , a large amount for a first - time candidate who had virtually no campaign infrastructure before Stupak received national attention over his health care positioning .
Saltonstall , who had been challenging Stupak in the primary , is the only Democrat left in the race .
But Democrats expect other candidates in tune with the culturally conservative sentiment of the Upper Peninsula district to emerge , including Mike Prusi and Gary McDowell and state Reps.
Joel Sheltrown and Jeff Mayes .
Stupak said he was confident that Democrats would hold the seat , taking a shot at the Republican candidates who had been looking to unseat him .
“ We have good Democrats who are term - limited [ in the Legislature ] and they can hold this seat .
I ’m excited about the Democratic prospects ; I ’m sure they will do well .
I do n’t think this is automatically a Republican seat , ” Stupak said .
“ I ’ve seen the Republican field and , obviously , I ’m not impressed .
In my estimation , it ’s the weakest field in some time . ”

Final Fantasy XIII has perhaps one of the worst introductions a Japanese RPG has ever had .
Square Enix thought it would be a good idea to not tell the player what is happening , and as a result , the first ten hours of the game feels like a conversation that the player has stumbled in on halfway through .
All the characters know what 's going on , and talk as if the player should know , leading to a very alienating narrative that ensures the player never truly connects with it .
When you finally do work out who is who and what 's going on , however , you 'll wish the game had stayed so vague .
Story is crucial to any RPG , and let me tell you right off the bat that Final Fantasy XIII has perhaps the worst story of any main Final Fantasy game to date .
Aside from being poorly delivered and only vaguely comprehensible , the characters have no personality or depth , the world is not immersive in the least , and the main villain 's methods and motivations are so illogical and convoluted that it 's impossible to take him seriously .
Even by Final Fantasy standards , the story is absolutely absurd .
Let that sink in for a moment .
The game is absurd by Final Fantasy standards !
The story is terrible , but the dialog is worse .
An average conversation in Final Fantasy XIII goes like this : " Pulse , Cocoon , L'sie , Fal'sie , Focus , Focus , Focus . "
Over and over again , the same stupid words .
If you can get to the end of this 30 + hour saga and not be sick of those words , you 're a strong man indeed .
I wanted to vomit after just an hour of it .
That 's not helped by Vannile , whose Australian warblings and high - pitched wailing manages to make an already ludicrous story sound even worse .
The worst crime committed by Final Fantasy XIII 's narrative , however , is the total lack of impetus provided to care .
There 's no depth to anything or anyone , and as a result , the player has no reason to be involved .
Why should the player care about saving Cocoon , when Cocoon is n't fleshed out in any way ?
With only the occasional glimpse at Cocoon 's society and culture , we have no motivation for saving it .
The characters talk about saving their world as if it 's important , but to the player , Cocoon 's just a series of random locations awkwardly mashed together .
Their hatred of various characters , and their empathy toward others , mean nothing to the player .
Villains and allies are introduced and then forgotten by the in the space of a few minutes .
Characters go on huge emotional spiels that mean nothing because the game does n't want to waste time making that emotion mean anything , and huge amounts of dramatic FMV are wasted because Square Enix did n't pace the game properly and build to the game 's many climactic moments properly .
The game has plenty of promising ideas .
The central theme of inescapable destiny , interspersed with hints of racial prejudice and propaganda , could have been something excellent .
However , not enough time is devoted to the exploration of these themes .
Instead , most of the game is given over to having the characters whine about how hopeless their situation is every thirty minutes .
That 's when the game is n't introducing epic FMV cutscenes that contain no narrative value whatsoever , just because Square Enix 's art department felt like publicly masturbating .
The game constantly gives off a sense that it 's having way more fun with itself than the player , and that theme is continued in the brand new battle system .
Battles ostensibly play themselves for you , mostly because Square Enix 's new Paradigm System is so contrived and complicated that the player would be confused if he had to control it himself .
Instead of manually inputting commands for all your characters , everybody -- including the player 's character -- can automatically fight of their own free will .
The player 's job is that of a mid-management office boss , occasionally green - lighting the game 's decisions and letting it get on with it .
To its credit , the battle system does a few things right .
The Paradigm System allows characters to change classes mid-battle , and each class works with the other one to create a variety of battle strategies .
For instance , you can have a melee - focused Commando work with a magic - wielding Ravager , backed up by a healing Medic in order to provide a mixed offense and defense .
You can use Saboteurs to weaken the enemy with surprisingly effective status ailments while drawing enemy fire with a defensive Sentinel .
There is some fun to be had in discovering which classes work best against which enemies , and keeping a variety of Paradigms to hand to deal with each threat .
The game also throws in a " Stagger " system to keep the pressure up .
The more players attack an enemy , the more their " Stagger " meter goes up .
When the meter is full , the enemy becomes considerably weaker and their attacks can be halted almost entirely .
This can be a very satisfying system indeed , although it eventually causes even the most random battles to last longer than they should , since staggering an enemy is usually the only way to deal any noteworthy damage to its HP .
Sometimes , the battle system can be entertaining , and a few of the boss fights in particular feel stunning in their scope and length .
However , the new system also relies too heavily on trial - and - error , and players can expect to die a few times before nailing how certain enemies work .
This is especially true of the Eidolon battles , that rank easily among some of the worst RPG boss fights in history .
Players have a time limit in which to learn and then perform the various actions each Eidolon wants you to do .
The first time you fight each Eidolon , you 'll essentially be going through a practice run as you learn how to fight it before dying an irritating death .
Square Enix even knows that its battle system is trial and error , since it gives you the option to retry fights at any point during combat , or after death .
Mostly though , the battles become tedious as the game sets about playing itself and concentrating more on looking impressive rather than feeling fun to play .
Once you know when and where to switch Paradigms , your fingers start working on autopilot .
Some of the later bosses , in fact , can take so long to beat that you 'll be doing the same thing over and over again for upwards of twenty minutes , wondering why the game should even require your presence ( the Proudclad boss stands as paramount proof of this ) .
The only truly interactive and intriguing part of the battle is Eidolon summoning , but would n't you know , they 're all pretty much useless .
Despite being able to perform a variety of visually stunning attacks , Eidolons do barely any damage to the enemy , and the Stagger meter empties as soon as they disappear , meaning they can come and go without contributing anything to the battle .
Their only use is as a way to revive and heal the party , but it 's a needlessly lengthy and pointless way to do it .
Not to mention the fact that summoning costs Tech Points , and Tech Points are also spent on studying enemies to learn their weaknesses .
Since that 's considerably more important than wasting your time with Odin , there will barely even be any opportunity to summon .
And the game forces you through six horrendous boss encounters for the privilege of obtaining these worthless wastes of time .
Despite the fact that the game is playing itself , the player is still forced to pay attention the whole time .
It 'll be your job to make sure the party 's HP stays up , and with enemies always busting out hugely devastating attacks , it 's a full - time job .
Also , if the main player character dies , it 's game over .
Naturally , this leads to all sorts of fun once enemies bring one - hit kills to the table , or arrive in groups of six with a Haste spell and more attacks than you can deal with .
Players can gain an advantage by sneaking up on enemies before a battle , but good luck with that .
Most enemies have eyes in the back of their head and will see you coming long before you can initiate a battle .
Some will even simply ignore the fact you snuck up on them and the preemptive strike wo n't be awarded , even though you started the fight without alerting anybody .
Player choice is stripped to a bare minimum as well .
Most of the time , players can't even choose their own battle party until the end of the game , and are constantly having to re-organize their Paradigms after the game decided to wipe all the customization from the slate .
Shops in the game are useless .
There are no distractions from the main quest ( and boy were distractions needed ) until thirty hours into the game , and by that point it 's a case of too little , too late .
The only really deep area in which the player has any input is the weapon upgrade system , where raw materials can be used to level up weapons .
Even then , however , it takes far too long to gather enough material and most players likely wo n't want to bother with it .
If one positive thing can be said for Final Fantasy XIII , it 's that it looks gorgeous .
Locations and characters alike are amazingly beautiful , and some hugely stunning vistas treat the eyes throughout the course of the adventure .
Despite some rather intricate clothing on a number of characters , the total lack of clipping is amazingly impressive .
Lightning 's swaying cloak never once goes through her body , as cloaks in games most often do .
Little details , like her sword holster bouncing off her legs while she runs , also add to the visual treat .
The music , unfortunately , is not as good .
Everything sounds " nice " but nothing sounds memorable .
FF XIII falls into the trap so many modern games do , focusing on sweeping orchestral music that provides an atmosphere , but no tune at all .
For a series made famous by its classic melodies , it 's sad that not even the music in XIII can provide some entertainment .
While most people could remember every track from every previous Final Fantasy game , one will be hard pressed to recall a single one from XIII after a week .
Even the famous Chocobo theme , brief though its appearance is , has been ruined with some ill - advised and embarrassing vocals .
But it 's clear that the music , just like the story and the gameplay , took a back seat to the graphics .
Final Fantasy XIII is visuals , visuals , visuals , with nothing of substance to back up the pretty colors .
So many cutscenes are thrown in just to show off the landscapes , and FMVs are regularly thrown in just to be a glorified tech demo for the White Engine .
XIII looks stunning , that much is true , but that 's all it is .
A looker .
XIII is vapid , shallow , and intensely self - satisfied .
All it cares about is displaying its peacock feathers and trying to distract us from the ludicrous plot with bright colors and audacious effects .
Even the battle system is clearly putting graphics first , putting fast - paced visual acrobatics before substantial gameplay .
It takes more than graphics to make a game , and Final Fantasy XIII offers very little else other than eye candy .
Ultimately , this latest addition to the Final Fantasy series is a pompous and masturbatory affair , created seemingly to promote the developer 's ego first , and the player 's enjoyment second .
Every now and then its fights can approach satisfying , but mostly this is a dull , dreary affair that is too busy licking its own arse to look up and notice that everybody around it has fallen asleep .
Written with all the skill of a three - year - old and paced with the eagerness of a virgin in heat , Final Fantasy XIII is n't just bad by Final Fantasy standards , it 's pretty damn poor for the genre itself .
It 's the worst main chapter in the Final Fantasy series to date , and if this is the future of the franchise , that future is incredibly bleak indeed .
Score : 4.0 -- Below Average ( 4s have some high points , but they soon give way to glaring faults .
Not the worst games , but are difficult to recommend . )

The grey whale that washed up on the beach at East Sooke Park on Easter weekend is among five that have perished in area waters over the last two weeks , and all seem to have died from starvation .
This spate of grey whale deaths is not unusual , say marine biologists .
In 1999 , more than 100 grey whales died on the West Coast and in 2000 , 12 died along the B.C. coast .
article continues below
" This is nature -- we get these cycles , " said Paul Cottrell , acting marine mammal co-ordinator for Fisheries and Oceans Canada .
" We have to keep our eye on it .
If this year is like 1999 , we 're going to have lots of grey whales die . "
The reason emaciated grey whales turn up here and die has to do with the remarkable three - month migrations the mammals make each year , starting in October , between their feeding grounds in the Bering Sea and mating areas in southern California and Mexico .
It 's one of the longest migrations by mammals on the planet .
The whales do n't head north again until sometime between February and May , with mothers and calves sticking around the longest .
They do almost all their feeding in the far north , said Lance Barrett - Lennard , head of the cetacean research program at the Vancouver Aquarium .
" They 're thought not to eat at all on the southbound migration and they may snack a little bit on the northbound migration , " said Barrett - Lennard .
" It 's even worse for females -- they have to swim all the way from the Arctic to warmer areas , produce a calf and swim back with the calf .
They 're lactating all the way and the calf is growing like fury .
" The calf is twice as big when it gets to the Arctic .
The poor female is dumping out all this fat - rich milk into the calf and trying to make this incredible migration . "
The deaths of grey whales stem from poor food supplies in the Bering Sea last year , said Barrett - Lennard .
" If they have a poor feeding year , they usually have enough fuel to get all the way south .
Where they tend to run out is on the way north again -- they 're running on fumes . "
Almost all of the 20,000 grey whales in the eastern Pacific make the round trip each year .
Between 100 and 200 choose to stop in B.C. waters and do their feeding there , said Howard Garrett of Orca Network .
" They know where to go and they find the food and do very well , " said Garrett yesterday .
The grey whales who do n't know the area come in because they 're desperate for food , Garrett said .
Grey whales feed in shallow waters by scooping up mud and using their baleens as a filter .
" They turn into the Strait of Juan de Fuca and meander everywhere , " Garrett said .
" They show up in the most remote , dead - end locations in the labyrinth of inlets , way down in Puget Sound and all over the place .
Often they die . "
On Easter weekend , a grey whale washed ashore at East Sooke Park .
Another landed in Oakland Bay in the southern reaches of Puget Sound .
Last Saturday , a grey whale beached at Samish Bay near Anacortes .
The next day , another dead whale turned up north of Whidbey Island in Deception Pass .
Then on Wednesday , a grey whale died near west Seattle .
Several of the dead whales have dried blubber , which indicates they 've been drawing on their own fat supplies for energy , said Garrett .
One whale had a large quantity of sawdust in its stomach .
" It had been attempting to find food in a mud flat that was near an old sawmill , " Garrett said .
The grey whales get thinner and lose insulation , so they have to use more energy just to stay warm , said Barrett - Lennard .
" It 's a double whammy . "

For a micro-ISV , selling to businesses can be more lucrative than selling to consumers .
Instead of making a few dollars per sale and hoping for thousands of sales , you sell to only a few customers , and charge much higher rates .
But the rates are high for a reason .
It takes more time and money to sell to businesses .
Legal Issues
Consumers rarely read software license agreements .
Most corporate customers do n't read them either , but some have legal departments that must approve any agreement that the company makes , no matter how small .
Your EULA will be examined with the same fervor as a billion dollar acquisition .
The license agreement 's primary purpose , then , is to get past the customer 's legal team quickly , because they stand between you and a sale .
It helps if it is fair and well balanced at the start .
That way , if they add crazy one - sided terms , you can negotiate without sounding unreasonable .
Some terms that you may be asked for :
" If you go out of business , we get all of your source code . "
The request is common .
The customer sees it as an insurance policy in case a smaller supplier disappears , and the assurance it provides may be so important that they are unwilling to drop it .
Source code escrow services will hold on to your source code for a fee ( hint : get the buyer to pay ) .
Opt for a more informal arrangement if they do n't specifically ask for this service .

" If someone sues us over your product , you have to pay our legal costs . "
Indemnification is also a standard clause that is difficult to get removed .
If you can't stomache any risk of personal bankruptcy , incorporating your micro-ISV is a must .

Support details .
Are you going to be providing free technical support for this product in perpetuity ?
I hope not .
Are you going to be providing free technical support for this product in perpetuity ?
I hope not .
" What happens if the product is defective ? "
It 's only fair to offer a full refund if the customer is not satisfied .
A good software license agreement that you can re-use in a variety of situations can cost anywhere from $ 1000 to $ 5000 .
It pays to shop around .
The procurement process
Quotations
A quotation looks just like an invoice , except that it has an expiry date .
Sixty days ought to be long enough for the client to make a decision , even if the whole department goes on consecutive vacations .
Evaluation Version
Purchase orders
The purchasing process can take a long time , so you might be asked to provide an evaluation version while the details of the sale are worked out .
It 's a great idea , because after the buyer incorporates your product into their processes , they are n't going walk away from the deal easily .
However , it is unclear whether the customer acknowledges any of your license terms during the evaluation period .
The product should have a time limited expiry and other technical measures to ensure compliance .
You and your buyer have patiently waited for five months for the company 's legal team review your license .
Now , the signed copies have been faxed ( yes , faxed ! ) back and forth .
At last , they 'll click on that Paypal button on your order page ...
Think again .
Once a large business has agreed to buy your product , you are expected to send it to them for free .
They do not have to pay you a dime until they feel like it .
Instead , they will send a purchase order .
The good news is that purchase orders are a legally binding promise to pay you , after all of the terms have been fulfilled .
Here is a diagram to illustrate the procedure :
Click to Edit on WebSequenceDiagrams.com
If you are lucky , they will use PDF files for the purchase order and invoice .
But you will probably have to send and receive some more faxes .
" Please read this 100 page document about our invoicing process .. "
Sometimes , after everything is agreed , you 'll be asked to perform some kind of insanely complex invoicing procedure .
The instructions are laced with stern , upper case warnings that if the invoice does n't follow the proper format , lacks item category labels ( found in document B ) , or is submitted during the wrong hours , it will be ignored .
If you have priced your product appropriately it will be worth it to spend a few hours to learn their codes and procedures .
If the price is too low , you can try your luck and ( politely ) ask if there are any other options .
( Do not mention why ! )
I have successfully gotten a couple of companies to use a reseller instead of dealing with me directly , but it is only because they had an existing relationship with the reseller .
See below .
" We will release the funds after you provide your US social security number .. "
" We only pay using Bankers ' Scrolls made from papyrus "
US customers will sometimes ask for a Taxpayer Identification Number ( TIN ) .
If you are not a US taxpayer , you do n't need one .
Once you point this out , they may be okay with it , or they will ask you to fill out a US form W - 8BEN and send it to them .
The form is scary because it states that your " income " will be subject to a 40 % withholding tax .
Do n't worry : the purchase price is not " an amount subject to withholding " , and sellers do not need to start doing US taxes ( if they are n't already ) .
Some US businesses feel that they must keep this form on file for all suppliers , and it 's easier to comply than argue .
Here 's some more information
Many companies have a policy against using Paypal .
It 's best to use an old fashioned check if you can .
You can suggest , but never insist on a method of payment .
Money is money !
Some international customers only use bank transfers .
If so , call your bank for the information that you need to provide them , and expect about $ 30 of the payment to go to fees .
I absolutely love cheques .
I walk into the bank and pay $ 0.60 to deposit a $ 5000 cheque , whereas Stripe or Paypal would have cost me $ 125 for the same .
More and more , though , US companies are using electronic transfers .
RBC randomly charges me $ 15 for these , but not all the time .
Resellers
Imagine you are asked to buy some software from , say Adobe .
You go to their web site , try to find the link to buy , figure out how to pay , get to the checkout page , then stop and search Google for " adobe coupon codes " , go back to step 1 keep refreshing your email for the link , download the software .
Keep of record of the receipt somewhere .
Now imagine you have to do this for 1000 different items , at 1000 different web sites .
It gets to be a very large job .
Some companies have outsourced their procurement and license management to resellers .
A reseller is simply an intermediary who pays you and provides the software to their client .
It 's also their job to ask for a discount , but there is no need to provide one .
They have been told to acquire your product , and have already been paid a fee as a percentage of your price .
As a consequence , the reseller will be very quick to renew your software and pay the maintenance fee each year .
This often occurs even if the original buyer is no longer at the company .
You do n't need to be listed in the reseller 's catalogue , and you do n't need to have a relationship with the reseller .
Just be prepared for emails asking , " Do you work with resellers ? " and respond yes , because they have a client who definitely wants buy your software .
Follow instructions , invoice quickly , and you will learn to love resellers .
The only annoying thing is on mornings when you get six of them asking for quotes on the same product , and you know a big company is just trying to shop around , causing more work for you .
Keep smiling
Selling to big companies can be frustrating .
Throughout the process , it is important to stay professional and pleasant .
Sometimes , it may appear that your customer is trying to screw you .
Even if they are , is your job to be jovial , point it out , and assume that it is a simple oversight .
It makes no business sense to throw money away because of a rude email .

Things I Love About Bundler
So I ’ve been working with working with Rails 3 and bundler full time for a month and a half now and it ’s going swimmingly .
Here are some things that bundler does that I think are awesome .
Gems from git repositories
We use custom forks of arel and savon in our project .
Before bundler , managing this would have been a mix of submodules / braid / piston and custom gem files that could easily become a mess .
With bundler we just throw this in our Gemfile and we ’re done .
gem ' savon ' , : git => ' git://github.com/hoopla/savon.git' gem ' arel ' , : git => 'git@github.com :hoopla/arel.git '
Gems from the local file system
Much like loading from git , bundler also handles loading gems from a local path .
This is great if you want to try out some ideas on a gem , but you ’re not yet sure if gem is worth forking .
gem ' mygem ' , : path => '/ path/to/my/gem '
What ’s especially awesome is that bundler wires things up so that source modifications get picked up without any sort of repackaging or reinstalling .
This beats the pants off of the change source > repackage gem > reinstall gem > test cycle that was so easy to fall into before bundler .
It actually works
I do n’t know about you , but I do n’t think I ’ve ever had a real Rails 2 project on which rake gems : install really worked .
There were always a couple of gems ( rspec ) that you needed to install separately .
bundle install on the other hand works pretty much every time .
Now of course it ’s not all rainbows and unicorns .
Bundler seems to take up some extra startup time beyond what I was used to on Rails 2 .
And I often wish there were a way to make it check git repositories for updates a little less aggressively .
But for 0.9.22 , I ’m impressed .
Hats off to carlhuda , indirect and any others that appear beyond page 3 of the commit log for all their hard work on it .

Mr. Fitzpatrick said Mr. Grassley ’s scrutiny , which he described as understandable given the attention paid to potential conflicts of interest in medicine , had led his organization to begin posting on its
Web site the names of companies that donate $ 5,000 or more .
And he predicted that other patient and disease advocacy groups would be prodded by Mr. Grassley ’s investigation to do the same .
“ Everyone I talk to wants to have more balanced fund - raising , ” Mr. Fitzpatrick said .
In a statement , Mr. Grassley praised the alliance for its disclosures .
“ It ’d be good for the system for other patient groups to do what NAMI has done , ” he said .
Mr. Grassley ’s scrutiny has been unnerving for patient and disease advocacy groups , which are often filled with sincere people who are either afflicted with serious illnesses themselves or have family members who have been affected .
Many join the groups in the hope of making sense of their misfortune by helping to find a cure or raising awareness of a disease ’s risks and frequency .
Drug makers are natural allies in these pursuits since cures may come out of corporate laboratories and the industry ’s money can help finance public service campaigns and fund - raising dinners .
But industry critics have long derided some patient organizations as little more than front groups devoted to lobbying on issues that affect industry profits , and few have come under more scrutiny for industry ties than the mental health alliance .
For years , the alliance has fought states ’ legislative efforts to limit doctors ’ freedom to prescribe drugs , no matter how expensive , to treat mental illness in patients who rely on government health care programs like Medicaid .
Some of these medicines routinely top the list of the most expensive drugs that states buy for their poorest patients .
Mr. Fitzpatrick defended these lobbying efforts , saying they were just one of many the organization routinely undertook .
The close ties between the alliance and drug makers were on stark display last week , when the organization held its annual gala at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium on Constitution Avenue in Washington .
Tickets were $ 300 each .
Before a dinner of roasted red bell pepper soup , beef tenderloin and tilapia , Dr. Stephen H. Feinstein , president of the alliance ’s board , thanked Bristol - Myers Squibb , the pharmaceutical company .

A Winnipeg man has admitted to participating in a " staged " armed robbery inside a Lockport fast - food restaurant while wearing a skeleton mask and matching costume .
Drew Kowal , 23 , was given three months in jail Monday in addition to six months of time already served .
He was also put on supervised probation for three years .
Kowal and a co-accused stormed inside the A&W location just north of Winnipeg in October 2006 and stole several thousand dollars , court was told .
Kowal later told police that a large group of friends – including two women who were working at the time of the heist – had planned the incident out ahead of time .
However , police only ended up charging Kowal and his primary partner - in - crime - who pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced to a year in jail .
The two employees claim they were truly victimized and did n’t know about any robbery plan .
Kowal was released on bail but got re-arrested last October after selling an undercover police officer three rocks of crack cocaine in exchange for $ 60 .
Police say he was working as a street - level " dial - a - dealer " in the inner-city .
Defence lawyer Les Kee told court Monday his client resorted to dealing drugs to help support himself financially after losing his job following his robbery arrest .
" He did n’t even have any food for himself – or his cat , " said Kee .

If you think the Internet came out of Silicon Valley , that NASA planned the first satellite to orbit Earth , or that IBM created the modern computer — think again .
Each one of these breakthroughs was conceived at RAND , a shadowy think tank in Santa Monica , California .
The Intimidation Factor
Rand rose out of the ashes of World War II .
After witnessing the success of the Manhattan Project — the $ 2 billion initiative that created the first atomic bomb — a five - star Air Force general named Henry " Hap "  Arnold ( pictured ) concluded that America needed a team of great minds to keep the country 's technology ahead of the rest of the world .
In 1946 , he gathered together a small group of scientists and $ 10 million in funding and started RAND ( which stands for Research and Development ) .
He even convinced a family friend , aircraft magnate Donald Douglas , to house the project at his factory in Santa Monica .
After a few short months , RAND got the attention of academics , politicians , and military strategists alike by issuing a prophetic study called " Preliminary Design of an Experimental World - Circling Spaceship . " 
At the time , rocket science was still in its infancy , so RAND 's call for an orbiting space station was revolutionary .
Not only did the think tank specify the kind of fuel the spaceship would need and how quickly it could be built , but it also outlined how the station could predict the weather , transform long - distance communication , and , most importantly , intimidate our rivals abroad .
If America could put a satellite into space , what else was she capable of ?
Although President Truman passed on the space station , the military fell in love with RAND .
Through Hap 's connections , the Air Force quickly became the think tank 's main contractor , and RAND began consulting on everything from propeller turbines to missile defense .
Before long , the organization was so flush with contracts that it had to hire hundreds of additional researchers to keep up .
In recruitment ads , RAND bragged about its intellectual genealogy , tracing a direct line from its president , Frank Collbohm , to Isaac Newton .
Whether or not that claim was true , the institute secured a reputation as the place to dream up new ways to wage wars and keep enemies at bay .
By the 1960s , America 's rivals were paying attention .
The Soviet newspaper Pravda nicknamed RAND " the academy of science and death and destruction . " 
American outfits preferred to call them the " wizards of Armageddon . " 
War Games
The Soviets had good reason to worry about RAND .
In 1957 , the Air Force hired the think tank to create spy satellites .
Within two years , it developed CORONA — a covert system that aimed to send camera - carrying satellites into orbit on the backs of missiles .
While the idea was genius , the design was flawed .
It took 13 failed attempts before the system finally got off the ground in 1959 .
Once it did , however , the results were spectacular .
The CORONA satellite returned with 161 lbs. of film about the Soviet Union , more footage than spy planes had recovered in the previous four years combined .
For the following decade , CORONA became the backbone of American intelligence on the Soviet Union .
Researchers watched troops march along the Russian border with China and spied on cities they 'd never seen before .
They could even count the fruit in Soviet orchards and analyze their crops .
By the early 1960s , RAND had established itself as a fixture of U.S. policy .
Branching out from straight rocket science , the think tank had become the center of the nation 's nuclear strategy .
One high - profile RAND genius , John Williams , developed game theory to predict how the cagey Soviet Union might act during conflict .
The theory was a perfect fit for RAND , an organization that continually sought to impose objective reality on an irrational world .
Another genius , mathematician Albert Wohlstetter , came up with the fail - safe concept , which saved the world from nuclear conflagration several times .
The idea called for a series of checkpoints for bombers armed with nuclear weapons .
If a bomber pilot failed to receive confirmation at any checkpoint , he would abandon the mission and turn the plane around .
Once , in 1979 , a mistake by a telephone operator led to a transmission that the United States was under nuclear attack from Moscow .
Ten fighters from three separate bases took to the air armed with nuclear missiles .
But in the end , because of Wohlstetter 's fail - safe system , none of them deployed their weapons .
Through the years , RAND 's sphere of influence became more visible .
In the 1960s , Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara hired scores of its young researchers — dubbed the " Whiz Kids " — to reorganize the Pentagon .
But perhaps the thing that most solidified RAND 's reputation in the public 's imagination was the release of the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb in 1964 .
The movie 's title character , a deranged Nazi scientist , was modeled after RAND 's eccentric Herman Kahn .
A military strategist , Kahn famously argued that America could easily survive an all - out conflict with the Soviet Union if people took refuge in shelters and rationed food .
Although the radiation would cause hundreds of thousands of genetic defects , Kahn insisted the American people would endure .
Kahn 's apocalyptic scenarios did n't end there .
He also dreamed up the Doomsday Machine , a device that could destroy all life on Earth , which Kubrick used in Dr. Strangelove .
In fact , Kubrick borrowed so many of Kahn 's sayings and ideas that the scientist began demanding royalties .
Kahn was so persistent that Kubrick finally had to tell him , " That 's not how things are done , Herman . " 
Spinning a World Wide Web
While RAND has played a major role in keeping America safe from military attacks and nuclear catastrophes , the think tank has also left its mark on the communications industry .
RAND is directly responsible for packet switching , the technology that made the Internet possible .
It all started in the 1960s , when the military asked RAND researchers to solve a hypothetical question :
If the Soviet Union destroyed all of our communication systems with a nuclear bomb , how could we fight back ?
A young engineer named Paul Baran provided an elegant solution by likening the nation 's telephone wires to the brain 's central nervous system .
Baran proposed sending messages via phone lines and changing words into numbers to avoid noise and distortion .
Baran also decided that any content relayed should be divided into " packets , "  or discrete bundles of data .
As a result , messages were separated during transmission , and would then automatically reconfigure themselves once they reached their destination .
More importantly , if direct communications were destroyed , the packets could reroute themselves through phone lines anywhere in the world .
Baran tried to convince AT&T to install the system , but the phone giant refused to create something that could become its worst competitor .
Instead , the creation of a worldwide packet - switching system was left to the Pentagon , which devised ARPANET , the predecessor to the Internet .
Healthy Choices
During the 1960s , RAND also expanded its lines of investigation into education , welfare reform , and criminal justice .
By the time Richard Nixon took office in 1969 , the think tank was an established , independent source for social policy research .
So , when the issue of medical insurance sparked a great national debate , Nixon tapped RAND for ideas .
At the time , there was little data on the effectiveness of free health care versus coverage plans with co-pays and deductibles .
In particular , Nixon wanted to know if free health care made people healthier .
To find the answer , RAND 's Health Division spent 10 years acting as the insurance company for more than 5,000 people around the country .
In the end , RAND 's research found that people who paid for health care were just as healthy as people who got it for free .
With free health care , people went in for more regular medical screenings , but their other habits — exercise , diet , smoking — were worse .
The message was not lost on the insurance industry , nor on the federal government .
In 1982 , when the study was released , only 30 percent of medical plans had deductibles .
Five years later , more than 90 percent did .
Thinking Ahead
Health care was just the beginning of RAND 's expansion into the social sciences .
Although 50 percent of RAND 's current $ 223 million budget still comes from federal funding , much of that goes toward non-defense work .
The think tank currently employs close to 1,000 researchers , who spend their time analyzing everything from renewable energy and obesity to hurricanes and the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Globalization has also opened up the organization 's opportunities .
In addition to its five centers that handle social and economic policy issues , as well as the five centers that focus on international affairs , RAND has an affiliate organization in Europe , and a prominent voice in Middle Eastern policy .
Most notably , the RAND Qatar Policy Institute is working on reconfiguring the emirate 's entire educational system .
Of course , RAND has n't exactly abandoned its bread - and - butter services .
The organization touts three federally funded research and development centers that concentrate on national security .
After all , RAND did establish the discipline of studying terrorism in the 1970s , long before the United Nations even had a working definition for the word .
Today , the RAND Terrorism Chronology Database , which has catalogued all acts of terrorism from 1968 to the present , has become an invaluable tool for the military and the government .
It makes sense that in these times , our new president will pay attention to the think tank , too .
Barack Obama has taken a keen interest in its study on post - traumatic stress disorder in soldiers returning from Iraq .
In other words , RAND already has his ear .
The Who 's Who of Rand John Nash " “ RAND was the motherland of game theory during the 1950s and 1960s , and among its most prominent players was John Nash — the soulful subject of the book and movie A Beautiful Mind .
Nash came up with what is now called the Nash equilibrium , which is used to determine the stability of competition .
Thomas Schelling " “ Schelling was an economist who came to RAND shortly after Nash 's frenzied departure .
His game theory concocted a worldview of aggression and counter - aggression that was heavily influential during the Vietnam War. Kenneth Arrow " “ One of the most influential RAND employees , Arrow posited that greed is good , and that what he termed " consumer sovereignty "  should rule society .
Some critics have blamed Arrow's Theorem for providing the theoretical foundation for the free market frenzy of the past 30 years , including the current housing market meltdown .
Albert Wohlstetter " “ The most prominent member of RAND 's so - called Nuclear Boys Club .
A brilliant theoretical mathematician and an unparalleled nuclear strategist , he worked at RAND on and off from 1951 to his death 46 years later .
He originated the Second Strike nuclear doctrine ( make sure you have enough backup nukes to wipe out any attackers ) and the Fail Safe principle ( drop the big one on your target only after confirmation in flight from headquarters ) .
Daniel Ellsberg " “ An endlessly loquacious mathematical genius , strategic thinker , and unlikely peacenik .
Disgusted with official lies about America 's involvement in Southeast Asia , he leaked the Pentagon Papers , which set in motion the end of the Vietnam War .

Barbie
Barbie is a doll that recently celebrated her 50th anniversary .
She ’s a real fashionista with a lifestyle that became a trend !
The first Barbie was made in 1959 and gained enormous popularity ever since .
That doll is known all over the word and probably the only doll that has so many different types .
The look of Barbie dolls was changed over the years starting with the color of the hair and her skin to the millimeters of her waist and breasts .
Until the late 90s Barbie had a super - model - like figure , but numerous complaints about it giving an unrealistic idea to girls of healthy body proportions led to changes to her figure .
Her waist got wider and breasts were reduced .
But that was not the first ( though the most common ) and guaranteed not the last complaint .
Though Mattel ( the toy company that produces Barbie dolls ) has also started numerous law suits , the most famous are against Nissan who used Barbie lookalike dolls in one of their commercials and a suit against the Danish pop-group Aqua who released a song called “ Barbie girl ” in 1997 .
The Barbie wardrobe is another topic altogether .
Even the world ’s top designers were creating clothes for Barbie .
In 2009 , during Barbie ’s 50th birthday celebration a runway show was held in New York for the Mercedes - Benz Fashion Week .
Fifty well - known haute couturiers including Diane von Fürstenberg , Vera Wang , Calvin Klein , Bob Mackie , and Christian Louboutin were showcasing their styles for Barbie dolls .
That doll still remains one of the most popular one with over a billion copies sold .
And young ladies continue to play in a happy pink American dream via a Barbie world .

Bratz
Bratz are the first dolls that were able to compete with the popularity of Barbie .
Though Mattel maintained the leading brand by selling dolls and accessories , 2005 figures showed that sales of Barbie dolls had fallen by 30 % in the United States , and by18 % worldwide .
And much of the drop was being attributed to the popularity of Bratz dolls .
Of course the Bratz could not appear on the market quietly .
Mattel sued MGA Entertainment for $ 500 million , alleging that the creator of Bratz — Carter Bryant — was working for Mattel at the time he created the look of the Bratz dolls .
After several months the courts decided that MGA was to pay Mattel only US $ 100 million in damages , citing that only the first generation of Bratz had infringed on Mattel property and that MGA had evolved the product significantly enough to be considered a totally different product .
But about the dolls themselv , Bratz are 4 girls – Jade , Yasmin , Sasha and Cloe .
According to their story they are the most typical teenagers .
The 4 girls / dolls are all about fashion , music and fun at the same with respect to their duties and families .
Bratz dolls have a huge collection of clothes and shoes as well .
But what makes them stand out is their appearance : bright make up on the doll faces , huge almond - shaped eyes , large heads , and skinny bodies .

Mooqla dolls
Mooqla dolls are very unusual dolls created by a Russian designer , Polina Voloshina .
The dolls are made out of silicone and plastic .
The clothes and accessories are also made by Polina ’s team .
What makes the dolls differ from the rest are their faces : they do not have typical doll faces — they look like ladies with exotic and edgy faces , but at the same time very sexy ones .
Each has its unique style and attitude .
That is another distinguishing aspect of Mooqlas — each doll has it own story .
The only similar part from one to the next is that they are daughters of very rich people , usually politicians , and were sent to study in a very expensive private school .
Each story has mystical parts .
One girl prefers to stay alone and talk to herself ( or not to herself ? ) , one adores guns , another wears only cosmic clothes , and so on .
What also brings attention to Mooqla is how they are presented : for each Mooqla girl there was a professional photo session and they really do not look like dolls there .
These dolls are not made for kids .
The customers of Mooqla brand are mostly women from 20 to 35 .
And to tell you the truth mostly not even middle class ones .
The dolls are pretty expensive : $ 350 - $ 500 per doll .
But the price is reasonable for the idea and its fulfillment .

Matryoshka
Matryoshka is another Russian handcrafted doll , but with a surprising filling .
It is also know as a Babushka doll or Nesting doll , though the name Matryoshka is probably one of the few Russian words that every foreigner understands .
That doll is the most popular of all Russian souvenirs .
The Matryoshka is a wooden doll without any concrete parts of its body – it has no hand or legs – the head smoothly turns into the body that only gives an illusion of the body .
It ’s usually dressed in a brightly colored dress .
The more traditional dolls were dressed in a Russian native costume with a scarf on the head .
And the secret of the Matryoshka is that if you pull it apart there will be another doll inside with another inside and so on .
The number of the dolls inside varies from 5 to 12 , but that is not the limit .
The traditional Martyoshka dolls are all totally the same inside .
But nowadays they are mostly done to be different from the top one .
And the design of the dolls is starting to vary .
The shape is the same , but it is not only a Russian woman anymore , sometimes not even a human .
You can see presidents , dictators , cartoon characters , Star Wars robots , or couture models .
As for the last one , the Matryoshka is often used as a print or the idea for couture collections and due to the 10th anniversary of the Russian Vogue Martyoshka had a chance to try on unique clothes from the world ’s top designers like Prada , Marc Jacobs , Kenzo , Burberry , Yves Saint Laurent , Sonya Rykiel , and others .

Ugly Dolls
Ugly dolls is a collection of design plush toys .
They were created by 2 designers — David Horvath and Sun-Min Kim .
The history of their creation is really romantic .
David and Sun-Min were dating and when she had to return to Korea for some time he was sending her short “ I miss her letters ” signed with his newly created character Wage .
Sun -Min decided to make a present for her future husband and sewed a plush version of Wage and sent it to David .
He showed it to his friends and it was a hit !
So Sun -min sewed several more , and more .
The first Ugly dolls were sold out in one day at the Giant Robot store in Los Angeles .
And so the mass production began .
Now there are over 20 characters and not only plush ones .
The little cute “ uglies ” became really popular with kids and the grownups as well , and can bring a lot of true joy even by using them as a small part of your décor .

Porcelain Dolls
Porcelain dolls are generally dolls for grown ups .
No , of course they were made for children and were greatly loved by little girls originally .
But nowadays the huge interest in these dolls is mostly from the side of collectors .
They truly love the dolls and accept their porcelain dolls as a part of the family .
All dolls created before approximately 1930 are considered antique .
There are many factors that affect the value of porcelain dolls .
The condition of the porcelain dolls will most certainly determine their value .
The porcelain dolls face should be bright , with even coloring on the doll body .
The first thing to remember is that they were played with , dressed and redressed , bodies sometimes worn out , patched and replaced .
Stained or significantly worn porcelain dolls or dolls not presented in the original costume would be less valuable and generally less desirable .
Many books , guides and specialized porcelain doll magazines provide information about manufacturers , trademarks , and model numbers and include size charts to assist in identifying your collectible dolls .

Bobblehead Dolls
Bobblehead dolls – also known as nodders or wobblers – are the classic collectibles .
They are thought to date back at least 150 years .
Its head is often oversized compared to its body .
Instead of a solid connection , its head is connected to the body by a spring in such a way that a light tap will cause the head to bobble .
Bobble head dolls were first believed to be referenced in 1842 in the short story “ The Overcoat ” by writer Nikolai Gogol .
The story is also known as “ The Cloak ” and has been adapted to film and stage .
The main character ’s neck was described in that story as “ like the necks of plaster cats which wag their heads ” .
In the 1920s , a New York Knicks basketball player bobblehead was produced , and this created a renewed interest in the collectible .
However , by the 1930s , interest had again waned , and from that point until the 1950s they were only produced in very limited numbers as novelty items .
The modern bobblehead appeared in the 1950s .
You can find cartoon characters , sport or movie stars or just animals .
A lot of drivers put a bobblehead doll in the car .
And now we can also enjoy the bobbles on solar batteries .
Such smiley heads raise your mood every time the sun reaches the figure .

American Girl Dolls
American Girl dolls are a line of dolls and accessories that represent a special place and time in American history .
Each doll has a series of historically accurate books written about them .
The Historical Characters were initially the main focus of Pleasant Company that produces the dolls .
The dolls are to teach aspects of American history through the book series from the perspective of a nine year old girl living in that time period ( the dolls are made to look like a 9 - 11 yeas old girl ) .
Although the books are written for pre-teen girls , they endeavor to cover significant topics such as child labor , racism , alcoholism , war , and many more social issues .
The first 3 dolls were Molly , Kirsten and Samantha .
And later about 15 characters were created that differed by skin , eyes , and hair color .
Though the dolls are not inexpensive ones , many families save up in order to purchase an American Girl doll and her clothing and accessories , or doting grandmothers often buy a little girl her first doll for a birthday or special holiday such as Christmas .
The dolls gained vast popularity ; they are collected and played with by little girls and their moms !

Voodoo Dolls
Voodoo is a powerful mystical practice that takes its origin from Africa .
Voodoo means “ Spirit of God . ”
The use of Voodoo dolls is not done to control others , but to focus one ’s energy into positive and constructive ways and for magic .
It started spreading from the African continent to other parts of the world during the centuries of slavery and a growing interest in traveling .
Voodoo is not a form of the Black Arts .
When a large number of people in Africa contracted an infectious disease , the healers were called upon and had to treat people without touching them .
At that time , spells were chanted into the Voodoo dolls which were used to dispel the sickness .
The Voodoo doll is used to represent the spirit of a specific person .
You can address the doll , requesting a change in attitude , influencing the person to act in accordance with your desires .
Most practitioners of Voodoo typically do not use pins in Voodoo dolls and when pins are used , they are used as focusing tools for healing and other positive purposes .
And each color of the pin means a different emotion or a feeling :
• Red | Power
• Yellow | Money
• Green | Tranquility
• Blue | Love
• Purple | Spirituality
• Black | Pain / Relief / Healing / Repelling negativity
• White | Positive Energy / Good Karma
• Pink = Death
And nowadays Voodoo dolls are mostly used for fun , to scare your boyfriend or just as a cute key - chain .

Paper dolls
Paper dolls are dolls that are cut out of paper .
The doll itself is just a figure that is dressed in underwear .
The clothes are usually held onto the dolls with folding tabs .
The doll , with several outfit options , is placed on one sheet of paper and can be easily cut out with scissors .
Basically the paper doll has been the most inexpensive toy for over 2 hundred years .
In Europe , particularly France , the first paper dolls were made during the mid 1700s .
They were intended to entertain adults and spread throughout high society .
In America paper dolls were more valued for fun .
Paper was an expensive resource and was rarely wasted on fun .
So if a kid could get a paper doll he / she would have treasured it between book pages or in a “ safe - box . ”
Only later when paper became less of a luxury due to the invention of the mechanical grinding machines , were dolls mass produced and available for all kids .
Vintage paper dolls were hand painted .
In America , Civil War widows often earned money by embellishing the printed paper dolls .
Paper dolls have regained popularity with young children featuring popular characters and celebrities .

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - A Dubai court Sunday upheld a one - month jail sentence given to a British pair for kissing in public , media reports said .
The British man living in Dubai and a female friend were arrested in November on charges of kissing intimately in public and consuming alcohol .
An Emirati mother had complained her child had seen their indiscretion .
The case is the third time in under two years that Britons have fallen foul of indecency laws in Dubai , a Muslim emirate popular with sun-seeking Western tourists and expatriates .
The defendants are consulting their lawyer on whether to appeal Sunday ’s ruling before a cassation court , the website of the daily Gulf News reported .
The pair , who had been free on bail , are also to pay a fine of 1,000 dirhams ( $ 272 ) for illegal consumption of alcohol and will be deported after serving their jail term , the website said .
Dubai ’s foreign population expanded rapidly in recent years as expatriates flocked to the Gulf Arab trade and tourism hub for its tax - free earnings and year - round sunshine .
The changes have challenged the Emirati population , now vastly outnumbered by foreigners , raising concerns that the rapid pace of growth is a threat to their social and religious identity in what remains a deeply conservative region .
In 2008 , a British couple narrowly escaped jail after a court found them guilty of engaging in drunken sexual activity out of wedlock and in public on a beach in the emirate .
They were sentenced to three months in prison followed by deportation , but had their jail terms overturned on appeal .
In another case this year , a British couple who shared a hotel room managed to escape trial in Dubai for having sex out of wedlock by producing a marriage certificate .

When Kevin Myatt dropped his chain powering into Dragons Tail in Whakarewarewa a few days ago he could n’t in his wildest dreams have imagined how the slam would unfold .
After sliding along the ground he realised the bike was still with him and glancing down at his wrist he soon realised why .
His brake lever had slid up his arm ( slicing it open on the way ) and then pierced the skin on his wrist surfacing a few centimetres later , as Kevin puts it , he was now “ at one with his bike ” .
[ LINK TO IMAGE ]
His riding buddies Julia and Tim called the ambulance and quickly removed the brake lever and caliper from the bike whilst Kevin Stemmed the blood flow from his own wrist .
Now I ’m pretty sure that you like me have never seen this type of wound before , as it happens neither had any of Rotorua ’s health professionals , starting with the ambo guys ; when one realised there was n’t enough light to shoot a good photo he instructed his partner to use the flashlight to illuminate it better .
Kevin did n’t fare much better at Rotorua hospital either where at least 10 hospital staff heard about the brake lever and turned up with personal cameras and cell phones .
[ LINK TO IMAGE ]
Even the radiologist who had been on strike admitted on seeing the wound that she was glad she came in to work !!!
A general anesthetic and 15 stitches later , Kevin was good to go .
As soon as the stitches are out he ’ll be back in the forest and is not deterred one ounce by his freakish ( yet slightly entertaining ) wound .

State of a Nation ( from Slaves to do these Things ; also found at Verse Daily )
Amy King
The actor is a second life
of people drawn
on the achievable with fiction .
The characters are fleeting
when an actor ’s flame
blows the shortest immortality .
As a result , great achievements
are limited to audience .
But the audience pants on .
Saliva glows on the mouths ’
cornered sounds .
We might live five hundred years
on time ’s sandbags
that prick with passivity ’s angels .
They hole our breath and weight us .
The stage baits .
Lungs blow over liver - grey streets .
No one ’s name survives
some small comfort
though hope will surely be given
ever after .
Even after ,
we still live in the present .
We live as presidents .
We hold on to the value
of a vote , a soliloquy , a sword ,
and the lights after curtain .
Ten thousand years and the barrier
between inner and outer ,
grape skin and meat ,
sticks marred by grey matter .
That lives will dine at single tables
fermenting veins that push
against wine and palate , seat and vision ,
the drive to behave and
the drive to portray knocks our hearts
in order not to die from these truths ,
however tailored and ill - fitted .
The only thing to ask ?
When I am a million candles ,
be my feet .
When I please
with human crisis ,
carry me into your finish .
When the tide waxes bold ,
grow roots from the specters
beyond me .
When I die ,
play the boy on the soul
of that death and use
my memory ’s mud
to make gods of us from the dust .
Comment :
The form of the poem is the “ state of a nation : ” discrete images that seem to stand independent of each other .
But there are generalities which tie , and some generalities speak to the particular .
An “ actor ” – anyone who does anything , to be literal – is a good place to start .
Of course , the actor in our world is n’t literally one who does ; it is someone who imitates another ( “ second life ” ) .
For us to invest the actor with significance is to see our first lives recede into the background .
We , independent of the actor , are drawn on the “ achievable . ”
The actor ’s roles come from our world ; the only things that mirror ancient myth nowadays , for example , are science fiction and comic books .
Our speaker almost dismisses our dependence on mass media , on watching ourselves every day in the office on television and thinking ourselves imaginative .
That ’s a democratic society , right ?
The characters will burn away , and no one cares , because the point is that there is reality , the “ achievable , ” and it is all of ours .
But that ’s just it – if the audience has already turned away from its own potential to the stage , nothing really is being achieved .
Time passes by , but it is someone else ’s time : it ’s like others parceled sand and we ’re pouring into the hourglass for ourselves .
“ Passivity ’s angels ” prick – something feels wrong about this process , but we ’re not sure what .
Maybe it ’s the actual sensation of breathing that ’s the alarm ( “ they hole our breath and weight us ” ) .
The significance of all of this : Lungs blow over liver - grey streets .
We all have the same gray houses and hole ourselves up inside of them .
Only children play outside ; the rest of us have decided to enter a nursing home at age 22 .
The freshness of the air is n’t enough to wake us , it ’s outside of us for the most part .
Our “ comfort ” and “ hope ” are dependent on screens where we watch what we think is real .
We ’re all being shaped into one sort of person , though .
And that ’s the funny thing .
You ca n’t just say we ’re brainwashed into this .
We do live in the present , we made this a conscious choice .
No one says out loud “ I ’m going to give up my freedom for the comfort of a flickering screen : ”
We live as presidents .
We hold on to the value
of a vote , a soliloquy , a sword ,
and the lights after curtain .
That ’s the specific appeal of democratic empowerment : there is no “ we . ”
There ’s “ I , ” and “ I ’m as good and as powerful as the President , ” and that attitude melts into “ we . ”
It is no wonder the speaker ’s imagery turns to the themes of time and humility :
Ten thousand years and the barrier
between inner and outer ,
grape skin and meat ,
sticks marred by grey matter .
That lives will dine at single tables
fermenting veins that push
against wine and palate , seat and vision ,
the drive to behave and
the drive to portray knocks our hearts
in order not to die from these truths ,
however tailored and ill - fitted .
We are what we consume , and this has always been true .
The marring by “ grey matter ” refers to the attempts to deny this truth , as well as the attempts themselves injuring what grey matter we have .
Our drunkenness is our blood .
There is no breaking of bread ( “ single tables , ” “ palate ” ) .
“ Behave ” indicates we do recognize ourselves as the audience ; “ portray ” ties us to the actor .
Wavering between the contradiction is us , and it is a reason to live other than the “ truth . ”
Our speaker ends with three requests : she ’s stepping forth from the stage , if you will , delivering a plea to the audience .
The actor she herself has been – I assume this poem is meant for recitation – requests completeness .
As a million lighted ways , she needs as many to follow those paths .
As a shore that receives many waves , she depends on others for stability .
And even though this is an age seemingly unconcerned with honor , she knows more than anyone else that being remembered depends on other people .
The death of a whistle - blower who said the UK government had “ sexed up ” a dossier on Saddam Hussein ’s military capabilities in order to sell the Iraq war has been one of the most intriguing and confusing elements of the war ’s history .
Now the UK ’s Conservative Party is signaling that it plans to reopen the inquiry into the death of Dr. David Kelly if it wins the next election .
The move could potentially harm the ruling Labour Party , which championed the Iraq war effort and is now trailing in the polls for this spring ’s election .

On Sunday , Dominic Grieve , the Conservative Party ’s “ shadow ” justice minister , said members of the public “ have not been reassured ” that Kelly ’s death was a suicide , and if his government wins the election , he would want to reopen the case , reports the UK ’s Daily Mail .
Kelly , a weapons expert with Britain ’s Ministry of Defence , was found dead in a forest near his home in Oxfordshire in 2003 , shortly after he gave an interview to the BBC in which he said that the British government was lying about its claim that Saddam Hussein could launch biological and chemical weapons within 45 minutes of giving the order .
Kelly ’s death sparked suspicions that he may have been killed for undermining the government of then - Prime Minister Tony Blair as the British leader stood with US President George W. Bush in pushing for an invasion of Iraq .
A former British ambassador quoted Kelly as having said Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I will probably be found dead in the woodsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â if Iraq were invaded .
Hours before his death , Kelly reportedly e-mailed New York Times reporter Judith Miller , warning her of “ many dark actors playing games , ” according to the BBC .
A 2004 inquest run by Lord Hutton declared Kelly ’s death to be a suicide .
But news reports began to question that verdict almost immediately , and last year , a group of 13 doctors announced that the doctor could not have committed suicide — the cut found on his left wrist was n’t enough for the weapons expert to bleed to death .

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The bleeding from Dr KellyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ulnar artery is highly unlikely to have been so voluminous and rapid that it was the cause of death , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  the 13 doctors stated in a 12 - page report .
It also emerged in 2009 that Kelly had been working on an expose of the claims surrounding Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction when he died .
Kelly had “ had several discussions with a publisher in Oxford and was seeking advice on how far he could go without breaking the law on secrets , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the UK Daily Express alleged .
The Conservatives ’ Grieve questioned the government ’s decision to seal the details of Kelly ’s death for 70 years , saying a Conservative government would re-examine that decision , the Daily Telegraph reports .

Grieve also applauded the work of the doctors ’ group that declared Kelly ’s death not to be a suicide .
“ I am aware of the work of the doctors ’ group on challenging Lord Hutton ’s findings .
They have made an impressive and cogent case , ” Grieve said in a letter last month , as quoted at the Daily Mail .
Any reopening of the case would be contingent on the Conservatives winning the election .
A recent poll shows the Conservatives leading the Labour Party by 11 points , but a complete victory is anything but assured .

Pollsters say the likeliest outcome of the election is a “ hung parliament , ” where no party controls a majority of seats in the legislature , and has to govern with the support of one of the smaller parties .
Euthanasia
The word euthanasia stems from the Greek words " eu thanatos " meaning " good death " and refers to the action of a third party , usually a doctor , deliberately ending the life of an individual .
Active and Passive Euthanasia the difference between " active " and " passive " is that in active euthanasia , something is done to end the patients 's life ( or , what amounts to the same thing , to kill the patient ) : in passive euthanasia , something is not done that would have preserved the patients 's life ( thus the patient is killed indirectly ) .
Voluntary and Involuntary Euthanasia " Voluntary euthanasia " is when the patient requests that an action be taken to end his life , or that life - saving treatment be stopped , with full knowledge that this will lead to his death .
" Involuntary euthanasia " is when a patient 's life is ended without the patient 's knowledge and consent .
Assisted Suicide
This is when someone provides an individual with the information , guidance , and means to take his or her own life with the intention that they will be used for this purpose .
Ordinary and Extraordinary Medical Care
An important distinction to be aware of is that between ordinary and extraordinary medical care .
Ordinary medical care includes basic nutrition and hydration given to a comatose patient .
Extraordinary medical care can be described as an excessive attempt to prolong human lif via artifical means , an attempt without which the person would progress naturally to death .
It can also be described as care that does not offer reasonable hope of benefit and may be excessively burdensome to the patient .

Microsoft is ending its support for Intel 's Itanium processor with the current version of its Windows Server OS , according to a Microsoft blog posting Friday .
" Windows Server 2008 R2 will be the last version of Windows Server to support the Intel Itanium architecture , " Dan Reger , a Microsoft senior technical product manager , wrote on the Windows Server Division Weblog .
" SQL Server 2008 R2 and Visual Studio 2010 are also the last versions to support Itanium . "
The news will come as a setback for Intel , which has struggled to get its 64 - bit Itanium processors more widely used by server makers .
It released the latest , quad - core version of Itanium in February after several delays .
By that time Red Hat had already announced in January that it would not support Itanium with the next release of its Linux OS distribution .
Burton Group analyst Nik Simpson said it was " no coincidence " that Microsoft announced its decision during the same week that Intel released its powerful new multicore Xeon 7500 series processors , which include high - end reliability features that Intel once reserved for Itanium .
" For Microsoft , reliability was the only thing that Itanium had going for it , the number of Windows licenses sold on Itanium is negligible compared to the x64 business .
So the decision to drop Itanium was probably a relatively easy one , " Simpson wrote in a blog post .
Microsoft 's Reger said much the same .
" The natural evolution of the x86 64 - bit ( ' x64 ' ) architecture has led to the creation of processors and servers which deliver the scalability and reliability needed for today 's ' mission - critical ' workloads , " he wrote .
Microsoft will continue to provide mainstream support for Itanium - based systems until July 2013 , and extended support until July 2018 , Reger said , in line with its standard support policy .
Intel recently committed to delivering at least two more generations of Itanium during the next four years , dubbed Poulson and Kittson .
HP , which made a big bet on Itanium when it ended the development of its own PA - RISC processor , has repeatedly said that it is committed to Itanium 's future .
But the end of support by Microsoft is sure to spark a fresh round of questions about the platform 's prospects .
For Itanium , Microsoft 's move is " bad , but not disastrous , at least for now , " Thompson said .
Most Itanium processors are sold in servers running Hewlett - Packard 's Unix variant , HP - UX , he noted .
But there will soon be just a handful of OSes remaining for Itanium that have " enterprise - ready credentials , " he wrote .
Those include Novell 's Suse Enterprise Linux ( SEL ) , Groupe Bull 's GCOS , and HP's HP - UX and OpenVMS .
" Of those operating system platforms , only HP - UX and OpenVMS actually require Itanium .
GCOS and SEL are both supported on x64 processors , which will probably hasten the end of support on Itanium now that x64 can match Itanium for reliability , " Thompson wrote .
" So HP is likely to be the last man standing in the Itanium systems business , but the new features and scalability of the 75xx Xeon beg the question , ' will HP adapt its Itanium hardware to support the Xeon 75xx and port HP - UX or OpenVMS to the x64 platform ? ' "
A Microsoft spokesman confirmed the company 's blog post is accurate .
Intel could not immediately be reached for comment Sunday .

Google Chrome is a wonderful web browser of choice for web designers and web developers because it offers so many extensions that are helpful for website design .
With Google Chrome extensions , you can add more features to the browser to help you with designing , debugging , and working on websites .
We share with you the top ten Chrome extensions for designers and developers .
1. Firebug Lite ( for Google Chrome )
Firebug Lite ( for Google Chrome ) is an extension that sets up Firebug Lite in the browser .
Although the built - in Developer Tools in Chrome gives you relatively the same features of Firebug ( and more ) , long - time Firebug fans will appreciate this extension for debugging and testing their work in Chrome .
Chris Pederick ’s Web Developer toolbar is a long - time favorite among web designers and front - end developers .
Originally created for Firefox , it has been ported to Chrome with a slicker interface .
It has loads of options for examining and understanding web page layouts , including showing block element stacking orders , displaying CSS style information about certain elements , browser cache controlling , and much more .
To learn some Web Developer toolbar tips and tricks , see the following posts :
Resolution
Test is an extension for testing web pages in different screen resolutions , with an option to define your own custom resolutions .
This is very handy in making sure that your web design looks great under different monitor sizes .
4. Pendule
Pendule extends the built - in Developer tools in Google Chrome .
The extension gives its users plenty of features such as one - touch markup validation using W3 C ’s automated web services , hiding images on a web page , viewing scripts included in a web page , and more .
5. PlainClothes
One of the best ways to evaluate the accessibility of a web page is to remove its CSS styles and see if content being presented is still readable without them .
This simulates the experience of a user who cannot see their monitor screen and have to rely on the web page ’s markup to access the content .
PlainClothes does one thing well ; it removes all CSS styles on a web page .
Though created primarily for web development testing , you can use this extension to view your favorite styles unstyled ( so that the boss does n’t catch you browsing Digg when you should really be finishing up that JavaScript function ) .
6. Image Cropper
If you want to take certain portions of a web page , Image Cropper is the simple , no - frills Chrome extension for you .
Just drag around the area you want cropped , and it ’ll take just that part of the web page .
Need pixel - perfect accuracy ?
It displays the dimension and location of your crops to help you get just the size you need .
7. Lorem Ipsum Generator
This extension prides itself in being minimalist and simple — and that ’s good because there ’s no reason generating Lorem Ipsum text should be a convoluted affair .
Lorem Ipsum generator helps you fill up your design mockups with dummy text for presentation purposes .
Troubleshooting in Internet Explorer ’s proprietary Trident layout engine is not a fun ordeal .
With IE
Tab , you can at least save some time from having to use Internet Explorer ( and its limited list of extensions ) for debugging rendering issues in your work .
9. jQuery Shell
j Query Shell allows you to run JavaScript and jQuery commands in the context of the current web page .
It ’s a great extension for learning and experimenting with jQuery .
10 . Color Picker
This one - trick Chrome extension does one thing really well : quickly getting the Hex and RGB values of any color on any web page .
It can be very helpful in determining what colors your favorite website uses without having to take a screen grab of it into Photoshop and using the Eyedropper tool .
11 . WebEdit
With the WebEdit Chrome extension , you can make any web page editable ( the changes you make , of course , will not be saved ) .
Why would this extension be helpful ?
If you are creating a website and want to play around with elements without making any significant changes to the code , this extension can come in very handy .
12 . Chrome Sniffer
Have you ever wondered what technologies , frameworks , and open source apps a website is using ?
Experienced web developers can find this out by studying the site ’s source code , but if you want a more convenient and quick way of doing this , then check out Chrome Sniffer .
Chrome Sniffer lists all known JavaScript framework / libraries ( jQuery , MooTools , etc. ) and CMS ( Drupal , WordPress , etc. ) that a website uses .
13 . Webpage Screenshot
A common task for web designers is taking screen grabs of web pages .
With Webpage Screenshot , you can capture an entire web page , even if it spills outside of the browser ’s viewport .
It gives users the opportunity to resize the window before capturing and saves the screen grab as a PNG file .
Eye Dropper is a Google Chrome extension that gives you the ability to determine a color on any web page .
What ’s more is that it presents a color wheel and color swatches ( found in most graphics software ) so that you can experiment , tweak and pick colors .
15 . SEO Site Tools

California ’s unemployment rate reached a new high of 12.6 % in March , bolstering fears that a weak labor market will remain a drag on the state ’s economy at least through the end of the year .
The unemployment rate in February was 12.5 % .
Despite hints of an economic turnaround , some of the 2.3 million unemployed in the state found March the toughest month yet .
That ’s because tens of thousands have been out of work so long that their unemployment checks will be cut off within the next few weeks .
They ’re not helped by the $ 18 - billion measure signed Thursday by President Obama that extends jobless benefits for many Americans through June 2 .
The Employment Development Department estimates that about 100,000 Californians will have exhausted their benefits by this weekend .
“ Jobs have not been quickly multiplying , so there ’s a lot of people who are still in need of assistance , ” said Loree Levy , a spokeswoman with the Employment Development Department .
California payrolls increased by 4,200 nonfarm jobs in March , primarily in the sectors of manufacturing , educational and health services , and leisure and hospitality .
Still , the unemployment rate rose as many who had been discouraged by the job hunt resumed their search .
The construction , information , government and financial activities sectors continued to shed jobs , the EDD said .
California has lost more than 1.3 million jobs since December 2007 .
The unemployment rate in Los Angeles County remained steady at 12.4 % in March , as employers added 9,900 jobs , led by the leisure and hospitality sector with 3,700 jobs .
Orange County ’s unemployment rate increased to 10.1 % , from a revised 9.8 % in February , although employers in that county added 7,300 jobs .
The Inland Empire , which includes Riverside and San Bernardino counties , gained 5,700 jobs but still saw its unemployment rate rise to 15 % , up from a revised 14.8 % in February .
Typically , unemployment benefits in California last 26 weeks .
But in the last two years , four sets of federal extensions have added 53 weeks .
Another program , called FED - ED in California , added 20 weeks on top of that , bringing the total potential benefits to 99 weeks .
That ’s the longest duration of jobless benefits made available in recent memory , the EDD ’s Levy said .
But employers remain cautious about hiring .
On average , there are 5.5 job applicants for every opening , according to Maurice Emsellem , policy co-director at the National Employment Law Project .
For those about to lose benefits , the clock is ticking .
“ They ’re on the leading edge of the demand , and for the first time , there ’s no more further weeks being discussed , ” Levy said .
Some unemployed workers will be helped by the federal measure passed Thursday .
They had already qualified for previous extensions of benefits but were not able to receive them because Congress had not yet authorized the funding .
Emsellem estimates that the measure will help 424,000 people who otherwise would have run out of benefits by the end of the week .
But other jobless workers , such as Dave McCord , feel ignored by Congress .
The 53 - year - old San Francisco resident got his last unemployment check three weeks ago .
The telecommunications engineer has been out of work since March 2008 , and he estimates that he ’s sent out thousands of resumes and spent countless hours searching for employment .
McCord does n’t have health insurance , and worries that if he does n’t find a job soon , he ’ll have to move in with his grown children .
He signed an online petition urging Congress to grant additional unemployment benefits to people like him .
But he knows that further extensions are unlikely .
“ I recognize that there should be a limit , but if there ’s six people looking for every job , we have a special situation , ” he said .
“ Now , we do n’t have a consistent safety net . ”
But some economists said that extending benefits could create a long - term unemployment problem similar to that in some European countries .
Alan Reynolds , a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute , says unemployment insurance benefits discourage people from looking for work .
He estimates that extending benefits increases the unemployment rate by 1.7 percentage points .
To reduce the unemployment rate , he says , states should reduce the amount of benefits available .
“ It sounds harsh , but if you want to improve the fiscal situation , you have to get people back to work , ” he said .
“ This will encourage it .
It ’s all about incentives . ”
Michael Patterson , a 45 - year - old aspiring actor , says he ’d much rather have a job than collect benefits .
Patterson is on his third extension of benefits .
When he first lost his job with a temp agency , he gave up his apartment and moved in with his family in Palmdale .
But , he said , they too are struggling financially , so he moved out a few months ago .
He now pays $ 210 a month to sleep on the floor of a friend ’s apartment , and he sometimes goes to the L.A. Mission to eat .
“ It ’s not good to depend on unemployment benefits that any moment could be cut off , ” he said .
Many of the long - term jobless in California were employed in industries decimated by the recession , including construction and business and professional services , said Esmael Adibi , an economist at Chapman University .
“ For those people , the outlook is grim , ” Adibi said .
About 39 % of the unemployed in California -- about 843,000 people -- have been out of work for 27 weeks or more .
That ’s more than twice as many people as a year ago .
Many companies are squeezing more work out of existing employees and delaying hiring anyone new , said Philip J. Romero , dean of the College of Business and Economics at Cal State L.A. Productivity grew 6.9 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 , the steepest growth rate since 2003 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
For some who run out of unemployment insurance and still can’t find a job , the only recourse is to go on welfare .
Laid - off warehouse worker Charles Valentino , whose benefits stopped coming a few months ago , found himself applying for general relief in a Social Services office in downtown L.A. this week .
He ’d much rather be working , he said .
He now sleeps in a room with four other people , collects food stamps and hopes to find a job so he can be reunited with his two children .
“ I tried real hard to find something , ” he said , holding his belt , which he had to take off to pass through the office ’s security .
“ It ’s frustrating . ”
