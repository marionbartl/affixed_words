In the rush - hour traffic on High Holborn , commuters were getting off one of many London buses that carry an advert proclaiming the beginning of Psalm 53 : " The fool hath said in his heart , there is no God . "
But , in a theatre down the road , hundreds had gathered to proclaim exactly that – that there is indeed no God and those who think there is one are , in fact , the real fools .
Greeted by a cardboard cutout of Darwin , they gathered in Conway Hall , the headquarters of the Ethical Society , for the creation of the first national student body to represent and lobby for the rights of young British atheists .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The launch of the National Federation of Atheist , Humanist and Secular Student Societies – which the founders have agreed to shorten to the abbreviated AHS – is the latest in a series of pro-secular movements that have sprung up to oppose what they believe is a growing pandering towards religious groups .
With scientists and rationalists celebrating the bicentenary of Darwin 's birth this year , the timing is more than apt .
But the creation of this latest manifestation of atheism reveals a renaissance over the past three years for secular and humanist ideals that began with Richard Dawkins ' book The God Delusion and only recently manifested itself in the popular atheist bus campaign , in which double deckers carried the message : " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
There was once a time when those ideals were , of course , commonplace .
Two centuries ago , progressive intellectuals of the post - Enlightenment age were all too happy to predict the end of religion , that the triumph of science and reason would win out and that man would turn away from God .
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s , meanwhile , student atheist groups were a vibrant and influential part of university life .
Thinking the battle had been won , they largely died out two decades ago .
But , as religious conflict spreads once again throughout the world , throwing the Western world into a so - called clash of civilisations with radical Islam , the time is ripe , according to secularists , for a new religion – a live - and - let - live brand of soft atheism .
Dressed in a sharp suit and sporting a carefully trimmed goatie , 24 - year - old Norman Ralph , the newly anointed president of AHS , explained why he feels it is time for Britain 's atheists to unite .
" I firmly believe that the secular traditions of this country are being openly challenged on all sides , " he said .
" But I also think there is a growing wave of British atheism sweeping the country and we need to ride that wave .
Ever since 9/11 people are being challenged to pick a side .
There is such a push at the moment to be politically accepting of religious views that those who do n't have a religion are , in fact , missing out .
That is a message that I think will be popular to many people . "
If the recent atheist bus campaign is any indication , he may be right .
When Ariane Sherine , the young comedian behind the adverts , somewhat jokingly suggested that atheists should all donate £ 5 to sponsor a bus campaign that would spread a secular message rather than the usual Biblical extracts , she was flooded with donations and letters of support .
Her original aim was to raise £ 5,500 to run 30 bus ads across London for four weeks .
Within weeks , the campaign had managed to raise more than £ 150,000 thanks to a huge response from the public and the financial clout of Dawkins who agreed to match any donations .
Over the past month , more than 800 buses across the country have been driving around with the " There 's Probably No God " slogan and plans are afoot to place 1,000 more adverts on the Tube system .
The idea has also spread abroad , with secular groups in America and Spain being prompted to take out their own bus adverts .

Considering his prominent involvement in the atheist bus campaign it was perhaps no surprise that Professor Dawkins attended the launch of AHS and announced that his charitable foundation would be willing to give support to students who wished to set up an atheist society at university .
" University is a place where people think , a place where people evaluate evidence , " the former Oxford don said .
" Public statements of non-belief are treated as threatening , an affront to the religious , while the reverse is not true .
More concerning is the enduring assumption that religious belief does not have to earn respect like any other view , an approach that has caused politicians and public figures across the UK to withdraw from asking the vital question : why is religion given such special status in government , culture and the media ?
Why is belief in a higher power an indication of greater moral fortitude , character and acumen ?
No opinion should be protected from criticism simply by virtue of being religiously held . "
Chris Worfolk , a 22 - year - old Leeds University graduate , was one of many students who travelled to London for the launch .
He said atheists in Leeds initially found it difficult to form their own society because of opposition from students ' groups like the Islamic Society and the Christian Union .
" It took us a long time to get our society up and running .
There was a lot of opposition , " he said .
" One of the issues we are trying to lobby the university on is the serving of halal meat in the canteens . "
Chloë Clifford - Frith , who recently graduated from St Hilda 's in Oxford , said students today had a duty to promote atheist ideas : " We live in a world where religious governments execute adulterers and homosexuals , deny women and minority groups basic freedoms , circulate fraudulent claims about contraception and scientific research and create laws that protect them from criticism , " she said .
" We are privileged , in such a world , to live in a country where we can even have this debate .
As such , we have a duty to bring it into our universities and beyond . "
Taking a stand : Notable non-believers
Diagoras of Melos
Often referred to as the " first atheist " , Diagoras was a poet and sophist who openly spoke out against religion in ancient Greece and was forced to flee Athens for doing so .
Unfortunately , little record of what he thought survives although we know that he publicly questioned the Eleusinian Mysteries , an elaborate series of ceremonies .
Albert Einstein
Einstein was regularly asked if he thought there was a god .
In developing the theory of relativity , he realised there must have been a beginning to the universe .
The question he struggled with was what came before the beginning ?
He concluded : " I do not believe in a personal God .
If something is in me which can be called religion , then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it . "
Mark Twain
A fearsome critic of organised religion , Twain wrote many of the soundbites atheists repeat today , such as : " If Christ were here , there is one thing he would not be : a Christian . "
Born in 1835 , a year Halley 's comet was seen , he ironically predicted " the Almighty " would take him next time the comet passed near Earth .
He died in 1910 , two weeks after the comet was spotted once more .

When I traveled to Gaza last week , everywhere I went , a photo haunted me .
I saw it in a brochure called " Gaza will not die " that Hamas gives out to visitors at the border crossing .
A poster - sized version was posted outside a makeshift memorial at the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City .
And now that I am back home , the image comes to me when I look at children playing in the park , when I glance at the school across the street , when I go to sleep at night .
It is a photo of a young Palestinian girl who is literally buried alive in the rubble from a bomb blast , with just her head protruding from the ruins .
Her eyes are closed , her mouth partially open , as if she were in a deep sleep .
Dried blood covers her lips , her cheeks , her hair .
Someone with a glove is reaching down to touch her forehead , showing one final gesture of kindness in the midst of such inhumanity .

Bushfire victims have reacted angrily after being told they must present identification to get Federal Government assistance , despite most having lost everything .
An open letter published in a News Limited newspaper this morning questioned the ability of Centrelink to quickly distribute the payments of $ 1,000 per adult and $ 400 per child .
News Ltd journalist Gary Hughes , who escaped the fires at St Andrews , said when he and others fronted Centrelink on Monday they were told there would be no financial help unless they could produce a driver 's licence or bank statement .
" What 's that meant to be , Kevin [ Rudd ] , some cruel joke ? "
Mr Hughes wrote .
" Losing everything means just that - everything .
There are many like us who did n't have time to calmly pause to collect wallets and purses as we fled our homes with wet towels over our faces to avoid choking to death on toxic smoke and flaming embers .
" Maybe bureaucrats think more clearly in a crisis . "
Human Services Minister Joe Ludwig has apologised for the bureaucratic bungle and says all efforts are being made to ensure people get the help they need .
" I do n't know the precise details but we are sorry if it did happen , " Senator Ludwig said .
" What we have instructed Centrelink to do is to take the lightest possible approach to the issue of confirming identity . "
He says while identification was helpful , a signature would suffice , adding that about 800 claims for assistance had already been paid out .
Meanwhile , VicRoads says it will issue replacement driver 's licences for free for bushfire victims .
Last night 's Battlestar Galactica episode , " The Oath , " about a violent , tragic anti-cylon rebellion in the Fleet , was one of the series ' best .
It was also a character study of how a good person goes bad .
Advertisement
Spoilers ahead !
In " The Oath , " a young tactical officer named Felix Gaeta lead a rebellion against Admiral Adama 's leadership , challenging the military government 's choice to ally with the Rebel cylon fleet .
Though Gaeta has been living in an ethical gray area for a while , many were taken aback by his sudden flare - up of evil .
Advertisement
His transformation , however , represented the culmination of several plot lines stretching all the way back to the Fleet 's encounter with the fascistic Battlestar Pegasus , whose violent , military leader Admiral Cain was a dark foil for Adama .
If you were a dork like me and watched the DVD extras , you 'd have seen a plucky , cute side of the early Gaeta .
In one extra scene , the young tactical officer meets with officers from the Pegasus , who say they can transfer to him all the data on their shipboard computers , including some kind of futuristic mega-Wikipedia that contains all human knowledge .
Gaeta smiles and says , " Hey , do you have any porn ? "
We know that Gaeta served with Adama for a few years before the Cylon attack , and his talent with techie tactics has helped the Fleet out of several scrapes .
He 's also often held the ship 's leadership to a high moral standard , and has a history of acting on his convictions .
He 's the guy who uncovered Tigh and Dualla 's plot to rig the election when Baltar is running against Roslin .
When he refuses to keep quiet about this perversion of democracy , he 's rewarded by new president Baltar with the position of presidential aide .

And that 's when our plucky , idealistic young Gaeta started to go bad .
Baltar decides to bring the Fleet to New Caprica , which is soon occupied by a cylon force .
During the cylon occupation , Gaeta tries his best to retain his strong moral center .
When he discovers that resistance leaders are being executed , he betrays Baltar and begins secretly passing information to resistance leaders .
Without his aid , it 's likely the human resistance would never have succeeded .
But when he returns to the Fleet , after risking his life repeatedly to save it , he 's spit on by the people he saved .
Nobody believes that he was part of the resistance , and Starbuck 's secret court almost has him airlocked .
He 's treated like a pariah , beaten , and nearly killed for a crime he did not commit .
At the last minute , he 's able to prove he was the resistance mole and Starbuck lets him go .
Eventually , his role in the resistance is widely - known and he 's given proper credit by the Fleet .
Even after he 's reintegrated into the fleet , however , he 's still punished .
He loses his leg in a clash between Helo and Starbuck during their search for Earth .
Advertisement
Still , as we learned in the webisodes " Face of the Enemy " that took place between the first and second half of this season , Gaeta has a lot on his conscience that we did n't know about .
When he was working with the resistance on New Caprica , it turns out he developed a romantic relationship with a Number Eight Sharon model cylon whom he thought was helping him to sneak prisoners out of the cylon jail .
But in " Face of the Enemy , " his Number Eight reveals that she was , in fact , killing many of the prisoners he 'd asked her to release .
And then she kills more humans when they are stranded in a space capsule together , arguing that they had to die so he would have enough oxygen to survive .
Worst of all , she blames Gaeta for the deaths of the prisoners back on New Caprica , claiming he suspected what she was doing and had done nothing to stop her .
At that point , it seems that all of the pain Gaeta has endured in his efforts to help the human Fleet comes crashing back into his brain .
He 's lost everything , now .
All the sacrifices he made on New Caprica , and all the horrors he endured when he returned , seem for naught .
Perhaps he really was the evil collaborator that Starbuck believed he was all along .
In a fit of rage , he murders his Number Eight right before the Galactica rescues him .
Advertisement
It is this Gaeta who returns to the Galactica and begins the insurrection as the second half of season 4 begins .
His confidence in his own moral goodness has been shattered , and his one positive relationship with a cylon has turned to terrifying betrayal .
Though he hates Starbuck , he suspects that she may have been right about him after all .
What happens to a person who believes they have been doing good , but then learns they have been collaborating with evil ?
I think we have to regard Gaeta 's actions in " The Oath " in this light .
We know that the once - carefree and idealistic tactical officer has a history of speaking truth to power .
He may not be one of the most powerful people in the Fleet , but he was n't afraid to call shenanigans when Tigh tried to destroy the Fleet 's nascent democracy by rigging the election .
And he also was n't afraid to challenge both Baltar and the occupying cylon fleet 's power by passing intel to the human resistance .
Throughout these trying times , Gaeta has kept himself together by believing that he 's upholding moral principles and protecting the Fleet from abuses of power .
He 's the quintessential little guy who stands up to the Man .
Advertisement
The problem is that when Gaeta challenges the Man , even on legitimate moral grounds , it always makes things worse .
When he challenged the rigged election , he wound up putting the weak and corrupt Baltar into power .
And when he challenged Adama and Lee 's alliance with the cylons - whom he knows from experience cannot be trusted - he allied himself with the power - hungry Zarek .
While Zarek 's intentions may have been good at one point , he long ago became a classic Machiavellian politician who uses people 's idealism to manipulate them .
Unfortunately , the shattered Gaeta falls for Zarek 's manipulation completely .
Gaeta is still an idealist at heart , and he believes that the military 's alliance with the cylons is yet another instance of corruption of power on Galactica .
He 's just discovered that cylon allies may not be what they seem .
He sees the Zarek mutiny as the only way to save the human Fleet from the same fate that met those prisoners on New Caprica , the ones whose lives he trusted to a Number Eight .
Advertisement
If you consider Gaeta 's actions from the perspective of all this history , it makes perfect sense that he tries to save the Fleet by taking out its most powerful members .
And it also , tragically , makes sense that his efforts result in a situation far worse than the one he 's trying to fix .
Instead of saving his human brethren , he turns them against each other .
Instead of saving lives , he destroys them .
It seems that Gaeta is beginning to realize this when Zarek kills an innocent bystander at the beginning of the episode , but at that point it 's too late to turn back .
Zarek has become a new version of Gaeta 's Number Eight - an ally whom he trusts to save humanity , but who is actually bent on violently controlling it .
Advertisement
I think what 's brilliant about " The Oath " is that Gaeta 's perfidy may have the unintended consequence of saving the Fleet , just not in the way he expected .
In the face of his mutiny , many of the characters who have been wallowing in ethical ambiguity suddenly sharpen up and remember their true duties .
Starbuck returns to heroic soldier form when she rescues Lee from mutineers .
Adama and Tigh reaffirm their bromantic love for each other as they fight side - by - side for the freedom of the Fleet - and for peace with the cylons .
Even the tormented Tyrol returns to form , aiding the resistance against Zarek and Gaeta , risking his life to save president Roslin and Baltar .
Indeed , one of the most promising results of Gaeta 's mutiny is the return of Roslin to the role of strong , decisive leader .
She 's been wanting to step down , enjoy her new romance with Adama , and slowly fade away .
But when push comes to shove in " The Oath , " she thinks fast and takes command , guiding Starbuck and Lee to Baltar 's quarters , where she knows Baltar has a secret wireless communications system she can use to entreat the Fleet to resist the mutiny .
Advertisement
She delivers a stirring speech , begging for peace , and forges what I believe will become an important alliance with Baltar .
Even Baltar , the whiny , greasy , morally blank fake religious leader , is redeemed by Gaeta 's mutiny .
In a pinch , he aids the president and Adama , despite their long history of animosity .
And he tries to convince Gaeta to stand down , in a scene that 's taut and moving .
For the first time in his life , Gaeta 's efforts to save the Fleet may have worked .
Just not in the way he intended .
A few weeks ago , I had some problems with iPlurk , an iPhone app for the micro-messaging service Plurk .
My main beef with the app was that the third - party developers who made it failed to capture what makes Plurk unique in its field .
Well , I ’ve got some good news :
Plurk itself has come around and released its own iPhone app today .
The app , dubbed simply “ Plurk , ” bests iPlurk in many ways .
In the main timeline view you can now see the service ’s trademark verbs ( like “ hates ” used in the title ) outlined in their appopriate colors ; you can see which messages in your timeline are unread ; you can easily browse your contacts ; and it even has emoticon hints .
But the major advantage of the app is its price : Free versus $ 1.99 for iPlurk .
Sadly , neither app supports the horizontal timeline view that sets Plurk apart from rivals like Twitter and Identi.ca .
Would n’t it be cool if you got this standard veritcal stream view when you held your iPhone vertical , but it switched to the horizontal layout when you rotated the device ?
I think so .
We ’re starting to see a trend in Apple ’s App Store of third party devolopers rushing to release a product built on a popular service , only to have it bested by the actual service ’s app shortly thereafter .
It recently happened with Reddit and now Plurk .
Unfortunately , many users are spending good money to download the first app before the better one makes it to market .
Hopefully you took my advice and did n’t buy iPlurk .
While it was adequate for those addicted to the service , Plurk ’s actual app is better and free .
Find it here .

Agency director Felipe Munoz Gomez announced his deputy 's resignation
The director of Colombia 's secret police , Felipe Munoz Gomez , says he has the letters of resignation from the entire high command .
As more evidence comes to light of a criminal conspiracy within the force , one deputy director has already gone .
Specialists from the attorney general 's office have moved into the Das headquarters to seize interception equipment and start investigations .
It is still unknown how far the rot goes and how many agents are involved .
What started as allegations that some rogue agents of the Das ( Department of Administrative Security ) could have intercepted the phone calls and e-mails of judges , politicians , government officials and journalists , appear now to be accepted as fact .
The information garnered from their wire taps could have been passed on to criminal elements , drug - traffickers , paramilitaries and even Marxist rebels .
Listening centres
The resignation of Deputy Director for Counter - intelligence Jorge Alberto Lagos has already been accepted - diplomatic speak for his dismissal .
No criminal charges have yet been presented against Mr Lagos , but these have not been ruled out .
The experts from the attorney general 's office have occupied the listening centres of the secret police and are inspecting all equipment and records .
Attorney General Mario Iguaran said that , if necessary , he would shut down all the Das 's wiretapping operations and said that there were indications of what he described as a criminal cartel in the heart of secret police .

A bill that would legalize the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is set for a Monday vote in the New Jersey Senate .
The Senate floor vote comes after the bill was approved by the Senate Health , Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee in December .
Jim Miller , husband of well - known patient / activist the late Cheryl Miller , at CMMNJ press conference introducing Sen .
Scutari 's first medical marijuana bill
The New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act ( SB 119 ) would remove state penalties for the possession , use or cultivation of a small amount of marijuana when a licensed physician recommends it for a debilitating medical condition .
Qualifying medical conditions include chronic pain , cancer , AIDS , multiple sclerosis and Crohn 's disease , among others .
Patients would be issued ID cards in a program run by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services ( DHSS ) .
They would be permitted to grow up to six plants and possess one ounce of marijuana , but not to use their therapeutic marijuana in public or while operating motor vehicles .
Patients would be able to designate a caregiver or treatment center to grow the plants for them , but the caregiver / center must also register with DHSS .
The New Jersey legislature has had medical marijuana legislation before it since 2005 , when Sen. Nick Scutari ( D - Linden ) first introduced a bill .
The bill had hearings in June 2006 and last December , when it passed out of committee on a 6 - 1 vote .
" The bill is very conservative , " said Ken Wolski , RN , executive director of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana - New Jersey .
" No medical marijuana state has a smaller plant limit or possession amount .
Still , it will help a tremendous number of patients here . "
If the bill passes the Senate Monday , it then goes to the Assembly , where it must be approved by the health committee and then the Assembly as a whole .
Gov. Jon Corzine ( D ) has said repeatedly that he supports medical marijuana and would sign a bill that makes it to his desk .
The CAB report was based on people seeking advice in July A typical householder seeking help has no realistic hope of paying off debts in their lifetime , according to Citizens Advice ( CAB ) .
The charity said that people turning to advisers for assistance owed an average of £ 16,971 that would typically take them 93 years to pay off .
The most common reasons for debt were low incomes , over - commitment , illness or disability and job loss , it said .
A new alternative to bankruptcy comes into force in April .
Personal debt is out of control
Working Lunch's Gillian Lacey Solymar
Watch Gillian 's report here These Debt Relief Orders are aimed at people with debts of less than £ 15,000 but without much surplus income or assets to their name .
The CAB said that a third of its debt cases would be eligible for the new relief , but called for fair treatment by lenders and creditors , as well as for more government schemes to help those in debt without them having to go to court .
Debt findings
The CAB report studied the finances of 1,407 people in England and Wales who visited the charity for help with debt problems in July 2008 .
FORMS OF INSOLVENCY
Bankruptcy :
The traditional way of escaping overwhelming debt .
Ends after one year , but you are likely to lose all your assets including your house to pay something to the creditors Individual voluntary arrangement ( IVA ) : A deal between you and your creditors , overseen by an insolvency practitioner .
Less stigma , less chance of losing your home , but involves paying some of your debts in one go or over a number of years Debt Relief Orders : Planned for introduction in April 2009 , these should allow consumers with debts of less than £ 15,000 and minimal assets or surplus income to write off debts without a full - blown bankruptcy
One man 's debt fears Insolvency in England and Wales Scots bankruptcy rise predicted Similar studies were carried out in 2001 and 2004 , and the charity claimed that the latest figures - published on Thursday - revealed a " deepening debt crisis " .
The study found that the average CAB client with debt issues owed two - thirds more than seven years earlier .
More than half had debts on priority bills such as mortgage repayments , rent , fuel bills or council tax .
One in 10 had more than 10 credit debts , such as plastic cards , overdrafts or personal loans .
" Low income , combined with irresponsible lending , unreasonable debt collection practices and badly - informed financial decisions are at the root of many of our clients ' debt problems , " said CAB chief executive David Harker .
" For many , there is little prospect of their income increasing or their circumstances changing .
The reality is that they are condemned to a lifetime of poverty overshadowed by an inescapable burden of unpayable debt . "
He added that the majority of these people were poorer than the average householder .
With the data taken in July , he said that further job losses across the country since then were only adding to debt problems .
The findings suggested there were also distinct problems with housing cost , poverty caused by fuel and water bills , and growing numbers of householders with mortgage or secured loan arrears .
Insolvencies up
The latest figures from the Insolvency Service highlight the toll that has been taken on by companies by the rapid lurch into recession .
The latest figures showed the number of corporate insolvencies rose by 220 % in the last three months of 2008 , compared with the same period the year before .
But the number of individuals who were declared insolvent stood at 106,544 in England and Wales in 2008 , which was roughly the same as in 2007 .
A separate survey by credit reference agency Experian 's CreditExpert service , published on Thursday , suggested that one in five people were keeping their money worries secret from their partners .
One in 10 of the 2,000 people asked said they had a secret bank account .

Steve Jobs , the chief executive and co-founder of Apple , announced yesterday that his health problems are " more complex " than he had previously realised and will take a medical leave of absence until the end of June .
The announcement , delivered by email to employees at the Apple campus in Cupertino , California , is likely to feed some of the worst fears of the company 's fans and investors who for weeks have been trying to make sense of conflicting rumours about the health of Mr Jobs , 53 , who was treated for pancreatic cancer in 2004 .
In after - hours trading , shares in Apple , which makes the iPod and iPhone , plunged 10 per cent on the news .
Speculation about the condition of Mr Jobs took off midway through 2008 when his gaunt appearance made clear he was rapidly losing weight .
Just last week , however , he issued a statement saying he had been diagnosed with a rare hormone imbalance problem that was " relatively simple and straightforward " to deal with .

He said last night that the day - to - day running of Apple would pass to its chief operating officer , Tim Cook .
" Unfortunately , the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family , but everyone else at Apple as well , " he wrote .
" In addition , during the past week I have learned that my health - related issues are more complex than I originally thought . "
He added : " In order to take myself out of the limelight and focus on my health , and to allow everyone at Apple to focus on delivering extraordinary products , I have decided to take a medical leave of absence until the end of June . "
Analysts last night were already wondering aloud , however , whether Mr Jobs will ever return .
Why you SHOULD forget your first love :
The memories ' can ruin all your future relationships '
They say that you never forget your first love .
But perhaps you should , because memories of it can wreck your relationships for life , research suggests .
Sociologists found that the euphoria of young love can become an unrealistic benchmark against which all future romances are judged .
Four - year passion : Kate Moss and Johnny Depp
According to the report , the best way to ensure long - term happiness in a relationship is not to fixate on how you fell head over heels the first time .
Those who take a more pragmatic view of what they need from a relationship rather than striving to recreate the intense passion they once shared with an old flame are more likely to have successful long - term partneship , it argues .
The claim comes in Changing Relationships , a collection of research papers edited by Dr Malcolm Brynin , of the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex .
He said : ' Remarkably , it seems that the secret to long - term happiness in a relationship is to skip a first relationship . '
‘ In an ideal world you would wake up already in your second relationship .
If you had a passionate first relationship and allow that feeling to become your benchmark , it becomes inevitable that future , more adult partnerships will seem boring and a disappointment .
‘ The problems start if you try not only to get everything you need for an adult relationship , but also strive for the heights of excitement and intensity you had in your first experience of love .
Unrealistic benchmark : Research claims the intense passion of a first relationship can damage future romances ( posed by models )
' The solution is clear : if you can protect yourself from intense passion in your first relationship , you will be happier in your later relationships . '
It is a message Kate Moss might take on board .
The model met Johnny Depp when she was 21 and they had a four - year romance .
Years later , when asked about the men in her life , she replied : ‘ I just have n’t found anyone I want to spend long periods with .
I do n’t think I ’ve completely got over my relationship with Johnny Depp . ’
The book has provoked fierce debate among academics .
Professor Helen Fisher , an anthropologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey , suggests striving for that initial intensity of emotion can help relationships survive .
Using MRI scans , she observed similar brain activity among those who had been happily married for more than two decades with those who had been in relationships for less than six months .
She said : ‘ I found incontrovertible , physiological evidence that romantic love can last . ’
The book also examines why people pick partners with a similar social background .

Cannabis users have been telling Newsbeat and 1Xtra News that moving the drug back to a Class B substance wo n't make any difference to their smoking habits .
Anyone caught carrying weed could now get five years in jail after the government increased the punishment for possession .
Ministers have pushed through the change because they say there is growing evidence of a risk to mental health .
But the decision was made against the advice of the government 's own panel of independent drug experts .
Change ' pointless '
More than 3,000 people filled in a joint Newsbeat and 1Xtra News online questionnaire on cannabis use .
The smokers who replied overwhelmingly said the upgrade would not force them to cut down .
What damage am I doing sitting at home with a spliff watching TV or playing on my Xbox ?
James , 18
Will the government 's cannabis reclassification work ?
Of the 2,494 people who claimed they used cannabis , 2,229 said it would n't change the amount they smoked .
Only 102 said they would give up or take less after the upgrade .
The results of the questionnaire were based on input from listeners who chose to get involved and are not representative of the UK as a whole .
Many people were angry at the decision to upgrade .
Katie from Manchester said : " It was against the advice of an independent body .
It belittles the idea that some drugs are worse than others .
" It wastes police resources .
It was clearly politically motivated rather than with health interests in mind . "
James , 18 , from Liverpool thought that moving the drug to Class B was " pointless " .

" I smoke weed .
I know it damages my health but it is my health .
What damage am I doing sitting at home with a spliff watching TV or playing on my Xbox ? " he asked .
But some listeners supported the move .
Kim said her mum had been taking cannabis for as long as she could remember .
" She used to be a civilised person but I have watched her decline , becoming more reliant on cannabis to function and deeply depressed and suicidal without it , " she said .
" I can't get her back , but other kids out there may be able to keep their parents from the same incoherent babbling mess if the police would take stronger action . "
" It is n't a waste of their time and should be recognised as a drug with serious , if not immediate , consequences . "
Cannabis strength
Around one in five 16 to 24 - year - olds have taken cannabis in the last year , according to the latest stats from the government .
Of the 2,494 cannabis users who responded to the Newsbeat / 1Xtra News questionnaire , 605 said they spent £ 10 a week on the drug ; 858 spent between £ 10 and £ 30 ; 461 spent between £ 30 and £ 70 ; and 131 spent more than £ 70 a week .
433 of the users said they spent an average of nothing , so could be taking the drug with friends without paying for it .
Cannabis facts Cannabis is back up from a Class C to a Class B drug
One in five 16 to 24 - year - olds have used it in the last year 80 % of the cannabis seized is high strength variety , skunk Cannabis use has dropped by more than a third in 10 years
Read : Cannabis law change comes into force According to official figures , cannabis use has dropped by more than a third over the past decade , although the reasons for such a sharp fall are unclear .
David Nutt , who is in charge of the advisory council , said it could be a result of a drop in tobacco use or a negative reaction to the stronger varieties of cannabis on the market today .
According to the Home Office , 80 % of the cannabis seized by police is now skunk , grown through selective breeding from flowers produced by the female cannabis plant .
Of the 2,494 cannabis users who responded to the Newsbeat / 1Xtra News questionnaire , 1,172 said they smoked the stronger skunk varieties against 599 for traditional herbal or grass and just 186 for resin .
465 people said they either smoked a mixture or did n't know what they were smoking .
As for the source of the drug , 1,716 smokers said they normally bought off friends , 551 from dealers and 39 from a shop or cafe .
190 users said they grew cannabis themselves .
The increased potency of weed over the last decade has led to fresh concerns about its impact on mental health , not just from the government but from a number of charities and support groups .
David Nutt , who chairs the government 's advisory council , told Newsbeat there was growing evidence the drug could be linked to problems like schizophrenia .
But he said the risk to mental health from smoking cannabis was no greater than getting drunk and the drug should remain a Class C substance .
Read more on cannabis and links with mental health Newsbeat / 1Xtra News listener Locan from Belfast said : " I believe that cannabis is not a safe drug , but in my opinion a possible link to schizophrenia is much less serious than the proven link to cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by alcohol . "
But other listeners got in touch to tell us about their experiences .
It seems most of the people who are against the reclassification ... have yet to feel any ill effects
Gary , 29 " From the age of 18 , I used cannabis as a substitute for cigarettes but became very depressed , " said Gary , now 29 .
" I firmly believe that cannabis played a huge part in my mental illness and ruined my life .
" It seems most of the people who are against the reclassification of cannabis are users who have yet to feel any ill effects .
" I can remember when I was exactly the same .
How wrong I was . "
Kirsty from Manchester , herself a former cannabis smoker , said : " I know of at least two people who have been affected in a negative way .
" My belief is that if someone has a propensity to mental health problems , then the use of cannabis can either bring this to the surface or make it a lot worse than it would have been had the person never taken the drug . "
" Like all drugs it affects different people in different ways and education is key . "

" We have offered the customer a £ 100 gesture of goodwill in apology . "
The Asda spokeswoman said the compensation was paid for the delay in dealing with the complaint and added : " We are at a loss to understand how it got there . "
Adrian McKeon , chief executive of Cobra Beer , said : " I 've already spoken with the customer concerned to express my personal disappointment at this regrettable situation .
" My understanding is that there was an item contained in the outer cardboard packaging - which is not tamper - proof .
" I would stress that we have strict quality control procedures in place at our brewing and packaging plants to ensure the millions of products we distribute around the UK and beyond are always in perfect condition . "
I have spent most of the Bush administration 's tenure reporting from Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon , Somalia and other conflicts .
I have been published by most major publications .
I have been interviewed by most major networks and I have even testified before the senate foreign relations committee .
The Bush administration began its tenure with Palestinians being massacred and it ends with Israel committing one of its largest massacres yet in a 60 - year history of occupying Palestinian land .
Bush 's final visit to the country he chose to occupy ended with an educated secular Shiite Iraqi throwing his shoes at him , expressing the feelings of the entire Arab world save its dictators who have imprudently attached themselves to a hated American regime .
Once again , the Israelis bomb the starving and imprisoned population of Gaza .
The world watches the plight of 1.5 million Gazans live on TV and online ; the western media largely justify the Israeli action .
Even some Arab outlets try to equate the Palestinian resistance with the might of the Israeli military machine .
And none of this is a surprise .
The Israelis just concluded a round - the - world public relations campaign to gather support for their assault , even gaining the collaboration of Arab states like Egypt .
The international community is directly guilty for this latest massacre .
Will it remain immune from the wrath of a desperate people ?
So far , there have been large demonstrations in Lebanon , Yemen , Jordan , Egypt , Syria and Iraq .
The people of the Arab world will not forget .
The Palestinians will not forget .
" All that you have done to our people is registered in our notebooks , " as the poet Mahmoud Darwish said .
I have often been asked by policy analysts , policy - makers and those stuck with implementing those policies for my advice on what I think America should do to promote peace or win hearts and minds in the Muslim world .
It too often feels futile , because such a revolution in American policy would be required that only a true revolution in the American government could bring about the needed changes .
An American journal once asked me to contribute an essay to a discussion on whether terrorism or attacks against civilians could ever be justified .
My answer was that an American journal should not be asking whether attacks on civilians can ever be justified .
This is a question for the weak , for the Native Americans in the past , for the Jews in Nazi Germany , for the Palestinians today , to ask themselves .
Terrorism is a normative term and not a descriptive concept .
An empty word that means everything and nothing , it is used to describe what the Other does , not what we do .
The powerful – whether Israel , America , Russia or China – will always describe their victims ' struggle as terrorism , but the destruction of Chechnya , the ethnic cleansing of Palestine , the slow slaughter of the remaining Palestinians , the American occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan – with the tens of thousands of civilians it has killed … these will never earn the title of terrorism , though civilians were the target and terrorising them was the purpose .
Counterinsurgency , now popular again among in the Pentagon , is another way of saying the suppression of national liberation struggles .
Terror and intimidation are as essential to it as is winning hearts and minds .
Normative rules are determined by power relations .
Those with power determine what is legal and illegal .
They besiege the weak in legal prohibitions to prevent the weak from resisting .
For the weak to resist is illegal by definition .
Concepts like terrorism are invented and used normatively as if a neutral court had produced them , instead of the oppressors .
The danger in this excessive use of legality actually undermines legality , diminishing the credibility of international institutions such as the United Nations .
It becomes apparent that the powerful , those who make the rules , insist on legality merely to preserve the power relations that serve them or to maintain their occupation and colonialism .
Attacking civilians is the last , most desperate and basic method of resistance when confronting overwhelming odds and imminent eradication .
The Palestinians do not attack Israeli civilians with the expectation that they will destroy Israel .
The land of Palestine is being stolen day after day ; the Palestinian people is being eradicated day after day .
As a result , they respond in whatever way they can to apply pressure on Israel .
Colonial powers use civilians strategically , settling them to claim land and dispossess the native population , be they Indians in North America or Palestinians in what is now Israel and the Occupied Territories .
When the native population sees that there is an irreversible dynamic that is taking away their land and identity with the support of an overwhelming power , then they are forced to resort to whatever methods of resistance they can .
Not long ago , 19 - year - old Qassem al - Mughrabi , a Palestinian man from Jerusalem drove his car into a group of soldiers at an intersection .
" The terrorist " , as the Israeli newspaper Haaretz called him , was shot and killed .
In two separate incidents last July , Palestinians from Jerusalem also used vehicles to attack Israelis .
The attackers were not part of an organisation .
Although those Palestinian men were also killed , senior Israeli officials called for their homes to be demolished .
In a separate incident , Haaretz reported that a Palestinian woman blinded an Israeli soldier in one eye when she threw acid n his face .
" The terrorist was arrested by security forces , " the paper said .
An occupied citizen attacks an occupying soldier , and she is the terrorist ?
In September , Bush spoke at the United Nations .
No cause could justify the deliberate taking of human life , he said .
Yet the US has killed thousands of civilians in airstrikes on populated areas .
When you drop bombs on populated areas knowing there will be some " collateral " civilian damage , but accepting it as worth it , then it is deliberate .
When you impose sanctions , as the US did on Saddam era Iraq , that kill hundreds of thousands , and then say their deaths were worth it , as secretary of state Albright did , then you are deliberately killing people for a political goal .
When you seek to " shock and awe " , as president Bush did , when he bombed Iraq , you are engaging in terrorism .
Just as the traditional American cowboy film presented white Americans under siege , with Indians as the aggressors , which was the opposite of reality , so , too , have Palestinians become the aggressors and not the victims .
Beginning in 1948 , 750,000 Palestinians were deliberately cleansed and expelled from their homes , and hundreds of their villages were destroyed , and their land was settled by colonists , who went on to deny their very existence and wage a 60 - year war against the remaining natives and the national liberation movements the Palestinians established around the world .
Every day , more of Palestine is stolen , more Palestinians are killed .
To call oneself an Israeli Zionist is to engage in the dispossession of entire people .
It is not that , qua Palestinians , they have the right to use any means necessary , it is because they are weak .
The weak have much less power than the strong , and can do much less damage .
The Palestinians would not have ever bombed cafes or used home - made missiles if they had tanks and airplanes .
It is only in the current context that their actions are justified , and there are obvious limits .
It is impossible to make a universal ethical claim or establish a Kantian principle justifying any act to resist colonialism or domination by overwhelming power .
And there are other questions I have trouble answering .
Can an Iraqi be justified in attacking the United States ?
After all , his country was attacked without provocation , and destroyed , with millions of refugees created , hundreds of thousands of dead .
And this , after 12 years of bombings and sanctions , which killed many and destroyed the lives of many others .
I could argue that all Americans are benefiting from their country 's exploits without having to pay the price , and that , in today 's world , the imperial machine is not merely the military but a military - civilian network .
And I could also say that Americans elected the Bush administration twice and elected representatives who did nothing to stop the war , and the American people themselves did nothing .
From the perspective of an American , or an Israeli , or other powerful aggressors , if you are strong , everything you do is justifiable , and nothing the weak do is legitimate .
It 's merely a question of what side you choose : the side of the strong or the side of the weak .
Israel and its allies in the west and in Arab regimes such as Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia have managed to corrupt the PLO leadership , to suborn them with the promise of power at the expense of liberty for their people , creating a first – a liberation movement that collaborated with the occupier .
Israeli elections are coming up and , as usual , these elections are accompanied by war to bolster the candidates .
You can not be prime minister of Israel without enough Arab blood on your hands .
An Israeli general has threatened to set Gaza back decades , just as they threatened to set Lebanon back decades in 2006 .
As if strangling Gaza and denying its people fuel , power or food had not set it back decades already .
The democratically elected Hamas government was targeted for destruction from the day it won the elections in 2006 .
The world told the Palestinians that they cannot have democracy , as if the goal was to radicalise them further and as if that would not have a consequence .
Israel claims it is targeting Hamas 's military forces .
This is not true .
It is targeting Palestinian police forces and killing them , including some such as the chief of police , Tawfiq Jaber , who was actually a former Fatah official who stayed on in his post after Hamas took control of Gaza .
What will happen to a society with no security forces ?
What do the Israelis expect to happen when forces more radical than Hamas gain power ?
A Zionist Israel is not a viable long - term project and Israeli settlements , land expropriation and separation barriers have long since made a two state solution impossible .
There can be only one state in historic Palestine .
In coming decades , Israelis will be confronted with two options .
Will they peacefully transition towards an equal society , where Palestinians are given the same rights , à la post - apartheid South Africa ?
Or will they continue to view democracy as a threat ?
If so , one of the peoples will be forced to leave .
Colonialism has only worked when most of the natives have been exterminated .
But often , as in occupied Algeria , it is the settlers who flee .
Eventually , the Palestinians will not be willing to compromise and seek one state for both people .
Does the world want to further radicalise them ?
Do not be deceived : the persistence of the Palestine problem is the main motive for every anti-American militant in the Arab world and beyond .
But now the Bush administration has added Iraq and Afghanistan as additional grievances .
America has lost its influence on the Arab masses , even if it can still apply pressure on Arab regimes .
But reformists and elites in the Arab world want nothing to do with America .
A failed American administration departs , the promise of a Palestinian state a lie , as more Palestinians are murdered .
A new president comes to power , but the people of the Middle East have too much bitter experience of US administrations to have any hope for change .
President - elect Obama , Vice President - elect Biden and incoming secretary of state Hillary Clinton have not demonstrated that their view of the Middle East is at all different from previous administrations .
As the world prepares to celebrate a new year , how long before it is once again made to feel the pain of those whose oppression it either ignores or supports ?
Yesterday morning , my son and I were in the bathroom cleaning .
I noticed that we were almost out of toilet paper .
My son went to retrieve some ( he may only be three years old , but he knows how to change the toilet paper roll !
I ’m so proud . ) and while he was getting the paper , I quickly used the toilet , using the remaining toilet paper – about nine squares of it or so .
When my son came back , he saw that the toilet paper roll was now empty and he actually admonished me about it .
“ You used all of that toilet paper , Dad ?
I only use one piece . ”
We washed our hands ( since we were done in the bathroom ) and joked about how much paper I had used , but after a bit , I began to think more carefully about his comment .
Did I really need to use that much toilet paper ?
So I tried a little experiment for the day .
Whenever I went to use something of varying quantity – salt , toothpaste , pepper , salsa – I strove to try to figure out the minimum amount that I could use and still get full enjoyment and utility out of the situation .
Take pepper , for starters .
I will put a large dose of pepper almost reflexively on anything I eat that is n’t sweet .
The pepper grinder is a mainstay on our kitchen table .
Instead of simply grinding away over the soup we had for lunch , though , I tasted it first , added just two grinds of pepper , stirred , tried it again , and found that I liked the taste .
Ordinarily , I would have just ground twelve or fourteen times without thinking about it .
What about toothpaste ?
I usually put a big glob on the brush without thinking about it too much .
Instead , I put just a tiny bit on my brush , spread it over the bristles , and started brushing .
Almost immediately , I had a nice bit of foam in my mouth and my teeth felt wonderfully clean afterwards .
By the end of the day , I was carrying this idea forward into all sorts of avenues .
Instead of getting four or five small squares off of the homemade pizza to start with , why not just get one square , see how I feel after it , then get another one if I still feel hungry ?
Instead of grabbing two or three Kleenexes to blow my nose , why not just grab one and use it until I absolutely can’t use it any more , then get another if I need it ?
What I ’ve found is this : you ’d be shocked how much less you can use during a day without sacrificing any quality .
There are so many disposable and consumable things that we use in our lives , even if we ’re careful about it .
Taking the time to “ reset ” our expectations on how much we have to use can pay great dividends – not only are we directly saving money by consuming less ( and thus not having to replace these consumables as often ) , we ’re also changing our expectations .
You do n’t need more than you need , after all .
OTTAWA–Conservative Senator and former aboriginal leader Patrick Brazeau is suggesting he 's being unfairly targeted for personal attacks by what he calls the " native establishment . "
Speaking on CTV's Question Period , Brazeau insisted he got into native politics in the first place to clean things up and fight corruption .
The 34 - year - old Brazeau was named to the Senate by Prime Minister Stephen Harper in December .
Since then , reports have emerged that he was accused of sexual harassment as head of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples .
He has adamantly denied the charge and says he was cleared by an independent investigation .
There have also been reports of a Health Canada audit that questioned the way the Congress handled federal money , and claims that Brazeau turned a blind eye to drinking on the job by Congress officials .
He says he did nothing wrong and wo n't give up his Senate seat , which he describes as a prefect post to educate parliamentarians about aboriginal issues .
Joan Walsh , the Salon.com political editor who appears often on MSNBC with Chris Matthews , is emblematic , for me , of a type I know all too well : the well - meaning Bay Area liberal .
Her politics exemplify the psychology of our opinion elites who got behind Barack Obama in a big way .
Exuding reasonableness from every pore , she radiates a kind of diffuse benevolence modified only by a slight wrinkling of the brow  a measure of her concern that someone , somewhere , is suffering from an overlooked injustice .
As President Obama takes on the burden of office , and , in the process , sheds his campaign promises like yesterday ’s fashions , it ’s fascinating to observe the reaction of his most ardent supporters , of which it is fair to say Ms. Walsh is one .
In a recent review of Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks ’ recent tome , The Gamble , Walsh suddenly discovers that the “ surge ” in Iraq was a success , and berates herself for ever having opposed it .
General Petraeus , the architect of the Bush administration ’s newly aggressive  albeit “ smart ”  strategy , is portrayed as an heroic innovator , who ignored liberal critics like herself  and MoveOn.org , to whom she delivers a gentle slap for famously calling him “ General Betray - us . ”
Against all these liberal voices , Petraeus , she avers , went on to achieve an “ inspiring ” victory over the forces of Darkness in Iraq .
Walsh contrasts a picture of an “ incompetent ” war , waged by Bushian “ knaves and buffoons , ” to one that deserves admiration if not quite whole - hearted support on account of the men who lead it : Petraeus , retired Gen. Jack Keane , and Gen. Raymond Odierno .
Commander - in - chief Obama goes unmentioned , but you get the idea .
In any case , you have a “ responsibility ” to read the Ricks book , Walsh avers , in order to “ have some of your prejudices challenged . ”
It ’s a “ prejudice , ” you see  not a considered opinion  that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan should never have been launched to begin with , no matter how “ smart ” the strategy employed nor how “ inspiring ” the leadership .
The Petraeus clique , we are told , was “ appalled ” by Abu Ghraib and other abuses , because it widened the insurgency and backfired in our faces : perhaps their objections did n’t quite attain the high moral tone of liberal concerns , but , heck , the result was the same .
In any event , Petraeus and his co-thinkers launched “ their own insurgency , ” says Walsh , to wrest “ control of the disastrous war as it spiraled out of control in 2006 . ”
Heaven forfend that the Americans should lose control of their conquered province  or of anything , for that matter .
Liberal , conservative , left or right , when you ’re talking about America , it really makes no difference 
Yankee arrogance is a well - nigh universal trait no matter where one sits on the political spectrum .
The real clue as to where Walsh ’s sympathies lie is her description of the Brave New Strategy of Petraeus and his confreres :
“ In a near - complete strategic turnaround , surge adherents argued that the way to victory was not killing as many Iraqis as possible but protecting them , building alliances by respecting Iraqi culture and religion . ”
One imagines a contingent of US soldiers showing up in a village and announcing : “ We ’re from the government , and we ’re here to help you ! ”
It is the domestic mantra of the Obama administration transferred to the international scene .
What could make a Bay Area liberal happier ?
Yes , but what about ostensible liberal opposition to the war , and to the interventionist policies of the previous administration ?
Well , that ’s not so important anymore , except to wild - eyed radicals like MoveOn.org :
“ If you were a fan of MoveOn ’s “ General Betray Us ” ad  I was not  you might have a hard time with Ricks ’ high praise for Petraeus ’ counterinsurgency planning and execution .
He does n’t idealize Petraeus , he shows us his ambition and quotes skeptics and critics , but it ’s hard not to come away admiring what the controversial general accomplished in just two years .
I had a harder time with the way Ricks lionized Gen.
Jack Keane and his friends at American Enterprise Institute , the neocon think tank partly responsible for the disastrous Iraq war .
I remember making fun of AEI ’s color - coded , Google - mapped surge sales brochure back in 2006 , as well as its “ neighborhood watch ” approach to pacifying Iraq .
It was tough for me to believe that one set of plans hatched at AEI destroyed Iraq , while another might begin to heal it . ”
MoveOn is dissed as a collection of ill - mannered malcontents , while AEI , the War Party ’s high command , is praised as a bastion of healers .
The mind reels .
Not since the breaking of the Hitler - Stalin pact , and the overnight transformation of America ’s fellow travelers from opponents of war to brazen jingoes , have we seen the likes of this .
According to Walsh , the new policy , spearheaded by Petraeus , is more “ realistic . ”
Gone are the effusive paeans to implanting democracy in the arid Middle Eastern soil , replaced by promises of eventual departure :
“ Ricks thinks Petraeus stated the new goals to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in April 2008 :  We ’re not after Jeffersonian democracy .
We ’re after conditions that would let our soldiers disengage . ' ”
We ’re there so we can leave .
True enough  in Bizarro World .
And here I thought I ’d heard it all .
Although , on second thought , have n’t we heard this somewhere before ?
Ah yes , now I remember : it was during the Vietnam war , when Lyndon Baines Johnson ( and , later , Richard Nixon ) , rationalized the prosecution of a futile conflict waged under false pretenses on the grounds that we had to stabilize the South Vietnamese government as a prelude to drawing down troop levels .
Yes , those were the bad old days when the Democrats were prosecuting an unpopular war , and the President of the United States was daily met with taunts of “ Hey , hey , LBJ  how many kids did you kill today ? ”
Those days , I ’m afraid , seem to have returned , complete with Hubert Humphrey - style liberals of the Joan Walsh mode defending the administration against its Republican critics :
“ Petraeus ’ restraint makes Sen .
John McCain sound deranged when , during the presidential campaign , he promised we were on the verge in Iraq of gaining a strong , stable , democratic ally against terrorism and a strong ally against an aggressive and radical Iran . ' ”
Oh , those wild and crazy Republicans !
The war aims of the new administration are much more modest : occupation lite .
It ’s astonishing how quickly this administration ’s supporters have taken up the cudgels in defending Obama ’s war .
Although perhaps
Walsh did not choose the title of her piece , surely the editors of Salon.com  the quintessential avatars of white - wine - and - brie liberalism  know what they ’re about : “ This war is our war . ”
It sure is , and it ’s amazing how well it suits them  the role of apologists for mass murder and military occupation , that is .
Throughout her article , Walsh keeps insisting she still wants US troops out of Iraq , and disagrees with Ricks ’ conclusion that we must stay until 2015 .
Yet before she ’s done the very concept of withdrawal begins to blur , in her mind , as it will in the minds of countless Obama - ites who will defend this administration til the cows come home :
“ Appraising the difference between my conclusions and Ricks ’ at the end of  The Gamble , ’ I found myself thinking about the old adage , ‘ Where you stand depends on where you sit . ’
Ricks spent a lot of time sitting in ( and courageously running around ) Iraq and American military bases , admiring and respecting the courage and intelligence of the men and women who ’ve turned this mess around as best they can , and he understandably does n’t want their work to be in vain .
I ’m sitting in my office in California , where teachers and other public workers are facing furloughs and layoffs , and poverty , homelessness and crime are on the rise .
So I still want troops out of Iraq as soon as possible .
But reading this well - reported book may have changed even my notion of what that means . ”
Walsh may be for getting out of Iraq , but she considers this a “ prejudice ”  after all , where you stand depends on where you sit .
Everything ’s relative .
Ricks may be right , for all we know .
Why did n’t AEI ’s plan for the surge turn out to be “ healing ” ?
And what does getting out of Iraq really mean , anyway ?
As Walsh puts it : “ A lot depends on the meaning of ‘ leave ’  as well as on the meaning of the term ‘ combat troops . ' ”
When you stop being a journalist , and start being an apologist for the regime , words cease to have any real meaning .
They become a means to evade , not clarify , to flee from truth rather than reveal it .
As Orwell put it :
“ Modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer .
It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else , and making the results presentable by sheer humbug . ”
Sheer humbug is what animates the Joan Walsh Syndrome , an ideological illness that has become pandemic among liberals since inauguration day , 2009 .
While Walsh is crying real tears over those overpaid , under - worked , and all too numerous “ public workers ” who have to take off two days a month without pay , 17,000 American “ public workers ”  the kind that come armed with guns and bombs  are being sent to Afghanistan by the One .
About that she has nothing to say .
Elsewhere in Salon , Walsh defends the Obama administration on another front : its apparent policy of continuing the Bushian ( and Clintonian ) practice of “ rendition , ” i.e. sending “ war on terror ” detainees to a country that will surely subject them to torture .
Obama ’s CIA will also , in certain instances , employ “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” of the sort employed by the KGB and the Gestapo .
Walsh argues that , although the administration has stated what they might do , they have n’t quite done it yet , and so never mind .
This is a variation of the “ give Obama a chance ” argument  after all , he does n’t really mean it .
It is also an indication of how quickly intellectual and moral corruption sets it the moment one becomes a servant of Power .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
If you go to the front page , you ’ll see what looks to be our final appeal to our readers to rescue Antiwar.com from oblivion .
I do n’t have a lot to add to that : it ’s an appeal that clearly speaks for itself .
I would only add that , unlike the suddenly silenced body of liberal “ antiwar ” opinion , we at Antiwar.com have plenty to say about Obama ’s war , and we are determined to say it no matter what the cost .
Antiwar liberals , libertarians , and conservatives whose eyes are beginning to open need to speak out  and make sure the voices of dissent are n’t quelled in the age of Obama , where “ unity ” for its own sake is loudly insisted on .
To heck with “ unity ” : US Out of Iraq and Afghanistan !

Britain faces an energy crisis next month as vital gas reserves run dry , top energy analysts warn .
The unprecedented emergency , which exposes a gaping hole in the country 's energy security , is expected to lead to sharp price increases .
Centrica , which owns British Gas , told The Independent on Sunday late last week that , on present trends , its main reserve would be totally depleted in a little over three weeks .
And though extra gas can be imported from Norway and the Netherlands to make up any shortfall , serious breakdowns have hit pipelines from both countries in the past week .
The crisis reveals an extraordinary failure to plan for the future as supplies of gas from the North Sea have run down , turning Britain into an importer of the fuel .
Though now dependent on overseas supplies , it keeps only about a quarter as much gas in reserves as France , Germany and Italy , making it uniquely vulnerable to shortages and price hikes .

Three - quarters of the country 's reserves are stored by Centrica in an old North Sea gas field , called Rough , some 9,000 ft below the seabed off the East Yorkshire coast .
Surplus fuel is injected into the reservoir in the summer when demand is low , and withdrawn between October and late March .
This year – thanks largely to the cold weather – its gas has been pumped at record rates .
It is now 24 per cent lower than at this time last year , and 49 per cent less than the year before .
Centrica said : " Rough is being drawn down at a very fast rate .
As of now , it would just last 22 days . "
Everything depends on the weather and – though depletion has slowed with milder conditions – the Met Office expects the cold back by the beginning of March .
The crisis is compounded by failures in vital pipelines .
A compressor on the one from the Netherlands broke down a week ago and is expected to be out of action for a long time .
Though the pipeline can still operate with two remaining ones , there is now no safety margin against further failure .
Late last week an electrical failure shut down a pipeline from Norway to Scotland .
Extra gas has been sent down another one that comes ashore in Yorkshire , but again Britain is precariously vulnerable to further interruption .
Craig Lowery , of the EIC energy consultancy , said : " We could see the price of gas rise quite sharply . "
Consultants McKinnon and Clarke , who advise businesses on energy costs , said : " If the contribution from Rough is exhausted before the winter is out then , at best , things will be very tight and subject to price volatility . "
The National Grid said : " We are not really seeing anything to cause us concern " .
But David Hunter of McKinnon and Clarke retorts : " It is the coldest winter in the past 13 years and there is still a month and a half left of the traditional withdrawal period from reserves .
There must be cause for concern . "
Toshiba Corporation today announced the prototype of a new FeRAM -- Ferroelectric Random Access Memory -- that redefines industry benchmarks for density and operating speed .
The new chip realizes storage of 128 - megabits and read and write speeds of 1.6 - gigabytes a second , the most advanced combination of performance and density yet achieved .
Full details of the new FeRAM will be presented this week at the International Solid - State Circuits Conference 2009 ( ISSCC2009 ) in San Francisco , USA .
The new FeRAM modifies Toshiba 's original chainFeRAMTM architecture , which significantly contributes to chip scaling , with a new architecture that prevents cell signal degradation , the usual tradeoff from chip scaling .
The combination realizes an upscaled FeRAM with a density of 128 - megabit .
Furthermore , a new circuit that predicts and controls the fluctuations of power supply supports high - speed data transfers .
This allowed integration of DDR2 interface to maximize data transfers at a high throughput at low power consumption , realizing read and write speeds of 1.6 gigabytes a second .
In developing the new FeRAM , Toshiba broke its own record of 32 - megabit density and 200 - megabit data transfers , pushing performance to eight times faster than the transfer rate and density of the previous records and the fastest speed of any non-volatile RAM .
FeRAM combines the fast operating characteristics of DRAM with flash memory 's ability to retain data while powered off , attributes that continue to attract the attention of the semiconductor industry .
Toshiba is going to continue R&D in FeRAM , aiming for further capacity increases and eventual use in a wide range of applications , including the main memory of mobile phones , mobile consumer products , and cache memory applications in products such as mobile PCs and SSDs .
Outline of New Technology
ChainFeRAMTM in the earlier generation of 64 - megabit FeRAM employed a data - line design in which neighboring data - lines operated in sequence : one is off when the other is on .
This allowed off lines to provide a noise barrier between on lines , contributing to chip scaling and fine performance .
Previous chain architecture collected four data - lines but Toshiba has successfully increased the number of data - lines to eight , which led to a decrease in the total chip area .
Chip scaling causes signal degradation as the stored polarization of memory cell gets smaller .
By shortening the data - line pitch and using chain architecture to decrease the number of memory cells connecting to sense amplifiers , Toshiba maintained the same cell signal level without any chip area penalty .
Furthermore , improvement of the sensing technique reduced the parasitic capacitance and realized a reading signal of 200 mV , sufficient for practical application .
A circuit that can predict power fluctuation during read / write and control the power supply is newly added .
This new circuit rapidly realizes the voltage required for read and write , allowing the new FeRAM to add a DDR2 interface and opening the way to practical use .

For an all - natural brain boost , skip the pills and hit the colors .
In the latest and most authoritative study on color 's cognitive effects , test subjects given attention - demanding tasks did best when primed with the color red .
Asked to be creative , they responded best to blue .
" Color enhances performance , " said study co-author Juliet Zhu , a University of British Columbia psychologist .
Previous research on red's effects on the brain have found that it attracts people to food and can enhance sexual arousal .
But research on the color 's cognitive effects have been mixed : Studies have linked red to cognitive impairment on IQ tests , telemarketing pitches and analytical problem - solving , but also to improvements on low - demand tasks and clerical work .
The latest findings tip the balance toward the red- as - brain - booster results and fits with work that showed a link between the color and arousal of neurobiological awareness and vigilance .
" Think about red , and what comes to mind : stop lights , stop signs , danger , ambulances , " said Zhu .
" People want to avoid those things , and that 's why they do better on detail - oriented tasks . "
While earlier studies tended not to test creativity , Zhu 's findings provide a plausible explanation for blue 's apparent role .
" Blue is the color of the sky , the ocean , safety , " she said .
" When their environment is safe , people are more explorative . "
Zhu 's study , published Thursday in * Science * , started with tests designed to measure avoidance and attraction .
Students vigilantly avoided red and were strongly attracted to blue .
Blue linked to higher scores on subsequent tests of creativity , and red with better performance on memory tests .
State University of New York at Albany psychologist Ronald Friedman , co-author of a study that found red-linked drops on IQtests , called the findings " quite remarkable . "
Stony Brook University psychologist Markus Meier , also a co-author on Friedman 's study , called Zhu 's study " a great paper , " one that underscores the unappreciated importance of color .
" Colors are everywhere in our lives , " said Meier .
" We should use them more carefully in all settings . "
To test alternative explanations for the findings , Zhu's team showed that neither red nor blue influenced mood .
Test subjects also spent the same amount of time on their tasks , suggesting that neither color affected their motivation .
The colors appeared to enhance performance , but not to impair it .
Red - and white - primed students had similar creativity scores , while blue - and white - primed students were equal on attention tasks .
Asked about the implications ,
Zhu suggested that people engaged in creative tasks surround themselves with blue , and with red when trying to focus .
" In our university , some professors use different color sheets for different groups during exams , " said Meier .
" Using them in an unthinking way could produce bad results for some students , and good for others . "
Zhu is now studying the effects of red on other types of tasks .
It 's possible , given the other effects provoked by red — interest in food and sex — that it will have different effects in other contexts .
" The science has been focused on the cognitive domain , " she said .
" But maybe in the physical domain , like sports , red can be associated with a different meanings , like power or enthusiasm .
That 's what we 're doing now . "

Once you ’ve created your data models , Django automatically gives you a database - abstraction API that lets you create , retrieve , update and delete objects .
This document explains how to use this API .
Refer to the data model reference for full details of all the various model lookup options .
Throughout this guide ( and in the reference ) , we ’ll refer to the following models , which comprise a Weblog application :
To create and save an object in a single step , use the create ( ) method .
save ( ) takes a number of advanced options not described here .
See the documentation for save ( ) for complete details .
This performs an INSERT SQL statement behind the scenes .
Django does n’t hit the database until you explicitly call save ( ) .
To create an object , instantiate it using keyword arguments to the model class , then call save ( ) to save it to the database .
To represent database - table data in Python objects , Django uses an intuitive system : A model class represents a database table , and an instance of that class represents a particular record in the database table .
Django will complain if you try to assign or add an object of the wrong type .
To add multiple records to a ManyToManyField in one go , include multiple arguments in the call to add ( ) , like this :
Updating a ManyToManyField works a little differently – use the add ( ) method on the field to add a record to the relation .
This example adds the Author instance joe to the entry object :
Updating a ForeignKey field works exactly the same way as saving a normal field – assign an object of the right type to the field in question .
This example updates the blog attribute of an Entry instance entry , assuming appropriate instances of Entry and Blog are already saved to the database ( so we can retrieve them below ) :
This performs an UPDATE SQL statement behind the scenes .
Django does n’t hit the database until you explicitly call save ( ) .
Given a
Blog instance b5 that has already been saved to the database , this example changes its name and updates its record in the database :
To save changes to an object that ’s already in the database , use save ( ) .
Retrieving objects ¶
To retrieve objects from your database , construct a QuerySet via a Manager on your model class .
A QuerySet represents a collection of objects from your database .
It can have zero , one or many filters .
Filters narrow down the query results based on the given parameters .
In SQL terms , a QuerySet equates to a SELECT statement , and a filter is a limiting clause such as WHERE or LIMIT .
You get a QuerySet by using your model ’s Manager .
Each model has at least one Manager , and it ’s called objects by default .
Access it directly via the model class , like so :
>>>
Blog .
objects < django.db.models.manager .
Manager object at ...> >>> b = Blog ( name = ' Foo ' , tagline = ' Bar ' ) >>> b . objects Traceback : ... AttributeError : " Manager is n't accessible via Blog instances . "
Note Managers are accessible only via model classes , rather than from model instances , to enforce a separation between “ table - level ” operations and “ record - level ” operations .
The Manager is the main source of QuerySets for a model .
For example , Blog.objects.all ( ) returns a QuerySet that contains all Blog objects in the database .
Retrieving all objects ¶
The simplest way to retrieve objects from a table is to get all of them .
To do this , use the all ( ) method on a Manager : >>> all_entries = Entry . objects . all () The all ( ) method returns a QuerySet of all the objects in the database .
Retrieving specific objects with filters ¶
The QuerySet returned by all ( ) describes all objects in the database table .
Usually , though , you ’ll need to select only a subset of the complete set of objects .
To create such a subset , you refine the initial QuerySet , adding filter conditions .
The two most common ways to refine a QuerySet are : filter ( ** kwargs ) Returns a new QuerySet containing objects that match the given lookup parameters .
exclude ( ** kwargs )
Returns a new QuerySet containing objects that do not match the given lookup parameters .
The lookup parameters ( ** kwargs in the above function definitions ) should be in the format described in Field lookups below .
For example , to get a QuerySet of blog entries from the year 2006 , use filter ( ) like so : Entry .
objects .
filter ( pub_date__year = 2006 )
With the default manager class , it is the same as : Entry .
objects . all ( ) . filter ( pub_date__year = 2006 )
Chaining filters ¶
The result of refining a QuerySet is itself a QuerySet , so it ’s possible to chain refinements together .
For example : >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( ... headline__startswith = ' What ' ... ) . exclude ( ... pub_date__gte = datetime . date . today ( ) ... ) . filter ( ... pub_date__gte = datetime .
date ( 2005 , 1 , 30 ) ... )
This takes the initial QuerySet of all entries in the database , adds a filter , then an exclusion , then another filter .
The final result is a QuerySet containing all entries with a headline that starts with “ What ” , that were published between January 30 , 2005 , and the current day .
Filtered QuerySet s are unique ¶ Each time you refine a QuerySet , you get a brand - new QuerySet that is in no way bound to the previous QuerySet .
Each refinement creates a separate and distinct QuerySet that can be stored , used and reused .
Example : >>> q1 = Entry . objects .
filter ( headline__startswith = " What " ) >>> q2 = q1 . exclude ( pub_date__gte = datetime . date . today ( ) ) >>> q3 = q1 . filter ( pub_date__gte = datetime .
date . today ( ) )
These three QuerySets are separate .
The first is a base QuerySet containing all entries that contain a headline starting with “ What ” .
The second is a subset of the first , with an additional criteria that excludes records whose pub_date is today or in the future .
The third is a subset of the first , with an additional criteria that selects only the records whose pub_date is today or in the future .
The initial QuerySet ( q1 ) is unaffected by the refinement process .
QuerySet s are lazy ¶ QuerySets are lazy – the act of creating a QuerySet does n’t involve any database activity .
You can stack filters together all day long , and Django wo n’t actually run the query until the QuerySet is evaluated .
Take a look at this example : >>> q = Entry . objects .
filter ( headline__startswith = " What " ) >>> q = q . filter ( pub_date__lte = datetime .
date . today ( ) ) >>> q = q . exclude ( body_text__icontains = " food " ) >>> print ( q )
Though this looks like three database hits , in fact it hits the database only once , at the last line ( print ( q ) ) .
In general , the results of a QuerySet are n’t fetched from the database until you “ ask ” for them .
When you do , the QuerySet is evaluated by accessing the database .
For more details on exactly when evaluation takes place , see When QuerySets are evaluated .
Retrieving a single object with get ( ) ¶ filter ( ) will always give you a QuerySet , even if only a single object matches the query - in this case , it will be a QuerySet containing a single element .
If you know there is only one object that matches your query , you can use the get ( ) method on a Manager which returns the object directly : >>> one_entry = Entry . objects .
get ( pk = 1 ) You can use any query expression with get ( ) , just like with filter ( ) - again , see Field lookups below .
Note that there is a difference between using get ( ) , and using filter ( ) with a slice of [ 0 ] .
If there are no results that match the query , get ( ) will raise a DoesNotExist exception .
This exception is an attribute of the model class that the query is being performed on - so in the code above , if there is no Entry object with a primary key of 1 , Django will raise Entry .
DoesNotExist .
Similarly , Django will complain if more than one item matches the get ( ) query .
In this case , it will raise MultipleObjectsReturned , which again is an attribute of the model class itself .
Other QuerySet methods ¶
Most of the time you ’ll use all ( ) , get ( ) , filter ( ) and exclude ( ) when you need to look up objects from the database .
However , that ’s far from all there is ; see the QuerySet API Reference for a complete list of all the various QuerySet methods .
Limiting QuerySet s¶ Use a subset of Python ’s array - slicing syntax to limit your QuerySet to a certain number of results .
This is the equivalent of SQL ’s LIMIT and OFFSET clauses .
For example , this returns the first 5 objects ( LIMIT 5 ) : >>>
Entry . objects . all ( ) [ : 5 ]
This returns the sixth through tenth objects ( OFFSET 5 LIMIT 5 ) : >>>
Entry . objects . all ( ) [ 5 : 10 ] Negative indexing ( i.e. Entry.objects.all ( ) [ - 1 ] ) is not supported .
Generally , slicing a QuerySet returns a new QuerySet – it does n’t evaluate the query .
An exception is if you use the “ step ” parameter of Python slice syntax .
For example , this would actually execute the query in order to return a list of every second object of the first 10 : >>>
Entry . objects . all ( ) [ : 10 : 2 ]
Further filtering or ordering of a sliced queryset is prohibited due to the ambiguous nature of how that might work .
To retrieve a single object rather than a list ( e.g. SELECT foo FROM bar LIMIT 1 ) , use an index instead of a slice .
For example , this returns the first Entry in the database , after ordering entries alphabetically by headline : >>>
Entry . objects .
order_by ( ' headline ' ) [ 0 ]
This is roughly equivalent to : >>>
Entry . objects .
order_by ( ' headline ' ) [ 0 : 1 ] . get ()
Note , however , that the first of these will raise IndexError while the second will raise DoesNotExist if no objects match the given criteria .
See get ( ) for more details .
Field lookups ¶
Field lookups are how you specify the meat of an SQL WHERE clause .
They ’re specified as keyword arguments to the QuerySet methods filter ( ) , exclude ( ) and get ( ) .
Basic lookups keyword arguments take the form field__lookuptype=value .
( That ’s a double - underscore ) .
For example : >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( pub_date__lte = ' 2006-01-01 ' ) translates ( roughly ) into the following SQL : SELECT * FROM blog_entry WHERE pub_date <= ' 2006-01-01 ' ;
How this is possible Python has the ability to define functions that accept arbitrary name - value arguments whose names and values are evaluated at runtime .
For more information , see Keyword Arguments in the official Python tutorial .
The field specified in a lookup has to be the name of a model field .
There ’s one exception though , in case of a ForeignKey you can specify the field name suffixed with _id .
In this case , the value parameter is expected to contain the raw value of the foreign model ’s primary key .
For example : >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( blog_id = 4 ) If you pass an invalid keyword argument , a lookup function will raise TypeError .
The database API supports about two dozen lookup types ; a complete reference can be found in the field lookup reference .
To give you a taste of what ’s available , here ’s some of the more common lookups you ’ll probably use : exact An “ exact ” match .
For example : >>>
Entry .
objects .
get ( headline__exact = " Cat bites dog " )
Would generate SQL along these lines : SELECT ... WHERE headline = ' Cat bites dog ' ;
If you do n’t provide a lookup type – that is , if your keyword argument does n’t contain a double underscore – the lookup type is assumed to be exact .
For example , the following two statements are equivalent : >>>
Blog .
objects .
get ( id__exact = 14 ) # Explicit form >>>
Blog .
objects .
get ( id = 14 ) # __exact is implied
This is for convenience , because exact lookups are the common case .
iexact A case - insensitive match .
So , the query : >>>
Blog .
objects .
get ( name__iexact = " beatles blog " )
Would match a Blog titled " Beatles Blog " , " beatles blog " , or even " BeAtlES blOG " . contains Case - sensitive containment test .
For example : Entry .
objects .
get ( headline__contains = ' Lennon ' )
Roughly translates to this SQL : SELECT ... WHERE headline LIKE '% Lennon % ' ;
Note this will match the headline ' Today Lennon honored ' but not ' today lennon honored ' .
There ’s also a case - insensitive version , icontains .
startswith , endswith Starts - with and ends - with search , respectively .
There are also case - insensitive versions called istartswith and iendswith .
Again , this only scratches the surface .
A complete reference can be found in the field lookup reference .
Lookups that span relationships ¶
Django offers a powerful and intuitive way to “ follow ” relationships in lookups , taking care of the SQL JOIN s for you automatically , behind the scenes .
To span a relationship , use the field name of related fields across models , separated by double underscores , until you get to the field you want .
This example retrieves all Entry objects with a Blog whose name is ' Beatles Blog ' : >>>
Entry .
objects . filter ( blog__name = ' Beatles Blog ' )
This spanning can be as deep as you ’d like .
It works backwards , too .
While it can be customized , by default you refer to a “ reverse ” relationship in a lookup using the lowercase name of the model .
This example retrieves all Blog objects which have at least one Entry whose headline contains ' Lennon ' : >>>
Blog .
objects .
filter ( entry__headline__contains = ' Lennon ' )
If you are filtering across multiple relationships and one of the intermediate models does n’t have a value that meets the filter condition , Django will treat it as if there is an empty ( all values are NULL ) , but valid , object there .
All this means is that no error will be raised .
For example , in this filter : Blog .
objects .
filter ( entry__authors__name = ' Lennon ' ) ( if there was a related Author model ) , if there was no author associated with an entry , it would be treated as if there was also no name attached , rather than raising an error because of the missing author .
Usually this is exactly what you want to have happen .
The only case where it might be confusing is if you are using isnull .
Thus : Blog .
objects .
filter ( entry__authors__name__isnull = True ) will return
Blog objects that have an empty name on the author and also those which have an empty author on the entry .
If you do n’t want those latter objects , you could write : Blog . objects .
filter ( entry__authors__isnull = False , entry__authors__name__isnull = True )
Spanning multi-valued relationships ¶
When you are filtering an object based on a ManyToManyField or a reverse ForeignKey , there are two different sorts of filter you may be interested in .
Consider the Blog / Entry relationship ( Blog to Entry is a one - to - many relation ) .
We might be interested in finding blogs that have an entry which has both “ Lennon ” in the headline and was published in 2008 .
Or we might want to find blogs that have an entry with “ Lennon ” in the headline as well as an entry that was published in 2008 .
Since there are multiple entries associated with a single Blog , both of these queries are possible and make sense in some situations .
The same type of situation arises with a ManyToManyField .
For example , if an Entry has a ManyToMany Field called tags , we might want to find entries linked to tags called “ music ” and “ bands ” or we might want an entry that contains a tag with a name of “ music ” and a status of “ public ” .
To handle both of these situations , Django has a consistent way of processing filter ( ) calls .
Everything inside a single filter ( ) call is applied simultaneously to filter out items matching all those requirements .
Successive filter ( ) calls further restrict the set of objects , but for multi-valued relations , they apply to any object linked to the primary model , not necessarily those objects that were selected by an earlier filter ( ) call .
That may sound a bit confusing , so hopefully an example will clarify .
To select all blogs that contain entries with both “ Lennon ” in the headline and that were published in 2008 ( the same entry satisfying both conditions ) , we would write : Blog . objects .
filter ( entry__headline__contains = ' Lennon ' , entry__pub_date__year = 2008 ) To select all blogs that contain an entry with “ Lennon ” in the headline as well as an entry that was published in 2008 , we would write : Blog .
objects .
filter ( entry__headline__contains = ' Lennon ' ) . filter ( entry__pub_date__year = 2008 ) Suppose there is only one blog that had both entries containing “ Lennon ” and entries from 2008 , but that none of the entries from 2008 contained “ Lennon ” .
The first query would not return any blogs , but the second query would return that one blog .
In the second example , the first filter restricts the queryset to all those blogs linked to entries with “ Lennon ” in the headline .
The second filter restricts the set of blogs further to those that are also linked to entries that were published in 2008 .
The entries selected by the second filter may or may not be the same as the entries in the first filter .
We are filtering the Blog items with each filter statement , not the Entry items .
Note The behavior of filter ( ) for queries that span multi-value relationships , as described above , is not implemented equivalently for exclude ( ) .
Instead , the conditions in a single exclude ( ) call will not necessarily refer to the same item .
For example , the following query would exclude blogs that contain both entries with “ Lennon ” in the headline and entries published in 2008 : Blog .
objects .
exclude ( entry__headline__contains = ' Lennon ' , entry__pub_date__year = 2008 , ) However , unlike the behavior when using filter ( ) , this will not limit blogs based on entries that satisfy both conditions .
In order to do that , i.e. to select all blogs that do not contain entries published with “ Lennon ” that were published in 2008 , you need to make two queries : Blog . objects .
exclude ( entry__in = Entry . objects .
filter ( headline__contains = ' Lennon ' , pub_date__year = 2008 , ) , )
Filters can reference fields on the model ¶
In the examples given so far , we have constructed filters that compare the value of a model field with a constant .
But what if you want to compare the value of a model field with another field on the same model ?
Django provides F expressions to allow such comparisons .
Instances of F ( ) act as a reference to a model field within a query .
These references can then be used in query filters to compare the values of two different fields on the same model instance .
For example , to find a list of all blog entries that have had more comments than pingbacks , we construct an F ( ) object to reference the pingback count , and use that F ( ) object in the query : >>> from django.db.models import F >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( number_of_comments__gt = F ( ' number_of_pingbacks ' ) )
Django supports the use of addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , modulo , and power arithmetic with F( ) objects , both with constants and with other F ( ) objects .
To find all the blog entries with more than twice as many comments as pingbacks , we modify the query : >>>
Entry . objects .
filter ( number_of_comments__gt = F ( ' number_of_pingbacks ' ) * 2 ) To find all the entries where the rating of the entry is less than the sum of the pingback count and comment count , we would issue the query : >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( rating__lt = F ( ' number_of_comments ' ) + F ( ' number_of_pingbacks ' ) )
You can also use the double underscore notation to span relationships in an F ( ) object .
An F ( ) object with a double underscore will introduce any joins needed to access the related object .
For example , to retrieve all the entries where the author ’s name is the same as the blog name , we could issue the query : >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( authors__name = F ( ' blog__name ' ) )
For date and date / time fields , you can add or subtract a timedelta object .
The following would return all entries that were modified more than 3 days after they were published : >>> from datetime import timedelta >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( mod_date__gt = F ( ' pub_date ' ) + timedelta ( days = 3 ) )
The F( ) objects support bitwise operations by .bitand ( ) , .bitor( ) , .bitxor ( ) , .bitrightshift( ) , and .bitleftshift ( ) .
For example : >>> F ( ' somefield ' ) . bitand ( 16 ) Oracle Oracle does n’t support bitwise XOR operation .
Changed in Django 3.1 : Support for .bitxor ( ) was added .
The pk lookup shortcut ¶
For convenience , Django provides a pk lookup shortcut , which stands for “ primary key ” .
In the example Blog model , the primary key is the id field , so these three statements are equivalent : >>>
Blog .
objects .
get ( id__exact = 14 ) # Explicit form >>>
Blog .
objects .
get ( id = 14 ) # __exact is implied >>>
Blog .
objects .
get ( pk = 14 ) # pk implies id__exact
The use of pk is n’t limited to __exact queries – any query term can be combined with pk to perform a query on the primary key of a model : # Get blogs entries with id 1 , 4 and 7 >>>
Blog .
objects .
filter ( pk__in = [ 1 , 4 , 7 ] ) #
Get all blog entries with id > 14 >>>
Blog .
objects . filter ( pk__gt = 14 ) pk lookups also work across joins .
For example , these three statements are equivalent : >>>
Entry . objects .
filter ( blog__id__exact = 3 ) # Explicit form >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( blog__id = 3 ) # __exact is implied >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( blog__pk = 3 ) # __pk implies __id__exact
Escaping percent signs and underscores in LIKE statements ¶
The field lookups that equate to LIKE SQL statements ( iexact , contains , icontains , startswith , istartswith , endswith and iendswith ) will automatically escape the two special characters used in LIKE statements – the percent sign and the underscore .
( In a LIKE statement , the percent sign signifies a multiple - character wildcard and the underscore signifies a single - character wildcard . )
This means things should work intuitively , so the abstraction does n’t leak .
For example , to retrieve all the entries that contain a percent sign , use the percent sign as any other character : >>>
Entry .
objects .
filter ( headline__contains = ' %' )
Django takes care of the quoting for you ; the resulting SQL will look something like this : SELECT ... WHERE headline LIKE '%\ % %' ;
Same goes for underscores .
Both percentage signs and underscores are handled for you transparently .

Now , a lawyer has one , and it ’s not encouraging .
Garry Mathiason is 37 - year veteran of Littler Mendelson , a leading employment - law specialist with 800 attorneys and 30,000 clients .
Mr. Mathiason estimates that the firm is consulted on roughly half the layoffs in the U.S .
During the course of a typical workday , in order to track down a problem , I often need to look at logfiles containing xml .
The xml is usually poorly formatted and sometimes it is all on one line , making it very difficult to read .
What would be ideal would be if I could extract the xml I am interested in into a buffer and pretty - print it with very little effort .
The steps would be something like :
create a new buffer called * xml * in another window ( C- x 4 b ) delete anything that exists in that buffer already pretty print the xml into the new buffer
Did I gloss over step 3 ?
That sounds pretty complicated right ?
Well , I can call a simple perl script from emacs .
I ’m pretty pragmatic and I do n’t feel the need to code absolutely everything in emacs - lisp .
# !/usr / bin/ perl use XML :: Twig ; use XML :: Parser ; my $ xml = XML :: Twig->new ( pretty_print => ' indented ' ) ; if ( $ ARGV [ 0 ] ) { $ xml -> parse ( $ ARGV [ 0 ] ) ; } else { $ xml -> parse ( \* STDIN ) ; } $ xml -> print ( ) ;
( defun xml- pretty - print - region ( start end ) ( interactive " r " ) ( let ( ( b ( get - buffer - create " * xml * " ) ) ) ( switch - to - buffer - other - window b ) ( xml- mode ) ( erase - buffer ) ( other - window - 1 ) ( goto - char end ) ( let ( (e ( point - marker ) ) ) ( join - broken - lines start end ) ( call - process - region start e " xml_pretty_print.pl " nil b ) ) ) )
Actually , sgml - mode ( xml - mode is just an alias ) has a method called sgml - pretty - print but firstly I prefer the output from XML :: Twig and secondly it is nice to see how easy emacs makes it to call out to an external process and return the results .
Anyone without perl installed might prefer to replace the external call with a call to ( sgml - pretty - print ... ) .
( defun xml- pretty - print - region ( start end ) ( interactive " r " ) ( let ( ( cb ( current - buffer ) ) ( buf ( get - buffer - create " * xml * " ) ) ) ( set - buffer buf ) ( erase - buffer ) ( set - buffer cb ) ( copy - to - buffer buf start end ) ( switch - to - buffer - other - window buf ) ( xml- mode ) ( join - broken - lines ( point - min ) ( point - max ) ) ( sgml - pretty - print ( point - min ) ( point - max ) ) ( other - window - 1 ) ) )
What is that call to ( join - broken - lines ... ) ?
When I cut and paste from putty it breaks lines at the width of my window .
< ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>< xsl : stylesheet version = " 1.0 " >< xsl : output method = " html " />< xsl : template match = " / " >< H2 > Customer Listing ( in Alternating ro w colors ) </ H2 >< table border = " 1 " >< xsl : for - each select = " / customers / customer " >< tr > < xsl : choose >< xsl : when test = " position ( ) mod 2 = 1 " >< xsl : attribute name = " class " > c lsOdd </ xsl : attribute ></ xsl : when >< xsl : otherwise >< xsl : attribute name = " class " >clsE ven </ xsl : attribute ></ xsl : otherwise ></ xsl : choose >< xsl : for - each select = " @ * " >< td >< xsl:value - of select = " . " /></ td ></ xsl : for -each ></ tr ></ xsl : for -each ></ table >< H3 > To tal Customers < xsl : value - of select = " count( customers / customer ) " /></ H3 ></ xsl : templ ate ></ xsl : stylesheet >
This invalidates the xml so I need to fix this before passing the result to the xml parser .
( defconst cr ( string ?
) ) ( defconst * broken - line - regex * cr ) ( defun join - broken - lines ( start end ) ( interactive " r " ) ( goto - char start ) ( while ( re - search - forward * broken - line - regex * end t ) ( replace - match " " nil nil ) ) )
This is the output from the version which calls ( sgml - pretty - print ... )
< ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < xsl : stylesheet version = " 1.0 " > < xsl : output method = " html " /> < xsl : template match = " / " > < H2 > Customer Listing ( in Alternating row colors ) </ H2 > < table border = " 1 " > < xsl : for - each select = " / customers / customer " > < tr > < xsl : choose > < xsl : when test = " position ( ) mod 2 = 1 " > < xsl : attribute name = " class " > clsOdd </ xsl : attribute > </ xsl : when > < xsl : otherwise > < xsl : attribute name = " class " > clsEven </ xsl : attribute > </ xsl : otherwise > </ xsl : choose > < xsl : for - each select = " @ * " > < td > < xsl : value - of select = " . " /> </ td > </ xsl : for -each > </ tr > </ xsl : for -each > </ table > < H3 > Total Customers < xsl : value - of select = " count( customers / customer ) " /> </ H3 > </ xsl : template > </ xsl : stylesheet >
We probably want a function to handle the common case is where all the xml is on one line with some junk before the xml and some junk afterwards .
E.g .
asdflkjnalkjnasdf < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>< a >< b >c</ b ></ a > xskldfgjnskldf
( defun xml- pretty - print - current ( ) ( interactive ) ( save - excursion ( end - of - line nil ) ( re-search - backward " > " 1 ) ( let ( (e (+ 1 ( point ) ) ) ) ( beginning - of - line nil ) ( re-search - forward " < ?xml [ ^ >] *> " e ) ( xml - pretty - print - region ( point ) e ) ) ) )
And , er , I guess that ’s all I ’ve got to say about that .
Here 's a quick Git pulling & merging tip for those of you learning this awesome Distributed Version Control System .
Git Pull 's Double Duty
As you may be aware , the git pull command actually does two things under the covers .
It does a git fetch to freshen your tracked remote branch and it does a git merge to merge it into the linked local branch .
Sometimes this can go awry if you 've been experimenting with files locally and forgot to return them to a checked - in state .
Git errors out nicely , saying " I do n't know what you want me to do , but I 'm going to be cautious here and just let you tell me exactly how to handle this . "
Error Message
One of the possible error messages you 'll see is :
error : Entry ' myapp/src/main/resources/scripts/launchapp.bat ' not uptodate
Solutions
If your local changes are unimportant to you and you just want to get back in alignment with the remote branch , you have two options to apply depending on the state of your local files .
First , you can reset any tracked files to their last committed state via the following command .
This discards any local changes to any tracked files .
git reset -- hard
Second , you can discard any untracked local files via the git clean command , in the case that they are colliding with files that the remote branch has actually added and is now tracking .
You can purge your repository 's current branch of untracked local files by typing :
git clean -f
And in case you are paranoid about what this will remove , you can get a safe preview of what it would do by typing :
git clean -n
Which outputs a preview list like so :
A friend of mine loves watching movies that star Keanu Reeves .
No matter how bad the plot , no matter how many rotten tomatoes are thrown at the movie because of Keanu ’s wrong - doing , the friend faithfully goes to the movie theater to watch Keanu play the same typecast role that he ’s always played throughout his career .
His dialogue and on - screen emotions rarely match , the depth of the characters he takes on are non-existent and his acting is best described as atrocious .
Still , I can see why you ’d want to watch a Keanu movie .
Despite knowing what the horrifying outcome will be , people love to watch train wrecks .
It ’s a sense of morbid curiosity that drives each of us to ‘ wait out ’ the full 2 hours to see exactly what we knew was going to happen .
So it got me thinking .
What movies starring Keanu Reeves are worth watching ?
Surely he must have acted well in at least one decent movie .
Otherwise , why would any Hollywood movie director choose to cast Keanu ?
The bad news is – there ’s really only one movie worth watching and that was the first of the Matrix series : The Matrix .
One movie may be all there is that ’s worth watching , but there are FOUR – count them with me , 1 ha ha ha , 2 ha ha ha , 3 ha ha ha , 4 ha ha ha bearable movies you could watch if you ever fancy for some really bad Keanu .
So let ’s count them down :
Gunaxin Rank : 5th
Movie : Bill & Ted ’s Excellent Adventure
Notable Actors : Keanu Reeves , Alex Winter , George Carlin
Year : 1989
Worldwide Gross : $ 40,485,039
Bearable Rating : Medium
Moving up the list of bearable movies is Bill & Ted ’s Excellent Adventure .
Keanu , who had been to this point an unknown model / actor was thrown into the spotlight among Hollywood ’s worst actors thanks to this shallow and brain - dead role ( shocking is n’t it !? ) .
Filled with intellectually stimulating lines like , “ whoaaa … ” and “ Rock on , Ted ! ” , Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves star as two teenage dummies Bill and Ted .
They dream together of starting a rock band called the “ Wyld Stallions ” .
Unfortunately , they are on the verge of failing out of school and if they do not pass their upcoming history report , they will be separated as a result of Ted ’s father sending him to military school .
It gets better as comedic legend George Carlin travels from the future into the past using a telephone booth to ensure Bill & Ted pass their history report .
What Bill and Ted do n’t know is that they must stay together to save the future .
So off goes Bill & Ted in the time traveling phone booth to gather up historical figures for their history report .
Gunaxin Rank : 4th
Movie : The Day the Earth Stood Still
Notable Actors : Keanu Reeves , Jennifer Connelly
Year : 2008
Worldwide Gross : $ 224,504,959
Bearable Rating : Low - Medium
As if you could n’t predict what kind of role he ’d play in this movie , Keanu takes on the role of an emotionless ( surprise ! ) alien messenger in human form named Klaatu .
Klaatu has been sent to mother earth to determine if the human race is worth saving or whether him and his alien friends must destroy them in order to save earth from their savagery and destructive ways .
Klaatu befriends Jennifer Connelly , a famed astrobiologist , and is ultimately convinced by her that the humans deserve a chance because it is only at the precipice that one can invoke the change that one knows must happen .
It ’s a bearable film which relied heavily on the visual and sound effects to make up for its incoherent story base .
It ’s also a movie that ’s littered with messages that would invoke tree huggers to unite and wail in a forest .
Gunaxin Rank : 3rd
Movie : Constantine
Notable Actors : Keanu Reeves
Year : 2005
Worldwide Gross : $ 229,976,178
Bearable Rating : Medium
After making some really bad flicks such as The Replacements ( 2000 ) , The Watcher ( 2000 ) , and Sweet November ( 2001 ) ( gag in your mouth yet ? ) , Keanu needed a movie to boost him back into the public spotlight .
He got exactly that by starring as supernatural detective and exorcist John Constantine whose soul is sentenced to hell .
He deports demons to get on good terms with God but God wants self - sacrifice .
Female police detective , Angela Dodson teams up with Constantine to investigate the suicide - like death of her twin sister .
Although not a great movie by most standards , it did gross a good amount of money as people watched in curiosity as to how angels and demons would be interpreted by the Hollywood studios .
Gunaxin Rank : 2nd
Movie : Speed
Notable Actors : Keanu Reeves
Year : 1994
Worldwide Gross : $ 283,200,000
Bearable Rating : Medium - High
The first movie to give Keanu Reeves a gun and some action scenes .
The movie takes place in Los Angeles and focuses on SWAT team explosive expert Jack Traven who tries to arrest an insane bomber & extortionist .
After the bomber escapes , he sets a bomb on a city bus which Traven boards and must keep moving above 50 miles per hour to prevent the bomb from exploding .
The movie stars Keanu Reeves , Dennis Hopper and Sandra Bullock .
Not a bad movie , so I ca n’t slam Keanu .
Gunaxin Rank : 1st
Movie : The Matrix
Notable Actors : Keanu Reeves
Year : 1999
Worldwide Gross : $ 460,279,930
Bearable Rating : High
The 1999 science fiction hit , The Matrix , solidified Keanu Reeves ’s place as an international superstar .
Arguably the best movie Keanu has been in , the movie describes a future in which reality perceived by humans is actually the Matrix : a simulated reality created by machines in order to pacify and subdue the human population while their bodies ’ heat and brain electrical activity are harvested as an energy source by the machines .
The story is an interesting one , but the movie ’s effects are what sold tickets .
From stopping bullets with his hand to an edge of your seat action scene which consisted of Keanu Reeves shooting his way through a heavily guarded building to rescue Laurence Fishburne ( Morpheus ) , The Matrix popularized the use of a visual effect known as “ bullet time ” , which allows the viewer to explore a moment progressing in slow - motion as the camera appears to orbit around the scene at normal speed .
Also , the movie made use of the “ time - slice ” effect in which characters and objects are frozen in time as the camera pans around the scene in a 360 deg fashion .
So there you have it .
From Dud to Stud – the Top 5 movies that you should watch if you fancy some sexy Keanu Reeves time on a rainy and cold weekend .
Kramnik versus Deep Fritz , match game 6
While the reports have not been confirmed , there has been some talk of the Fritz team having employed a clever diversionary tactic in Game Six to unsettle the World Champion , Vladimir Kramnik .
Before the game , programmer Frans Morsch and the notorious – some might say nefarious – Fred Friedel apparently tinkered with the Deep Fritz program , installing the Shakespearean Chatter Files slated to appear with a future release of Fritz .
Morsch thought it would give the computer better odds .
Fred thought it would be funny to see Kramnik turn red and talk to himself .
The conspirators rigged up several speakers around Kramnik ’s chair and set them at volumes low enough that only Kramnik might hear the computer ’s chatter .
That the computer was talking to him doubtless distracted Kramnik ; that Fritz was speaking entirely in Shakespearean verse surely drove Kramnik mad , prompting the questionable , Morphy - esque Knight sacrifice at f7 .
Our reports go on to say that a Bahraini match official managed to extract a full transcript from the Deep Fritz computer after the game .
This transcript he then e-mailed to the chatter - file designer , S. Michael Fisher , in the USA .
In a fit of good conscience , this same Mr. Fisher ( no relation of Bobby Fischer ) then decided to make public the entire sordid affair .
What follows is a copy of that transcript .
Kramnik , Vladimir - Deep Fritz
Brains in Bahrain Match , Game Six 15.10.2002
Fritz : “ Now is it time to arm : come , shall we about it ? ”
The World Champion blinks at this and looks about him .
Convinced he is hearing things , he plays the first move .
1.d4 Nf6
Fritz : “ The game ’s afoot . ”
Kramnik looks under the table .
Not finding anyone there , he stares a while at Mathias Feist , the technician across the table , then continues with the game .
2.c4 e6
Fritz : “ In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off , and now is the whole man governed with one : so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm , let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse ; for it is all the wealth that he hath left , to be known a reasonable creature . ”
At this , Kramnik realizes what ’s going on , but the memory of his humiliating blunder in Game Five must be preventing him from making the infraction known to the arbiter , Enrique Irazoqui .
Fritz technician Mathias Feist is frowning uncomfortably .
Kramnik frowns too , but in anger .
He proceeds to pound out the next few moves .
3.Nf3 b6 4.g3 Ba6 5.b3 Bb4 + 6.Bd2 Be7
Fritz : “ Better do so than tarry and be hang'd . ”
7.Bg2 c6 8.Bc3 d5 9.Ne5
Fritz : “ What sneaking fellow comes yonder ? ”
9 …Nfd7 10.Nxd7
Fritz :
“ Stain to thy countrymen , thou hear 'st thy doom !
Be packing , therefore , thou that wast a knight :
Henceforth we banish thee , on pain of death . ”
10 … Nxd7
Kramnik itches his ear and gives his bodyguard a sidelong look .
11.Nd2 0–0 12.0–0 Rc8 13.a4
Fritz :
“ Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag . ”
Fritz had apparently expected 13.e4 .
After this the position becomes equal .
13 ... Bf6
Fritz :
“ Is this the scourge of France ?
Is this the Kramnik , so much fear 'd abroad
That with his name the mothers still their babes ?
I see report is fabulous and false :
I thought I should have seen some Hercules ,
A second Hector , for his grim aspect ,
And large proportion of his strong - knit limbs .
Alas , this is a child , a silly dwarf !
It can not be this weak and writhled shrimp
Should strike such terror to his enemies . ”
Kramnik , normally not one to be drawn out by such taunts , proceeds to go into a long think .
After a few minutes of this , Fritz disrupts him .
Fritz : “ Why , sir , is this such a piece of study ? ”
At last Kramnik seems to have appropriately assessed the pawn tension in the center and has decided upon his plan .
14.e4
Fritz , however , is not to be unsettled with a few fresh complications .
Its opening book is more than adequate at this point .
Fritz :
“ And now I will unclasp a secret book ,
And to your quick - conceiving discontents
I 'll read you matter deep and dangerous ,
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
As to o'er - walk a current roaring loud
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear . ”
14…c5 15.exd5 cxd4 16.Bb4
Fritz : “ What , the sword and the word ! do you study them both , master parson ? ”
16...Re8
Fritz :
“ Hang out our banners on the outward walls ;
The cry is still ' They come : ' our castle 's strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn : here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up . ”
At this point , Kramnik , while reluctant of making an international scene , particularly after having permitted the chatter to run on this long , wishes the computer would shut up and whispers to the Fritz operator to turn off the bloody chatter feature .
Feist attempts to do so , but Fritz wo n’t have it .
“ I prithee , give no limits to my tongue : I am a king , and privileged to speak . ”
Kramnik frowns all the more now and goes into a much longer think .
Fritz hums a while , whistles the theme from A Midsummer Night ’s Dream , and again interrupts .
Fritz : “ How long shall I be patient ? ”
Upon which Kramnik rises from the board and , escorted by his bodyguard , retreats to the restroom for a respite from Fritz ’s chatter .
While he ’s away , Fritz whispers to the room :
Fritz :
“ Tis now the very witching time of night ,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world : now could I drink hot blood ,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on . ”
Eventually Kramnik returns to the board .
After 41 minutes of thought , he plays the first , seemingly innocuous move of an attack he had been brewing up in his head all this while .
17.Ne4
Fritz is clearly unimpressed .
“ A very good piece of work , I assure you , and a merry . ”
17…exd5 18.Nd6
Fritz :
“ Stand back , Lord Kramnik , stand back , I say ;
By heaven , I think my sword 's as sharp as yours :
I would not have you , lord , forget yourself ,
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence ;
Lest I , by marking of your rage , forget
Your worth , your greatness and nobility . ”
“ If thou but frown on me , or stir thy foot ,
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame ,
I 'll strike thee dead .
Put up thy sword betime ;
Or I 'll so maul you and your toasting - iron ,
That you shall think the devil is come from hell . ”
18…dxc4
Fritz : “ You are a villain ; I jest not : I will make it good how you dare , with what you dare , and when you dare .
Do me right , or I will protest your cowardice . ”
But Kramnik is set on attacking the King and wo n’t be diverted .
He plays the move that resounds around the world , eliciting across the ChessBase chat room the sort of din one might expect had Russia just then been reported to have stormed the city of Toronto in Canada .
19.Nxf7 !?
Fritz : “ Beshrew me , the knight 's in admirable fooling . ”
Deep Fritz contemplates the sacrifice for all of a few seconds before turning up an evaluation of better than – 1.63 to Black ’s advantage .
Fritz : “ These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse . ”
19 …Kxf7
Fritz : “ Hark , the game is roused ! ”
Kramnik slams out the obvious continuation .
20.Bd5 +
Fritz :
“ The sea enraged is not half so deaf ,
Lions more confident , mountains and rocks
More free from motion , no , not Death himself
In moral fury half so peremptory ,
As we to keep this city . ”
20 …Kg6
Fritz : “ Nothing will come of nothing : speak again . ”
21.Qg4 + 21…Bg5
Fritz : “ I say , there is no darkness but ignorance ; in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog . ”
Once again , Kramnik stares at the board for some time .
Fritz :
“ A fearful eye thou hast : where is that blood
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks ?
So foul a sky clears not without a storm :
Pour down thy weather . ”
22.Be4 +
Fritz : “ Stand fast , and wear a castle on thy head ! ”
22…Rxe4 23.Qxe4 +
Fritz : “ Fie on her ! see , how beastly she doth court him ! ”
23 … Kh6 24.h4 Bf6 25 .Bd2 +
Fritz : “ By gar , it is a shallenge : I will cut his troat in dee park ; and I will teach a scurvy jack - a- nape priest to meddle or make .
You may be gone ; it is not good you tarry here .
By gar , I will cut all his two stones ; by gar , he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog . ”
25…g5
Here Kramnik begins talking to himself in Russian .
Fritz : “ Why , uncle , what 's the matter ? ”
26.hxg5 + Bxg5
[ In the commentators ’ room , GM Julian Hodgson claims to have discovered ( with the aid of Fritz , likely ) a possible draw for Kramnik , beginning with 27 .
Qe6 + but requiring that White find about seven difficult only - moves in the time crunch .
Fritz , however , has unearthed the wonderful , even miraculous resource 27 .
Qe6 + Nf6 28.f4 Bh4 !!
Kramnik had missed this in his calculations .
It is , in fact , the only saving move … and a winning move at that , since 29 .
Qh3 c3 30 .
Qxh4 + Nh5 and 29.gxh4 ?
Qg8 +! put Black on top . ]
Kramnik is thinking , thinking , thinking .
The position is n’t looking as good as he had hoped now that he ’s spotted 28 … Bh4 !!
He chews on his fingernails .
If only his King were on g2 !
Fritz :
“ Death , having prey'd upon the outward parts ,
Leaves them invisible , and his siege is now
Against the mind , the which he pricks and wounds
With many legions of strange fantasies . ”
Kramnik whispers something more in Russian .
Is it a draw offer ?
If it is , Fritz wo n’t have it .
Fritz : “ Before we will lay down our just - borne arms ,
We 'll put thee down , ' gainst whom these arms we bear ,
Or add a royal number to the dead ,
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war 's loss
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings . ”
Kramnik decides against the check at e6 and takes a different course .
27 .Qh4 +
Fritz : “ ' Tis nothing but conceit , my gracious lady . ”
27 ...Kg6 28.Qe4 +
Fritz : “ Nothing will come of nothing : speak again . ”
28…Kg7
Fritz :
“ O , 'twas a din to fright a monster 's ear ,
To make an earthquake !
sure , it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions . ”
29.Bxg5
Fritz : “ Shall I lose my parson , my priest , my Sir Hugh ? ”
29 … Qxg5
Fritz : “ But one fiend at a time , I 'll fight their legions o'er . ”
30.Rfe1
Kramnik has nine minutes left on his clock .
Fritz : “ By my troth , I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man . ”
30…cxb3
Fritz : “ Rogue , thou hast lived too long . ”
31.Qxd4 +
Fritz :
“ Think you a little din can daunt mine ears ?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar ?
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat ?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field ,
And heaven 's artillery thunder in the skies ?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud ' larums , neighing steeds , and trumpets ' clang ?
And do you tell me of a woman 's tongue ,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer 's fire ?
Tush , tush ! fear boys with bugs . ”
31…Nf6
Fritz : “ Now you see , sir , how your fooling grows old , and people dislike it . ”
32.a5
Fritz had seen within a millisecond that 32 .
Rab1 was the better move .
Fritz : “ Beshrew my heart , but I pity the man . ”
32…Qd5
Fritz : “ Avaunt , thou hateful villain , get thee gone !
Or away with her to execution ! ”
33.Qxd5 Nxd5
Fritz :
“ Take her away ; for she hath lived too long ,
To fill the world with vicious qualities . ”
Kramnik has to realize at this point that he ’s facing a lost endgame .
There ’s the vague and dreamy hope that maybe Fritz will misplay it somehow ... perhaps leave itself open to a perpetual check ... perhaps find itself forced to give up material in staving off a continued attack …
34.axb6
Fritz :
“ Since brevity is the soul of wit ,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes ,
I will be brief … ”
34…axb6
A pause on all sides .
A hushed silence .
Then …
Fritz : “ Do ye yield , sir ?
or shall I sweat for you ?
if I do sweat , they are the drops of thy lovers , and they weep for thy death : therefore rouse up fear and trembling , and do observance to my mercy . ”
And since 35 .
Rxa6 sees 35 … b2 ! , Kramnik resigns .
He leaves the board .
To no one in particular , Fritz announces through the little speakers :
“ Here once again we sit , once again crown'd ,
And looked upon , I hope , with cheerful eyes . ”
“ We have had pastimes here and pleasant game . ”
And that ’s what really happened .
We thought the world should know .

POZNAN , Poland ( Reuters ) -
An ancient technique of plowing charred plants into the ground to revive soil may also trap greenhouse gases for thousands of years and forestall global warming , scientists said on Friday .

Heating plants such as farm waste or wood in airtight conditions produces a high - carbon substance called biochar , which can store the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and enhance nutrients in the soil .
Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow .
Subsequently storing that carbon in the soil removes the gas from the atmosphere .
“ I feel confident that the ( carbon storage ) time of stable biochar is from high hundreds to a few thousand years , ” said Cornell University ’s Johannes Lehmann , at an event on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in the Polish city of Poznan .
Lehmann estimated that under ambitious scenarios biochar could store 1 billion tons of carbon annually -- equivalent to more than 10 percent of global carbon emissions , which amounted to 8.5 billion tons in 2007 .
Under a conservative scenario the technique could store 0.2 billion tons of carbon annually , he said .
That would still require heating without oxygen -- called pyrolysis -- some 27 percent of global crop waste and plowing this into the soil .
Lehmann cited experiments on 10 farm crops suggesting biochar can also increase yields by up to three times , because the organic matter holds on to nutrients .
The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) said in November that global greenhouse gas emissions were so out of control that avoiding more dangerous levels of climate change depended on creating negative emissions later this century .
The energy adviser to 28 industrialized countries cited biochar as one way of achieving that .
The technique rings alarm bells among some environmentalists worried it could spur deforestation , but its chief problem may be that it is barely proven on a commercial scale .
“ It will remain theoretical without making demonstration plants on the ground , ” Lehmann said .
Soils containing biochar made by Amazon people thousands of years ago still contain up to 70 times more black carbon than surrounding soils and are still higher in nutrients , said Debbie Reed , director of the International Biochar Initiative ( IBI ) .
The IBI was in Poznan to lobby for research funding for biochar .
In Poznan , 187 countries are meeting in ongoing talks to agree a new climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol after 2012 .
They hope to finalize a deal next year .
Lehmann emphasized that the technique was not a substitute for fighting climate change by curbing man-made greenhouse gas emissions , especially carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels .
LONDON , Feb. 1 ( UPI ) --
A top British official says couples who have more than two children create an unbearable burden on the environment .
" I think we will work our way towards a position that says having more than two children is irresponsible , " said Jonathan Porritt , chairman of Britain 's Sustainable Development Commission .

Curbing population growth through contraception and abortion is key to combating climate change , said Porritt , who has two children and argues the government must promote more effective family planning .
Each baby born in Britain will use , during his or her lifetime , an amount of carbon equivalent to 20 acres of old - growth woodland , said the Optimum Population Trust .
Britain 's current population of 61 million people is expected to exceed 70 million by 2028 , while the world 's current population of 6.7 billion people is expected to rise to 9.2 billion by 2050 , reported The Sunday Times of London .
Since its publication in 1985 , sociologist Lenore Weitzman 's
The Divorce Revolution has had a critical role in shaping the national debate on divorce and its economic effects .
In particular , the book 's claim that in the year after divorce women 's standard of living decreased by a whopping 73 percent while men enjoyed an increase of 43 percent caught the attention of pundits , legislators , and judges .
This statistic has become one of the philosophical bases for deciding child custody and property division in divorce cases .
It has also altered public perceptions of men , women , and divorce .
It was cited hundreds of times in news stories , scholarly studies , and law review articles last year , and was regarded so clearly as holy writ that President Clinton cited it too in his budget proposal this year as part of his attack on deadbeat dads .
The only problem with this statistic , in fact , is that it turns out to be wrong .
In June of this year , Richard Peterson of the Social Science Research Council published a study of Weitzman 's 73/42 statistic , which was arrived at using an " income / needs ratio . "
After precisely recreating Weitzman 's study using the data sample and methods outlined in The Divorce Revolution , Peterson reported his findings : Weitzman 's figures were actually the result of a computer transcription error and dramatically overstated the case .
After correcting her errors , Peterson arrived at a 27 percent decrease in standard of living for women and a 10 percent increase for men in the first year after divorce - figures more in line with other studies dealing with this topic .
Because his corrected figures may actually still overstate the inequalities in the economics of divorce , Peterson 's revision of Weitzman 's numbers may ironically continue the distortion of the truth .
As the media slowly begins to use Peterson 's calculations to correct its uncritical acceptance of Weitzman 's 73/42 statistic , it may lose in the shuffle the growing body of scientific and anecdotal evidence indicating that both women and men suffer economically after a divorce .
Amidst the hosannas for Weitzman 's findings that echoed in the nation 's courtrooms , lecture halls , and legislative chambers , a few researchers expressed some doubts about the accuracy of the 73/42 statistic .
Some critics charged that her sample - 228 people who had been divorced in 1977 - 78 - was too small to be representative .
Furthermore , the respondents were all from Los Angeles , an area which has its own unique culture of divorce and divorce laws .
These concerns , however , received little play in the press , and Weitzman refused to let other researchers examine her data set , shielding her research from further scrutiny .
Atlee Stroup , professor emeritus of sociology at the College of Wooster ( Ohio ) , remembers being surprised when the 73/42 statistic first hit the scene in 1985 .
He had been specializing in family sociology since the 1950's and felt that Weitzman 's numbers were too extreme to be accepted at face value .
" A general feeling that this ought to be evaluated very carefully led me to think about doing some kind of study , " Stroup says .
The National Opinion Research Center , a sociological organization affiliated with the University of Chicago , provided Stroup with the data sample he needed to ensure that the study he undertook would avoid Weitzman 's parochialism .
Every year , the Center surveys roughly 1,500 adults , creating a national data sample representative of the major socioeconomic segments of American society .
Along with Gene Pollock , a professor of economics at the College and an expert statistician , Stroup combined the surveys from the years 1983 - 1987 , creating a cumulative data set of close to 7,500 respondents .
Armed with this sizable , national data bank , Stroup and Pollock brought their considerable experience - a combined seven decades of research and teaching - to bear on the question of the economic repercussions of divorce .
They found that women and men , at every socioeconomic level , experience a decline in income after divorce .
According to their data , women in the first year after divorce experience on average a 22 percent decline in family income , with professional women 's family incomes declining the least ( 12 percent ) and unskilled laborers declining the most ( 30 percent ) .
These figures were far less dramatic than Weitzman 's 73 percent , and comparable to , although still lower than , other studies methodologically similar to Weitzman's , which suggested an average 30 percent decrease for women .
When they looked at the status of men , however , Stroup and Pollock uncovered surprising information .
" Keeping in mind the suggestion of Weitzman and others of economic gain by males with divorce , " they wrote , " the results are sharply contrary to expectations . "
Instead of the 42 percent increase reported by Weitzman or the more common 10 percent figure , the data indicated an average 10 percent decrease in income , with professional men experiencing a decline of 8 percent and less - educated workers a drop of 19 percent .
Stroup and Pollock wrote that Weitzman 's " sharp generalization of a 42 percent rise in living standards for males certainly does not hold for our sample . "
More importantly , their findings presented an implicit challenge to the studies which reported lower figures than Weitzman but still agreed with the conventional wisdom that men benefit from divorce .
The findings of Stroup and Pollock , first presented at a conference of the National Council on Family Relations in 1992 , and subsequently published in 1994 as " Economic Consequences of Marital Dissolution " in the Journal of Divorce and Remarriage , initially attracted only a modicum of attention , Weitzman 's claims having by that time achieved a hammerlock on public opinion .
But the results came as no surprise to men who had gone through a divorce ; Pollock says that one editor at the Akron ( OH ) Beacon - Journal commented that he and Stroup had " discovered that water is wet . "
Unfortunately - and equally unsurprising given the politically correct zeitgeist concerning these issues - the observers in academia , government , and the media failed to acknowledge the implications of Stroup 's and Pollock 's research , and the promotion of Weitzman 's 73/42 statistic proceeded apace .
Her figures were cited in over 170 newspaper and magazine articles , 350 social science articles , 250 law review articles , 24 state appellate and supreme court cases , and one U.S. Supreme Court decision .
The American Sociological Association awarded The Divorce Revolution its 1986 Book Award for " Distinguished Contribution to Scholarship . "
Weitzman repeated the statistic when she testified before the U.S. Congress , and legislatures across the nation revisited their divorce laws in response to her claims .
( Weitzman herself takes credit for influencing 14 laws in California alone . )
The attention culminated with the statistic 's appearance in President Clinton 's 1996 budget proposal .
Before long , the 73/42 statistic had for some observers attained the status of received truth .
One enthusiast , for example , wrote in 1991 that the numbers " are far less surprising than is the fact that people have been so surprised by them . "
Weitzman 's numbers had been accepted so totally in media , legal , and social science circles , explains USC sociologist Angela James , that research which conflicted with them was for the most part disregarded .
" It was taken as a given that [ the numbers ] were correct , " she says .
" I think there were some concerns raised on the part of scholars in that area of research , but they did not get nearly as much attention as the statistics themselves .
Almost every article on the subject - and in many related subjects - cited that statistic ... New scholars coming to the arena may not have read the skeptical reviews but they definitely knew of Lenore Weitzman 's book . "
How did this happen ?
How did the 73/42 statistic , so out of line with other scholarships as well as the real - life experiences of divorced men , gain such power in the media , government , and academy for more than a decade ?
The answer was that in the increasingly radicalized atmosphere that characterized the debate over the economics of divorce , the 73/42 statistic had the force of an idea whose time had come .
The disparity it pretended to uncover was so dramatic that it became the perfect media sound - bite , a shocking factoid which after many repetitions seemed to ring true .
Perhaps more importantly , Weitzman 's numbers could be used to promote just about any agenda , further ensuring the statistic 's popularity .
Weitzman herself , for example , said that her study indicated the need for changes within the no-fault system of divorce which by 1986 was in place in 48 states .
Others saw the statistics and recommended scrapping no - fault entirely .
A large number of people , including most feminists , cited the statistic as proof that child support levels needed to be raised in order to equalize post - divorce standards of living , an argument which , according to Maggie Gallagher , author of The Abolition of Marriage , carried significant weight in the press .
" I think the reason [ the 73/42 statistic ] played so broadly was that it was part of this big push to say that there is an easy solution : 'we should increase child support . ' "
Other , more radical feminists , most notably Susan Faludi , disputed Weitzman 's findings , charging that the media 's acceptance of them was evidence of a pervasive anti-feminist " backlash " which threatened to reverse the " gains " made by the women 's movement in the area of divorce law .
Christina Hoff Sommers , professor of philosophy at Clark University and author of Who Stole Feminism ? , explains that although some feminists valued the 73/42 statistic as evidence of patriarchal discrimination against women and others criticized it as a threat to the cause of feminine independence , Weitzman 's findings actually served the same purpose for both camps .
" Lenore Weitzman 's research is used by many groups of feminists to trash men ... no matter what , " she says .
" It 's either ' men are monsters , ' or ' we do n't need them . ' "
Sociologist Atlee Stroup says that the 73/42 statistic also fit society 's preconceptions about divorced men .
" I think that , interestingly , we still have a concept of the carefree man floating around [ after divorce ] - now he does n't have his ' burdens ' and he 's off again .
It 's the idea that men become part of that ' bachelor set ' again , with no responsibilities and a lot of money . "
Stroup 's collaborator Gene Pollock has a simpler explanation : " I think it was a politically correct statistic . "
As horror stories of a 115 percent disparity between men's and women 's post - divorce standard of living made their way through the legislatures and editorial boards of the nation , Weitzman ensured the success of her 73/42 statistic by refusing to allow other researchers access to her data , claiming that she wanted to correct some errors in the master computer file before doing so .
She had every right to do this , at least at first , explains Richard Peterson .
" There are some norms that are generally accepted , " he says .
" If you collect data you have the right to keep it to yourself and not be required to share it with others until you publish from your data . "
But when Weitzman 's data files arrived at the archives of the Murray Research Center at Radcliffe College she had still not made the corrections , and what started as the exercise of her rights as a researcher began to look suspiciously like ten years of stonewalling .
She reserved to herself the right to veto anyone from looking at the material and turned down Peterson 's requests .
It was not until a year and a half had gone by and the National Science Foundation , the organization which had funded Weitzman 's research , threatened to declare her ineligible for federal grants in the future that she finally allowed Peterson to examine the data .
Once given access to the files , Peterson began to recreate Weitzman 's study using exactly the same 228 - person sample and the methods described in The Divorce Revolution .
He found that the information in Weitzman 's computer file in many cases did not match up with the paper records of the original respondent interviews .
" The computer file was supposed to be coded from the paper records , " he says , " but the computer file in fact did not reflect the paper records .
For example , suppose the computer file said a person 's income was $ 27,000 last year , but when I looked at the paper records it turned out that it was $ 37,000 . "
After correcting the data file , Peterson arrived at figures more in line with national studies , with women 's standard of living decreasing by 27 percent in the first year after divorce and men's standard of living increasing by 10 percent .
Peterson 's findings are a welcome improvement over Weitzman 's hyperbolic statistics ; one feels a measure of relief knowing that the nation 's elite will no longer be basing its decisions on a typo .
But even Peterson 's more moderate figures seem out of step with the research done by Stroup and Pollock , not to mention the real life experiences of divorced men across the country , who would likely be surprised to hear that getting divorced improved their standard of living .
The problem seems to lie in the " ratio of income to needs " used by Weitzman , Peterson , and others .
Weitzman asked 114 women and 114 men to report pre- and post - divorce income for both themselves and their spouses , adjusting for alimony and child support payments where applicable .
Then , she compared these figures to each person 's " economic need , " based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' Lower Standard Budget for an urban family of four in 1977 , to arrive at her ratio .
Even as corrected by Peterson , her data was sketchy : income or needs data was missing for 134 of the respondents , and , according to Peterson , the data for family size , age of the household head , oldest child , and other relevant variables was " problematic " with notable " inconsistencies . "
From this admittedly flawed data set , an income / needs ratio was derived , and the results labeled " standard of living . "
Gene Pollock feels that this measure of needs is unreliable .
" I think you can talk about standard of living based on income , " he says , " but when you start talking about income as a ratio to needs , that is a very slippery concept . "
In the real world , standard of living is determined not simply by a ratio of income to needs , but also by a lifetime of economic choices , earnings , investments , and purchases .
An accurate measure of standard of living would necessarily include property owned , savings , houses , furniture , automobiles , the neighborhood one lives in , clothing , and the like , most of which is typically divided between spouses in a divorce settlement .
It seems unlikely that the average man would have a 10 percent higher standard of living after losing half of his marital property , much less a 42 percent increase .
Pollock points out that Weitzman 's income / needs ratio " omits completely any prior assets that people have .
In divorce settlements , so much of the issue is who gets what , and it's not just alimony or child support but also the division of the other assets .
And most of the studies that I 've read have omitted that part . "
Warren Farrell , the San Diego - based author of The Myth of Male Power , agrees with Pollock and adds that Weitzman 's and other studies usually omit several expenses which men face .
" There are five expenses that men have after divorce , typically speaking , that Weitzman just did n't measure , " he says .
These include : mortgage payments on a home they no longer live in , rent on a home or apartment they do live in , child support payments , alimony , and higher percentages of dating expenses .
Says Farrell , " No one that I know has controlled for all five of these variables . "
Pollock feels that using this " measure of needs " as a proxy for standard of living is misleading .
" Years ago people used to say about computers , ' garbage in , garbage out . ' " he says .
" The thing is , you can make [ the income / needs ratio ] sound quantitative by calling it ' standard of living , ' and it will seem like hard and fast numbers you are using because somehow you adjust income for needs .
But you make a strong implicit assumption that your measure of needs is correct .
Even though the bulk of people write it that way , that still does n't make it the right methodology as far as I 'm concerned .
Maybe I 'm just being stubborn , but as a statistician , you do n't quantify something by just arbitrarily deciding how you are going to measure one of the variables . "
For over a decade statistics like Weitzman 's - which suggest that women suffer tragically from divorce while men blithely benefit - have been at the center of the national discussion of divorce and its economic effects .
They have served as what Thomas Sowell calls " aha ! " statistics , appearing to confirm in dramatic fashion the worst expectations about the American social system .
In Weitzman 's case , the 73/42 statistic suggests at bare minimum a jarring unfairness , perhaps even an outright misogyny .
It is easy to see how for radical feminists it would become part of a wish - fulfilling fantasy .
The real power of statistics is cultural , their ability to shape the way society thinks , discusses , and acts .
Peterson has corrected the errors in Weitzman 's study , but has given a veneer of legitimacy to the conclusions which for eleven years decision - makers in the media , academy , and government have drawn from it .
While the 73/42 statistic may have reached the end of its shelf - life , the idea that divorce catapults men into some sort of financial Elysian fields will likely continue to influence public policy and discussion , at least until researchers like Stroup and Pollock - as well as the stories of thousands of divorced men- get the attention they deserve .
While new forests may absorb carbon emissions , he says , they are unlikely to save most endangered rain - forest species , which have no way to reach them .
Everyone , including Dr. Wright , agrees that large - scale rain - forest destruction in the Amazon or Indonesia should be limited or managed .
Rain forests are the world ’s great carbon sinks , absorbing the emissions that humans send into the atmosphere , and providing havens for biodiversity .
At issue is how to tally the costs and benefits of forests , at a time when increasing attention is being paid to global climate management and carbon accounting .
Just last month , at climate talks held by the United Nations in Poznan , Poland , the world ’s environment ministers agreed to a new program through which developing countries will be rewarded for preventing deforestation .
But little is known about the new forests — some of them have never even been mapped — and they were not factored into the equation at the meetings .
Dr. Wright and other scientists say they should be .
About 38 million acres of original rain forest are being cut down every year , but in 2005 , according to the most recent “ State of the World ’s Forests Report ” by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , there were an estimated 2.1 billion acres of potential replacement forest growing in the tropics — an area almost as large as the United States .
The new forest included secondary forest on former farmland and so - called degraded forest , land that has been partly logged or destroyed by natural disasters like fires and then left to nature .
In Panama by the 1990s , the last decade for which data is available , the rain forest is being destroyed at a rate of 1.3 percent each year .
The area of secondary forest is increasing by more than 4 percent yearly , Dr. Wright estimates .
With the heat and rainfall in tropical Panama , new growth is remarkably fast .
Within 15 years , abandoned land can contain trees more than 100 feet high .
Within 20 , a thick rain - forest canopy forms again .
Here in the lush , misty hills , it is easy to see rain - forest destruction as part of a centuries - old cycle of human civilization and wilderness , in which each in turn is cleared and replaced by the other .
The Mayans first cleared lands here that are now dense forest .
The area around Gamboa , cleared when the Panama Canal was built , now looks to the untrained eye like the wildest of jungles .
But Dr. Laurance says that is a dangerous lens through which to view the modern world , where the forces that are destroying rain forest operate on a scale previously unknown .

Could " shadow life " be lurking in the deep ocean ?
Never mind Mars , alien life may be thriving right here on Earth , a major science conference has heard .
Our planet may harbour forms of " weird life " unrelated to life as we know it , according to Professor Paul Davies , a physicist at Arizona State University .
This " shadow life " may be hidden in toxic arsenic lakes or in boiling deep sea hydrothermal vents , he says .
He has called on scientists to launch a " mission to Earth " by trawling hostile environments for signs of bio-activity .
Weird life could even be living among us , in forms which we do n't yet recognise , he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) meeting in Chicago .
" We do n't have to go to other planets to find weird life .
" It could be right in front of our noses - or even in our noses , " said the physicist .
" It is entirely reasonable to expect we will find a shadow biosphere here on Earth .
" But nobody has actually taken the trouble to look .
" The question is why ?
The cost is not expensive - it would be a fraction of the money we spend searching for extraterrestrial life . "
' Second genesis ' Professor Davies was one of the speakers at a symposium exploring the possibility that life has evolved on Earth more than once .
How do we know we are dealing with separate Earth genesis and not a Mars genesis ?
Professor Paul Davies ,
Arizona State University
The descendants of this " second genesis " may have survived until today in a " shadow biosphere " which is beyond our radar because its inhabitants have biochemistry so different from our own .
" All our microscopes are customised for life as we know it - so it's no surprise that we have n't found microbes with different biochemistry , " said Professor Davies .
" We do n't quite know how weird life would look .
It 's as wide as the imagination and that 's why it 's really hard to look for . "
If it exists , weird life could be based on DNA and RNA - but with a slightly different genetic code or different amino acids .
At the other end of the spectrum , we could find creatures which have more drastic differences .
" Maybe one of the elements life uses - carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorus - could be replaced by something else , " said Professor Davies .
" When I say that , everyone immediately thinks of silicon life - because of Star Trek .
But I 'm not talking about anything that drastic .
" For example , most of the jobs that can be done by phosphorus can be done by arsenic . "
Arsenic may be poisonous to humans , but it has chemical properties which might make it ideal in a microbe 's machinery , he said .
' Mission to Earth '
So how do we go about hunting for something we have never seen before ?
" There are two possibilities , " said Prof Davies , Director of the BEYOND Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science .
Mono Lake in the US is home to arsenic - fuelled microbes " One is that weird life is ecologically isolated , in niches beyond the reach of mankind . "
In this case , we must begin trawling the world 's most inhospitable environments - deserts , salt lakes , and areas of high pressure , temperature or UV radiation .
" We could have a ' mission to Earth ' .
There 's a big long list of places we could be looking , " observed Professor Davies .
" For example , if we are looking for arsenic life , we could head for environments which are both arsenic rich and phosphorus poor - such as deep ocean vents .
" There is also a heavily contaminated lake in California which is arsenic rich - Mono Lake - and we do find microbes in there which get their energy from arsenic .
" But they do n't actually incorporate the arsenic into themselves .
They spit it back out again .
They smoke but they do n't inhale . "
On the other hand , it could be that " weird life " is actually all around us - intermingled with carbon based life .
" In that case it 's going to be really hard to detect - you have to find some way of filtering everything else out . "
This laborious process has been used to search for unknown organisms in seawater - by painstakingly filtering everything else away .
If we did discover something unprecedented , " we 'd all start arguing " said Professor Davies , a theoretical physicist .
" The question would be whether this life was truly different , or whether there was a common precursor a deep branch on the main tree of life .
" Also , how do we know we are dealing with separate Earth genesis and not a Mars genesis ?
" We know rocks do get traded between the two planets , and life could hitch a ride .
" Personally , I 'm only interested in establishing whether life happened more than once .
If we find it has happened twice from scratch then its going to have happened all around the universe .
" It 's going to be teeming with life and there 's a very good chance we are not alone . "
Life in the lab Another way to determine what alternative life might look like is to try to invent it ourselves .
If we can create new molecules which can behave in life - like way , we may then go out and look for these in the environment , says Professor Steven Benner , of the University of Florida .
His team have created perhaps the closest yet to a man -made alternative form of life .
" We are announcing the first example of an artificial synthetic chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution , " he told the conference .
" Is it alive ?
Well , I can tell you that it is not self - sustaining .
" You have to have a graduate student stand there and feed it from time to time , but it is evolving . "
The molecule is essentially a modified version of our own DNA double helix - but with six " letters " in its genetic alphabet , instead of four .
These nucleotides pair up in strands , which can replicate , though only with the help of polymerase enzymes and heat .
" Sometimes mistakes are made in pairing and these mistakes are maintained in the next generation - it is evolving , " said Prof Brenner .
" The next step is to apply natural selection to it , to see if it can evolve under selective pressure .
" The accepted definition of life is a molecule capable of Darwinian evolution , so we are trying to put together molecules that are capable of doing it . "
But he questioned whether our definition of " living " is perhaps too " Earth - centric " .
" Remember - just because you are a chemical system which is self - sustaining and capable of Darwinian evolution , that does n't mean that is the universal definition of life , " he said .

Yenikapi , Istanbul
Digging through thick mud and an ancient swamp of black clay , archaeologists in Istanbul have discovered a grave that proves the city is 6,000 years older than they previously thought .
The skeletons of two adults and two children lie curled - up , perhaps to save space .
Alongside them are pots : gifts placed in the grave to use in the afterlife .
The ancient family was unearthed at the site of a 21st Century rail project .
" We found the grave , pots and other artefacts .
There were signs of houses made of tree - branches and next to the settlement was a swamp where we found small tools , wooden pieces and bones , " explains Ismail Karamut , head of the Istanbul Archaeology museum , which is leading the dig .
Neolithic graves were unearthed at the site " It all shows there was a Neolithic settlement here in the historic peninsula of Istanbul where people lived , farmed and fished , " he adds .
Historians had believed modern - day Istanbul was first settled around 700 BC .
The discovery of the skeletons has revealed far deeper roots .
The Neolithic era - when man abandoned the nomadic , hunting lifestyle and settled to farm the land and raise cattle - began east of here , gradually carrying the foundations of " civilised " life west , to Europe .
The new find in Istanbul helps map that transition .
" Neolithic culture changed as it moved west .
Not all of what we call the ' Neolithic package ' was transferred , " explains Professor Mehmet Ozdogan of Istanbul University .
" Domesticated animals and some of the cereal crops came , but mud brick became wooden architecture , settlements were re-organised .
The transformation is important to understand the Neolithic culture in Europe .
Every new site adds data to the picture . "
Past and present Neolithic remains were discovered in two Istanbul suburbs in the 1950s and 1980s , but this is the first such find in the historic heart of the city .
That has created a stir the other sites never managed .
Archaeologists worked in shifts , covering 24 hours a day Prof Ozdogan believes the Yenikapi settlement dates from between 6400BC and 5800 BC - long before the Bosphorus Strait had formed and in the days when the Marmara Sea was a small , inland lake .
Istanbul 's first inhabitants appear to have lived on both sides of a river that flowed then through Yenikapi .
The excavation of Istanbul 's first settlement is taking place at the site of a state - of - the - art train station on the multi-million dollar Marmaray rail project .
The line will link Europe and Asia with the world 's deepest underwater tunnel , 56 metres beneath the Bosphorus .
The last sections of underwater tubing were joined in October .
The project has been delayed , but it 's important to discover the culture here
Yasar Anilir , Chief archaeologist at the dig
But above ground , the revolutionary project has been held up by history .
Scheduled to last six months , Yenikapi archaeological dig is still going strong four years later .
The Marmaray is now expected to open in 2011 at the earliest .
" Of course the project has been delayed , but it 's important to discover the culture here , " argues Yasar Anilir , chief archaeologist at the dig .
" But if there was no Marmaray project we would not have been digging at all .
This requires a lot of labour and money . "
Archaeological delight
The team 's first major discovery was a section of the first city walls , believed to date back to Constantine I .
As anticipated , they also uncovered a 4th Century port - once the busiest in Byzantium - and the stunningly well - preserved remains of more than 30 wooden ships , many wrecked in storms in the 10th and 11th centuries .
Unearthing the Neolithic settlement was an unexpected archaeological delight .
Under pressure to complete their excavations and let - in the construction workers , archaeologists have at times worked in shifts , digging 24 hours a day .
The cost of the delay to construction has not been calculated yet .
" The Marmaray project is very important , but you cannot sacrifice our cultural heritage , " says Ismail Karamut , who insists his team has not compromised on the quality of their work .
" We 're trying to reconcile both demands - to help the project , and protect the heritage . "
The Yenikapi dig has now reached bedrock , so archaeologists do n't expect any more major discoveries .
They 're still working through piles of ancient swamp mud though , which has preserved some of the oldest wooden artefacts ever found .
Skeletons and gifts for the afterlife were found
On the far side of the site , beyond the Marmaray station , excavation work will continue alongside construction .
" We 're expecting to find more - maybe a small settlement , " Yasar Anilir explains .
" We have to remove the Byzantine ships first , then we can complete our dig . "
This experience should be a lesson to the authorities , according to Prof Mehmet Ozdogan , who says there have been no archaeological digs for purely scientific purposes in Istanbul since the 1960s .
" Of course a city should live , you can't turn it into a museum .
But we should not wait for construction projects to learn the history of a town .
We should dig on purpose , just to learn , " the professor argues .
" Once the past is destroyed , it 's irreversible . "

Can a 4000 ft2 Home be Green ?
Can a 4,000 ft2 Home be Green ?
I regularly receive requests for my ecological design services for very large private homes .
The individuals behind these requests are generally quite accustomed to getting what they want .
Some have a difficult time understanding :
a ) why money alone cannot buy an ecological home , and
b ) why I wo n't work on their project
This is a letter to one such client who I had a particularly nice personal connection with .
I never did work on their place , but at their request , I did give them an interview for their TV show about the project , expressing the views in this letter .
Dear ___________ ,
First let me repeat that I appreciate that your heart is in the right place ; you are smart , focused , dedicated to this project , and unafraid of honesty .
Because of the stage your project is at , there is n't time to beat around the bush .
I would like to tell you what you want to hear and help you achieve your goals .
However , as an ecological systems designer I can't embrace your project as currently conceived .
You want a 4,000 f t2 ecological passive solar house , with a wall of glass at the north view .
These goals are mutually exclusive : the house is poorly oriented and far too big .
If you build a 4,000 square foot house for six people on your site and do it conventionally all the way , it might cost you $ 500,000 .
If you add thin " green veneer , " it might add 10 % to the cost of the project .
Thick green veneer might double the cost to a million dollars .
Examples of " green veneer " in this context are alternative construction materials such as straw bale , nontoxic paints , real linoleum , recycled wood , high performance windows & insulation ; alternative power sources such as solar electric and heating ; and alternative water sources such as recycled wastewater and rain water harvesting .
Some of these features may be found to save resources over the life of the project .
But if the fundamentals of the project and lifestyle of the inhabitants do n't change , these features are essentially add - ons .
Properly rigorous life - cycle analysis will show that many of these add - ons will increase the overall environmental impact .
" Green veneer " may seem dismissive .
But the reality is that without lifestyle change and integration with other designs , green add - ons are not " green . "
In contrast , building a " deep green " house for six people on your site might cost $ 100,000 - $ 200,000 less than the presumed base price of $ 500,000 .
A deep green house can't be bought with money alone .
It also comes from integrating lifestyle accommodation , a rearrangement of priorities , and time and personal involvement in the design , construction , and use of a much smaller , better - designed house .
Such a house might incorporate nearly the same alternative construction materials , alternative power sources , and alternative water sources .
However , in conjunction with altering the fundamentals of square footage , siting for optimal solar exposure and water reuse , and occupant lifestyle , the result would be completely different .
The tendency is to view these fundamentals on equal par with other " list items " such as solar power .
However , the fundamentals are vastly more well , fundamental .
Square footage
If you overshoot on square footage , no amount of money spent on greening is going to yield a low - impact project .
Lower the square footage , and you lower almost every other impact proportionately .
A 2,000 square foot house with completely conventional construction would have a lower ecological impact than a 4,000 square foot straw bale house that employed every ecological feature .
Using the same money , a 1000 square foot house could be carefully designed and custom built with way more soul .
Well - made , the comparative small footprint of such a house would shrink as the resources that went into the initial construction were amortized over the century or more it could last .
Would it be enough space ?
This is a question partly of good design , and mostly of mind set .
Billionaires are quite happy cruising for years on yachts with less than 200 square feet per person , which is the reasonable target we recommend for a home .
The average size of new single - family homes in the US increased from 1,500 square feet to 2,266 square feet between 1970 and 2000 .
The Census Bureau also reports that over the same time period , the average household size declined , from 3.1 people per household in 1970 to 2.6 people per household .
Thus , the square feet per person have nearly doubled , from 483 to 872 .
The ecological design approach is to take the most inherently simple solution and implement it as well as possible .
In the case of housing , this means a small number of very well designed square feet .
The better the square feet , the fewer of them you need .
Moreover , most people will be happier in a small number of really well designed square feet than a large number of less perfect square feet .
Because the most ecological solution is always the cheapest , profiteers will do all they can to steer the market in the opposite direction .
That is , towards the most inherently complicated solution , with the option of shoddy execution to " save money " ( actually , ensure future income from repair and replacement sales ) .
Just like big SUVs are more profitable for auto makers than small cars , a big , feature - laden house is more profitable in every way .
Like the impacts , the profits also multiply by the square feet .
The construction industry wants lots of square feet , and they 'll do everything to pass laws requiring more , bigger features , and persuade buyers into thinking they want these things , too .
Do we see our homes as investment commodities , or the cradle of our family 's soul ?
Even if you make houses and sell them for a living , you do n't need them to have mass appeal .
You just need one buyer who is in love with the place .
Like many of my fellow citizens , I feel a pull towards a large , valuable real estate holding .
Considering how focused I 've been on resisting it , to a surprising extent I accept the central tenet of the brainwashing , that " bigger is better , " even though my life experience does n't validate this point .
Vast , rectangular spaces with high ceilings and a correspondingly low level of detail work and craftsmanship are soulless and leave me cold .
On the other hand , I 've noticed that the spaces I 'm most comfortable in are cozy , well - fitting , generally older or self - built homes with " substandard " ceiling heights , odd shapes , narrow doorways , and smaller rooms , and maybe one bigger one for gathering .
Interesting shapes , real materials , and a high level of craftsmanship , detail and handwork give a building soul .
Such features are very expensive or impossible to implement in a large home .
This hobbit scale lodge was a surprisingly delightful family home for us as summer turned to fall in Northern California .
Several skylights provided nice light .
It has both a diminutive fireplace and a wood stove , bookshelves ... all in about 50 square feet .
Needless to say , it was easy to heat .
One summer my parents , sister and I traveled for three months in a 19 - foot camper .
We were all amazed at how much easier it was to live in a hundred and fifty square feet than 1500 .
You could reach the silverware drawer from the dining table and the kitchen sink .
Cleaning was a breeze .
We got along better than at any other time .
Living on various boats , I had similar experiences .
My wife , six - year - old daughter and I lived happily for a year of traveling in a two - person tent forty square feet ( with lots of outdoor living space around it ) .
Traveling in other countries , I noted that norms for square feet per person are way lower .
Back in our house , a 600 square foot summer cabin , we could feel the house was n't " working . "
Despite all the experiences above , I bought the standard diagnosis , that the house was " too small " ( apparently I 'm a slow learner ) .
Fortunately , as the first step towards adding on more space , we filled one room with building materials , functionally removing it from our everyday lives .
Surprise !without that room , our house worked better !
This was the experience that finally broke the marketers ' " more is better " spell that had me in its thrall .
Now I seriously question the purported advantage of more space .
What we really need is better - designed space something much less straightforward , but a much worthier pursuit .
Fifty square feet of well - designed space per person is possible ; 200 square feet per person is generous .
At 500 + square feet per person ecology is out the window and domestic help is no longer a luxury but a necessity .
Siting and orientation
Siting and orientation are also as important , but in a different way .
If your house faces the sun , the solar design just clicks into place .
If it does n't , the solar design requires much more time and money to achieve less result .
I understand that you want a wall of windows to face that Northwest view , but this simply is n't compatible with your desire for a passive solar heated home .
No amount of money ( or wishful thinking ) can make a wall of northwest facing windows a passive solar asset .
( Putting a wall of windows to the south — with a few small , well insulated sited and framed windows to views elsewhere — enables the view to be enjoyed while the house to be heated by passive solar .
It is a myth that windows need to be big to make a view enjoyable .
The most beautiful view window I 've ever seen frames a long west view in a window well about thirty inches high by eight inches wide , and a foot and a half deep . )
The same with water reuse .
If the wastewater generation points are a short distance uphill from the wastewater reuse points , the design , its implementation and use all take less time , money , and resources .
Dual plumbing in a small house might take thirty additional feet of drain pipe .
In a large house with several bathrooms and other water sources , it could take hundreds .
With only a few people living there , the investment in money and plastic can't be justified — the earth would be better off if you wasted the water .
Lifestyle
Finally , lifestyle is the king of all the considerations .
If the occupants are willing to alter their habits , this makes it much easier to design a low - impact house .
A low - impact lifestyle is easier and more comfortable in a house designed to support it this synergy can ratchet impacts down dramatically .
I hope the foregoing helps explain the reaction of myself and the other designers you 've talked with .
It 's not that the straw bale guy ( who also turned this project down ) and I do n't want to help you make something ecological , it 's that we can't make something ecological without ecological fundamentals to build on .
So where do you go from here ?
I suggest you take a breath and really look closely at those fundamentals .
Read Principles of Ecological Design ( article ) , which could perhaps help make the leap out of the Santa Barbara mind set , which is antithetical to an ecological approach .
If your wife is not willing to concede an inch on comfort , perhaps she could be persuaded to try life in a very well - designed 2,000 square foot house , with the option of adding more ( already designed ) space if she hates it .
You could point out that she would probably not want for space if your family were cruising on a 60 - foot yacht , and that your home could be equally well - designed , and twice as big .
Whether you go " deep green " or some degree of " green veneer " I suggest you hire a project manager with extensive green building experience to prevent yourself from going crazy with work overload and cultural clash with subcontractors .
Wishing you the best of luck ,

The Union of Concerned Scientists ranks housing third among destructive human enterprises , just after transportation and agriculture .
Forty percent of all the raw materials humans consume , we use in construction .
Building an average house adds seven tons of waste to the landfill .
If we returned to 1955 building and housing patterns of 350 square feet per person , we would n't have to build another thing until our population doubled again .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday 9 February 2009
The Trinitarian Bible Society , which is running advertisements on buses quoting a line from the Bible , is not a church ; it is a Bible publisher .
The society has asked us to clarify that its campaign is unconnected to those being mounted by the Russian Orthodox Church and the Christian party .
In the beginning , there was the atheist bus campaign .
And it was good .
Unless , that is , you were one of the many God-fearing folk who considered it blasphemy .
They , however , are planning to get their own back .
A trinity of Christian groups have created their own series of advertisements to run across London buses , the medium of choice for the battle of beliefs , it seems .
The original ads from the British Humanist Association insisted : " There is probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
The new campaign is organsied by the Christian Party , the Trinitarian Bible Society and the Russian Orthodox Church .
Their pro-God campaigns will run on 175 buses for two weeks from Monday .
In a somewhat cheeky move , the Rev George Hargreaves of the Christian Party has created a bus advert which proclaims : " There definitely is a God .
So join the Christian Party and enjoy your life . "
It will run on 50 bendy buses in central London , east London and the West End .
Meanwhile , the Russian Orthodox Church has booked 25 supersize bus advertisements , backed by a sponsorship deal with Russian Hour TV , using the line " There IS a God , BELIEVE .
Do n't worry and enjoy your life . "
The Trinitarian Bible Society has taken a less temperate approach , using a line from the bible to scold nonbelievers : " The fool hath said in his heart , there is no God , " runs the advertisement 's slogan , taken from Psalm 53.1 .
The church 's campaign , which like the others was booked through outdoor advertising company CBS Outdoor , runs on 100 buses .
Last month the Advertising Standards Authority received almost 150 complaints that the atheist bus campaign was offensive to Christians , and that the " no God " claim could not be substantiated .
However the ASA ruled that the campaign did not break the advertising code , concluding that the ads were an " expression of the advertiser 's opinion and that the claims in it were not capable of objective substantiation " .
As such , it said that it was unlikely to mislead or to cause widespread offence .
Writer Ariane Sherine first suggested the campaign in a Guardian Comment Is Free blog last June , to provide a reassuring counter - message to religious slogans threatening non-Christians with hell and damnation .
She wrote : " Yesterday I walked to work and saw two London buses with the question : ' When the son of man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? ' ( Luke 18:8 ) ...
If I wanted to run a bus ad saying ' Beware , there is a giant lion from London Zoo on the loose ! '
I think I might be asked to show my working and back up my claims . "
World 's first wrist - watch video phone available by Christmas
If you spent boyhood imagining yourself as Dick Tracy , there may be no need to grow up .
The comic - strip detective hero , with a watch which doubled as a two - way radio , was the stuff of dreams for Fifties youngsters .
But now an electronics company has made his gadget a reality .
In fact , the latest phone and timepiece from LG is even better than Tracy's .
The LG G910 phone watch was first unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
It has voice - recognition software
Combining a wristwatch with a mobile phone , it has a touch screen and miniature camera for those vital video calls - and also sends texts and emails .
The LG - GD910 allows wearers to search the web and download films and music - useful for time spent alone at a stakeout .
' Our new 3G Touch Watch Phone is stylish , sophisticated and the height of technology , ' said LG Electronics Mobile Communications .
' How else can you re-enact those scenes from your favourite spy movie ? '
From fiction to fact :
In the 1950s , the comic strip detective hero Dick Tracy had a ' two - way wrist radio '
A new generation of smart watches has been promised for a number of years , however none has yet reached the mass market .
In 2003 , the Microsoft founder Bill Gates , unveiled plans for smart watches that worked as mini FM - radios rather than mobile phones .
It was suggested that the watch screen would be constantly updated with news , sports results , stock market updates via the FM radio system .
However , this idea has been overtaken by LG even before it reached the mass market .
There is no information yet on the price of the Watch Phone , however analysts expect the device to cost around £ 100 no the basis of signing up to an 18 - month contract .
Yves Maitre , senior vice president of devices at Orange , said : ' This phone really manages to combine form with functionality , and its chic styling and mobile broadband connectivity will no doubt appeal to all the early adopters out there .
' It is a great addition to our range , showing that we can give customers the latest in high - tech design for a totally new kind of multimedia experience . '
The LG device is just one of a number of new phones being launched at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , a technology show devoted to mobile phones and services .
A wrist - watch that doubles as a mobile phone is set to go on sale in the UK by the end of the year , manufacturers said .
The gadget will be available via Orange 's network later this year .
Thankfully , at just half an inch thick , with its glass face and contemporary metal casing , the watch has the gravitas to look right on a man 's wrist . . . even though there 's a schoolboy spy inside .
Watch the phone in action ...
Vassilis Paleokostas appears to have a fondness for helicopter travel
Two of Greece 's most wanted men have staged a daring helicopter escape from Athens ' highest - security prison - for the second time in three years .
Serial armed robber and kidnapper Vassilis Paleokostas and his Albanian sidekick Alket Rizai were days away from trial for their 2006 escape .
They fled Korydallos prison after a helicopter landed on the jail 's roof and threw them a rope ladder .
The aircraft was reportedly later found abandoned by a main highway .
The road leads towards Greece 's central mountain range , an area where Paleokostas , 42 , was able to hide with impunity during previous years , says the BBC's Malcolm Brabant , in Athens .
Our correspondent says the breakout is a damning indictment of Greece 's prison system .
Shots fired
Sunday 's escape happened at around 1530 local time ( 1330 GMT ) , the Associated Press reports , adding that guards opened fire on the fleeing fugitives but were unable to stop them .
" The helicopter was then found in the northern Athens suburb of Kapandriti but there was no trace of the fugitives , " an unnamed police official told Reuters news agency .
Three years ago both men managed to escape when a hijacked helicopter landed in Korydallos ' central yard at exercise time .
On that occasion , the guards failed to react , because they thought it was a visit by prison inspectors .
Paleokostas was previously in prison for a string of crimes including the kidnapping of an industrialist called George Mylonas , released after paying a substantial ransom .
After the previous escape he was recaptured in August 2008 .
The architect of that escape , Paleokostas ' brother Nikos , has since been captured and jailed , and is now likely to face increased security .
Located in northwest Pakistan , Parachinar is 12 miles from Tora Bora , the last confirmed location of Osama bin Laden .
While U.S. intelligence officials have spent more than seven years searching fruitlessly for Osama bin Laden , UCLA geographers say they have a good idea of where the terrorist leader was at the end of 2001 — and perhaps where he has been in the years since .
In a new study published online today by the MIT International Review , the geographers report that simple facts , publicly available satellite imagery and fundamental principles of geography place the mastermind behind the Sept. 11 attacks against the U.S. in one of three buildings in the northwest Pakistan town of Parachinar , in the Kurram tribal region near the border with Afghanistan .
" If he 's still alive , he honestly could be sitting there right now , " said Thomas W. Gillespie , the study 's lead author and an associate professor of geography at UCLA .
" It is still the safest tribal area and city in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) of northwest Pakistan and one of the only tribal areas that the U.S. has not bombed with its unmanned Predators . "
Despite keen interest in the terrorist recluse and a $ 25 million reward for information leading to his capture , academics have shied away from getting involved in the quest to find him , the researchers contend .
Meanwhile , dramatic improvements in remote - sensing imagery have improved the odds of civilians doing so .
" We believe our work represents the first scientific approach to establishing bin Laden 's current location , " said John A. Agnew , study co-author and UCLA geography professor .
" The methods are repeatable and could easily be updated with new information obtained by the U.S. intelligence community . "
The researchers advocate that the U.S. investigate — but not bomb — the three buildings .
They warn that if bin Laden indeed remains to this day in the tiny city of Parachinar , or even elsewhere in the relatively thinly populated tribal area of Kurram , he may move to the city of Peshawar ( population 1.4 million ) in the neighboring tribal area of North - West Frontier Province if Peshawar falls to the Taliban .
News reports have warned of that possibility since last summer .
" If bin Laden were to move to Peshawar , which would become an option if the Taliban were in control there , the search would become much more complicated , " Gillespie said .
" It 's the difference between looking for someone in L.A. versus in Big Bear , " he added , referring to a mountain resort town 90 miles east of Los Angeles .
The findings are based on the last information on bin Laden 's whereabouts to be made public by U.S. intelligence sources , which have closely guarded the details of any efforts to locate him .
One and a half months after the coordinated attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people , a walkie - talkie radio broadcast placed bin Laden in Tora Bora , a cave complex in eastern Afghanistan .
In an unsuccessful attempt to capture bin Laden , U.S. forces attacked the caves the following month .
The UCLA findings rely on two principles used in geography to predict the distribution of wildlife , primarily for the purposes of designing approaches to conservation .
The first , known as distance - decay theory , holds that as one travels farther away from a precise location with a specific composition of species — or , in this case , a specific composition of cultural and physical factors — the probability of finding spots with that same specific composition decreases exponentially .
The second , island biogeographic theory , holds that large and close islands have larger immigration rates and will support more species than smaller , more isolated islands .
Inspired by distance - decay theory , the seven - member team started by drawing concentric circles around Tora Bora on a satellite map of the area at a distance of 10 kilometers — or 6.1 miles — apart .
" The farther bin Laden moves from his last reported location into the more secular parts of Pakistan or into India , the greater the probability that he will be in an area with a different cultural composition , thereby increasing the probability of his being captured or eliminated , " Gillespie said .
Then , informed by island biogeographic theory , the researchers scoured the rings for " city islands " — or distinctly separate settlements of considerable size .
" Island biology theory predicts that he would find his way to the largest but least isolated city of that area , " said Gillespie , an authority on measuring and modeling biodiversity on Earth from space .
" If you get stuck on an island , you would want it to be Hawaii rather than one with a single palm tree .
It 's a matter of resources . "
The approach netted 26 cities within a 12.4 - mile radius of Tora Bora on imagery from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ( ETM + ) , a global archive of satellite photos managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey .
With a 2.7 - square - mile footprint , Parachinar turned out to be the largest and fourth - least isolated city , the team determined .
" Based on bin Laden 's last known location in Tora Bora , we estimate that he must have traveled 1.9 miles over a 13,000 - foot - high pass into Kurram and then headed for the largest city , which turns out to be Parachinar , " said Agnew , who is the current president of the Association of American Geographers , the field 's leading scholarly organization .
The researchers ruled out cities on the Afghanistan side of the border because the country was occupied at the time by U.S. and international forces and has been particularly unstable ever since .
" The Pakistan side of the border is much better for hiding because of its ambiguous political status within the country and the formal absence of U.S. or NATO troops , " Agnew said .
Faced with the prospect of picking from more than 1,000 structures clearly portrayed in the satellite imagery of Parachinar , the team decided to come up with a short list of the criteria that bin Laden would need for housing , based on well - known information about him , including his height ( between 6 ' 4 " and 6 ' 6 " , depending on the source ) , his medical condition ( apparently in need of regular dialysis and , therefore , electricity to run the machine ) and several basic assumptions , such as a need for security , protection , privacy and overhead cover to shield him from being spotted by planes , helicopters and satellites .
So they looked for buildings that could house someone taller than 6 ' 4 " and were surrounded by walls more than 9 feet tall ( both as judged by mid-afternoon shadows depicted on the satellite imagery ) , and that had more than three rooms , space separating them from nearby structures , electricity and a thick tree canopy .
Only three structures fit the criteria .
The buildings also appeared to be the best fortified and among the largest in Parachinar .
Two are clearly residences , the study states .
The third may be a prison .
But whatever the third structure is , it has " one of the best maintained gardens in all of Parachinar , " the study says .
While the three structures meet all six of the criteria that the researchers believe would be required for lodging bin Laden , an additional 16 structures in Parachinar appear to meet five of the six criteria .
If bin Laden is not in the first three structures , the U.S. military should investigate these other buildings , the study urges .
The outgrowth of an undergraduate geography course in remote sensing , the study lists five 2008 UCLA graduates as co-authors .
The students have since gone on to a range of endeavors , from selling real estate and attending law school to earning a master 's degree from Oxford University .
One now works for a remote - sensing company .
Undergraduates had attempted to take on the same study in 2006 , but at 30 x 30 meters — or nearly 100 x 100 feet — the resolution of publicly available satellite images of the area at the time was insufficient .
In contrast , today 's resolution is 0.6 meters , or just under 2 feet , Gillespie said .
The remote - sensing company that employs one of the alumni authors plans soon to unveil a 0.4 - meter resolution of the entire world .
" Technology has caught up to the question , " said Gillespie , who serves as the director of the Spatial Demography Group for the UCLA - based California Center for Population Research .
" Finding Osama bin Laden : An Application of Biogeographic Theories and Satellite Imagery " is not the first attempt by Gillespie and Agnew to bring scientific analysis to nettlesome political issues .
In September 2008 , they received widespread attention for a satellite study of the density of lights in the night sky of Baghdad in the time leading up to , during and immediately following the U.S. military surge of 2007 .
The findings cast doubt on the role claimed by the U.S. military in quelling violence during that time and suggest instead that intra-sectarian conflict was responsible for clearing whole portions of the city , leaving them both dark and devoid of the objects of Iraqi - on - Iraqi violence .
Due to the low cost of conducting the study , it received no outside funding .
However , past research by Gillespie has received funding from the National Institute on Aging , the MacArthur Foundation and the National Science Foundation .

The mystery of a tiny charge on credit and debit cards is heightening to one of anticipation - of when the other shoe is going to drop .
Fraud experts are concerned about these charges - from 21 cents to 48 cents - that have appeared on cardholders ' accounts in at least 46 states .
The fear is someone is trying to find usable card numbers so that they can use the cards to make bigger charges at some future date .
The small charge , showing up as being from either Adele Services or GFDL , is designed to try to fly under the radar of credit card companies ' fraud detection programs .
Those companies appear to be fictitious .
" More than likely , the perpetrators are attempting to test the waters , " said Jeremy Cannon of the National White Collar Crime Center .
" They are relying on their assumption that the victim will not be vigilant in monitoring their banking and credit statements . "
The scope of this scam has caught the attention of the companies and the national Internet Crime Complaint Center ( www.ic3.gov), run by the National White Collar Crime Center and the FBI .
The site registered 800 formal complaints about the scam as of last week and officials issued a warning to consumers .
Separately , the consumer finance site Mint.com notified 800 of its customers that a scan of their databases detected those charges on their credit or debit statements .
Consumer complaint experts say those who complain tend to represent a tiny portion of those affected , particularly in cases such as this where many would not even know they had been affected .
Ben Woolsey of CreditCards.com warns : " Consumers who have seen these micro charges should be doubly vigilant in monitoring their statements .
It might also be prudent for consumers who experience these charges to report their card as lost and request that a new card with a new account number be issued by their bank " rather than just requesting that the 25 cents be reversed .
Banks are reluctant to discuss such problems for fear of losing customers and increasing costs , he said .
Bank of America , for example , said it is against policy to discuss any specific charge .
Chase Card Services vice president Gail Hurdis said she is aware of the charges and said the company has " sophisticated systems to monitor and detect fraudulent activity " and encouraged consumers to promptly call their card 's toll - free number if they suspect fraud .

Happy New Year !
While the onset of recession has driven prices down on the high street over the past few months , there ’s been no such savings to be had for regular train - travellers .
Prices on some networks rose by as much as 7 per cent at the start of January – almost eight times greater than the current rate of inflation .
But in spite of the rise in headline rail ticket prices , there are plenty of bargains to be found out there if you know where to look and when to book .
And if you ’re considering travelling further afield by airplane , there are some great bargains to be bagged as the airlines do everything they can to keep their planes full .

All the best deals for British train journeys are to be found online – and will only be caught by those who book several weeks in advance .
However , most train companies wo n’t release the cheapest until between eight and 12 weeks before departure – so , to make sure you get the best deal , it ’s well worth signing up to the alert service provided at ticketalert .|thetrainline.com .
This will contact you when the cheapest tickets for your desired journey have been released .
And , for longer journeys , the difference between the full price and discounted tickets can be hundreds of pounds .
For example , a regular weekend return ticket from London to Edinburgh will set you back £ 136.50 .
But if you buy two advance single tickets , you could end up paying no more than £ 24 for your whole trip .
The ticket alert service is not the only useful tool on thetrainline.com .
There ’s also a best fare finder , which will help you pick out the cheapest fare for your journey by showing how ticket prices differ from day to day .
You may find you can save a three - figure sum simply by leaving a day earlier or coming back a day later .
Another site worth a look is megatrain .|com , which offers fares from Virgin and South West Trains for as little as £ 1 .
Even if you have n’t managed to book in advance , it ’s always worth checking for discounted fares – right up to the last minute .
Train operators tend to have a set number of cheap tickets per service , and occasionally there are some left on the day of travel .
Again , this can often deliver three - figure savings for the price of a phone call to the train company .
Rail cards are another easy way to save money on fares .
If you ’re between 16 and 25 , or over 60 , you can get a third off rail fares with a Young Person ’s or Senior railcard , which cost just £ 24 a year .
If you ’ve got children , you can make similar savings with a Family & Friends railcard – as long as someone under 16 is travelling with you .
Your local network may also offer other railcards , so it ’s worth asking at your station .
If you ’re a daily rail commuter , it ’s usually cheapest to buy your season ticket for a whole year .
However , ask what options are available , as you can save thousands by agreeing not to take certain routes .
Finally , if you ’re really dedicated to finding the cheapest possible train fares , it ’s sometimes possible to reduce the overall cost of your journey by buying multiple tickets for different legs .
According to moneysavingexpert.com , you can save up to £ 55 on a Manchester to Edinburgh journey by buying one ticket from Manchester to York , and a second one from York to Edinburgh .
Similarly , if some of your journey will be at peak time , why not buy one ticket to cover the peak hours , and a cheaper off - peak ticket for the rest .
Details of these and other tricks can be found at moneysavingexpert.com .
Flight plans
The price of flights out of Britain has plummeted this winter , as airlines have been able to pass on some of the savings from the fall in fuel prices – and as they ’ve increased their attempts to keep people travelling .
At the moment , you can get flights to New York with Continental for as little as £ 258 , or you can make it all the way to Hong Kong with Jet Airways for less than £ 350 .
If you want to travel with a particular airline , it ’s worth checking its website as many of the best deals are only available there .
But if you ’re not fussy who you fly with , the easiest way to get a sweep of the market is to use an aggregator site , such as kayak .
co.uk and travelsupermarket.com , which will check prices on all the major websites foryou .
These sites are better places to visit than flight brokers – such as expedia .co.uk and opodo .
co.uk – because they check individual airline sites as well as the brokers ’ sites .

Finally , if you ’re after a free flight , some credit cards offer free trips as an incentive to join .
Lloyds TSB Airmiles and Citi bmibaby MasterCard , as well as easyJet ’s and Ryanair ’s own - brand cards , are worth checking out .

はじめに 連載第4回目は、ADB （Adobe Developer Box）の裏方として活躍しているデータベース「 SQLite」についてどのように活用しているかをご紹介したいと思います。
ADBでは、RSSリーダーやおすすめ情報などの受信したデータは全てSQLiteに格納するようにしています。一旦、SQLiteに格納してしまえばオフライン状態でもデータを表示することができ、使い勝手を向上させることができます。
SQLiteは、MySQLやPostgreSQLなどのデータベースに比べると扱えるデータ型などが限られているので複雑なものを格納するには適していませんが、クライアントの一時的なデータ保管場所としては十分使えるデータベースです。
Adobe AIRでは、このSQLiteを利用するためのAPIが用意されているので、データベースへのINSERTやUPDATE、SELECTなどの操作が行えます。 しかしAPIでは、昔ながらの手順でデータベースへのコネクションを取得し、SQLStatementで生成したクエリを発行して結果を取得するという流れになります。これでは、画面側のロジックでSQL文の生成やコネクションなどデータベースのことを意識しなければいけなくなってしまいます。 そこで今回ADBを開発する中でSQLiteをもっと手軽に効率よく操作するため、AIR向けのO/Rマッピングライブラリ「AirRecord（エアーレコード）」を作りました。
AirRecordは、マーチン・ファウラーのデザイン･パターンの１つ「ActiveRecord」にもとづき設計しています。 ActiveRecordのパターンは「アプリケーション側のモデル構造とDB側のテーブル構造を1:1で対応させる」といったシンプルな考え方で必要なクラス数も比較的少なくおさえることができ、ソースコード量も抑えることができます。このため、他のプログラミング言語でも様々な形式で実装されており、Ruby on RailsやCakePHPなどのフレームワークの中でも機能的に組み込まれています。
AirRecordを使うことで、モデル側でデータベースの操作を集約できるので画面とロジック、モデル（データベース）をうまく分離して開発することができます。それでは、AirRecordの仕組みと使い方を説明していきましょう。
AirRecordの仕組みと特徴 AirRecordは、次のような特徴があります。 SQL文を書くことなく非常に短い記述でレコードの抽出や書き換えが行えます。
テーブル間の関連を表現でき、1回の検索で紐付くデータを抽出することができます。 例えば、今回のADBの場合、RSSのフィードに関連したエントリー（記事）を取得したいときに、「feed.find(id)」と書くだけで全ての情報が連想配列として返すことができます。
このことにより、画面を担当している開発者は、あまりデータベース周りを気にすることなくデータを操作できるので、スムーズに開発を進めることができます。（今回のADBでは、実際にできたと思います）
AirRecordでは次のような仕組みでデータベースを操作することができるようになっています。
AirRecordのインストール AirRecordは、オープンソースとし てGoogle Codeにて公開しています。 AirRecordプロジェクトのページ
インストールは、ダウンロードしたアーカイブ（最新は、airrecord-1.1.zip）の中のairrecord.swcをAIRプロジェクトのlibsにコピーするだけです。 ここからは、AirRecordプロジェクトページからダウンロードできるサンプルソースをベースに説明していきます。
データベースの接続 アプリケーションの初期処理の中でデータベースへの接続を行います。
AirRecordでは、シングルトンのARDatabaseクラスがコネクションを管理しています。まずは、ARDatabaseのインスタンスに対してaddメソッドでデータベースの接続情報を追加し、connectメソッドで接続します。
var db: ARDatabase = ARDatabase.instance ; db.add(userID , password , dbName , ddl , name , path ) ; db.connect ( ) ;
addメソッドでは、下記のパラメータを設定します。 userID : DBのユーザーID
password : DBのパスワード
dbName : DB 名
ddl : 流し込 むSQL文の配列
name : コネクション識別名( デフォルトは、 " " )
path : DBファイルのパス( デフォルトは、app - storage : / ) AirRecordでは、dbNameで指定した名前でSQLiteのファイルを生成します。例えば、dbNameにadbを指定するとadb.dbというDBファイルが作られます。（既にファイルが存在している場合は、DBファイルは生成されません）
DBファイルの生成場所は、pathパラメータでも指定できますが、デフォルトで「app-storage:/」になります。（AIRアプリのストレージ格納場所） ちなみにAIRアプリのストレージ格納場所は、下記のようになります。
| Windows XP|C : \Documents and Settings \( ユーザー名 ) \Application Data\( AIRアプリケーショ ンID ) \Local Store|
| Windows Vista|C : \Users \ ( ユーザー名 ) \AppData \Roaming \( AIRアプリケーショ ンID ) \Local Store|
| Mac| / Users /( ユーザー名 ) / Library / Preferences /( AIRアプリケーショ ンID ) / Local Store| また、接続時にはddlパラメータで指定したSQL文の配列を順番に流しこむようになっています。
このddlには、主にCREATE TABLEのSQLを書いておき、テーブルを生成できるようにしておきます。
var ddl : Array = [ " CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books ( " + " id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY , " + " name TEXT " + " ) " , " CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes ( " + " id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY , " + " book_id INTEGER , " + " title TEXT , " + " body TEXT , " + " created REAL , " + " modified REAL " + " ) " , " CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tags ( " + " id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY , " + " name TEXT " + " ) " , " CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes_tags ( " + " note_id INTEGER , " + " tag_id INTEGER " + " ) " ]
SQLでは、IF NOT EXISTS を指定することで既にテーブルが存在する場合は実行しないようにできます。
基本的にテーブルの主キーのフィールド名はidにし、INTEGER PRIMARY KEY を指定しておきます。こうすることでidに通番を自動的にふることができます（auto-incrementなフィールドになる）。
それと、これはテーブル設計時のルールなのですが、テーブル名は複数形に統一するようにしています。bookならbooksとし、noteならnotesとします。これはテーブルは、複数レコードが集まったものなので名称は複数形にするべきという考えだからです。
テストなどでデータベース接続時に必ずDBファイルを初期化したい場合は、connectメソッドを次のように記述します。
db.connect ( " " , true ) ;
こうすることで、起動するたびに一旦DBファイルを削除してから新しいDBファイルを生成することができます。
DBファイルの中を確認する方法として筆者の場合、PupSQLiteというWindowsのツールを利用しています。PupSQLiteを使えば簡単にSQLiteのデータをGUIで確認できるので便利です。 モデルクラスの作成 テーブルの数と同じ分だけモデルクラスを作成します。 モデルクラスは、ARModelを継承し、コンストラクタで__tableにテーブル名を指定します。 例えば、booksテーブルに対するモデルクラスは下記のようになります。
public class Book extends ARModel { public function Book ( ) { super ( ) ; this .__table = " books " ; } }
驚くことに、たったこれだけでモデルクラスとして機能します。 レコードの追加 レコードを追加する場合は、モデルクラスのinsertメソッドを使用します。
予めモデルクラスのインスタンスを生成しておきます。
var book : Book = new Book ( ) ; var result : SQLResult = book .insert ( {name : " My Notebook " } ) ; var bookID : Number = result.lastInsertRowID ;
insertメソッドには、フィールド名と値の連想配列（配列オブジェクトとも言う）を引数で渡します。
レコードの追加の場合は、主キーであるidは指定しないでおきます。こうすることでidにインクリメントされた番号が自動的に割り当てられます。
インクリメントされた番号を取得するには、insertの戻り値のSQLResultの中のlastInsertRowIDを使います。 AirRecordでは、連想配列で指定するのが好きではない人のために、別のinsertの方法があります。
予めモデルクラスに、フィールドに対応したメンバー変数を作っておきます。
public class Book extends ARModel { public var id : Number ; public var name : String ; public function Book ( ) { super ( ) ; this .__table = " books " ; } }
insertする前にモデルのインスタンスに対して値を設定しておきます。（idの場合は、Number型なのでNaNを指定する）
そして、引数を指定せずにinsertメソッドを実行します。
book.id = NaN ; book .name = " My Notebook " ; var result : SQLResult = book.insert ( ) ;
どちらでも同じことができますが、モデルクラスにメンバー変数を作っておくほうが堅実なやり方です。 レコードの検索 レコードを検索する場合は、モデルクラスのfindメソッドを使用します。
var book : Book = new Book ( ) ; var bookData : Array = book .
find ( {id : 1 , name : " My Notebook " } , " name ASC " , " 10 " ) ;
findメソッドの1つ目の引数に検索条件を指定します。
検索条件は、文字列で指定する方法と連想配列で指定する方法があります。
連想配列の場合は、フィールド名とマッチさせる値の組み合わせを指定するとAND検索することができます。
上記の例では、下記のようなSQLが発行されることになります。
SELECT * FROM books WHERE id = 1 AND name = ' My Notebook ' ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 10 '
文字列の場合は 、WHERE句に指定する条件文を下記のように直接書きます。AND検索以外や、一致検索（A = B）でない場合は文字列で指定します。
var bookData : Array = book . find ( " id = 1 AND name = ' My Notebook ' " , " name ASC " , " 10 " ) ;
findメソッドの2つ目の引数はソート条件（ORDER句）になり、3つ目は取得件数（LIMIT句）が指定できます。 引数を指定しない場合は、全件を取得することができます。
検索結果は、次のようなArrayオブジェクトで返ってきます。
bookData = [ 0 ] {id : 1 , name : ' aaa '} , [ 1 ] {id : 2 , name : ' bbb'} , [ 2 ] {id : 3 , name : ' ccc'}
1件だけを取得したい場合は、findOneメソッドを使う方が便利です。
var bookData : Object = book.findOne({id : 1} ) ;
findOneメソッドでは、連想配列として結果が返ってきます。
bookData = { id : 1 , name : ' aaa ' }
複雑なSQLで検索したい場合は、queryメソッドを使用してください。
queryメソッドでは 、SQL文をそのまま発行してSQLResultで結果を返します。
var result : SQLResult = book.query ( " SELECT * FROM books WHERE name LIKE ' My % ' " ) ;
レコードの更新 レコードを更新する場合は、モデルクラスのupdateメソッドを使用します。
var book : Book = new Book ( ) ; book.update ( {id : 1} , {name : " Sample Book " } ) ;
1つ目の引数に更新レコードの条件を連想配列もしくは文字列で指定します。（条件指定の方法は、findと同じです）
2つ目の引数に更新対象のフィールドと値のセットを連想配列で指定します。
insertと同じようにモデルクラスに値をセットして更新することもできます。その場合は2つ目の引数を省略します。
book.id = 1 ; book.name = " Sample Book " ; book.update ( {id : 1} ) ;
但し、この場合は全てのフィールドをモデルにセットしておかなければいけないので注意してください。特定のフィールドのみを更新するには連想配列で指定してください。 レコードの削除 レコードを削除する場合は、モデルクラスのdelメソッドを使用します。
book.del({id : 1} ) ;
引数に削除レコードの条件を連想配列もしくは文字列で指定します。（条件指定の方法は、findと同じです） アソシエーション AirRecordでは、アソシエーション（関連付け）を記述することで関連したテーブルの情報を自動的に取得できます。 例えば、booksテーブルとnotesテーブルが1:nの関係で関連しているのであれば、下記のようにモデルクラスのコンストラクタでアソシエーションを定義しておきます。
public class Book extends ARModel { public function Book ( ) { super ( ) ; this .__table = " books " ; this .__recursive = 2 ; this .
__hasMany = { " notes " : new ARAssociation ( " Note " , " book_id " ) } ; } }
関連が1:nの場合は__hasManyに連想配列でキーとARAssociationオブジェクトをセットします。（キーを変えて複数指定することができます）
ARAssociationオブジェクトをnewする際に、1つ目の引数で対象のモデルクラス名、2つ目の引数に外部キーとなっているフィールド名を指定します。 これで、Bookのモデルクラスからレコードの検索を行うと、検索結果の連想配列にnotesというキーでNoteモデルクラスに対応したnotesテーブルの関連データが自動的にセットされるようになります。 この状態で、booksから1件だけデータを取得すると下記のような結果が得られます。
bookData = { id : 1 , name : ' aaa ' , notes = [ 0 ] {id : 1 , book_id : 1 , title : ' note1'} , [ 1 ] {id : 2 , book_id : 1 , title : ' note2'} , [ 2 ] {id : 3 , book_id : 1 , title : ' note3'} , }
同様に関連が1:1の場合、親となるモデルでは__hasOneを指定し、子のモデル側では__belongsToを指定します。
n:nの場合は__hasAndBelongsToManyを指定します。（この辺はサンプルソースを見てもらうほうが理解が早いと思います）
アソシエーションの考え方は少し難しい部分もありますが、慣れると1回の検索で関連データが一気に取得できるので非常に便利です。
何階層まで関連データを取得するかは、__recursiveで指定できます（デフォルトは1）。
__recursiveが2の場合は2階層先までの関連データを取得してきます。-1にすると最下層まで取得するようにもできます。
他にも関連データを取得する際に件数を制限したり検索条件を加えたりしたい場合は、ARAssociationオブジェクトをnewする時の引数を変えることで実現できます。
アソシエーションには2つだけ注意点があります。
1つめが、関連データを自動的に検索するため、アソシエーションを定義しすぎるとボトルネックになるということです。1回の検索でどこまでデータを取得したいか利用シーンを考えながら最低限の設定にしておくほうがよいでしょう。
2つめが、アソシエーション定義したモデルクラスがコンパイル対象にならないということです。FlexやAIRアプリケーションをコンパイル（ビルド）すると、内部で使用されていないクラスは除外されてしまいます。
アソシエーションで動的にクラス名を指定しているだけの場合は、下記のようなモデルクラスを参照するだけのModelClassesクラスを作っておき、どこかの場所でこのModelClassesを参照するようにしておくと全てのモデルをコンパイル対象にすることができます。
package sample.notepad.model { public class ModelClasses { Book ; Note ; Tag ; NoteTag ; } }
複数データベースの対 応 AirRecordでは、1つのAIRアプリケーションで複数のデータベースを操作することもできます。
その場合は、まずデータベースの接続時の引数でnameの部分を別の名前で登録しておきます。（下記の例では、db1とdb2にしています）
var db: ARDatabase = ARDatabase.instance ; db.add(userID1 , password1 , dbName1 , ddl1 , " db1 " , path ) ; db.add(userID2 , password2 , dbName2 , ddl2 , " db2 " , path ) ; db.connect ( " db1 " ) ; db.connect ( " db2 " ) ;
そして、モデルクラスで__dbNameにどのデータベースが対象か指定します。
public class Book extends ARModel { public function Book ( ) { super ( ) ; this .__table = " books " ; this .__dbName = " db1 " ; } } public class Note extends ARModel { public function Note ( ) { super ( ) ; this .__table = " notes " ; this .__dbName = " db2 " ; } }
The last terror trial at Guantánamo Bay has been halted after the senior military judge dropped charges against a suspect in the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 , the Pentagon has said .
The military prosecution of the suspected al - Qaida bomber Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri was the last active war crimes case at the US navy base in Cuba .
The decision by Susan Crawford , the top legal authority for military trials at Guantánamo , brings all cases into compliance with Barack Obama 's executive order to halt proceedings at the base .
The announcement came on the eve of a meeting at the White House today when the president will hear from the families of those killed in the Cole bombing and in the September 11 attacks .
A Pentagon spokesman said Crawford dismissed the charges against al - Nashiri without prejudice , meaning new charges can be brought later .
He will remain in prison .
" It was her decision , but it reflects the fact that the president has issued an executive order which mandates that the military commissions be halted , pending the outcome of several reviews of our operations down at Guantánamo , " the spokesman said .
The ruling gives the White House time to review the legal cases of all 245 ­terror suspects held at Guantánamo and to decide whether they should be prosecuted in the US or released to other nations .
Seventeen US sailors died on 12 October 2000 when al - Qaida suicide bombers steered an explosives - laden boat into the Cole , a guided - missile destroyer , as it sat in a Yemen port .
The Pentagon charged Nashiri , a Saudi Arabian , last summer with " organising and directing " the bombing and planned to seek the death penalty in the case .
In his 22 January order , Obama promised to shut down the Guantánamo prison within a year .
The order froze all detainees ' legal cases pending a three - month review .
Two military judges granted Obama 's request for delays in their cases .
A third military judge , Colonel James Pohl , defied Obama 's order by scheduling an arraignment for Nashiri , saying that a delay would not be " in the interest of justice " .
That left the decision on whether to continue to Crawford , whose delay on announcing a decision prompted concern at the Pentagon that she would allow the court process to continue .
Last year , al - Nashiri said during a Guantánamo hearing that he confessed to helping plot the Cole bombing only because he was tortured by US interrogators .
The CIA has admitted he was among terror suspects subjected to waterboarding , which simulates drowning , in 2002 and 2003 while being interrogated in secret CIA prisons .
Ahead of today 's meeting , a White House statement said Obama wanted to " talk with these families about resolving the issues involved with closing Guantánamo Bay – while keeping the safety and security of the American people as his top priority . "
Among those due to meet the president is the former commander of the Cole , retired navy commander Kirk Lippold , who has been critical of the decision to close Guantánamo .
" I 'm going to listen , " he said .
" The families have already been through enough .
Do n't put the families through even more of this agony . "
The retired New York fire chief Jim Riches , whose son was killed at the World Trade Centre , is another of those invited .
" My concern is these guys killed my son and I 'd like to see justice served on them , " he said yesterday .
" I 'd like to see Guantánamo stay open but my main concern is that we get the justice we deserve . "
Riches added : " It shows that he 's reaching out to the people .
At least we 'll get to voice our opinion . "
Some family out in Missouri decided five years ago to purchase a cave and build their house in it ... literally .
This 17,000 sq.ft .
house not only has three bedrooms , but a secondary party room and a performing stage (!? ) .

Apparently , this property used to be some sort of musical venue called " Caveland " where the likes of Bob Seger and Ike and Tina Turner ( !?! ) once performed .
As if the story was n't already strange enough , the house is now for sale because the economy crashed and the family can no longer afford their balloon payment mortgage , so their attempting to sell the house for $ 300,000 .
Apparently the house is finished , but most of the photos show the house in an unfinished form .
But whatever , because the main point here is that these people are living in a cave .
And that 's just crazy .

The Year of Indie Games : 2008 ’s Ten Best Independent Games
Posted by Jared Newman
Check out our historic favorites below , then check out the latest headlines with these Video Game videos :
In a year dominated by corporate titles like GTA IV and Fallout 3 , the independent video game industry has begun to strike back .
Designed in basements , bedrooms and offices by small , dedicated startups , indie gaming is about something that many corporate titles have missed – pure , unadulterated fun .
To celebrate the work of the unsung heroes of gaming , here is GearCrave ’s list of the 10 best indie games of 2008 .
Number Ten : ROM CHECK FAIL
Like a bad dream after a long night at the arcade , you ’re at one moment driving the Spy Hunter car and shooting Goombas over the backdrop of a Pac - Man level , when suddenly you hear the crunch of a computer glitch and everything has changed .
Now , you ’re Mario , trying to stomp Space Invaders in a maze of Arkanoid bricks .
It ’s a hilarious mashup that tests not only primitive gaming skills , but the ability to change gears at a moment ’s notice .
[ Free Download ]
Number Nine : N +
The instant replay mode of this platform jumper is a testament to the impressive ninja skills you ’ll be showing off in every level .
With speed , timing and the ability to jump from walls , your tiny avatar narrowly avoids rockets , lasers , machine guns and electric drones , all in the name of reaching the next exit as quickly as possible .
[ $ 10 Xbox Live , $ 20 DS and PSP ]
Number Eight : You Have to Burn the Rope
It ’s pointless to read too deeply into this two - minute flash gag and its eponymous hand - holding .
But maybe Swedish developer Kian Bashiri is right about games becoming too easy .
Yes , you have to burn the rope to beat the boss .
Also , YHTBTR has the catchiest credits theme song since Portal .
[ Free Flash ]
Number Seven : Gravitation
Jason Rohrer ’s breakout game , Passage , dug deep and jumpstarted his career of using computer games to make small , abstract gestures instead of sweeping blockbusters .
Gravitation sports the same simple play mechanics and intentionally pixilated graphics , but with a “ Cat ’s In The Cradle ” message that ’s typically unfound in game culture .
That ’s because Rohrer proudly exists outside of it .
[ Free Download ]
Number Six : “ The C Word ” ( NSFW )
The game that gets its name for a part of the female anatomy , and features a part of the male anatomy attacking it , is fiendishly fun .
Too bad you ca n’t play it around anyone who is n’t in on the joke .
Edmund McMillen created this shoot - em - up mostly to assert his artistic independence , but he suggests there could be subconscious hints of misogyny lurking about .
No kidding .
[ Free Flash ]
Number Five : Aether
Because it would n’t be fair to present only McMillen ’s sick side , Aether is a meditation on the dangers of introversion .
A boy meets a monster when delving into his own imagination , and together they swing from planet to planet , encountering happy - looking , but deeply disturbed creatures at every turn .
The looping soundtrack is appropriately dreamy .
[ Free Flash , or check out McMillen ’s compilation CD for $ 10 ]
Number Four : Crayon Physics Deluxe
The imagination runs wild in this physics puzzle game , in which you draw ramps , see - saws , pulleys and big , swinging hammers to move a ball around the screen .
Each level captures that youthful sense of wonder , where anything seems possible .
Even though the PC version does n’t drop until this week , we ’re counting this one because of its late - December iPhone port .
And because it ’s awesome .
[ Pre-order for $ 19.95 ]
Number Three : Karoshi 2.0
The expanded version of Karoshi , which is Japanese for “ death from overwork , ” has little respect for the fourth wall or other standard gaming conventions .
The goal of killing yourself in each level starts with a few cathartic leaps onto spikes , but quickly becomes a game of developer vs. player .
Do n’t be surprised when you ’re booted out to Windows , only to move your mouse and have the game launch again while being told that the joke ’s on you .
[ Free Download ]
Number Two : Braid
Braid is this year ’s golden boy of indie games , garnering buzz phrases like “ long - awaited ” that are typically reserved for AAA titles .
The hype is justified though , as this title plays on the platform genre with mind - bending time manipulation puzzles .
The plot , of a man who wonders about changing the past in the wake of lost love , is masterfully applied .
[ $ 15 on Xbox Live ]
Number One : World of Goo
No game in 2008 so deftly combined all the things that we love about indie games .
The task of stacking goo balls into wobbling towers and connecting them to drainage pipes is easy to learn but ruthlessly difficult by the game ’s end .
Wry humor and a cartoon art style make World of Goo personable , and its download - only availability for the Wii hints at a retail - free future where even the little guy can shine .

A new study in Psychology of Women Quarterly explored the outcomes of sexual harassment on both boys and girls .
While girls were harassed more frequently , boys were indirectly yet negatively affected through a school climate that tolerates the harassment of girls .
The study , led by Alayne J. Ormerod , PhD , of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , examined the relationship among peer - to - peer sexual harassment , school climate , adult - to - student harassment , and outcomes for the students .
Approximately 300 girls and 250 boys were surveyed from seven public high schools in the Midwest .
Girls had more frequent , upsetting experiences of peer harassment .
Girls also reported more frequent and distressing harassment from school personnel than boys .
Male students reported fewer , less upsetting experiences of harassment .
Consequently , they had fewer stress - related consequences directly associated with harassment .
However , the damaging effects of harassment extended beyond those who were directly harmed by it .
For girls and boys , a school climate associated with experiences of sexual harassment was related to feeling unsafe while at school , withdrawal from school , and feelings of lowered self - esteem .
For boys , a negative climate , that is , a climate tolerating the harassment of girls , was the major variable associated with negative psychological , health and educational outcomes .
Given that boys are harassed less frequently and rate their experiences as less upsetting , these findings suggest that boys may suffer negative consequences regardless of whether they are the targets of harassment .
“ We hope these findings inform teachers , administrators , and policy makers for high schools when they develop policy and procedures related to sexual harassment , ” the authors conclude .
“ When students believe that teachers and administrators do not actively intervene in harassing behavior toward girls , it has negative consequences for all students : both boys and girls , and targets and non-targets . ”
This study is published in the June 2008 issue of Psychology of Women Quarterly .
Comet 96P / Machholz ( lower left ) comes very close to the Sun , whose light is blocked in this 2002 image taken by the SOHO spacecraft ( Image : SOHO / LASCO / ESA / NASA )
A comet orbiting our Sun may be an interloper from another star system .
Comet Machholz 1 is n’t like other comets .
David Schleicher of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona , measured the chemical makeup of 150 comets , and found that they all had similar levels of the chemical cyanogen ( CN ) except for Machholz 1 , which has less than 1.5 % of the normal level .
Along with some other comets , it is also low on the molecules carbon 2 and carbon 3 .
Schleicher suggests three possible explanations .
Advertisement
The simplest is that Machholz 1 could have formed in an extremely cold region of the solar system .
The other comets depleted in carbon 2 and carbon 3 are thought to have formed in the chilly outer regions of the Kuiper belt far beyond Neptune , where the low temperatures mean that most carbon gets trapped in other molecules .
“ In really extreme cold , maybe the cyanogen goes away as well ? ” says Schleicher .
Hurled out
A second possibility is suggested by the comet ’s peculiar orbit .
Machholz 1 approaches very close to the Sun on its orbit , closer even than Mercury , so it is possible that repeated baking by the Sun ’s heat has removed most of its cyanogen .
But a more exciting idea is that Machholz 1 is an alien .
“ An extrasolar origin makes it easy to explain the composition – of course we ’d expect everything to be different , ” Schleicher told New Scientist .
“ Here , three molecules with carbon are all depleted , so maybe carbon is depleted across the board ?
That sounds to me as if it came from somewhere else and is not just an oddball from our solar system . ”
Astronomers expect some comets to be hurled out of their stellar systems by the gravity of giant planets .
In theory , they should be wandering around out there , and sometimes come flying though our system – although no comet has yet been found moving fast enough to be identified as an extrasolar interloper .
If Machholz 1 did fly in from interstellar space , a chance encounter with Jupiter could have made it a captive of our solar system .
This would be an extraordinary discovery , but much more evidence is needed before the alien origin is any more than a hypothesis .
Fortunately , Machholz 1 will be close to the Sun again in 2012 , when astronomers can study its bright coma of gases again .
David Jewitt of the University of Hawaii is happier with the data than with Schleicher ’s conclusions .
“ The question is how to make the jump from measuring chemical depletions to a conclusion about where the comet originated , ” he told New Scientist .
“ We do n’t know enough to do that with any certainty .
Still , the observational result is a good one and Dave ’s speculation about the source of the comet is very . . . stimulating . ”

You Do n’t Have To Be Human To Be Family
Ask any pet parent .
Our pets are our furry children , beloved members of our family .
We love them dearly and we want to give them the best possible life .
The Sun first reported the story on Friday
Alfie Patten may not be a father at 13 after all , amid allegations that the mother has had several other sexual partners , it has been reported .
The case of Alfie — who was just 12 when the baby was conceived — has already provoked a fierce political debate over the high rate of teenage pregnancies in the UK and the sexualisation of children .
But two other teenagers believe they may have fathered six - day old Maisie , whose mother Chantelle Steadman is herself just 15 .
Richard Goodsell ( 16 ) told the News of the World that he also slept with the teenager at her home in Eastbourne , East Sussex , at around the time she became pregnant .
Richard , a trainee chef , said : “ I know I could be the father .
Everyone thinks I am .
My friends all tell me that the baby has my eyes — even my mum thinks so .
“ Even Chantelle ’s mum asked me if I was the father .
“ If I am the father , I have the right to know . ”
Richard , who told the paper he slept with Chantelle with the consent of her parents and without using any contraception , said he plans to demand a DNA test .
Chantelle lives with her mother , Penny , and father , Steve , in the Old Town area of the city .
Tyler Barker ( 14 ) also told the paper he could have fathered Maisie , born at the Eastbourne District General Hospital last week .
He said he slept with Chantelle around nine months ago , again in her own bed .
Realising the gravity of the situation , he added : “ I hope it ’s not me . ”
Both boys and their parents are reported to have made sworn statements in front of a solicitor detailing their encounters with Chantelle .
The situation has provoked outrage from politicians and charity workers who said it exemplified the “ complete collapse ” of parts of society .
Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith , who runs the Centre for Social Justice think tank , said the birth highlighted another case of “ broken Britain ” where “ anything goes ” .
He said : “ It ’s not being accusative , it ’s about pointing out the complete collapse in some parts of society of any sense of what ’s right and wrong .
“ There is no opprobrium any more about behaviour and quite often children witness behaviour

It ’s as if no - one is saying this is wrong . ”
Tory leader David Cameron said children having children was “ worrying ” and that parenthood should not be something they should even be contemplating .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown did not comment directly on the case but said “ all of us would want to avoid teenage pregnancies ” .
Meanwhile , Tony Kerridge , of the sexual health specialist Marie Stopes International , said children needed better education to develop aspirations and avoid a life of poverty .
Society should be encouraging young people to have bigger aspirations than simply to slip into a benefits culture lifestyle , he added .
Both Chantelle and Alfie have been kept hidden from the media glare since bringing Maisie home from hospital last week .
Alfie , who stands just 4ft tall and looks young for his 13 years , has said he plans to stand by and support Chantelle with the baby .
However the schoolboy , who lives with his mother , Nicola , in nearby Hailsham , admitted that he did not know how he would be able to support them financially .
Sussex Police has said no action will be taken , with it “ not in anyone ’s interests ” to prosecute .
East Sussex County Council said the teenage parents would be supported with intensive monitoring and health visitor support .

Despite the tanking economy and an increasing number of video game - industry layoffs , many believe 2009 will be a year of evolution for games .
The combination of innovative new titles , long - awaited franchise follow - ups and desire for escapism could spawn a gaming renaissance .
" While game makers providing traditional retail product will continue to concentrate on high - profile sequels and licensed properties in an effort to mitigate risk , many of the field 's most exciting developments will actually be happening outside of your local GameStop , " said DigitalTrends.com publisher Scott Steinberg .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
By focusing on sure - fire sequels that are appearing on next - generation consoles for the first time - like Resident Evil 5 , Street Fighter IV and God of War III - gaming publishers are expected to avoid economic pitfalls while independent developers are poised to provide cheaper , quicker and quirkier alternatives , such as low - cost downloadable games like Flower for the PlayStation 3 or Darwinia Plus for the Xbox 360 .
" Why pay $ 60 for a game you do n't have time to play anyway when dozens of bite - sized , instantly intuitive and schedule friendly alternatives are available for $ 5 to $ 15 right from your couch ? " muses Steinberg .
Steinberg also anticipates even more developers will extend their games ' out - of - the - box life with downloadable content .
Rockstar Games is set to release The Lost and Damned exclusively on Xbox Live on February 17 .
The Grand Theft Auto IV expansion will add new content and hours of gameplay to last year 's top - selling action game .
Several grander gaming innovations were teased at last week 's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
Sony showcased 3D editions of such games as MotorStorm : Pacific Rift and Wipeout HD while Microsoft introduced Kodu , a downloadable Windows PC and Xbox 360 program that allows amateurs - from children to adults - to create their own games .
" Video games are poised to eclipse all other forms of entertainment in the decade ahead , " Activision president and CEO Mike Griffith proclaimed during his CES keynote speech .
He cited market statistics which stated that between 2003 and 2007 , the cumulative number of movie ticket sales and hours of television watched fell by 6 per cent , music sales slumped 12 per cent and DVD purchases remained flat .
Over the same four - year period , Griffith said the gaming business grew by 40 per cent .
With long - awaited exclusive PC sequels like Diablo III , The Sims 3 and StarCraft II also expected in 2009 , this could be the year when gamers pay attention to something other than World of Warcraft on their computers .
According to Nielsen Media Research , gamers spent 24 fewer hours a week playing PC games in 2008 than they did the previous year .
Rob Talbert , gaming manager and host of Arcade on ManiaTV.com , longs for PC gaming to prosper in 2009 .
" I think I speak for a good portion of the gaming community when I say that it 's very possible that 2009 will be the year that PC gaming makes a comeback in a big way , " said Talbert .
" I can't remember the last time I have seen this much excitement over PC titles , and I hope these games can live up to the hype and the gaming community 's expectations . "
Wedbush Morgan video game analyst Michael Pachter describes his outlook for the gaming industry in 2009 with one word : discovery .
He believes the increasing number of diverse console owners , especially those with Nintendo Wiis , will demand new software - and publishers will figure out how to directly market their wares to such folks in exciting new ways .
" They must discover how to reach those audiences , " said Pachter .
" It 's not like they wo n't want new games . "

THE TIMES ’ word of choice for one of the most destructive weeks in L.A. 's history — from April 29 to May 4 , 1992 , when more than 50 people died , thousands were injured and hundreds of millions of dollars in property was destroyed — is “ riot . ”
The Times has used “ riot ” for the Rodney G. King verdict furor well over 1,000 times since then .
Webster ’s defines “ riot ” as “ a raucous or violent disturbance of the public peace by three or more persons assembled for a common private purpose . ”
By comparison , the politically neutral words “ disturbance ” and “ unrest ” have been used as the primary name about 60 times combined .
The terms “ rebellion ” and “ uprising ” were favored by those who saw a purposeful political message in the tumult , but The Times has used them rarely ( often in direct quotes or letters to the editor ) .
“ If you call it a riot , ” Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - Los Angeles ) said at the time , “ it sounds like it was just a bunch of crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason .
I maintain it was somewhat understandable , if not acceptable .
So I call it a rebellion . ”
Another characterization of the L.A. turmoil came a year after the disturbances , when writer Ruben Martinez told PBS : " [ It ] was a riot and a rebellion and an insurrection and an uprising .
It was part bread riot at times .
It was at times a Hollywood riot , just staged purely for spectacle a giant piece of performance art that only L.A. could have created . ”
Of all the names floating around for what many simply called “ the events , ” perhaps the least judgmental is the Korean term of choice : sa - i - gu , or 4 - 2 - 9 .

SHANGHAI / BEIJING , Jan 23 ( Reuters ) - China will make clear its displeasure at U.S. accusations of currency manipulation but hold its anger in check in the belief that President Barack Obama is simply posturing , Chinese analysts said on Friday .
Timothy Geithner , Obama ’s choice to head the U.S. Treasury , said the president believes China is “ manipulating ” the yuan , a loaded term that the Bush administration had deliberately avoided even as it criticised Beijing ’s exchange rate policy .
The People ’s Bank of China , the central bank , had noted the comments by Geithner , a central bank official told Reuters on Friday .
“ We have reported them to relevant government departments and are awaiting a response , ” the official said , declining to elaborate .
Under U.S. law , formally labelling China a currency manipulator would require the Treasury to begin “ expedited ” negotiations with Beijing to reduce China ’s huge trade surplus with the United States and eliminate any “ unfair ” currency advantage .
“ China is going to be extremely unhappy , to say the least , ” Tao Xie , an expert on Sino - U.S. relations at the Beijing Foreign Studies University .
“ For administration officials , I do not think any one has ever pointed a finger so strongly at China . ”
Chinese anger at Geithner ’s choice of words , written in response to questions at his Senate nomination hearing , will add to simmering tensions over the global financial crisis .
“ President Obama -- backed by the conclusions of a broad range of economists -- believes that China is manipulating its currency , ” Geithner wrote .
Chinese officials have accused the United States of regulatory failings that sparked the meltdown .
When Henry Paulson , former U.S. Treasury chief , said that the high Chinese savings rate had helped sow the seeds of the crisis , a firestorm of criticism ensued in China .
U.S. Treasury bond prices fell on worries that China might respond to Geithner ’s frank comments by cutting its holdings , the world ’s largest , of U.S. government debt .
But Yi Xianrong , a finance professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , said such concerns were premature .
“ They will not take the remarks very seriously , ” Yi said , referring to the foreign ministry and central bank .
“ We will only try to understand their real stance via diplomatic channels , ” he added .
“ If they really resort to diplomatic tactics to intervene , we will take measures to respond . ”
FLEXIBILITY
Geithner , head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , said the Obama administration would “ aggressively ” use all its diplomatic tools to press Beijing on currency reform , but he also signalled some flexibility and patience .
“ The question is how and when to broach the subject in order to do more good than harm , ” Geithner said .
That hedging could suggest a more moderate approach .
The first real test will come in a semi-annual Treasury Department report , due in April , on whether other countries manipulate their foreign exchange regimes .
“ Obama will be too busy in his first 100 days to take on China , ” Xie said .
“ If he really wants to induce China to do something , he should do it in private , not in a public confrontational way . ”
The yuan CNY=CFXS edged down against the dollar on Friday after traders concluded that China might usher in a period of mild depreciation as a shot across Washington 's bow .
“ Such U.S. comments , if they become an official policy , will only lead to tit - for - tat moves from the Chinese side , ” said a dealer at a major European bank in Shanghai .
A Reuters poll earlier this month forecast that the yuan would remain virtually fixed in place this year at 6.83 to the dollar as China walks a tightrope between slowing growth at home and fears about a backlash abroad if it pushed through a significant depreciation .
The yuan has been stable against the dollar for six months but broader strength in the U.S. currency has put upward pressure on China ’s trade - weighted exchange rate , Capital Economics , a London consultancy , noted in a report .
Chinese exports have fallen for two straight months , which , coupled with a domestic property slump , dragged down the economy ’s growth to a seven - year low of 9.0 percent last year .

It was the mid-1990's and business was booming at the company that Terry worked at .
It was booming so much that the existing process of entering an order — faxing in an order form torn out of an outdated - as - soon - as - it - was - printed catalog — was delaying things enough that it was costing the company some serious dough in missed sales .
Needing a way to re-engineer the process without hiring an army of support staff , management decided on an innovative plan that would enable customers to place orders electronically without needing to contact customer service .
With resources being tight ( even the help desk was fielding order inquiries ) , management decided to farm out the work to an outside IT firm .
Now , important work like this was n't going to be farmed out to the boss 's nephew who was a whiz at programming in Word and Excel .
Instead they were going with a big name , " we named our building after ourselves " company .
Yes it would be expensive , but the money that could be saved by receiving orders this new way would allow the program to more than pay for itself in short order .
Terry , a senior developer for the existing inventory ordering system , acted as a liason between his company and the technical manager who oversaw a team of consultants at the firm .
The initial meetings to define requirements went ok .
Terry had done his homework and came prepared with screen mockups and specs of how to hook into their existing system .
During the meetings , the Project Manager and Technical Lead would reply with head nods and the occasional " Um-hm ...yes , this is doable ... um - hm " .
The estimates came back and Terry 's company provided the capital to get everything going .
Everything appeared to be humming along fairly smoothly .
Soon , the consultants were ready to deliver the fruits of their labor .
In the final meeting , the Project Manager went on about how the application would " maximize positive customer synergies " and provide " value added cross- functional , intra-business combinations " .
Through the marketing mumbo- jumbo , Terry was happy when he saw two things - the UI looked good and the application ( though working against a set of test data ) seemed to run smoothly .
The consultants delivered the code and Terry was on his way .
Under the Hood
As a cost saving measure , Terry 's company planned to start with with a much - simplified version of what they actually wanted .
By starting out with code developed by a top - notch IT firm , any flaws or minor enhancements could be easily tweaked .
Plus , it just cost less for a salaried developer to make a data field label in italics or move a button a few pixels .
A month or two , tops , of polishing up would make it shine out as being a crown jewel for Terry 's company and save them millions .
At first glance of the source , Terry thought that the application must have been written by gurus placed so high in that crystalline building of theirs that their logic transcended that of mere humans .
They were very expensive , were prominantly placed , and therefore the best ... right ?
Instead , upon further review , the end product that Terry only had to " polish up " was more likely a result of the developers not getting enough oxygen in that high rise of theirs .
Following is how the order process worked .
Aftermath
Once the inner workings of the program were explained to management , the project was scrapped in favor of implementing a simple PDF catalog on CD where a customer would fill out a paper form and fax it into the order processing center where it would be hand entered .
It is hoped that by not having to print paper catalogs that the six figure cost of development can be recovered ... eventually .
( Some makes and models of cars mentioned have been omitted to protect the guilty ! )
I ’m going to sound like a conspiracy theorist – it ’s my grumpy rant about oil - change interval for our much beloved automobiles .
I do n’t know why , but I get terribly bugged by this every time I happen to buy a new car – which I did last month .
I just feel liked being “ bullied ” into not making the right decisions about our environment and my pocket book .
For years , the recommended oil change interval for gas - powered cars in the US has been every 3,000 miles .
This 3,000 miles interval is so well programmed into the psyche of the driving public that for many , drivers , mechanics , and dealers alike , it ’s sacrosanct .
I ’m trying to break a superstitious habit .
Let ’s start with the fundamentals – why we need to change the oil in the engine ?
Because oil gets “ used up . ”
This means that after being in the engine crankcase , churned at high temperature by the crankshaft and circulated throughout the bearings , it will eventually lose it ’s lubrication quality .
This lost of lubrication is due to contamination from the engine ( anti- freeze , unburned gasoline , metallic particulates from the bearing ) and physical destruction of the oil molecules due to intense heat and sheer forces which the oil is subjected to .
But why 3,000 miles ?
This number has been considered the useful life of the oil and everyone who is alive today seem to know that number from “ way back when I first learn to drive ! ”
Some 30 years ago , it was brought to my attention that we in the US may have been taken for a ride .
A visiting scholar from the UK decided to buy a car while he and his family were in the US so they could see the country .
He bought the same car ( make and model ) as his own at home as he ’s familiar with it .
As the shade - tree mechanic at that institute , I was asked to help him check out his find .
His first question after scanning through the US version of the owner ’s manual was why the recommendation to change oil very 3,000 miles whereas the identical model he owned in the UK had a recommendation of 7,500 miles interval .
Oh really ?
I did an informal survey among our overseas visitors from Germany , Japan , UK and France and indeed everyone said that their oil change intervals at home were anywhere from 5,000 miles to 10,000 miles .
So , was their oil better than ours ?
Is their driving conditions less demanding ?
Are their gasoline ( petrol ) cleaner ?
The answers were no , no , and no .
Car owners outside the US were just not brainwashed with the superstition that oil only lasts 3,000 miles .
15 years ago – I bought myself a brand new luxury car and the recommended oil change interval list in the users manual was every 7,500 miles !
Wow .. finally ?
But no – after signing all the papers for the purchase , I was introduced to the service manager and the first thing he reminded me was to make sure I bring the car back every 3,000 miles for an oil change !
No , no , no ..
I protested – the manufacturer recommended 7,500 .
I also found out that the same car sold in it ’s native country of Japan ( but under a different make and model name ) had a recommended oil change interval of 15,000 kilometers ( almost 10,000 miles . )
So , nice Mr Service manager started to explain to me why I should ignore the manufacturer ’s recommendation and get the oil changed every 3,000 miles .
It ’s CHEAP INSURANCE to protect an expensive car .
I was not convinced – and assured him that I will bring my car back to his dealership every 7,500 miles for an oil change – and since they have very good record keeping , I do n’t expect them to hassle me about my warranty if anything goes wrong with the fine engine during the warranty period .
( It also helped that their charge for oil change was only $ 10 more than the neighborhood quick - change outfit and they thrown in a free rental car for the day and they wash my luxury - mobile before I pick it up – so it worth taking it to them . )
But after each oil change , they put a sticker on my window to bring the car back after 3,000 miles – which I duly ignore and brought the car in again at 7,500 mile interval plus or minus 200 miles .
They never harassed me again for a couple of years until a new service manager came on board and he started all over again about bringing the car in very 3,000 miles .
In the last 50 years , technologies we encountered in every aspects of our lives have improved greatly – so why not the automobile industry ?
Should n’t oil have a longer useful life now than 50 years ago ?
Should n’t the oil filters be better at removing contaminants from the oil then 50 years ago ?
Should n’t metallurgy have improved the engine bearings ?
Should n’t engines have a much better combustion control systems to keep uncombusted contaminates off the crankcase ?
The answers are of course yes , yes , and yes !
But we are being bullied and intimated by the purveyors of more frequent oil change proponents who have a lot to gain by our acquiescence to their scare tactics ?
To satisfy my own curiosity and to shut Mr Service Manager up , I decided to actually send my oil to a lab to be tested .
There are many laboratories that will test used oil and will give you a list of contaminants and a report of the general health and well being of the engine from which the oil came from .
It only cost about $ 25 and a 4 oz sample of your oil .
Many large fleet owners use these labs rather than depend on mileage or hours of operations to determine when oil should be changed .
( Google “ oil analysis ” and you ’ll find these companies . )
When my luxury mobile had about 120,000 miles , I sent in a sample each at 3,000 , 5,000 and 7,000 miles after the oil change .
The results that came back was astonishing and very educational .
It showed that all the 3 samples had pretty much identical metallic contamination – very very low – indicating very little wearing of the engine .
They all indicated no anti-freeze – indicating that the head gaskets were good and the integrity of the engine block .
The oil analysis report also indicated no gasoline contamination – indicating that the piston rings and combustion metering was perfect .
Most importantly , the report indicated that all three samples showed very little change in viscosity over the period of use , indicating that the oil had not deteriorated .
I shared the reports with the service manager , buttering him up with kudos for the fine engineering of the brand ’s car engine .
He was satisfied that I ’m not ruining the car by changing oil every 7,500 miles – I claim that I could have gone another 7,500 miles with the state of the oil they just poured out .
But the saga continues .
At 200,000 miles , with the car in almost mint condition and engine purring like a kitten , I traded it in for a Hybrid .
( I missed my 14 - speaker , power - everything luxury - mobile but changing from a 15 mpg to 50 mpg commute - mobile was good for my pocket book and green - conscience . )
My new hybrid came with a factory recommendation of 10,000 miles between oil change .
Hallelujah – amazing – a manufacturer finally stepped up to the plate and is willing to say that oil chemistry , engines control and fluid filtering technologies have improved and we do n’t have to waste oil changing it so often when it ’s obviously not needed .
But guess what , after the first 10,000 miles with the hybrid , when I brought it in for its first oil change , I was accosted by the service manager who tried to convince and cajole ( more like cohere and threaten ) me into bringing it in for oil changes every 3,000 miles !
No .. No.. NO ..
I protested – unless he can show me a recall notice , service bulletin or service manual addendum from the manufacturer , I will stay with the recommendation printed in the users manual .
So , I duly took the hybrid in to the dealer every 10,000 miles for the oil change and they duly slap a next - service reminder sticker after each service to come back in 3,000 miles , which I duly ignore !
Last month , I succumbed to the ultra-cuteness of the Smart Car “ fortwo ” model ( even the model name is too cute ! ) and bought one .
The overjoy salesman was more than eager to tell me all the great things about the little bugsy looking two - seater – the highlight of which was that it only needs service ( ie oil change ) every 10,000 miles .
I starred at him with a look of incredulity !
“ Yea , that ’s what you and the manual say , but what would your service manager tell me ? ” I hissed .
So , we walked over to the service manager ’s office and I asked him directly to which he replied “ we do what the service manual says and if it says oil change every 10,000 miles , then every 10,000 miles it is . ”
Now , that ’s different .. but we ’ll see .
I only have 950 miles on the little thing and when I bring it back at 10,000 , I know if he really meant it .
So , if I were to make this 3,000 mile oil change nonsense into a conspiracy , who is perpetuating it and who benefits from perpetuating it ?
Every good conspiracy theory has to have a beneficiary ( usually the US Government , Big - Pharma , etc )
The three obvious suspects are 1 ) Oil Companies , 2 ) Car manufacturer and 3 ) Oil Change service industry including car dealerships .
Oil companies are one of the least beloved industries in this country so it ’s tempting but as I see it , we can not hang this one on them .
Yes , they ’ll sell more oil if we change more often but they can charge more for longer lasting oil .
In fact many brands proudly tout that you can leave their oil in for 25,000 miles and more .
It is in their interest to flaunt how good their oil is and give customers more confidence in using their brand .
They make money charging 5 times more for oil that will last 3 time longer .
It ’s good profit for them .
Car manufactures are recommending longer and longer intervals between oil changes .
Intervals of 5,000 , 7,500 mile intervals are very common and many are recommending 10,000 miles intervals .
They understand that their engines are much better made than 50 years ago with higher quality material , more accurate fuel / air mixing resulting in cleaner burning engines .
Since they have to underwrite the warranty for their engines , it is in their interest to recommend the longest possible interval they can statistically justify .
So , if they recommend 10,000 miles you can be assured that it will be good , for the penalty is on them to fix a bad engine at a cost to them financially and more importantly , their reputation .
Oil Change businesses are the only ones to lose if you change your oil less often .
As car engines become more and more reliable ; as computer technology took over more and more of the engine control , there is less and less things that are repairable in the engine .
The modern automobile engines are now so complicated and computerized that most of the problem can only be diagnosed by specialized computers and software , specialized for a particular make and model of the engine .
This means that dealers are doing most of the repairs but even then , with the reliability , their main income stream may well be the “ routine ” maintenance , oil change being one of them .
They want to scare you into bringing your car back for more “ routine ” maintenance .
The street corner gas station has long gotten out of the repair or maintenance business .
The “ quick - change - while - U- wait ” is the fast - food equivalent for the auto - industry and is entirely dependent on routine maintenance .
They really really want ( need ) you to visit them every 3,000 miles to stay in business .
In addition to changing oil , they will also try to sell you additives for every liquid in your car .
They will try to convince the naive and uninitiated to buy the additives and come back more often for oil changes by showing them how “ discolored ” the oils are compared to new clear right off the can samples .
How else can “ Quicklee Lube ” charge only $ 19.95 for an oil change ?
Note : discoloration of your engine oil after even a mile of driving is not an indication of anything special !
Seriously , I do n’t know if there really is a conspiracy perpetrated by the oil change businesses .
It is really up to us consumers to rid ourselves of this superstition that oil formulated by laboratories with 21st Century know - how and used in engines with advance electronic management can only be good only for 3,000 miles .
The manufacturers know better – go with their recommendation for they have everything to lose by recommending too long an interval .
If there is a problem with what they recommend in the owners manual , they will have a service bulletin issued to the dealers and an amendment to your manual .
Do n’t waste oil – yes , I know they get recycled but why waste the resources to recycle more oil than is needed .
And especially for your pocket book and inconvenience , why change oil 2 or 3 times more frequent than is really needed .

I 've been smoking weed for about 3 in a half years so i know what to do to get high without smoking it .... - make sure your in a room filled with the smoke ( contact high ) and you can just sit with a group of people who are hotboxing and just inhale the smoke - shotgun ; if you do n't know what that is , it 's when a person who takes a hit of weed takes the biggest hit they can and you kiss them and they blow the smoke into your mouth as your inhaling - the worst thing to do which does n't get you high as fast as you would like ( but its another option if you do n't want to shot gun or reek your clothes from hotboxing ) is that you take a bag ( usually a gallon storage bag ) or a bottle ( recommend a water bottle because you can crumple it and expand it easily ) and have the person who is taking the hit blow their smoke into the bag or bottle and seal it as quick as possible so that the smoke does n't escape and just put it to your mouth and inhale until you clear the smoke from it .

Lingering marks on DNA could amplify stress responses .
Victims of childhood abuse can carry chemical changes to their DNA into adulthood .
Punchstock
Suicide victims with a history of abuse during childhood are more likely to carry chemical changes to their DNA that could affect how they respond to stress as adults , a study has found .
Those with no history of childhood abuse did not show the same pattern of DNA modification , and had normal expression of NR3C1 , a gene linked to stress responses .
But the findings do not mean that the effect of childhood abuse is indelible , cautions Joan Kaufman , a psychologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven , Connecticut , who was not involved in the new study .
" The long - term effects of early abuse are not inevitable , " she says , " and the more you understand about the mechanisms of risk , the more you can devise treatments . "
The results , reported today in Nature Neuroscience1 , follow on from work showing that rat pups that are stressed because they were raised by negligent mothers have extra methyl groups in their DNA in a region of the genome that controls expression of Nr3c1 , the equivalent gene in rats .
Such ' methylation ' can reduce gene expression .
NR3C1 encodes a protein expressed in neurons that responds to hormones called glucocorticoids .
Lower expression of NR3C1 could be harmful because reduced responses to these glucocorticoids have been linked to increased stress .
Lasting impressions
To find out whether the results in rodents translated into humans , neurobiologist Michael Meaney of McGill University in Montreal , Canada , and his colleagues collected brain samples from the Quebec Suicide Brain Bank .
The researchers looked at samples from 12 suicide victims with a history of childhood abuse , 12 suicide victims with no history of childhood abuse , and 12 controls who had died suddenly from other causes .
People with a history of childhood abuse had lower levels of glucocorticoid receptors than either people who had not been abused or those who had not committed suicide .
And childhood - abuse victims had a similar methylation pattern to that seen in rats that had been stressed as pups .
These changes are unlikely to be passed on to the next generation , notes Meaney .
Although researchers have not yet looked for effects on egg or sperm DNA , it is doubtful that the changes affect the germline , he says .

Researchers do not yet know whether trauma as an adult produces the same pattern of changes .
There may be times during childhood when the developing brain is particularly responsive to abuse , explains Martin Teicher , director of the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at Harvard Medical School in Belmont , Massachusetts .
Teicher and his collaborators imaged the brains of women who had been victims of child abuse and found that those who were abused between the ages of three and five , or eleven and thirteen , had a smaller hippocampus — a region in the brain that is important for memory and learning — than those who had not been abused2 .
Searching for a way out
Studies in rats have also suggested that the methylation changes can be reversed : if pups reared by negligent mothers are later treated with a chemical that removes DNA methylation , their stress responses return to normal3 .
Victims of childhood abuse can carry chemical changes to their DNA into adulthood .

Such drugs are not ready for use in humans , and could carry unwanted side effects .
But medication may not be the only way to treat victims of child abuse , and DNA methylation was restored to normal in neglected rat pups if those pups were transferred to more attentive mothers .
" Just because there 's a biological effect does n't mean the only way you can intervene with drugs , " says Kaufman .
Psychotherapy , for instance , has been shown to produce chemical changes in the brain , and might be able to reset the methylation pattern , says Meaney .
" A social event got you into it .
Could a social event get you back out ? " , he asks .
" That 's a very viable hypothesis . "
A team of Monash University researchers led by Professor James Whisstock has made a major breakthrough in the international fight against malaria , which claims the life of a child across the world every 30 seconds .
The research , performed in collaboration with Professor John Dalton at the University of Technology , Sydney , provides a new approach to treating and controlling the disease that is contracted by half a billion people and causes around 1 million deaths a year .
The team , based at the Monash University ARC Centre of Excellence in Structural and Functional Microbial Genomics , has been able to deactivate the final stage of the malaria parasite 's digestive machinery , effectively starving the parasite of nutrients and disabling its survival mechanism .
This process of starvation leads to the death of the parasite .
Professor Whisstock said the results had laid the scientific groundwork to further develop a specific class of drugs to treat the disease .
" About forty percent of the world 's population are at risk of contracting malaria .
It is only early days but this discovery could one day provide treatment for some of those 2.5 billion people across the globe , " Professor Whisstock said .
" Drug - resistant malaria is an ever increasing problem , meaning that there is an urgent requirement to develop new therapeutic strategies . "
Researchers used the Australian Synchrotron , located adjacent to Monash University 's Clayton campus .
The results are published today in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A .

Lead author of the research paper , Dr Sheena McGowan , from the Monash University NHMRC program on protease systems biology said their findings prove their concept .
" We had an idea as to how malaria could be starved and we have shown this , chemically , can be done , " Dr McGowan said .
" A single bite from an infected mosquito can transfer the malaria parasite into a human 's blood stream .
The malaria parasite must then break down blood proteins in order to obtain nutrients .
Malaria carries out the first stages of digestion inside a specialised compartment called the digestive vacuole – this can be considered to be like a stomach .
However , the enzyme we have studied ( known as PfA - M1 ) , which is essential for parasite viability , is located outside the digestive vacuole meaning that it is easier to target from a drug perspective . "
This breakthrough is in addition to existing malaria drug discovery research advances at Monash University .
A new drug candidate which aims to provide a single dose cure , discovered by a major international project involving the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences , is currently progressing to first human studies with support from the Medicines for Malaria Venture , Geneva , Switzerland .

The disease

Malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium , which is transmitted via the bites of infected mosquitoes .
In the human body , the parasites multiply in the liver and then infect red blood cells .
Symptoms of malaria include fever , headache and vomiting , and usually appear between 10 and 15 days after the mosquito bite .
If not treated , malaria can quickly become life - threatening by disrupting the blood supply to vital organs .
In many parts of the world the parasites have developed resistance to a number of malaria medicines .
Key interventions to control malaria include : prompt and effective treatment with artemisinin - based combination therapies ; use of insecticidal nets by people at risk ; and indoor residual spraying with insecticide to control the vector mosquitoes .*
The human toll
About 40 per cent of the world 's population , mostly those living in the poorest countries , are at risk of malaria .
Of these 2.5 billion people at risk , more than 500 million become severely ill with malaria every year and up to 2 million can die from the effects of the disease .
The disease is a critical problem in Asia and South America but is especially a serious problem in Africa , where one in every five ( 20 per cent ) of childhood deaths are due to the effects of the disease .
An African child has on average between 1.6 and 5.4 episodes of malaria fever each year .
Every 30 seconds a child dies from malaria .*

Cramer went so far as to call Obama ’s stewardship of our much - needed stimulus package “ a complete and utter disappointment . ”
He ’s letting congressional Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid fill the bill with pork instead of the $ 300 billion to $ 400 billion in infrastructure spending we expected .
No , for building bridges and roads , we got just $ 30 billion instead .
The jobs that were supposed to be created and the business that was supposed to be “ stimulated ” – all of the above - mentioned sectors and more – are n’t happening here at home .
At least not yet .
So there had to be another reason for today ’s gains .
Enter China .
Under the threat of social unrest – because the Chinese Communist Party ’s last bit of legitimacy hangs solely on delivering upward mobility to its citizens – leaders have taken a “ kitchen sink ” approach to rejuvenating its ailing economy .
And in addition to that “ by any means necessary ” mentality is an open wallet .
China ’s spending more on updating just its telecommunications infrastructure than the U.S. is on its entire infra build - out .
That ’s why Cisco Systems was up despite a downbeat outlook and Qualcomm recovered so quickly from the Goldman Sachs downgrade .
Right now , China seems to outweigh any problems here at home for these companies .
The same kind of action can be seen in oil and agriculture .
U.S. oil companies say that crude ’s decline is done , but it is n’t our demand that put the floor in .
Agriculture firms are n’t getting grain orders from domestic poultry and beef producers , but Bunge is seeing strength in soybeans .
As a result , all of the fertilizer , seed and agriculture - equipment stocks are up .
Who ’s to blame ?
Cramer says China .
But that ’s not the only proof that China ’s on the move .
The Baltic Freight Index , which is a good indicator of China ’s commodity demand , has more than doubled since the beginning of the year .
The Chinese stock market is up 15 % over the same period .
( And if China ’s market predicted an economic slowdown six months before it happened , why would n’t that market predict an upturn ? )
The demand for minerals is rising , which might explain the bottom in copper .
The Chinese are also ordering iron ore , a market from which they ’ve long been absent .
And the recently announced power shortage could mean they ’ll build more power plants , boosting business for our coal and steel companies .
Maybe that ’s why those stocks have been doing so well lately .
It ’s not that the U.S. is devoid of any stock market leadership .
But Cramer feels more confident about Mosaic , Deere , Nucor , Schlumberger , even the iShares FTSE / Xinhua China 25 ETF , the China plays , than he does about Wal - Mart , Mastercard , Visaor his Four Horsemen of Tech – Apple , Research in Motion , Google and Amazon.com .
These more pure American plays , so to speak , just do n’t have the government sponsorship that China ’s offering right now .
Even though that ’s what President Obama has been promising since he got elected .
Therefore , because China is behind everything that ’s working in this market , “ it 's China we should be focused on , ” Cramer said , “ not our leaders in Washington . ”
Cramer ’s charitable trust owns Qualcomm .

Thousands of inmates rioted at the Reeves County Detention Center in Texas on Saturday , the second disturbance at the prison facility in the last two months .
As many as 2,080 inmates from two of the center 's three buildings began fighting in the prison yard about 4:30 p.m. CT , said county Sheriff 's Office Dispatcher Anna Granado .
Authorities from several law enforcement agencies responded to quell the violence .
However , officials had not brought the unrest under control as of 1 a.m.
Sunday , according to the sheriff 's office .
Officials said they do not know what prompted the riots .
Three inmates were hospitalized , including one with a severed finger , the sheriff 's office said .
On December 12 , inmates took two workers hostage and set fire to the recreation area at the center in Pecos , located about 430 miles west of Dallas .

Amid growing alarm over drug violence in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , the Mexican government will deploy as many as 5,000 more troops to the border city , officials said Thursday .
The increase would triple the number of troops and federal police officers operating there as part of President Felipe Calderon ’s offensive against drug traffickers .
Ciudad Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said the added troops would give the military a higher profile by taking control of police functions , including street patrols .
Currently , soldiers tend highway checkpoints , guard crime scenes and take part in special operations , such as house searches .
The city is without a police chief .
Roberto Orduña
Cruz quit last week after several officers were slain and someone posted threats saying more would be killed unless he stepped down .
On Wednesday , top Mexican security officials traveled to Ciudad Juarez to reassure local leaders and vowed to significantly boost the federal presence .
A little more than 2,000 soldiers and 425 federal police officers are assigned to Juarez in addition to local police , army spokesman Enrique Torres said .
He said the reinforcements could begin to arrive in two weeks .
The move would represent a continuation of Calderon ’s strategy of relying on the army and federal police to counter drug - trafficking gangs in the country ’s main smuggling corridors .
He had deployed 45,000 soldiers and 5,000 police officers across the nation as part of the crackdown , launched two years ago .
The offensive has sparked shootouts between soldiers and traffickers and triggered vicious fighting between drug gangs that has propelled the country ’s fast - climbing death toll .
More than 6,000 people were slain in 2008 , and the figure has exceeded 900 this year , according to unofficial tallies by the news media .
Ciudad Juarez , which had about 1,600 killings last year , has been on edge over the police chief ’s resignation and threats that appeared over the weekend against the mayor .
Reyes and other officials have described the police slayings and threats as “ acts of terrorism . ”
In a radio interview Thursday , Reyes said the city ’s 1,600 - member police force was too small even before officers were ordered to double up in patrol cars after the recent threats .
A beefed - up military contingent will help combat other crimes , such as robberies , kidnappings and extortion , the mayor said .
Reyes has vowed to continue trying to clean up the city ’s corruption - laden police force , which , like many in Mexico , has been infiltrated by drug smugglers .

Were the stories of Jesus ' life copied
from the Egyptian God Horus ' life ?
The Eye of Horus
Quotations :
" The Christian myths were first related of Horus or Osiris , who was the embodiment of divine goodness , wisdom , truth and purity ... This was the greatest hero that ever lived in the mind of man -- not in the flesh -- the only hero to whom the miracles were natural because he was not human . "
Gerald Massey ( 1828-1907 ) , poet , amateur Egyptologist , and author of " The Natural Genesis , " 1
" None of the attempts made by sceptics [ sic ] to demonstrate that Christianity is false because it contains alleged pagan elements is credible or convincing . "

A biblical qotation : Hosea 13:4 : King James Version . " ... I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt , and thou shalt know no god but me : for there is no saviour beside me . "
Young 's Literal Translation : " And I [ am ] Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt , And a God besides
Me thou dost not know , And a Saviour -- there is none save Me . "
Some interpret this passage as implying that Yahweh was originally an Egyptian pagan deity who the ancient Hebrews renamed and started worshiping while they were in Egypt .
However , the usual interpretation of this passage is that the ancient Hebrews learned about Yahweh independently of the Egyptian polytheistic religion , when they were in exile in Egypt .
They adopted him as their sole deity to be worshipped ever since .

Overview :
Some skeptics have suggested that there was , in ancient times , a shared supply of religious myths circulating throughout much of the Mediterranean area , the Middle East and beyond .
They suggest that ancient and modern religions have adopted material from these stories about heroes , saviors , and god-men .
Although their claims have been largely discredited , the Zeitgeist Movie resurrected them .
In the following YouTube video , some of the alleged correspondences are listed , involving : Horus ( Egyptian ) , Attis ( Greek & Phrygia ) , Krishna ( India ) , Dionysus ( Greece ) , Mithra ( Persia ) :

One of the more controversial theories -- sometimes called the " copycat thesis " -- suggests that many of the miracles , other life events , and beliefs about Horus -- an ancient Egyptian God -- were recycled and incorporated into stories about Jesus as recorded in Gospels and other books in the Christian Scriptures ( New Testament ) .
The copycat thesis is strongly rejected by the vast majority of Christians but is accepted by many skeptics .
Most conservative Christians look upon the Bible as a " top - down " document : one revealed by God to humans .
Since fraud , deceit , and lying are not attributes normally associated with God , they believe that the Bible -- as God 's Word -- is truthful , accurate , and without error .
Many skeptics , secularists , religious liberals , etc. view the Bible as a " bottom - up " document : one written by human authors to promote their religious and spiritual beliefs .
The believe that authors frequently adopted religious concepts of other cultures and incorporate them into their literary works .
A stalemate exists .
Skeptical commentators claim that there are many parallels between the lives of Horus and Jesus ; Christian commentators tend to deny the existence of most or all of them , looking upon them as coincidences or -- more likely -- as simple fabrications about the life of Horus .
Some skeptics may lose objectivity because they are motivated by a desire to weaken the claims of Christianity ; Christians may lose objectivity because they do n't want to admit that there such parallels could exist , because they would throw doubt on the accuracy of the Bible and the uniqueness of Yeshua of Nazareth ( Jesus Christ ) as God .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier today , and said that while “ President Obama has signaled his intention to support tough and direct diplomacy with Iran , ” the US intends to punish the Iranian government if it continues to decline cooperation with the assorted demands made by the United Nations Security Council and the IAEA .
“ If Tehran does not comply with United Nations Security Council and IAEA mandates , there must be consequences , ” Clinton insisted .
Iran has been cooperating with the IAEA to the extent that the Non-Proliferation Treaty requires , but has balked at the Additional Protocol to their Safeguards Agreement .
The United Nations Security Council complaints with respect to Iran have largely stemmed from this as well , though Iran has indicated they would consider resuming voluntary cooperation with the Additional Protocol if the situations is referred back to the IAEA instead of the Security Council .
The United States has struggled in recent days to get international cooperation for additional sanctions against Iran , but President Obama ’s popularity in Europe may make it easier to push through such initiatives .

Snow Day !!! \o/
As a person who originates from Snowy Parts I 'm usually somewhat dubious about disruptions due to snow in Southeast England .
Generally the media seems to hype up the disruption rather more than is warranted .
Naturally people hear that there is severe weather and sensibly stay home .
This time though , there 's sufficient snow that frankly , you all may as well go back to bed .
The southeast ( and London in particular ) is just not equipped to deal with snow .
I mean that quite literally .
Five years ago when I was fresh from Snowy Parts there was a cold snap with lots of ice piling up everywhere .
When I enquired as to why it was n't cleared I was told that London as a whole owns something like three snowploughs .
I mocked this idea as clearly three snowploughs are insufficient to deal with severe weather in such a large city .
But now , five years later , I 'm of a different opinion .
If we only get severe weather once every five years then there really is no point spending millions on preparations for something that rarely happens .
Of course , there are lots of curmudgeonly media types * waves to the Togmeister * who grumble about things like the tube not running when it snows heavily .
There are accusations that LUL 's shutdown means that nobody can get to work .
This is true .
But nobody thinks through to the logical extension .
In London very few people live near to the place they work .
Many come from outside using national rail .
So when the big boys shut down their train service nobody gets to London .
Why does this affect LUL ?
Because tube staff are no different from any other person who works in London .
We also do n't tend to live within walking distance of our place of employment and many come from outside .
So if there is no national transport and road conditions are dangerous to drive on then we end up with having nobody to run the LUL network .
This reasoning impresses nobody .
' It 's London UNDERGROUND !' , they holler , ' There 's no WEATHER underground !'.
Actually no .
Over half of LUL track is not in tunnel sections which means trying to get trains through appalling conditions .
Not to mention that nearly all of the trains are stabled outdoors overnight as those pesky victorians were too lazy to dig out huge , underground caverns so that we could park up out of the rain .
Tsk .
I hate driving in snow .
Or any inclement weather really .
Aside from anything else the cabs of trains are never sealed properly and the heaters are often poor .
This means that the passengers might feel slightly chilly in the back but the driver is sitting in a tiny metal box with air currents ( and often snow and rain ) roaring through the gaps in the doors and windows .
Not to put too fine a point on it , it 's fucking freezing .
But can we huddle over and resign ourselves to our fate and dream of hot cuppas ?
No we flippin ' can't because of all the ice skating we need to do .
Trains have thin metal wheels .
These balance on top of thin metal rails .
When the rails are wet due to rain , snow or ice the train has a nasty habit of developing wheelspin .
What 's happening with wheelspin is a lack of traction .
The driver tries to move the train forward but the wheels can't gain any grip and spin rather uselessly on the wet , slippery rails .
That 's not the problematic part .
Wheelspin when trying to move a train is a mere inconvenience and can be mostly got round by reducing the amount of power being fed to the motors and keeping the train in shunt for a while before gradually increasing the speed .
Any idiot can get a train moving in wet weather , wheelspin or no wheelspin .
Even poor visibility is n't too much of a problem if the driver is mindful of what signals mean and keeps the speed down where necessary .
So once the train has got going it can ( assuming there 's no buildup of ice or snow ) race along as speedily as ever .
Moving trains ai n't really an issue .
No , it 's the stopping that 's tricky .
The thing you 'll have noticed about trains is they are big .
Very big .
And heavy .
Each LUL train takes at least a thousand passengers which just adds to the weight .
Fully loaded my train weights about 300 tons .
As I 've mentioned many times before in this blog : Trains do n't just stop .
It takes a while .
In wet weather there are two possible methods of stopping a train - each comes with it 's own difficulties .
One approach would be to bring the train slowly into the platform .
Seems sensible on the face of it but that style of driving does n't account for trainstops .
Trainstops are devices fitted to the track at points where there is signalling .
Their job is to knock the brakes on from underneath so that if a train goes past a danger signal for some reason , the train will automatically have an emergency brake application .
They stop trains going up the arse of the one in front .
This means that anyone sitting in the crumple zone ( aka ' the cab ' ) does not die .
I like trainstops .
Lots .
They are nifty .
The problem is that on some platforms you can either continue on in the direction you are travelling in or be told to reverse .
In which case you 'd go to the other end and drive in the opposite direction .
This means a signal and trainstop at either end of the platform .
Trainstops at the ' wrong ' end ( i.e. the rear ) of the platform are n't really required if the train is just going to continue on .
They are only there to stop the train going the other way without permission .
In fact , they are potentially a problem as they 'd knock the brakes on at the rear of the train when there is no reason for it to be stopped .
So as the train enters the platform they smoothly tuck down so as not to hamper the brakes .
They stay down for a fixed amount of time - however long it takes for a train to enter and fully berth in the platform at normal line speed .
Then they rise up again .
Have you spotted the problem ?
Yes , it 's that bit about ' normal line speed ' .
If the train is creeping in because the driver does n't want to skid or overshoot the platform then it 's going to take longer to fully berth .
So the trainstop will rise again before the train has fully passed over and the brakes get knocked on .
Then there 's an eight minute delay as the driver shuts down and goes back to manually take the brakes off .
Now imagine that every train which enters the platform has the same problem .
Clearly driving slowly is n't a sensible option .
The alternative is to come in at normal line speed and brake normally .
In dry weather that 's no issue but when it's wet and slippy then the wheels lock and the train quite literally slides along the track .
This happened to me over a set of very bumpy points once and my heart nearly stopped as I tried to work out if I was going to derail or not .
The only way to counter the wheels locking is to release the brakes which is not exactly conducive to stopping .
If the driver cannot then get the train under control then there 's a good chance it will go through the station starter signal .
If that 's red then there 's going to be a long delay as the driver phones the signaller and reports a signal passed at danger .
So that 's not a good plan either .
The trick to driving in the wet is to use the Westinghouse brake to add tiny amounts of air to the brake chamber .
This slows the train slightly and means that once the normal brake is applied there is already some pressure in the brake chamber so the wheels do n't lock and the train does n't skid .
Why not just use Westinghouse all the way in ?
Well it 's a bit more complicated than this but basically there 's only so much air held in reserve and it takes time for the compressors to create more .
So the driver can only use a touch of Westinghouse and then has to use the other brake .
Which requires a hell of a lot of concentration and is oddly tiring .
Add to that a freezing , rain - soaked , windswept driver who is having to concentrate lots to get the train running smoothly in the first place and who is battling poor visibility and you can see why I hate driving in the rain and snow .
Frankly , it sucks and I 'd far rather be driving in the snuggly warm tunnels .
But the only line which is wholly underground is the Victoria Line .
Which brings me neatly to my next point .
Or rather , points .
Points are bits of track which move between two fixed positions .
They are the railway equivalent of steering wheels .
Fixed in one position the train rolls onto the lefthand road .
Fixed in the other position and the train takes the righthand road .
Very simple , very useful , VERY much a moving metal part which is therefore prone to freezing in one position when you leave them lying around outdoors in winter .
It 's a bit of a bummer really .
I remember a few years ago we had a moderate amount of snow .
All the staff turned up , all the passengers turned up and together we all waited on the platforms for our trains to also turn up .
The passengers were n't worried because there were loads of staff milling about so clearly we were running .
The staff were n't worried because all week LUL management had been putting up notices advising of the coming cold - snap and had arranged for the sleet trains and de-icer units to run throughout the night , keeping the track clear of slush and snow .
After a good long wait phonecalls were made :
It transpired that the drivers who had been bringing the trains out of the various depots and sidings had been unable to move them .
Although points all have heaters they - crucially - did n't have very good heaters and the company supposed to be responsible for points * cough * Metronet * cough * had n't bothered checking them .
They were probably all too busy trying to find ways to spend the millions they ripped the government off for .
So all the drivers trudged back to their depot and left the station staff to tell the customers .
This came as something of a relief as it's somewhat embarrassing to have to tell a passenger that there are no trains available due to the cold weather only to have them turn around , point and say ' What about those eight trains though ? ' .
' Well .....'
So all in all , it 's generally not worth anyone bothering to attempt going to work in London today .
A far better option is to stay home and wrap up warm .
Let 's face it - if the weather is so bad that even Severe Delays is n't turning up then it ain't worth bothering .
ETA : Oh !
I certainly was n't expecting * this * amount of feedback !
So in case I miss anyone - Welcome and thanks for stopping by . :-)
A few people have asked if they may friend .
Of course you may , it does my ego good ( though I may need wider doors to fit my head through ) .
Many LRA fighters are abducted children Uganda 's rebel Lord 's Resistance Army has reportedly torched a church crowded with worshippers holding a prayer vigil in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
It is not clear how many died .
The reported attack was the group 's latest on villages in the north - east DR Congo .
Human Rights
Watch says the LRA has killed at least 620 Congolese civilians and abducted more than 160 children since Christmas Eve. Uganda , DR Congo and South Sudan last month launched an offensive on the LRA .
And the Central African Republic has sent troops to its border with DR Congo in an effort to push back the rebels .
Researchers found fresh graves , pools of dried blood blood - stained bats and axes used to kill victims
Human Rights Watch Local residents said the LRA carried out the church attack on Saturday in a community just 130 km ( 80 miles ) from Dungu , which is the military base of Operation Lightning Thunder - the joint multi-national offensive on the rebels .
Felicien Balani , an official in Dungu , told Uganda 's New Vision newspaper : " The LRA entered around midnight .
They surprised the faithful of the church who were in a prayer vigil .
They burned them in the church . "
New York - based Human Rights
Watch said it had unearthed evidence of a wave of killings by the LRA between 24 December and 13 January in DR Congo .
The organisation said in a statement : " At several sites where the killings took place , researchers found fresh graves , pools of dried blood , cords used to tie up prisoners and blood - stained bats and axes used to kill victims . "
Last week the UN refugee agency UNHCR said the Congolese village of Duru was deserted after the rebels had attacked , looting , killing and burning .
The BBC has also received accounts of killings from the South Sudanese district of Mundri .
Two church parishioners who intervened after the rebels had abducted two boys had their hands and legs chopped off and were then beaten to death , said witnesses .
LRA leader Joseph Kony refused to sign a peace deal last year until International Criminal Court arrest warrants are withdrawn .
Over 100,000 people have fled suspected LRA rebels marauding across hundreds of kilometres stretching from the Central African Republic through Sudan and into DR Congo .
The LRA has been fighting in northern Uganda for two decades but is now based in DR Congo , most recently in the Garamba National Park .

Forthcoming January traffic data will reportedly show that Google Maps has taken the lead from MapQuest as the top mapping site in the US .
According to the numbers that I received ( I ’ve asked comScore to verify ) , MapQuest ’s January monthly unique visitors were 41.5 million and Google ’s were 42.2 million .
This is the first time that Google Maps has overtaken MapQuest .
However my source said that time on site / engagement , as reported by comScore , is still greater for MapQuest than for Google Maps .
In some respects we have been anticipating this event for a long time , ever since Google removed links to competitors ’ mapping sites from its search results in January , 2007 .
Some people will argue that this is the inevitable ( and potentially “ unfair ” ) result of Google ’s ability to refer traffic to its own properties .
Indeed , Hitwise has reported multiple times that the bulk of Google Maps ’ traffic comes from this sort of self - referring .
A year ago in a post on Google ’s gains against MapQuest , I quoted Hitwise ’s Heather Hopkins who had written at the time :
Google sends more of its own traffic to Google Maps than to Mapquest , a change that occurred last March .
This ca n’t really be attributed to an increase in consumers looking for Google Maps .
We can measure this through Internet searches .
Searches for “ google maps ” have increased but the term “ mapquest ” receives nearly 10 x the search volume .
And those Maps referrals apparently increased significantly with the advent of “ universal search . ”
But the fact that Google.com can refer traffic to Google Maps does n’t fully explain what ’s happened .
There ’s obvious truth in the self - referral scenario , but that would miss other significant factors .
Google has for several years been investing very heavily in Maps ( and Earth ) , as well as distributing Google Maps across the internet via its API .
The features and capabilities developed for Google Maps are more extensive and widely known than those of its competitors .
And only Microsoft has matched Google ’s investment in online mapping ; however Redmond has not done as effective a job of promoting Live Search Maps / Virtual Earth ’s capabilities to end users .
Part of that goes back to Google ’s search share dominance .
But part of that is Microsoft ’s failing .
Among the top mapping providers , Yahoo Maps was actually the early innovator in dynamic mapping more than five years ago with its SmartView offering that allowed users to find and interact with different categories of local businesses on the map .
However Yahoo made a decision a few years later to opt out of the “ mapping arms race ” with Google and Microsoft and not match them feature for feature .
As a partial consequence of that decision , use of Yahoo Maps flattened over time .
MapQuest , for its part , made a similar decision , instead relying on the strength of its brand and user loyalty as a bulwark against the insurgents .
At one point I heard a former MapQuest executive privately complain that he had to justify everything he did in terms of P&L , while Google could spend freely , in his mind , and “ lose money on its Maps . ”
That may or may not be true .
Regardless ,
Google steadily built out a large number of features that consumers and the market have found compelling ( although not always ) .
More importantly , Google has regarded Maps as a strategic product , arguably its most successful after core search .
Part of the continuing emphasis on Maps is undoubtedly due to its acquisition of Keyhole ( in 2004 ) , which became Google Earth .
Keyhole CEO John
Hanke became head of Maps & Local at Google .
Hanke ’s thoughtful and mature presence at Google has kept the product evolving and growing .
And Maps / Earth are a PR machine for Google — witness the recent launch of Ocean and related press exposure .
Meanwhile , after a long period of near complacency at AOL / MapQuest , new MapQuest VP of Product Mark Law has brought his company ’s product “ out of hibernation ” with a range of interesting new features ( i.e. , MapQuest Local ) and a bigger push into mobile .
MapQuest retains enormous brand strength and may regain the lead .
But the momentum is now in Google ’s favor .
I wrote some Erlang code the other day to spin up a ring of processes ( which are like super - lightweight green threads ) and send messages around the ring .
I ’ve already done one full rewrite of this code but I suspect it ’s still probably not very idiomatic Erlang code .
I ’d love to see someone else ’s example or any comments from Erlang gurus out there .
There are three basic steps to this run :
Start the processes in the ring and remember their Pids ( process IDs ) Connect the processes into a ring Send messages around the ring
I ’ve kind of combined # 1 and 2 into the same function to start up the ring .
I suspect there ’s probably some nifty way to use a map or foldl to do steps 1 and 2 at the same time but my feeble brain could n’t figure out how to do the special case to connect the ring when it wraps around .
Anyhow , here ’s the startRing / 2 function which 1 ) spawns the nodes and 2 ) connects them : [ source : erlang ]
- module ( ring ) .
- import ( lists , [ last / 1 ] ) .
- export ( [ startRing / 2 ] ) .</ p>
% % returns first pid in the ring of size N
startRing( N , TimerPid ) ->
Pids = spawnNodes ( N , [ ] , TimerPid ) ,
connectNodes ( [ last ( Pids ) Pids ] ) .
spawnNodes ( 0 , Pids , _ TimerPid ) ->
Pids ;
spawnNodes ( Remaining , Pids , TimerPid ) ->
Pid = spawn ( fun ( ) -> unconnectedNode( TimerPid ) end ) ,
spawnNodes ( Remaining - 1 , [ Pid Pids ] , TimerPid ) .
%% Connect F and S until there are no nodes left to connect
connectNodes ( [ F [ S T ] ] ) ->
F ! {connect , S} ,
if
length ( T ) > 0 -> connectNodes ( [ S T ] ) ;
true -> S
end .
%% Run node unconnected until there is a connect message
unconnectedNode( TimerPid ) ->
receive
{connect , SendTo} ->
nodeloop ( SendTo , TimerPid )
end .
[ / source ]
Here ’s a run down of the functions and what they ’re doing in more detail :
startRing ( N , TimerPid ) – this is the main exported function .
It spawns N processes , then connects them in a ring .
One of the Pids in the ring is returned ( the nodes are all the same so it ’s not too important which one ) .
– this is the main exported function .
It spawns N processes , then connects them in a ring .
One of the Pids in the ring is returned ( the nodes are all the same so it ’s not too important which one ) .
spawnNodes (0 , Pids , _ TimerPid ) – spawnNodes is a recursive function and this is the base case .
The first parameter is decremented as processes are created .
The second parameter accumulates a list of Pids .
The third parameter is a Pid for a timer process that will be used later .
In this base case definition , it is unused and thus prefixed with an _ .
– spawnNodes is a recursive function and this is the base case .
The first parameter is decremented as processes are created .
The second parameter accumulates a list of Pids .
The third parameter is a Pid for a timer process that will be used later .
In this base case definition , it is unused and thus prefixed with an _. spawnNodes ( Remaining , Pids , TimerPid ) – the main recursive spawnNodes first spawns a new process with the function unconnected Node ( ) and does the obvious recursive call – decrement the # of processes left to create , add Pid to the head of the list of Pids , and pass the Timer Pid through .
– the main recursive spawnNodes first spawns a new process with the function unconnected Node ( ) and does the obvious recursive call – decrement the # of processes left to create , add Pid to the head of the list of Pids , and pass the Timer Pid through .
** connectNodes ( [ F [ S T ] ] )** – this function takes a list of Pids and connects them ( recursively in a ring ) .
If you noticed back in the startRing function , the last Pid was added to the head of the Pids before the initial call to connectNodes so that we will have a full ring .
The first expression in connectNodes sends a message to process F to connect it to process S. If there are still pids left in T , we recurse while moving dropping the initial F pid .
If no pids are left in T , we return S , which was a pid in the ring which will be returned by startRing .
unconnectedNode( TimerPid ) – unconnectedNode is a sort of initial state for each node in the process where each node is only looking for a single connect message with the Pid it should forward messages to when it receives them .
When it receives it , it will dump into the main node function nodeloop which we will look at next .
So , moving onward we look finally at the main nodeloop function from each node :
[ source : erlang ]
%%
When connected , run loop waiting for either a stop or { Source , Val}
% % message where Source is the Pid of the node that originated the message .
nodeloop ( SendTo , TimerPid ) ->
receive
stop ->
SendTo ! stop ;
start ->
io :format ( “ ~p Starting message~n ” , [ now ( ) ] ) ,
TimerPid ! start ,
SendTo ! { self ( ) , 0} ,
nodeloop ( SendTo , TimerPid ) ;
{ Source , Val} when Source == self ( ) ->
logOnNth ( Val+1 , 10000 ) ,
if
Val+1 == 1000000 -> TimerPid ! stop , SendTo ! stop ;
true -> SendTo !
{ Source , Val+1}
end ,
nodeloop ( SendTo , TimerPid ) ;
{ Source , Val} ->
SendTo !
{ Source , Val} ,
nodeloop ( SendTo , TimerPid )
end .
%% Log if Val is Nth value
logOnNth ( Val , Nth ) when Val rem Nth == 0 ->
io : format ( “ ~p Around ring ~p times ~n ” , [ now ( ) , Val ] ) ;
logOnNth( _Val , _ Nth ) -> void .
[ / source ]
The nodeloop / 2 function takes SendTo which is a Pid to forward messages on to and the TimerPid which is the timer process .
The receive loop is expecting three kinds of messages : stop , start , and { Source , Val} ( where Source is the originating Pid and Val is an int counter for the number of trips around the ring ) .
stop – just forwards the stop message on and most importantly does NOT call nodeloop , ending the recursion and allowing the function to end .
start – notify the TimerPid that the message send has started , send the initial { Source , Val} message with self ( ) pid as the source , and finally recursively wait for the next message
{ Source , Val} with guard – when a message is received , if this node was the source of the message , we log that every 10000 trips around the ring .
If the message has traveled around the ring 1 M times , we notify the Timer process to stop and switch to sending a stop message around the ring .
Otherwise , we just forward the message and bump up the Val .
{ Source , Val} – if this node was not the source , just forward the message and loop
So , this allows us to spin up a ring of size N , tell some process in the ring to start , and the message will go around the ring a million times .
I should also explain the timer process .
This process has two states defined by functions timerOff ( ) and timerOn ( ) .
The timer starts in the off position and waits for either a start or cancel message .
On start , it switches to the timerOff ( ) function , which just listens for a stop message .
When stop is received , we calculate and print the elapsed time , then switch the timer off .
Here ’s the code : [ source : erlang ]
%% Start timer listener process , return Pid of timer listener
startTimer ( ) ->
spawn ( fun( ) -> timerOff ( ) end ) .
timerOff ( ) ->
receive
cancel -> void ;
start -> timerOn ( now ( ) )
end .
timerOn( Start ) ->
receive
cancel -> {timer , aborted} ;
stop ->
End=now ( ) ,
io:format( “ Start=~p Stop=~p Elapsed=~p~n ” , [ Start , End , diff ( Start , End ) ] ) ,
timerOff ( )
end .
diff ( Start , End ) ->
{_, StartSeconds , StartMicros} = Start ,
{_, EndSeconds , EndMicros} = End ,
(( EndSeconds *1000000 ) + EndMicros ) – ( ( StartSeconds *1000000 ) + StartMicros ) .
[ / source ]
The important thing to know about now ( ) is that it returns a tuple { MegaSeconds , Seconds , Microseconds} .
I ’m making the assumption in the diff function above that MegaSeconds is not changing , which is completely not true all the time .
But I was lazy and cut that corner for this code .
I also wanted to know how long it took to actually spawn the processes in the ring , so I modified the startRing function a bit to look like this : [ source : erlang ]
startRing( N , TimerPid ) ->
{ Micros , Pids} = timer : tc(ring , spawnNodes , [N , [ ] , TimerPid ] ) ,
io : format ( “ spawned : ~p in ~ p microseconds~n ” , [ N , Micros ] ) ,
connectNodes ( [ last ( Pids ) Pids ] ) .
[ / source ]
This is wrapping a timer :tc call around the initial spawnNodes call which wraps the whole recursive spawn that creates all the processes .
Ah , so now let ’s look at how it works :
[ source : erlang ]
1> c( ring ) .
{ok , ring}
2> T=ring : startTimer ( ) .
< 0.38.0 >
3> R=ring : startRing ( 100 ,T ) .
spawned : 100 in 241 microseconds
< 0.40.0 >
4> R ! start .
{ 1230,863064,116530} Starting message
start
{ 1230,863064,879862} Around ring 10000 times
{ 1230,863065,642097} Around ring 20000 times
{ 1230,863066,404689} Around ring 30000 times
…etc
{ 1230,863140,707023} Around ring 990000 times
{ 1230,863141,471193} Around ring 1000000 times
Start= {1230,863064,116875} Stop={1230,863141,471380} Elapsed=77354505
[ / source ]
Here I started a ring of 100 processes and sent a message around the ring 1 million times .
It took 241 microseconds ( .000002 seconds per process ) to spin up the processes and about 77 seconds to send the messages around .
Given the size of the ring , this is actually 100 million messages in 77 seconds or 1.3 million messages / second .
I do n’t have anything to judge against ( yet ) but that seems fast !
Of course , making process spawn and message send really fast are the basis of how the Erlang model works , so this should not be surprising .
I also tried just spinning up a lot of processes in the ring to see how fast that was :
[ source : erlang ]
3> R = ring : startRing ( 20000,0 ) .
spawned : 20000 in 118580 microseconds
[ / source ]
which actually created 20,000 processes in 0.12 seconds !
So , as we saw earlier , process spawn is really fast .
Hope this was fun for someone .
And I ’m very open to constructive criticism on the Erlang code – I ’m a total n00b .
I confess I do n't know whether there is room in this world for Howard Dean to be in a cabinet that reports to Rahm Emanuel .
I know that Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee is a top candidate .
That said , the former Vermont governor , DNC chair , NGA chair , health care expert and presidential candidate has some momentum tonight .
Sen .
Tom Harkin , who has discussed the job with the White House , has publicly endorsed Dean , as has the influential House member Raul Grijalva , who wrote the following letter to Obama .

I 've sat on this story for a LONG time .
More than 25 years .
Now I live in a different country , on the other side of the world .
So perhaps it 's time to unburden myself of this tale .
It is a story of stupidity , near - death , mayhem , soldiers and more .
How I survived , I will never know .
But here goes .
It 's a bit of a long story , with a 20 - year - later twist , so apologies for length and girth , if not volume .
Back in the early 80's , I was an 11 - year - old South African kid somewhat adrift in the world of English private boarding school .
I 'm not going to give any more detail than " the school was in the south of England " .
I was bright and nerdy , so they put me in the Scholarship Class .
This class had only seven kids in it , and we were all quite bright .
Science lessons were our favourites .
They were conducted in a portakabin - type of classroom just outside the main school building , which was an old 1800 's - style stately home affair .
Our science teacher decided that , since we were the " bright " kids , we were also the " responsible " kids - and stupidly gave each of us a key to the science lab , carte blanche to spend our time in there whenever we wanted , and a signed pad of requisition chits .
These chits could be filled out and passed to the school secretary , and because they were already signed , we could - and did - requisition whatever we damned well liked .
Can we spot a recipe for disaster yet ?
Read on ... A couple of the kids got into making beer and wine .
I helped them and we made a still .
Then we had a great trade going , selling beer , wine and moonshine to all the other kids in school ( the oldest kid in our school was 13 ) .
This helped us raise some money .
Another couple of kids used the science lab 's darkroom to develop folks ' films ( for money , of course ) , pocketing the profits .
I tired of the still once it was made , and did n't really care for the taste of the moonshine .
But I did like the way it burned when you set fire to it ...
You will already know from my previous post to this QOTW that I 'm a bit of a pyromaniac , so it was inevitable that I started experimenting with explosives .
From the boring ( phosphorous in a shower head ) to the exciting , I spanned the gamut of lethality .
I then found a book called the Anarchist 's Cookbook , which led me to my ruin .
My first real achievement was to create almost a kilo of gunpowder .
I used one of those huge science - lab mortars to mix the ingredients , with a large stone pestle to crush everything together .
Once the mix was made , I poured a bit more than half away into a storage container , and then decided to " test " my mixture .
On this occasion , I was alone in the science lab .
So I lit a match , tossed it into the stone mortar ( which had about half a pound of black powder in it ) and legged it to the other end of the science lab .
From this " safe " distance , I watched as ... nothing happened .
Meh ; I started walking back towards the mortar , when there was a blinding white flash and a spectacular " FOOM " sound .
Yay !
It worked !
I was about 10 feet from it when it blew , and I still felt the shock / heat wave - cool !
As I walked towards the mortar , this huge ( 10 - 15 kilo ) stone mixing bowl slowly and silently cracked in half ... and the pestle ( itself a good 10 inches of granite ) had vanished .
Looking up , I noticed a perfectly round hole in the ceiling of the science lab , with powder burns all around it , and a matching hole in the roof above ...
Cue a chit from the pad for the school handyman to fix the roof .
I explained it away as " a science experiment " .
Phew - got away with that , eh ?
Did I learn ?
Did I buggery .
The fascinating publication I had found then told me about nitro-glycerine .
Chit for the ingredients ?
NO !
Of course not - I 'm not that stupid .
I spread them out over three chits .
So a little while later ( wavy lines ) there I am with three large beakers full of nitro , wandering about the lab showing me mates ( I still shudder and get the cold sweats thinking about this ) .
I took a pipette and squirted little drops onto the floor , where they amusingly exploded with little petard - like flashes and bangs .
Cool , eh ?
Enough for me ?
Oh , no .
Oh , no - not even slightly .
Turns out that you can use ( unstable ) nitro - glycerine to make much more stable dynamite sticks , which can then be used for wholesale destruction .
And my faithful book told me what to do .
Off to the woodworking shop went I , coming back with two large bin-bags full of sawdust .
Then off to the kitchen for a roll of brown waxed paper .
But that was n't all .
The other thing I needed was a method of ignition .
Fire or impact will do it , and I could n't get or make electric detonators .
So I decided ( on the advice of my book ) to make fuse ( or detonation ) cord .
Off to the school laundry , where I blagged three old threadbare sheets .
Back to the science lab with my haul ... You make dynamite sticks by combining sawdust with liquid nitro - glycerine .
This stabilises the nitro , so it 's harder to ignite by accident .
You can make them sturdy by wrapping the gooey mix up in wax paper .
You make the fuse cord by taking long strips of bedsheet , coating them with glue , coating them with a fine layer of the gunpowder you made earlier and then twisting it ( before the glue dries ) into a long string .
You then cut 12 " lengths of this string and insert it into the middle of each of your dynamite sticks , before you roll it all up and sellotape it tight .
Before long , I had 15 and a half sticks of dynamite , looking exactly like something you 'd see on a Wile E Coyote cartoon ( only without the ACME logos ) .
I also , by this time , had an accomplice - Tim .
Sorry , Tim .
So what on earth do we do with this stuff now ?
This was a dilemma , to be sure .
So Tim and I went for a walk outside to consider our options .
Outside the science lab was the stump of a massive old oak that had died many years before and had been chopped off , about 15 feet above the ground .
The oak was wide enough around that we could n't reach each other 's hands if we both hugged the tree ; it was a bit big , then .
The stump was next to a barbed - wire fence , which was made up of wooden fence posts about 6 " across , with barbed wire between them , at about 8 feet apart .
Inspiration struck !
Would n't it be awesome to use the massive , old , dense , heavy tree to absorb our explosion (s ) ?
So - off to the woodworking lab again for a hand drill with a sufficient diameter bit to drill holes to take our sticks of dynamite .
It was exhausting , this - drilling holes in this old tree .
The sticks that I 'd made were about 10 " long and 1 " across , so each hole needed to be at least that size .
However , we persevered , and over the next week or so , we went out and drilled holes until the tree was ringed with holes , about a foot from the ground .
Unfortunately , we mis-counted , and the tree got 14 holes .
But we had 15 and a half sticks ...
What to do ?
Well , there was that tempting fence right next to the tree ...
You guessed it ; the post nearest the tree got a hole and so did the next one in line ( toward the science lab ) .
So , now begins the Darwin part of the story .
I carefully inserted a stick into each hole in the tree , leaving the fuse cord sticking out .
Each snicked home with a satisfying " thunk " .
The fence posts got , respectively , the spare full stick and the last half a stick .
I then got my long roll of fuse cord and started at the side of the tree facing the science lab , tying each stick 's cord to the roll and then moving clockwise around the tree to the next one .
Soon enough , I had reached the fence , so I attached the full stick and then the final half stick .
I ran the remaining cord to our shelter .
Our shelter was , and I want to be completely clear about this , utter shite .
It was a low ( 18 inches or so ) berm of earth with grass on it , about 25 feet from the tree .
Our plan was to lie on the ground behind the berm , light the fuse and watch the fun - if things got too hairy , we'd hide behind our carefully - chosen shelter .
With the inevitability of all really really stupid decisions , we lit the cord .
If you 've ever seen the little spark run down Wile E Coyote 's fuse cord , I 'm here to tell you that yes - in real life , it looked just like that .
Only it moved a great deal faster than we were expecting .
The spark jogged merrily along the ground to the first fence post , where the half stick was waiting .
Exactly as planned , and in true Mythbusters style , the spark reached the knot , split in two and continued a ) towards the next stick ( a full one this time ) in the second fence post , and b ) into the drilled hole at the bottom of the first fence post , while we peeked over our berm like a pair of retarded Chads .
Then all sound ceased .
The earth below us heaved , and the bottom of the first fence post vanished in a bright , blinding white flash and a huge cloud of splinters ( tiny , tiny splinters that were also very much on fire ) .
The shock wave knocked the wind out of us and flattened us to the ground , while the first fence post whizzed straight up , to be restrained by the barbed wire ( I imagine a comedy " bwoinnnnngggg " noise ) .
Unfortunately , the shit train had , by now , well and truly left the station .
That was , you will recall , just the first stick - and a half stick at that .
It was about this time that the second one went off , followed by regular THUMP - THUMP - THUMP explosions as the remaining 14 full sticks - confined in their dense , wooden lairs , started to blow .
The crushing , overwhelming force is impossible to describe .
The earth beneath us was bucking and kicking .
We could n't hear a fucking thing ; all hearing was gone .
We could n't breathe ; there was a rapidly - expanding fireball full of wood splinters that engulfed the air around us .
We were completely flattened behind our pathetic little berm and totally convinced that we were going to die .
When the concussions stopped , I risked a peek up , to see something even more horrifying , if that could be possible .
The tree stump - all 15 ' of it - was rising majestically into the air atop a huge fireball .
It was slowly corkscrewing , too ( remember , the sticks went off in sequence , not all together ) .
I will remind the gentle reader that we were not very far at all from the science lab ...
When you 're 11 , and deaf , and on fire , and you then see about eight tons of flaming tree rising into the air , your brain just kind of shuts down .
I just lay there , mouth open , watching like a mong as the stump reached its apogee , and - gravity being a harsh mistress - began its inevitable return journey .
My memories of the time have it going at least ten miles into the air ; measuring the lateral distance later , I reckon I got it a real 200 to 300 feet up .
When it began its downward journey , still burning like an Apollo rocket , I could n't move to run out of its path .
If it had landed on me , I would n't be here now .
Luckily , it headed in the direction of the school pool , but did n't reach it .
It crashed to earth ( with another huge concussion ) about halfway between the science lab and the pool , and began smouldering .
Now came the aftermath .
Neither Tim nor I could hear ANYTHING .
We looked at each other , and we could both tell we were talking ( screaming ? ) because our mouths were moving , but neither of us could hear our own voices , let alone each other's .
Tim was on fire , with burning sawdust and splinters on his back , so I quickly batted the flames out , and then he did the same for me .
Then we thought to look around ; take stock , if you will .
Behind us , the science lab ...
The wall facing us was scorched black and peppered with chunks of wood and splinters .
Every single window was gone , and all the desks and tables inside the lab had been swept clear .
Beyond the lab , the old school building was also in a bad way .
Every window facing the science lab had been blown out , and - what was this ?
There was a flood of kids and teachers leaving the building very quickly indeed .
I imagine they were screaming , as many mouths seemed to be wiiiiide open .
The music teacher ( male ) was running like a girl , all flappy hands and arms and such , mouth wide open , trampling kids in his haste to leave .
So Tim and I looked at each other ; we stripped off our ( burned ) school jumpers , flung them into the science lab , and joined the screaming exodus .
Just merged with them .
Then the police came , along with the fire engines , and the Army , too .
We were all interviewed - every one of us - and the school was closed for two weeks .
Once Tim and I could hear , we agreed on our story ( we were in the science lab , doing homework , when - BOOM - and that 's all we knew ) and swore that neither of us would breathe a word for at least 20 years AND only if we 'd emigrated .
We were both absolutely shitting ourselves that we'd be caught .
I mean ; blowing up your school ?
That 's Borstal for sure , right ?
The thing that bothered me the most was the incriminating trail of ingredient requests ... The Army posted a guard on the school for the next six months ; we had nice squaddies with Landies and guns looking after us and the girls ' school next door .
The bomb squad came out , and they analysed the residue .
They concluded that the IRA had targeted the school , blaming them for the home - made explosive and for trying to kill the poor widdle kiddies .
It turned out that the chits went in the bin as soon as the stuff was ordered , and the overall bill for " stuff " drowned out my ingredients ; nobody put two and two together at all .
Impossibly , we got away with it .
To this day , I have a small glass vial with some of that gunpowder in it .
I keep it to remind myself to NEVER BE THAT FUCKING STUPID again .
Does n't always work though .
EPILOGUEStill with me ?
Thanks !
So there is a final chapter in this story .
A couple of years ago , my wife and I were living in California , next to a really nice American family .
They invited us around for Thanksgiving dinner , and after a lovely feed , the cigars , brandy and stories came out .
So I told this one , to general acclaim , horror and so on .
A week or so later , my Mum came to live with us ( different story , do n't ask ) , and the same family invited us all to Christmas dinner .
At that same dinner , the family 's son - in - law also attended .
He 's a fantastic sort ; a practical joker , and exactly the sort of person with whom I should DEFINITELY NOT associate .
So he started telling HIS stories .
Then his father - in - law uttered the fateful words ...
" Lustfish !
Tell Zak the story about blowing up your sch .... "
But it was too late .
Me , standing behind my mother , making throat - cutting motions and mouthing " Ix - nay on the ool - skay " ...
My mum turned around , and with a look of pure frost , said " yes , why DON 'T you tell us that story ...? " .
All those years , and I never told her .
Never breathed a word .
She had had to come and take me out of school because of the nasty old IRA , and she never knew it was me ...
She did n't speak to me for weeks ( WIN ) and still has n't quite come to terms with the whole thing .
Mouth like a cat 's bum or what !
This whole episode made the front pages of all the rags in England that year , until the government put a media blackout on it .
They did n't want the IRA getting the publicity , apparently .
How I 'm still alive today is a complete mystery , to be honest .

There are a bunch of basic functional elements to building out a popular Rails app that I 've never really seen explained in one place , but we had to learn the hard way while building Posterous .
Here 's a rundown of what we 've learned , in the hopes that some Google linkjuice may bring an intrepid wanderer to this forlorn part of the woods and help you out .
Static Storage
S3 is awesome .
Yes , you can host everything off S3 .
Is it a little more expensive ?
Probably .
But if you 're engineer constrained ( and if you 're a startup , you absolutely are ) -- set it and forget it .
If you absolutely must have local storage across app servers , then MogileFS , GFS , or HDFS or even NFS ( yuck ) are possibilities .
For alternatives to S3 , Mosso is supposed to be good too .
Images , files , whatever .
Just drop it there .
People say a lot of stuff about the Cloud , but it 's real and a game changer for anyone doing user generated content .
The HTTP protocol lets you tell browsers what static content they can cache .
You set this in apache .
Rails automatically will put timestamps in the IMG / javascript / CSS tags , assuming you 're using the helpers .
The Firefox plugin YSlow coupled with Firebug are your friends here .
The improvement is significant and well worth your time , especially if you add gzip 'ing .
100 KB initial page load can be brought down to 5 K ( just the HTML file ) on subsequent clicks around your site .
You 're not going to run full text search out of your DB .
It 's totally not worth it to roll anything custom here .
The smart money is on Sphinx with the ThinkingSphinx plugin is probably your best bet .
If you have more than one app server , you 'll want to use this .
Alternatively , Solr with Acts as Solr can be used if you 're a Java geek / have Lucene / Solr experience previously .
MyISAM is marginally faster for reads , but InnoDB will make you more crash resistant and will not lock tables on writes .
Read about the difference , because when your servers are on fire , you will realize MySQL feels like a pretty thin layer of goop on top of your storage engine .
MyISAM is actually the default on MySQL , which makes sense for most crappy phpBB installations -- but probably not good enough for you .
The default can hurt you .
Oh yeah , and if you can start with some replication in place , do it .
You 'll want at least one slave for backups anyway .
This basically saves your ass completely .
Everyone complains that Rails is slow .
Rails is not slow , just like Java Swing is not slow .
Rails makes it easy to shoot yourself in the face .
If you do follow - the - textbook - example bumbling around with Rails ActiveRecord objects , you will end up with pages that drive 100 queries and take several seconds to return .
Above is a screenshot from query_reviewer .
It tells you every single query being run , and alerts you to things that use temporary tables , file sorts and / or just damn slow queries .
In a nutshell , you need indexes to avoid full table scans .
The traditional way is to run EXPLAIN manually on queries coming out of your dev log .
Query_reviewer lets you see it all right there in the left corner of your web browser .
It 's brilliant .
You also need to eager load associations that will use in your views by passing : include to your ActiveRecord find method call , so that you can batch up SQL queries instead of destroying your DB server with 100 queries per dynamic page .
New Relic is new for us , but it helps us see what is really happening on our production site .
If your site is on fire , it 's a freaking beautiful gift from the heavens above .
You 'll see exactly what controllers are slow , which servers in your cluster , how load is on all your machines , and which queries are slow .
If you memcache first , you will never feel the pain and never learn how bad your database indexes and Rails queries are .
What happens when scale gets so big that your memcache setup is dying ?
Oh , right , you 're even more screwed than you would have been if you got your DB right in the first place .
Also , if this is your first time doing scaling Rails / a db - driven site , there 's only one way to learn how , and putting it off til later probably is n't the way .
Memcache is like a bandaid for a bullet hole -- you 're gonna die .
If you 're using nginx or Apache as a load balancer in front of a pack of mongrels ( or thins or whatever else is cool / new / hip ) , then each of those mongrels acts like a queue .
The upshot is that if you EVER have a request that takes a long time to finish , you 're in a world of hurt .
So say you have 4 mongrels , and Request A comes in to port 8000 and it takes 10 seconds .
The load balancer is naive and keeps passing requests to Port 8000 even though that port is busy .
( Note : This might help , but we do n't use it )
Then what happens ?
Sad town happens .
1 in 4 requests after Request A will go to port 8000 , and all of those requests will wait in line as that mongrel chugs away at the slow request .
Effective wait time on 1/4th of your requests in that 10 second period may be as long as 10 seconds , even if normally it should only take 50msec !
Enter the wonderful mongrel proctitle .
Now , you can see exactly what is blocking your mongrels .
I keep this on a watch in a terminal at all times .
It 's what I look at immediately if our constant uptime tests tell us something 's wrong .
Super useful .
The answer is : a ) run some mongrels dedicated to slow running jobs ( meh ) or b ) run Phusion Passenger , or c ) run slow stuff offline ... which leads us to ... So you gotta send some emails .
Or maybe denormalize your DB .
Or resize photos , or transcode video or audio .
But how do you do it in the 200msec that you need to return a web request ?
You do n't .
You use Workling or Delayed Job or nanite .
It 'll happen outside of your mongrels and everyone will be happier .
I do n't know why people do n't talk about this more , because if you run a site that basically does anything , you need something like this .
It * should * be a part of Rails , but is n't .
It is n't a part of Rails in the same way that SwingWorker in Java was n't a part of Java Swing core like forever , even though it absolutely had to be .
Test your site uptime , not just ping but actual real user requests that hit the DB .
Sure , you could use pingdom if you 're lazy , but it seriously takes like 10 lines of ruby code to write an automated daemon that runs , does a user action and checks that your site is not hosed .
open - uri is your friend .
You do n't know if you 're up if you 're not checking .
Do not tolerate downtime .
Also , use god for mongrel and process monitoring .
Mongrels die or go crazy .
You gotta keep them in their place .
( What 's funny is that god leaks memory over time with Ruby 1.8.6 * sigh* ) .
Munin monit , and nagios are also great to have .
Keep an eye on your resources -- IO ok ?
Disk space ?
It 's the worst thing every to have a site crash because you forgot to clean the logs or you ran out of disk space .
Make cronjobs for cleaning all logs and temp directories , so that you can set it and forget it .
Because you will forget , until you are reminded in the worst way .
You will learn more reading the source and debugging / fixing bugs in plugins and sometimes Rails itself than a ) complaining on a mailing list or b ) whining about shit on your twitter .
It 's Ruby open source code -- if it 's broken , there 's a reason .
There 's a bug , or you 're doing it wrong .
Fix it yourself , drop it into a github fork , and submit back .
They do n't work well .
And they sit around on Google sucking up time and effort .
Acts as paranoid is one .
They look legit , with famous names who created them .
Do n't fall for it .
Insist on using code that has been updated recently .
Rails changes pretty fast , and plugins that do n't get updated will waste your time , cause random bugs , and basically make your life crap .
Github is new on the scene and has totally revolutionized Rails .
When in doubt , search Github .
If it 's not on Github , it 's probably dead / not - maintained .
Be wary .
Actually , if this blog post is older than even 6 months or 1 year -- you might want to go elsewhere .
Rails moves fast .
What 's hot and " must have " in Rails now may be totally a piece of crap / barely functioning garbage later .
Same with any blog posts .
Be super wary of the Rails wiki .
There be dragons -- I mean , really stuff that references Rails 1.2.6 or earlier !
There 's tons more stuff , but this is a pretty decent list of stuff to watch out for .

A PATENT dispute over the intermittent windshield wiper may not sound like ideal fodder for a major motion picture .
But Flash of Genius , opening next month in the US , will be worth seeing if it tells the story of inventor Robert Kearns as well as John Seabrook does in the title story of his collection of articles from The New Yorker .
Driving in the rain in 1962 , Kearns realised the wipers should be more like his eyelids : sweeping across the glass – and obscuring his view – only occasionally .
He patented his design for these “ blinking eye wipers ” and …
BT has blamed Brits ' poor broadband speeds on tellies , lights and electrical wiring and the interference they all cause .
All this noise gets in the way of broadband signals pinging around homes ' phone extension wiring , the telco claimed .
The interference is picked up by the bell wire , a third cable which runs alongside the pair of wires that carries the telephony and broadband signal .
The greater the number of telephone extension sockets and the more electrical equipment in a home , the greater the problem can be , BT said .
Its solution : filter it out .
To that end , it 's offering I - Plate , a plug in filter that clips onto a BT NTE 5 master socket .
The company estimates that 9 m homes have these , and they 'll be able to acquire the filters from their broadband providers , to whom BT will be shipping I - Plates from today .
The I - Plate isolates the bell wire .
A BT NTE 5 box , yesterday
To fit one , unscrew the face plate , clip the I - Plate in place in the socket and replace the cover .
No need to call out an engineer , the telco said .
Does it make a difference ?
We await independent tests , but the provider claims , based on " a benchmark survey of 36,000 lines " that it 's carried out since first introducing the technology back in March this year , that users could see an increase of up to 1.5 Mb/s , with some particularly lucky punters getting an increase of up to 4 Mb/s .
The caveat is that the speed boost - if any - is all entirely dependent on your electrical conditions : what kit you have running , what broadband package you have , your provider and so on .
If your broadband is n't piped over ADSL , you 're out of the loop anyway .
BT also claimed the I - Plate may allow homes that have thus far been considered too far from an exchange to receive broadband to now be able to get it .
Fasting ( intermittent , IF , or alternate day , ADF ) may be the newest diet craze rivaling calorie restriction ( CR ) to increase longevity and improve health .
Recent reports have shown that fasting diets can confer health benefits similar to ( or even greater than ) those of chronic calorie restriction ( CR ) , without reducing the number of calories consumed relative to an ad libitum diet .
The molecular mechanisms underlying the IF diet induced longevity are not well understood .
Honjoh et. al. established a fasting diet regimen in C. elegans to study molecular pathways involved in fasting induced longevity .
They found that alternate day fasting ( ADF ) had a 40.4 % increase in lifespan , and intermittent fasting ( IF : every two days ) had a 56.6 % increase in lifespan over ad libitum fed worms .
In contrast , chronic CR only increased lifespan by an average of 13.2 % .
CR and IF may have similar effects on lifespan , but results reported in this paper indicate that signals in each of these processes are distinct .
skn - 1 and pha -4 have been shown to be essential genes in the CR longevity phenotype , but are dispensable in IF longevity .
Two proteins that were found to be important in this model of IF induced longevity are RHEB - 1 ( Ras homologue enriched in brain ) and it ’s downstream target , TOR ( target of rapamycin ) .
Inactivating either of these genes suppressed the longevity of worms on the IF diet , adding support to the role RHEB and TOR proteins play in influencing lifespan .
Interestingly , inactivation of RHEB - 1 did not mimic IF longevity , instead it recapitulated CR in lifespan increase and target gene activation .
Thus , the authors conclude that RHEB - 1 has a dual role in lifespan regulation .
Signaling through RHEB - 1 mediates intermittent fasting - induced longevity in C. elegans .
RHEB - 1 exerts its effects in part by the insulin / insulin growth factor ( IGF ) - like signaling effector DAF - 16 in IF .
Our analyses demonstrate that most fasting - induced upregulated genes require RHEB - 1 function for their induction , and that RHEB - 1 and TOR signaling are required for the fasting - induced downregulation of an insulin - like peptide , INS - 7 .
These findings identify the essential role of signaling by RHEB - 1 in IF - induced longevity and gene expression changes , and suggest a molecular link between the IF - induced longevity and the insulin / IGF - like signaling pathway .
The authors performed a microarray on fasted worms with or without RHEB - 1 or TOR RNAi to identify gene expression changes .
They found that the majority of genes that were upregulated as a result of fasting were dependent on RHEB - 1 and TOR ( 100 out of 112 genes and 94 out of 112 , respectively ) .
RNAi of either RHEB - 1 or TOR suppressed the induction of these genes in fasting .
Through further analyses , hsp - 12.6 ( the C. elegans orthologue of αB - crytallin ) and ins - 7 ( insulin - like peptide 7 ) were identified as downstream targets of RHEB - 1 and TOR and are critical for mediating the IF - induced longevity phenotype .
It will be important to follow up on these findings , which elucidate the molecular pathways behind longevity diets , to determine how different diets overlap ( or are distinguished ) at the molecular level – especially considering that it seems improbable that people will willingly embrace a lifelong restricted diet to improve their health and lifespan .
Understanding these pathways and factors involved will hopefully advance our ability to develop pharmaceuticals to mimic the benefits observed in these longevity diets .
The thing that would ‘ threaten public security ’ , let alone ‘ community harmony ’ is that twice in the last month Wilders has been invited to speak in the House of Lords and twice Lord Ahmed of Rotherham ( soon to go to prison himself ) and other Muslim ‘ leaders ’ have explained that they will provide a mob to object to the film .
Ahmed proclaimed the previous effort to stop Wilders coming to Parliament as ‘ a victory for the Muslim community . ’
The meeting scheduled for tomorrow had already been cancelled once .
Yesterday Wilders was presented with a letter written on behalf of the Home Secretary stating that she ‘ is satisfied that your statements about Muslims and their beliefs , as expressed in your film Fitna and elsewhere would threaten community harmony and therefore public security in the UK . ’
I blogged on ‘ Fitna ’ for Conservative Home when it came out , just after interviewing Wilders for The Spectator .
The film , which can be seen here , equates verses in the Koran with actions carried out in their name by Islamist terrorists .
The Dutch MP and Party leader , Geert Wilders ( pictured ) , has been told he cannot enter the UK .
Wilders was due to speak to fellow Parliamentarians at the House of Lords tomorrow and show his film ‘ Fitna ’ .
I have just got off Dutch television , and it is plain that a serious diplomatic row is now emerging between our own inept Foreign and Home Secretaries and their more robust Dutch counter - parts .
Even those in the Dutch Parliament deeply in opposition to Wilders are outraged that he should be banned from the UK in this way .
Having tried so hard to insult and alienate our Indian allies our diplomatic stars Jacqui Smith and David Miliband have now managed to insult a second close ally in less than a month .
The letter presented to Wilders is a disgrace .
I hope that he is successful in entering the country tomorrow , as he has said he plans to do .
Meantime , there is something we need to be reminded of here .
The government is currently trying to damage - limit by pointing out that they have in recent years managed to keep out foreign clerics who are due to stir up hatred .
Two things need stating .
Firstly : they have n’t .
Numerous extremist clerics still come into this country each year and numerous others ( not least those filmed by the Dispatches crew ) remain happily untroubled by our authorities despite being filmed calling for the murders of Jews , homosexuals , Hindus , Muslim apostates and others .
This country hosts many ambassadors – official and unofficial – for terrorist organisations such as Hamas and Hezbollah who call for the annihilation of whole peoples .
These people do not find themselves deported , nor barred from entry or re-entry into the country .
Secondly : the government is displaying a false dichotomy .
Many people disagree with Wilders .
But he is not inciting violence .
The people inciting violence are those he cites in his film , and those who in response to his film incite violence against him .
Wilders attacks Islam , not Muslims .
Islam is only an ideology , like any other , and as such cannot and should not be beyond criticism – even hostile criticism .
Wilders calls for violence against no one .
In his film he highlights those who do .
Violence has been promised against him if he comes to Britain and so Britain has banned him from coming .
Our political leaders clearly do not mind about the terrible signals they are now giving to our allies .
But I do wish they would sometimes think - for even a moment - about the signals they are giving to our enemies .

Take a walk in the woods , soak in a tub ; but , do it alone .
Even if you do n’t have kids , you can learn from this article about how to “ gift ” yourself during stressful times .
Environment Matters :
You do n’t eat in the bathroom , and you do n’t sleep in the garbage bin .
But , if you take a look around , you may find that you ’re simulating those negative environments in your office or bedroom .
Spend time cleaning the clutter , as a pleasant environment contributes to a pleasant state of mind .
Productivity is Key : Although you may feel as though you ca n’t lift your pinky finger , thanks to apathy or depression , systematic productivity can help you feel good about yourself .
Do one thing at a time and enjoy it ; or , at least enjoy getting it done .
Learn more from this free book about how to prevent stress through positive productivity .
Self - Massage : Learn how to relieve headaches , tired eyes , sore muscles and more through these short videos .
Each video tackles a specific problem , and they ’re all rated highly .
This means you do n’t need to stress out about paying a massage therapist ; although a professional massage on occasion will help you feel righteous about yourself .
Learn How to Breath : Breath focus is a common feature of several techniques that evoke the relaxation response , a technique first developed in the 1970s at Harvard Medical School by cardiologist Dr. Herbert Benson .
Learning how to breath is one method involved in that technique , and a major factor in avoiding stress and fear .
Do n’t Worry :
Whether you ’re spiritual or religious or none of the above , your ability to believe that everything will turn out ok is key to peace of mind .
The saying , “ Things happen for a reason , ” may help you see the bright side in dark situations .
Or , you can learn how to stop worrying unnecessarily through some techniques developed by Dale Carnegie in 1948 .
Consider the Source : Relying on other people ’s opinions is good for certain decisions .
But , consider the source : if that person is placing a burden on you with guilt , wrong information or other negative motives , then you can detach from that source for some inner peace .
Use the tips at this link to learn more about how to discern “ good ” information from “ bad ” sources .
Break the Monotony : Women and children are constantly warned to change their patterns if they walk every day to the same location .
The reason behind this advice is safety , but it also helps bring vitality to life and a sense of control and peace .
Change up your lifestyle ( especially if you ’re single ) to see if you achieve the same feelings … turn off the TV and exercise , invite friends over for a game of cards or even think about a new career .
Get More Exercise : Stress may affect your heart , but stress from exercise strengthens your heart .
You may hate to exercise , but you can find ways to move without calling it “ exercise . ”
Walk around the mall and window - shop , or take the stairs instead of the elevator .
Do some housework or create a garden .
Exercise can elevate your mood , help concentration and focus and help you sleep better at night .
Control the Noise :
If you live near an airport , try to move .
If your roommate watches car races all day long , buy some headphones for your roommate ( and try to remember that car racing is seasonal ) .
The point is to learn how to control the noise in your environment for your peace of mind .
Noise pollution can take a toll on your health and happiness .
See “ Music Tips ” below for more information .
Music Tips
Music can prove relaxing or stressful , depending upon your situation .
The following tips may help you decide when , where and what you want to hear to help you focus and remain calm .
Learn About Music : Music can manage pain , improve mood and mobility , reduce the need for pain relievers and sedatives , relieve anxiety , lower blood pressure , ease depression and enhance concentration and creativity .
Yes , really .
Give it a shot .
Get a Beat Going : Research has shown that music with a strong beat can help provide sharper concentration and more alert thinking .
Plus , rhythmic music may change brain function and treat a range of neurological conditions , including attention - deficit disorder and depression .
Use music with a beat when you ’re feeling down and need to focus .
Slow it Down :
If you want to relax , the last thing you need is “ dance fever ” music .
Instead , choose something soothing .
If soothing music can help overcome anxiety , stress and maybe even depression in pregnant women , it may work for you , too .
Control Your Environment :
Why listen to news when you ’re preparing a meal ?
You want love in that food , not stress .
Whether upbeat or soothing , music can alter your environment , and never forget that you can control of the music choice and volume .
Music
Therapy : Music can be used to address physical , emotional , cognitive and social needs for individuals of any age .
If you want to learn more about how music affects you and your environment , visit the American Music Therapy Web site .
Eating Tips
You are what you eat … so if you eat junk food on the run , expect a lousy day .
Sugar , salt and fatty foods are a great way to avoid the ability to focus and the peace of tranquility .
The following tips will help you manage your intake for optimum health and well - being .
Eating Causes Stress :
Even if you ’re digging into your favorite food groups , eating causes what is known as “ oxidative stress . ”
But , antioxidants can fight that situation , and healthy compounds found in fruits and vegetables will do the trick .
Manage Stress with Food :
While eating food is stressful , certain foods are more harmful than others .
Some foods can help you manage stress , some can help elevate your mood and others can calm and relax you .
Try food , instead of drugs , to help manage your day .
But , try to avoid overeating , as this activity can lead to obesity , which can lead to poor sleep and even more stress and depression .
Eat Your Good Cholesterol : And , help to eliminate the “ bad ” LDL cholesterol with certain foods such as oatmeal , olive oil , certain nuts and more .
Eat Fresh :
You can avoid budget stress , achieve a calm mind and sleep better if you eat meals that are fresh , rather than salty and fatty foods and “ junk food . ”
Overeating — and eating the wrong foods — are major factors that work against focus and tranquility .
Use a meal planner like this one to help lower your stress about cooking , too .
Eat Regular and Right :
No matter if you eat 100 calories per hour , three full meals with fruit snacks in between , or just three meals … a regular diet will help you sleep better and also will help you maintain energy and brain power throughout the day .
At Work
There is mounting evidence that work can age you , thanks to the stress involved in deadlines , negative environments and little room for mistakes .
But , if you can apply some of the following tips , perhaps you ’ll begin to feel younger and more tranquil :
Work in Fresh Air :
If you can , try to work or study in fresh air .
Open a window if possible or make sure ventilation is working well .
Fresh air helps to keep your mind clear and focused and revitalizes your body .
Introduce Plants to the Indoors :
If you ca n’t introduce fresh air , Plants help to absorb pollutants and they raise the level of fresh oxygen in the air , too .
Plus , plants add visual appeal , and taking care of them often adds to one of life ’s joys .
Take Sun Breaks :
Take breaks to stand outside on sunny days .
Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) is known to occur in individuals who do n’t get sufficient amounts of sunlight .
Melatonin , which is a sleep - related hormone , is secreted in increased levels in the dark .
Good for sleep , but not for work .
Eliminate Tobacco Smoke :
If you still smoke , do it outside .
Do n’t bring pollutants into your work or home environment , even if you continue to ingest them internally .
This habit also helps to eliminate second - hand smoke , a problem that can cause cancer and other health problems for others .
Find Birds of a Feather :
Those birds tend to flock together …if you want to get work done , hang around with the workers .
If you want to relax , avoid the gossips , nay - sayers and whiners .
If you work solo , try to stay in touch with positive people through social networks such as FaceBook , Twitter , etc .
You can turn social networks off and on during the day , just like the phone .
Create a Focus :
Even if you ’re not interested in what you ’re doing , try to fake it .
Dr. Anne Reith , author of several gooks on student success , suggest pretending that you are a reporter who must write an article on a lecture .
This type of concentration works during that board meeting as well .
Exercise Before or During Work : University of Bristol researchers found that employees who enjoyed a workout before going to work — or exercised during lunchbreaks — were better equipped to handle whatever the day threw at them .
Try these “ workexercise ” tricks to get started and build from there .
Be in the Moment :
In other words , avoid multi-tasking .
While conducting two or more tasks at one time might seem productive , in reality you avoid focusing on a single task to completion .
Multi-tasking the antithesis to tranquility .
Let Go :
Of control , that is .
You are not the Master of the Universe , even if you ’re the boss .
Learn to separate yourself from your tasks and learn how to delegate .
Others will be happy for the responsibility and you will be less stressed and more focused on your priorities .
After Work
Develop Supportive Friendships :
You may not want to develop these friendships among co-workers , vendors or other people who affect your work .
Instead , look to family , friends outside of work and others who maintain similar interests and a desire to relax in a healthy way .
Help Others :
One way to forget your own problems is to help others .
One person even discovered that it helped his business when he helped his competitors .
If you ca n’t go that far , at least help your neighbor , volunteer at a soup kitchen , or travel while helping to build homes .
This is a great way to focus on gratitude .
Avoid the Bar :
If you have a habit of visiting the local bar after work , try something different .
Take a walk , head home and have a glass of wine with dinner instead .
You may sleep better , and you can avoid all the bar drama and Karaoke as well .
Take a Class : Expand your horizons and develop more self - confidence through adult - learning classes .
Instead of using these classes to advance your career , branch out into something different .
Learn ( or re-learn ) how to cook healthy meals , take a yoga class or learn how to dance .
You ’ll focus on your new learning , which is a great way to put the workday behind you .
Make New Resolutions :
You do n’t need to wait for the New Year to make new resolutions .
Create goals , and take baby steps each day after work to reach them .
With each small step toward your goal , you may feel a sense of renewed focus and accomplishment .
In the Evening
Sometimes the best way to avoid stress in the future is to take care of things now .
This includes the following items :
Plan Your Wardrobe : Plan ahead for what you ’ll wear to work the next day or even for the entire week .
If you need to do laundry or iron a piece of clothing or clean your shoes , this is the time to do it .
Although you are n’t a kid in school anymore , laying you ’ll be happy you took care of yourself when morning comes around ( this article also shows you how to clean out that closet ) .
Prepare for Work :
If you need to prepare for a meeting the next day or for other activities , make sure you have everything you need now .
That way , you can wake up peacefully , knowing that you are in control of your destiny .
If , as in this article , you must prepare for work in a home office , take heed and learn how to separate your office from your personal life .
Identify Stressors : Begin to identify the things that stress you out during the workday .
Make a list , and begin to weed out those stressors .
For those triggers you can’t eliminate , begin to find ways to make them less stressful .
Simplify Your Plans :
While you ’re taking care of the things you need for the next day , you can begin to see some items on your list ( s ) that you can eliminate .
Take care of priorities , then see what you can eliminate … maybe you ’ll have some time for that relaxing walk in the sun during lunch , rather than yet another meeting .
Identify the Source :
As you begin to simplify your plans for the following day , touch base with how you feel about these eliminations .
Maybe the stress is coming from inside you , and not from outside ?
If you can identify the source of your stress , this revelation could help you to obtain some peace .
Plan for the Unexpected :
What if you lose your job tomorrow ?
Do n’t be stressed ; be prepared !
Develop a “ Plan B ” during this time each day that will help you face the unexpected .
Update your resume , learn new skills , and create goals that are achievable over a period of time .
If you ’re prepared for the unexpected , you ’ll feel more confident and at peace .
Before Bed
There are many things you can do to invite tranquility into your life so you can sleep well .
Here are a few of those ideas :
Pamper Yourself :
Some folks think that manicures and pedicures are a waste of money , but one session with a professional can make a person feel like new .
You can do this at home , too .
Take care of your body and you ’ll feel good about yourself .
Plus , you can rest easier when you know you look your best ( this includes men ) .
Home Spa Experience :
If you have a hot tub , you already know how even a short soak can bring relaxation into your life .
But , you can set up a spa in your bathroom , too .
This link will take you to an article that will help with your home spa experience .
Practice Meditation : Meditation is not easy , especially if your head is spinning with things you MUST do .
But , begin slowly and you may discover that meditation is a great practice , and it could help bring tranquility into your life .
Learn Visualization : Based upon guided imagery , you can learn how to imagine your future , one filled with a focus on success and tranquility .
Can you have both ?
If you can visualize it , perhaps you can !
At the very least , visualization is a great way to focus and to relax .
Light Exercise :
If you ’re feeling “ antsy ” before bed , try yoga to calm your body and soul .
While some people can engage in vigorous exercise before bedtime , rigorous exercise is detrimental to sleep for others .
You ’ll need to discover what works for you .
Practice Progressive Muscle Relaxation :
When you tense and relax all the muscle groups in your body , you can relieve tension and achieve relaxation in minutes .
You can try this in bed , too , to speed sleep your way .
Make Love , Not War :
If you have a partner , you may know that sex provides a great way to relieve stress and tension .
While you may not feel like making love when stressed , this actually is the best time to take a break and spend time with your partner .
It sure beats arguing before bedtime !
Limit Fluid Intake :
While fluids , such as water , are necessary for top - notch body functions , try to reduce the amount of fluids you drink before you sleep .
This reduction can help you sleep through the night , rather waking in the middle of the night to use the bathroom .
Try Trytophan Instead of Pills : Tryptophan , an amino acid found in foods such as turkey , chicken , fish , pheasant , partridge , cottage cheese , bananas , eggs , nuts , wheat germ , avocados , milk , cheese and the legumes , can make you sleepy .
Tryptophan helps the body produce the B - vitamin niacin , which , in turn , helps the body produce serotonin , a remarkable chemical that acts as a calming agent in the brain and plays a key role in sleep .
Fall Asleep to Music :
You may not like any songs on this person ’s list , but it ’s a starting point .
No matter whether you like soft rock , classical or country music , you can create a playlist that will help you focus more on the music and less on the tornado in your head .
Falling asleep to music may help you wake up in a different mood .
During the Night
If you ’re not getting a good night ’s sleep , then you are n’t achieving a path to tranquility or the ability to concentrate during the day .
There are few tips listed here , because if you practice many of the other tips in the other categories , you may find yourself sleeping better anyway !
High Quality Sleep :
How long do you sleep ?
Sleep deprivation can cause fatigue , reduce brain function and reaction times , and alters mood , among other negative side effects .
Plus , lack of sleep can inhibit your desire to exercise or to do other things that will reduce stress and help you to relax .
Try to get between seven and eight hours of sleep per night .
Use Earplugs if Necessary : Does your partner snore ?
Is the neighbor having a late - night party ?
While many earplugs may prove uncomfortable , try moldable earplugs that you can shape and fit to your ear .
You will achieve a great night ’s sleep , but make sure that alarm clock is set to “ high ” so you wake up !
Help for sleep : Consistently poor sleep now is associated with overeating and obesity .
But , exercise and a balanced diet will help you tackle several problems at once .
Plus , attention to your environment and what you eat and drink are huge factors that you can control .
Sleep Disorders : Sleep disorders often are caused by a number of factors , including heavy meals , alcohol , caffeine and nicotine .
Other problems for a healthy sleep include stress , depression , late vigorous exercise and emotional or mental problems .
Try to eliminate as many causes for irregular sleep as possible .
Get Help :
If you have eliminated all possible problems for sleep disorders and you still can’t sleep , then seek help .
Continued sleep disorders can lead to physical disorders and emotional problems .
An article like the one linked here can give you information you might need to tackle various sleep problems , one problem at a time .
In the Morning
If you ’re stressed or depressed , the best time to get yourself in the mood for the day is in the morning .
While you may not want to get out of bed , perhaps some of the following tips can help revitalize you and relieve some of your stress .
Wake up to Music :
While some people might want to hear soothing music in the morning , try something with a beat , instead .
The beat could help move your heart and breathing to go in sync with the music ’s beat .
But , if the music makes you jittery , slow it down .
Deep Breathing : Deep breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress in the body .
At the same time , deep breathing can help you focus and feel re-energized .
Before you leave the bed , do some deep breathing exercises to get your blood moving in a positive way .
Morning Massage :
You do n’t need to leave your bed to practice some stimulating massage .
Big stretches , head massages and “ scalp tapping ” can stimulate your body and soul .
Try the routine suggested in this article at the UK Guardian .
Stretch :
As you age , you begin to lose some muscle tone and range of movement .
Simple stretching can help you retain your range of motion .
But , be careful : stretching also can cause injuries , so start slowly .
A side benefit is that stretching gets your blood moving , helping you to focus .
Eat Breakfast : Yes , this is the most important meal of your day .
You are “ breaking a fast ” that you endured during sleeping , and what you ingest now can make or break your morning .
If studies show that children who eat breakfast perform better in school , it does n’t take much thought to realize that adults could feel and perform better at work .
Take a Walk or Exercise : Like stretching , walking can contribute to brain “ fitness ” , but it also helps to strengthen your heart and can delay or prevent major diseases or illnesses .
Exercise , also , can help you feel on top of the world , especially if you exercise in the morning .
You get a kick - start , a new focus on your day , and this practice also helps you to sleep at night .
Start with Green Tea , Not Coffee : A cup of green tea can fill you with antioxidants and is a healthy lifestyle choice to start your day .
If you feel the need for caffeine , you can find it in some green teas to help wean yourself away from the brew .
Drive Time
Ever feel that road rage coming on while driving to and from work ?
Here are a few solutions that can help you focus and retain a tranquil morning .
Manage Your Time : Plan to arrive early , so if traffic is slow you wo n’t be late .
Often , road rage occurs when we ’re angry about the inability to control a situation .
If you plan for enough time to travel , you can retain your equilibrium .
Breathe Through the Tension : Did you learn how to breathe correctly to relieve tension ?
Use your knowledge now to make it to the next stoplight .
Listen to Audio Books or Music :
Use this down time to listen to music or to catch up on your audio “ reading . ”
Soothing music , upbeat dance tunes or funny audio books can help break any tension you might feel .
And , you might just sing along to release some anger .
Just be sure to concentrate on traffic when you ’re moving again .
Take Public Transportation :
If you take the bus or train , you might find time to catch up on your reading .
Leave the driving to someone else and arrive unhassled and fresh to and from work .
Ride Share :
While ride - sharing helps cut gas costs , it also can keep you in line .
You might curse at another driver when alone , but you might hold your tongue with someone in the car .
You can relieve that tension later on the treadmill .
Use local tools like the one linked here for Cal Poly students to find a person to ride with you .
Try Automotive Aromatherapy : New studies have shown that the smell of cinnamon or peppermint might take the edge off road rage during your next traffic jam .
Peppermint and cinnamon odors boost motivation , performance , and alertness while cutting fatigue and stimulating the brain .
Be Productive :
If down time is what gets under your skin , turn that traffic jam into a production session .
Make sure a tape recorder is with you at all times , so you can take notes or dictate letters .
Maintain Healthy Choices
Even if you ca n’t afford health insurance , think about spending a few dollars here and there on health maintenance .
Silent killers , such as cholesterol and high blood pressure are especially important to monitor .
If you are in good health and you know it , it ’s easier to focus and maintain a relaxing lifestyle .
Learn About Blood Pressure : A stressful life can lead to higher blood pressure , and high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attacks , strokes and heart failure .
Your systolic blood pressure should be below 140 and your diastolic blood pressure below 90 .
Certain individuals need to achieve even tighter control of their blood pressure .
Get a Blood Pressure Monitor :
You can check your own blood pressure daily or even twice a day .
Additionally , owning a cuff means that you can check your blood pressure after exercising .
This tool is a huge help for you and your doctor as you can help that doctor stay on top of any changes in your health plan .
Check Cholesterol Levels :
The only way to know if you have a healthy cholesterol level is to get it checked .
If you have not had your levels checked in the past year or two , get them checked now .
The ideal level for your LDL ( “ bad ” cholesterol ) is less than 100 .
Keeping your HDL ( “ good ” cholesterol ) levels up is also important .
Know your lipid levels and talk to your physician about the best plan of action to keep your cholesterol levels ideal .
Keep a Journal :
When you document your progress in a journal , you can begin to see your progress in all your goals .
This is a tool that help you reach for more changes that will help you avoid stress and meet tranquility head on .
Understand Stress Myths
Finally , it ’s good to understand that some stress is good .
Stress can force positive and healthy changes , and — since relaxation and focus is the opposite of stress — you can use stress as a measurement to determine your progress toward a better life .
The following myths may help you understand whether a renewed focus and tranquility are possibilities for you …since stress is , after all , unavoidable .
I respect Richard Stallman for the same reason I respect gravity .
The man is a force of nature .
He is like the iron core of the Earth : fixed , central , essential .
So , when I read a story like " Cloud computing is a trap , warns GNU founder Richard Stallman " , which ran in the Guardian last week , I take notice .
And I 'm not alone .
A search on Google for stallman " cloud computing " brings up 142,000 results .
Of cloud computing , RMS says , " It 's worse than stupidity : it 's a marketing hype campaign " .
Also , " Somebody is saying this is inevitable – and whenever you hear somebody saying that , it 's very likely to be a set of businesses campaigning to make it true " .
And , " One reason you should not use web applications to do your computing is that you lose control ...
" It 's just as bad as using a proprietary program .
Do your own computing on your own computer with your copy of a freedom - respecting program .
If you use a proprietary program or somebody else 's web server , you 're defenceless .
You 're putty in the hands of whoever developed that software " .
The story points back to this post by Chris Brogan , about how Nick Saber one day " came back from lunch to find out that he could n't get into his Gmail account .
Further , he could n't get into anything that Google made ( beside search ) where his account credentials once worked " .
Long story short , Nick 's account was restored , and Google did get back to him personally ( after putting him through an automated impersonal treatment stage ) , and much learning resulted through actual human contact .
But still , we 're talking about exposure here .
How much of our lives should we be willing to put off in the mists we call " clouds " ?
RMS has a simple answer : none .
But are all clouds the same , and do they all involve relinquishment of control over your own digital life ?
After failing to master SpamAssassin last year I gave up and started routing my inbound mail ( to my searls.com address ) through Gmail .
Google does n't keep any of that mail .
And I do n't have to keep Google as a provider of spam filtration .
In fact I have what Joe Andrieu calls " service portability " : the ability to substitute one service for another -- as one would with , say , a bank .
Is that a Bad Thing ?
Not sure .
On the other hand ( or another tentacle , since there are many different scenarios here ) , I 've never felt comfortable about doing my writing or storing my files in any clouds ; although I have to confess that Amazon 's S3 tempts me , mostly because I 've lost or crashed more personal hard drives than I can count .
Meaning , I think the chance of Amazon losing my data is a lot smaller than my own chance of doing the same .
I 'm also not clear to me if a Web service like Flickr is a " cloud " thing .
I have 23,697 photos on Flickr right now .
I can do far more with those pix there than I can here .
But I do have them here , on a hard drive .
Two , actually .
And if those are lost or stolen , I'm SOL .
Except for the shots on Flickr .
Still , I think that RMS is onto something .
The core promise of computing , even on a vast network that connects us all , is autonomy and independence .
It 's being free ( as in freedom ) to operate on your own , and to share what 's meant to be shared in ways that nobody else can control , and to improve useful goods in ways that work for everybody .
There are , in those core values , imperatives that seem at odds with the dependencies that " cloud computing " can sometimes involve .
For my chapter of Open Sources 2.0 , I borrowed this " layers of time " diagram from the Long Now Foundation ...
... and explained ,
At the bottom we find the end - to - end nature of the Net .
It 's also where we find Richard M. Stallman , the GNU project , the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) and hackers whose interests are anchored in the nature of software , which they understand fundamentally to be free .
When Richard M. Stallman writes , " everyone will be able to obtain good system software free , just like air " , he 's operating at the Nature level .
He does n't just believe software ought to be free ; he believes its nature is to be free .
The unbending constancy of his beliefs has anchored free software , and then open source development , since the 1980s .
That 's when the GNU tools and components , along with the Internet , began to grow and flourish .
The open source movement , which grew on top of the free software movement , is most at home one layer up , in Culture .
Since Culture supports the Governance , the open source community devotes a lot of energy and thought to the subject of licensing .
In fact , the Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) serves a kind of governance function , carefully approving open source licenses that fit its definition of open source .
While Richard and the FSF ( Free Software Foundation ) , sitting down there at the Nature level , strongly advocate one license ( the GPL or General Public License ) , the OSI has approved around fifty of them .
Many of those licenses are authored by commercial entities with an interest in the governance that supports the infrastructure they put to use .
Well , now that culture is at the heart of Google , Yahoo , Amazon , Dell and other providers of " cloud " services .
We treat these as infrastructure , but in fact they 're not .
They 're up at the Commerce level , and in some ways at the Fashion level as well -- at least to the degree that " cloud " is a hot topic .
In that same Guardian piece , Oracle 's Larry Ellison calls cloud computing announcements " fashion - driven " , adding , " The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion - driven than women 's fashion .
Maybe I 'm an idiot , but I have no idea what anyone is talking about .
What is it ?
It 's complete gibberish .
It 's insane .
When is this idiocy going to stop ? "
Meanwhile , there 's RMS , back down at the Nature level , calling this current weather system stupid .
Is it ?
I 'm thinking of writing more about this for an upcoming print edition of Linux Journal , so I thought I 'd ask what ya'll think first .

What shall we make of the wrath of God ?
We have this quote from the Gospel of St. Luke :
And it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem , And sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as Elias did ?
But he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of ( Luke 9:51 - 55 ) .
In this passage , sending down fire from heaven , in the pattern of Elijah is rebuked as somehow belonging to “ another spirit . ”
Fans of New Testament wrath are quick to point out the passage in Acts concerning Ananias and Sapphira :
But a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , sold a possession , And kept back part of the price , his wife also being privy to it , and brought a certain part , and laid it at the apostles ’ feet .
But Peter said , Ananias , why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
Whiles it remained , was it not thine own ?
and after it was sold , was it not in thine own power ?
why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart ?
thou hast not lied unto men , but unto God .
And Ananias hearing these words fell down , and gave up the ghost : and great fear came on all them that heard these things .
And the young men arose , wound him up , and carried him out , and buried him .
And it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
And Peter answered unto her , Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much ?
And she said , Yea , for so much .
Then Peter said unto her , How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord ?
behold , the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door , and shall carry thee out .
Then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
And great fear came upon all the church , and upon as many as heard these things ( Acts 5:1- 11 )
For accuracies ’ sake , it must be noted that we are nowhere told that Ananias and Sapphira died as the result of the action of God .
We are told that they fell down dead .
This is not unimportant .
Of course the New Testament makes reference to the wrath of God .
Indeed there are 45 verses which make reference to the wrath .
It is little wonder that interpreters should want to make a theological point out of so common a reference .
Of course many of those verses refer to our own wrath and tell us to put it away from us .
But of the wrath of God we read a typical passage :
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth ; fornication , uncleanness , inordinate affection , evil concupiscence , and covetousness , which is idolatry : For which things ’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience ( Colossians 3:5 -6 ) .
A legitimate question has to be : has the Spirit “ of which we are ” changed between Luke 9 and Colossians 3 ?
Or is there a deeper understanding at work ?
With this I offer an Orthodox answer .
First , Christ Himself is the definitive revelation of God and that revelation is not corrected by either an Old Testament reading ( for “ these are they which testify of me ” ) nor by an Epistle , for Christ as witnessed to in the gospels is the definitive revelation for interpreting even the Epistles .
Of course my citation of Luke 9 is often countered with , “ What about the moneychangers in the Temple ? ”
To which I can only say that He “ drove them out with a whip ” which is not the same thing as saying that Christ beat them , nor did He call down fire from heaven to consume them .
For various reasons , some people are determined to make the economy of salvation to be linked with the Wrath of God .
If you do not repent , then God will do thus and such …
I have always considered this representation of the gospel to be coercive and contrary to the love of God .
I have heard convoluted ways in which this wrath is interpreted to be “ the loving thing to do ” but I do not buy it .
The common witness within Orthodox Tradition is that the wrath of God is a theological term which describes not God Himself , but a state of being in which are opposed to God .
Thus the work of Kalomiros , The River of Fire , makes ample citation of the fathers in this matter .
We may place ourselves in such a position that even the love of God seems to us as fire or wrath .
But it is essential in our witness to the God Who Is , to always relate the fact that He is a loving God , not willing that any should perish .
He is not against us but for us .
This is utterly essential to the correct proclamation of the Gospel .
Those who insist on exalting
His wrath as a threat , inevitably misportray God and use anthropormorphism as a substitute for the Gospel of Jesus Christ .
Intricate theories of the atonement which involve the assuaging of the wrath of God are not worthy of the God and Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ .
I can say it no plainer .
Those who persist in such theological accounts do not know “ what Spirit they are of . ”
It is not ever appropriate to exalt a Biblical system over the plain sense communicated to us in the Gospel .
No matter the chain of verses and the rational explanations attached – we cannot portray God as other than as He has shown Himself to us in Jesus Christ .
To do so makes the Bible greater than Christ .
It is very difficult in our culture , where the wrathful God has been such an important part of the gospel story , to turn away from such portrayals – and yet it is necessary – both for faithfulness to the Scripture , the Fathers , and the revelation of God in Christ .
I commend the referenced work , the River of Fire , for its compliation of Patristic sources .
I also beg other Christians to be done with their imagery of the wrathful God .
They do not know the God of Whom they speak .
Forgive me .

Update :
COLORADO SPRINGS —
The city is considering changes in the way it cleans up homeless encampments after being accused of illegally seizing residents ’ property .
Homeless people and their advocates say prescription drugs , military service medals , sleeping bags , tents and other personal property were taken during the regular sweeps by city - backed crews .
The city has paid the nonprofit Keep Colorado Springs Beautiful to perform sweeps since 1998 .
After a veterans group threatened a lawsuit , claiming the civil rights of the homeless were being violated , the city in October declared a moratorium on the cleanups .
The City Council will vote Feb. 24 on a plan to reinstitute the cleanups under new guidelines .
Representatives for police and the nonprofit say they targeted trash , not usable personal items , during the sweeps .
They said the only drugs taken were either illegal substances or mixtures of pills in plastic bags and other containers that did not show any indication of having been prescribed .
Police said they do not keep lists of items taken from the camps and that many such items were destroyed .
Robert Moran , founder of the Street Church , which serves homeless people , said he believes there is more behind the cleanup effort than a desire to keep the city beautiful .
“ Nobody is against cleaning up trash .
But the sweeps are a desperate attempt to solve the homeless problem by making them go someplace else , ” Moran said .
It was Moran who brought the sweeps to public attention when he videotaped police and the nonprofit cleaning up a campsite in October .
On the tape , workers for the nonprofit are shown stuffing a pillow and other items into trash bags , and an officer is shown opening and searching a suitcase .
“ You come back , and your whole camp is upside down , ” said Jeff Wempe , 43 .
“ I lost my whole camp , my tent , my sleeping bag .
They took my ID .
I had to send back to Missouri where I was born , and they had to send me a birth certificate . ”
But Colorado Springs police Cmdr. Kurt Pillard denies that either police or the workers — many of them young people ordered by a judge to perform community service — have trashed personal possessions .
“ When you hear that sleeping bags are being thrown away … they are no longer usable because of the extreme filth .
Items have also been disposed of that are infested with rodents and insects , ” Pillard said .
Similar cleanups around the country have led to court rulings saying the sweeps violate the constitutional ban on unwarranted search and seizure , said Tulin Ozdeger , civil - rights director for the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty .
“ People do have a right to their property , and if the city wants to clear out a public space , they need to follow proper procedures .
( The homeless ) should be given notice , and they should n’t destroy property immediately .
It should be stowed so that it can be reclaimed , ” Ozdeger said .
The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless said it is n’t aware of any other cities in the state that sponsor such cleanups .
Since the sweeps were stopped in Colorado Springs , the city has reviewed ethical and legal issues , said Colorado Springs Councilman Jerry Heimlicher .
The proposed rule changes would require the nonprofit to post a notice in areas where a cleanup is planned , giving the occupants 72 hours ’ warning .
The city also is considering storing personal property someplace where it can be reclaimed without police involvement .
An estimated 800 homeless people live in Colorado Springs .
Some spend the nights at the Salvation Army New Hope Center , a nonprofit , 210 - bed shelter , Moran said .
Others find a place to stay at about a dozen other facilities , each with only a few beds , that are run by nonprofits .
That leaves hundreds of homeless people who cannot find shelter .
Last year , El Paso County cut its $ 209,000 contribution to the town ’s only detox center , a blow that , coupled with an annual $ 1.4 million shortfall , led to its closure early this month .
Homeless who have mental problems often require medication to avoid slipping into confusion or worse .
Others are in pain and have been prescribed painkillers .
Still others inject insulin to control diabetes , said Patrick Ayers , who heads a local chapter of Pax Christi .
At the Peak Vista Community Health ’s Homeless Health Center , demand for prescription - drug refills spiked whenever police and cleanup crews swept the camps , said Lynn Pells , spokeswoman for the clinic .
Pillard said , “ If a prescription was found in an appropriate container with a name on it , we would have tried to locate the owner .
But these are drugs that have been compromised .
They are taken to the evidence custodian at the Police Department , and when we have enough stuff , it is destroyed . ”
Police do not document the medications taken from the camps , only those drugs seized when criminal activity is involved , Pillard said .
How police handle drugs they find in such situations is an internal affair , according to the El Paso County District Attorney ’s Office and the Drug Enforcement Administration .
Pillard also said police try to give the homeless a warning of impending cleanups .
But those who are n’t in the camp at the time can not be told .
Some homeless people said they would receive at most 15 minutes to pick up belongings or lose them , or no warning at all .
Mel Brant , 52 , a one - time cowboy with a straight , black ponytail , said he lost his military discharge papers , a sleeping bag , a tent and other property to a cleanup .
Others say the commendations they won serving in Iraq and other countries were taken , said Rick Duncan , head of the Colorado Veterans ’ Alliance .
“ We are working through our congressional delegation to get those replaced , ” Duncan said .
If personal items appeared to be abandoned , they may have been taken during the sweeps , but police did what they could to return them to owners , Pillard said .
Heimlicher said police posted notes saying that if valuables were missing , the homeless should check for them at the police station .
Few items were reclaimed .
“ A lot of those folks do n’t consider the police as friendly , ” Heimlicher said .
“ Very little is ever picked up . ”

President Obama has started to play the " catastrophe " card to sell his economic stimulus plan , using yesterday 's terrible January jobs report to predict doom unless Congress acts .
No doubt he 'll get his way , but the tragedy of this first great effort of the Obama Presidency is what a lost opportunity it is .
Everyone agrees that some kind of fiscal stimulus might help the economy , and that running budget deficits is appropriate in a recession .
The stage was thus set for the popular President to forge a bipartisan consensus ...
You see , people need heroes to look up to , especially when they are young .
Kids naturally seek out a mold to pour themselves into , someone besides mommy and daddy that can do extraordinary things to model themselves after .
Whether that 's a legendary warrior in the age - old tales of a village shaman , a big sister , a laser - firing robot or the ideal of a firefighter , cop or princess is irrelevant - what matters is the accessability of the character , how easily he or she can be understood , how easily and how much he or she can be respected , and for what qualities or actions .
So how does this play out in today 's world ?
Anyone can tell that we 've transcended the single hero mentality by a long ways , that we 've left the days of three - or - four " great heroes " behind in favor of endless hoards of protagonists ( and antagonists ) vying for our affections - and it's all thanks to the information age and the steady climb that we 've made toward it .
Think about it - growing up in a small village in the ancient past , you would n't have had much to go on .
You 'd look up to your father or your mother , maybe a grandparent or an uncle as your " hero " .
The mythology would be his or her exploits , harrowing adventures , and near misses - sound familiar ?
The kind of things we share around the table today are the same kinds of things we shared around the fire in the distant past , inspiring the young to go out and try new things , to assert themselves and change the world around them .
As time went on , the number of available heroes and the number of stories expanded - larger communities and contact with other cultures brought divinity and great heroes and other peoples ' relatives into the picture , and then the heroes spun and spread by poets , bards , and storytellers alike blossomed and tantalized in ever - increasing droves until a whole plethora of heroes became available for the common man or woman - or most importantly , the common child - to look up to .
In the not - so - distant past , the heroes of books , radio , and much later , movies , followed this example as they popped up and began to snare our attentions .
The Lone Ranger , Flash Gordon , and even Captain Kirk inspired countless children to push forward and attain their own superhuman heights - and new heroes were thus born , more men and women that could be looked up to and idolized , used as a benchmark for progress and a guide whenever the flying got hard .
And with each new decade , with each new technological mark we surpass that brings humanity just a little closer together , the number of available heroes to inspire us continues to grow , hundreds pouring out of the stories that come to us through books , television , movies , even anime and interactive media like videogames and " action books . "
It 's all the same - from Lancelot , Indra , and Jason to Luke Skywalker , Ellen Ripley , and Cloud Strife , the hero myth proves itself eternal and continues unabated , rising up and griping us , giving us men and women with superhuman qualities that we can look up to and emulate consciously or unconsciously throughout the rigors of our everyday lives and the not - so - everyday circumstances we all - too - often find ourselves face - to - face with .
Every second , new heroes are born and new people are exposed to them - it 's an endless cycle .
Just ask anyone the simple question of who their hero is and you 'll get an incredible array of answers , from relatives and friends to characters that have never existed outside the imagination , with many people not content to pick or stick to just one in any given circumstance .
OTTAWA – Canada 's information watchdog says the public knows less than ever about what its government is doing – a stark contrast to Barack Obama 's push for openness in the United States .
Information Commissioner Robert Marleau said Thursday the grip on federal files is tightening , largely because of the Conservative government 's " communications stranglehold " on the bureaucracy .
" There 's less information being released by government than ever before .
And that 's alarming . "
In Washington this week , Obama marked his first full day in office by serving notice to officials they must favour disclosure of records under the Freedom of Information Act over keeping them secret .
" The government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure , because errors and failures might be revealed , or because of speculative or abstract fears , " said his memo to the heads of departments and agencies .
Canada 's Access to Information
Act , which has changed little in a quarter of a century , is often criticized as poorly administered , antiquated and generally neglected by the government .
It means those who plunk down $ 5 to request information from federal agencies face delays of several months and frequently receive little of value .
Marleau 's office is so backlogged it can take a year or more for his staff to investigate complaints .
The Conservatives took office in early 2006 partly on the strength of promises of new accountability , including reforms to Canada 's outdated Access to Information regime advocated by Marleau 's predecessor .
However , the Harper government made good on only a handful of changes , including opening the law to some additional agencies .
But the issue of access reform was handed to a Commons committee for more study .
A declaration of openness from Harper to match Obama 's call for transparency would be significant , Marleau said .
" It sends a real signal .
Whatever the prime minister has to articulate in terms of policy , the public servants listen carefully .
It would be very important , it would have a dramatic impact , I believe , " Marleau said .
" I certainly would welcome it . "
Lawyer and frequent user of the access law Michel Drapeau agrees .
" I think it would have a huge effect , an absolutely huge effect , " said Drapeau , a retired colonel and author of a reference book on the information law .
Bureaucrats would respond to a strong signal from above that things should be done differently , he said .
" They know when there is a wind of change in the place . "
Harper spokesman Andrew MacDougall said the government has fought for the right of Canadians to know how their government operates , noting that 70 new institutions – including the Wheat Board and CBC – are now covered by the law .

" This government remains committed to accountability and to transparency . "
MacDougall said the Conservatives would implement " procedural recommendations " made by the information commissioner , though he could not say when or provide other details .
Marleau said he plans to present special report cards to Parliament on 10 federal agencies in February that show the information fog is thickening .
" The time extensions are longer and longer , " he said .
" There is an information management crisis in the public service of Canada . "
Departments do n't know what they have , nor where to find it .
``Technology has overtaken them .
If you do n't know what you have , how can you access it ? "
Marleau said the tone is set in the Prime Minister 's Office .
" You hear it all around town that ministers are n't allowed to communicate , " he said .
" It trickles down the side of the mountain in various departments .
" If the message out there is that you cannot talk to the media , you cannot communicate with citizens without clearing it at the centre , then how do you feel as a public servant answering the telephone when either a member of the media or the public call you for information ?
It inevitably has to have a chill effect . "

Many have wondered about what the semantic web and publishing can offer each other .
( By " publishing " here , I mean " making content available in one media or another , ideally to make money " . )
After following a lot of writing and discussions in these two worlds — and they are surprisingly separate worlds — I have a few ideas and wanted to write them up where people could comment on them .
What can the publishing world offer to the semantic web ?
The less obvious , but to me , the clearest win is what the publishing world can offer to the semantic web : the lessons learned from long practical experience with developing and applying taxonomies , such as identifying useful concepts , naming them , identifying the useful relationships between them , and mapping units of content to those concepts .
Many of the if - you - build - it - they - will - come ontologies out there seem to be thrown together in the hope that someone will use them , with no examination of use cases beyond the needs of the individual developers who created them — and sometimes , not even a close look at those needs .
Semantic web technology gives us the standards and tools to assign descriptive terms to resources so that people ( and software agents ) who need those resources can identify them more easily ; taxonomy professionals know about best practices for picking good terms to assign that will help the larger project meet specific goals .
( For an example of this thinking , see part 1 and part 2 of the article " Creating User - Centred Taxonomies " from the FUMSI group , which is just one of the resources I 've learned about since I began following the Taxonomy Community of Practice . )
What can the semantic web offer to the world of publishing ?
I 've heard discussions in which publishers picture machine - readable encoded semantics of content driving customers to that content , but this sounds a little pie - in - the - sky for now .
( I 'd be happy if someone could point me to indications that working examples of this using semantic technology are imminent . )
Publishers who want more people to find their content on the web would be better off putting greater effort into basic search engine optimization , and will find solid practical advice in Jamie Lowe 's SEO for Publishers presentation .
Semantic web technologies , as opposed to the grander idea of the Semantic Web itself , offer tools that can help publishers assemble and distribute their content more efficiently , and I think that this low - hanging fruit is a better place to start , if only to get a better idea of the technology 's strengths and weaknesses .
What can an aggregator / publisher do to take advantage of content metadata when the metadata fields for one source 's articles do n't line up with the fields in another source 's articles ?
More and more publishing these days is about aggregation .
When so much content is available from so many places for free , we 're more likely to pay money for ( or put up with ads next to ) content selected by people whose judgment we trust .
There are many models for aggregation , ranging from print publications such as Utne Reader to grand old online services such as Nexis and Factiva to more Web 2.0 - oriented approaches such as Digg and Reddit .
Now more than ever , publishers know that metadata makes it easier for both publishing staff and readers to track and connect relevant content , but a problem for aggregators is that while they 're happy to get metadata with the content that they collect , different content sources will send different sets of metadata .
There may be certain fields of metadata that most content chunks have in common , such as Dublin Core fields , but what can an aggregator / publisher do to take advantage of content metadata when the metadata fields for one source 's articles do n't line up with the fields in another source 's articles ?
Or when the same thing happens with images ?
According to traditional practice , the aggregator should put this data into a database that may be built into a CMS or set up as a standalone relational system such as Oracle , MySQL , or SQL Server .
In either case , a crucial step in the setup part is deciding what fields you want to track .
Let 's say you define 10 fields of metadata to track .
If an article arrives with 12 fields of metadata , but only 8 match fields that you 've defined , you store those 8 , throw out the other 4 , and have 2 blanks left over .
If , over time , you find yourself throwing out a particular field that more and more content providers have been including with their articles and images , you can modify your database schema or revise the customized fields in your CMS to start collecting that field from that point on , but this is rarely a quick and simple procedure , and all the values delivered to you for that field in content you 've received up to then are still lost .
The kind of technology developed to support semantic web projects offers an alternative .
The RDF triples at the base of semantic technology let you store the fact that a particular resource ( for example , a JPEG file ) has a field with a particular name ( for example , " resolution " ) and a particular value for that field ( for example , " 72dpi " . )
Actual resource and field names must be URLs to avoid confusion ( I discussed this a bit last week ) ; if you can do this , you can store any metadata about anything .
The {resource , field name , field value} combination ( more technically known as a subject / predicate / object ) is called a triple , and the database managers that store them are called triplestores .
Unlike relational database managers and production XML systems , the technology for working with these triples does n't need to know about field names in advance .
The flexibility that this offers lets developers fit applications around their data instead of shoehorning their data into the current application 's requirements , which can put a lot of constraints on future possibilities for both the applications and the data .
This flexibility does offer the possibility that two publishers might use different field names for the same concept , as Dale Waldt described in the posting I responded to last week , but the OWL part of the semantic web technology stack can help to account for that .
For example , what if two publishers use different URLs to indicate the title of an article ?
If one uses a term from the Adobe XMP namespace to assign an article a http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/Title value of " The Trans - Siberian Railroad " , and the other publisher assigns another article an http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title value of " Across Canada by Train " , a bit of OWL ( as demonstrated in my response to Dale ) can show that these terms mean the same thing so that a single query for titles retrieves both articles .
If you as an aggregator feel that it would be easier for your suppliers to use a more normalized set of vocabulary terms , get them together and talk about it .
This is what standards groups such as OASIS and IDEAlliance are for .
( IDEAlliance 's PRISM standard , whose motto is " Developing a standard XML metadata vocabulary for the publishing industry " , is just such a group , and they include an RDF profile as part of their standard . )
Getting More Semantic
If I 'm recommending semantic web tools to help you keep track of things such as the resolution of your digital images , you might ask " what 's so semantic about that ? "
It 's not particularly semantic , but it uses semantic web technology to track metadata that helps your staff and customers more easily find the content that they need , so it does help toward the greater goal .
If you want to push this technology a little further to incorporate metadata about the semantics of the content — without spending money on software — look into OpenCalais , which analyzes content and returns a copy with RDF representations of key terms it found and information about what classes those key terms fall into ( for example , that " Slumdog Millionaire " is a Movie or that " Golden Globe " is an EntertainmentAwardEvent ) .
I played with the first release of OpenCalais to create the BlogBigPicture website , which uses this metadata to ease navigation of news about Hollywood gossip , investing , the British Premier League , world business , and U.S. politics .
You can take the metadata that OpenCalais returns and store it in the triplestore of metadata about your content as easily as you can store information about the resolution of your digital images .
Do n't let the grander ideas about semantics distract you too much just yet , though .
Prototypes aimed at lower - hanging fruit will give you a better focus on which of the grand ideas can help your business .
There 's plenty of free software available to create these prototypes , and even Oracle provides support for triplestores nowadays .
So , if you 're interested in what semantic web technology can do for your publishing business , start thinking about some inexpensive short - term projects that will give you a better idea of the long - term possibilities .
MONTERREY , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Hundreds of Mexicans blocked roads and bridges into the United States on Tuesday in a protest of army operations against drug gangs that officials said was organized by drug traffickers .
About 300 protesters , some with handkerchiefs tied over their faces , carried signs saying “ Army Get Out ! ” in front of the town hall in the northern city of Monterrey , 130 miles from the Texan border .
It was the largest in a series of anti-army protests this week .
In a growing challenge to the military across Mexico , small groups of taxi drivers also blocked bridges that connect the border cities of Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo with Texas , stopping vehicles and foot passengers , police said .
Hundreds of miles away , another 300 people shut highways in the Gulf city of Veracruz to pressure the military to go back to their bases .
The demonstrations put fresh pressure on President Felipe Calderon to defeat the cartels after two years of an army - backed campaign and spiraling drug violence .
Calderon said on Monday the rampant violence that killed 6,000 people last year shows drug cartels are desperate , but drug trade experts say Mexico ’s deepening economic slump and rising joblessness could attract more recruits to the trade .
Natividad Gonzalez , governor of Nuevo Leon state , blamed Mexico ’s most violent drug gang , the Gulf cartel , and its armed wing The Zetas for the protests .
“ There are reasons to believe it has to do with the Gulf cartel and the group known as The Zetas , ” he told a news conference .
State police chief Aldo Fasci said last week that crime organizations were paying people to protest against the army and that gangs were handing out backpacks full of school books , pens and paper to poor families who joined the demonstrations .
The northern states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas , home to Monterrey , Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa , are the main trafficking routes into Texas for the powerful Gulf Cartel and its feared armed wing , the Zetas , who behead their enemies .
One woman at the protest who declined to be named told Reuters she came with a neighbor who had been paid to turn up .
Mexico ’s drug war has scared off investors and worried the United States , which is giving $ 1.4 billion worth of equipment and other aid to help Mexico and Central America fight cartels .
GUN BATTLE
At least five people died in a gun battle between troops and drug hitmen in Reynosa on Tuesday , police said , but added that the violence was not related to the protests .
Calderon has sent 45,000 troops and federal police across Mexico to fight drug gangs since late 2006 , a move widely supported by Mexicans angry with years of inaction and the deep corruption in the country ’s police forces .
Despite warnings from rights groups about soldiers using excessive force in the drug fight , Calderon also has Washington ’s support for the army , which has made historic drug seizures and is catching more gang leaders .
“ Rising levels of unemployment in Mexico make it much easier for Mexican drug traffickers to recruit youths to engage in demonstrations like this , for relatively low pay , ” U.S. - based security consultancy Stratfor said in a report .
Q : As a native of Zambia with advanced degrees in public policy and economics from Harvard and Oxford , you are about to publish an attack on Western aid to Africa and its recent glamorization by celebrities .
‘‘ Dead Aid , ’’ as your book is called , is particularly hard on rock stars .
Have you met Bono ?
I have , yes , at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , last year .
It was at a party to raise money for Africans , and there were no Africans in the room , except for me .
What do you think of him ?
I ’ll make a general comment about this whole dependence on “ celebrities . ”
I object to this situation as it is right now where they have inadvertently or manipulatively become the spokespeople for the African continent .
You argue in your book that Western aid to Africa has not only perpetuated poverty but also worsened it , and you are perhaps the first African to request in book form that all development aid be halted within five years .
Think about it this way —
China has 1.3 billion people , only 300 million of whom live like us , if you will , with Western living standards .
There are a billion Chinese who are living in substandard conditions .
Do you know anybody who feels sorry for China ?
Nobody .
Maybe that ’s because they have so much money that we here in the U.S. are begging the Chinese for loans .
Forty years ago , China was poorer than many African countries .
Yes , they have money today , but where did that money come from ?
They built that , they worked very hard to create a situation where they are not dependent on aid .
LOS ANGELES --
A year ago , a day - laborer center adjacent to a Home Depot here teemed with Latin American immigrants who showed up and found a sure day 's work painting , gardening or hauling .
These days , more than immigrants are packing the Hollywood Community Job Center : Unemployed Americans are joining them .
There 's little work for anybody .
" Everybody is coming to look for work , " says Rene Jemio , outreach coordinator for the hiring hall .
" It 's not just your average immigrant anymore ; it 's African - Americans and whites , too . "
For the first time in a decade , unskilled immigrants are competing with Americans for work .
And evidence is emerging that tens of thousands of Hispanic immigrants are withdrawing from the labor market as U.S. workers crowd them out of potential jobs .
At least some of the foreigners are returning home .
" We see competition from more nonimmigrant workers , " says Abel Valenzuela , a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who studies day laborers .
" Employers are also paying less than in previous years , " he says .
Mexican drug cartels grow pot in U.S.
Most discussions of Mexican drug wars focus on the smuggling and the gang violence that threatens the border areas .
But now the Mexican cartels have caught on and found a new way to get drugs in the U.S. Mexican drug cartels are increasingly active inside the United States , producing homegrown marijuana and gaining new urban footholds , officials say .
...
The four largest Mexican cartels -- the Federation , the Tijuana Cartel , the Juarez Cartel and the Gulf Cartel -- now operate in 195 U.S. cities , up from about 50 cities in 2006 , a Justice Department report indicates .
One reason is that marijuana sales have been a steady and lucrative business for them , virtually unrelated to the ups and downs of other drugs .
" Marijuana is the king crop , " Special Agent Rafael Reyes of the Drug Enforcement Administration told the Times .
" It consistently sustains its marketability and profitability . "
Mexican drug traffickers have also moved into hydroponic marijuana production -- cannabis grown indoors without soil and using sunlamps , officials said .

Last year Electronic
Arts put the development of the PlayStation 3 version of Red Alert 3 on hold , and went on to release the game for both the PC and Xbox 360 .
However , it looks like PS3 RTS fans will be getting a treat to make up for the delay , as a new " Ultimate Edition " of the game will be making its way to Sony 's console .
According to a product listing on the EA Store , the new version will include a number of special bonus features .
These include blooper , behind - the - scenes , and developer strategy videos , as well as new battleground maps and a built in video encyclopedia covering all of the units in the game .
There are a few other surprises for series fans as well , including an HD video feature , dubbed " Girls of Red Alert 3 . "
Unfortunately , it looks like all of the bonus features will be supplements to the game , with no actual gameplay additions made .
Still , it 's nice to see a developer at least make an effort to improve a significantly delayed release .
Let 's just hope EA does a better job with the port compared to past games .
Command & Conquer : Red Alert 3 is expected to hit the PS3 on March 23 .
The discovery that butterfly wings have scales that act as tiny solar collectors has led scientists in China and Japan to design a more efficient solar cell that could be used for powering homes , businesses , and other applications in the future .
Their study appeared in the Jan. 13 issue of ACS ’ Chemistry of Materials , a bi-weekly journal .
Close - up of the scales of a butterfly wing .
These scales have inspired more powerful solar cells .
Michael Apel , Wikipedia Commons .
In the study , Di Zhang and colleagues note that scientists are searching for new materials to improve light - harvesting in so - called dye - sensitized solar cells , also known as Grätzel cells for inventor Michael Grätzel .
These cells have the highest light - conversion efficiencies among all solar cells — as high as 10 percent .
The researchers turned to the microscopic solar scales on butterfly wings in their search for improvements .
Using natural butterfly wings as a mold or template , they made copies of the solar collectors and transferred those light - harvesting structures to Grätzel cells .
Laboratory tests showed that the butterfly wing solar collector absorbed light more efficiently than conventional dye - sensitized cells .
The fabrication process is simpler and faster than other methods , and could be used to manufacture other commercially valuable devices , the researchers say .

( Dagbladet.no ) :
Det som startet som en fredelig demonstrasjon foran Stortinget kl. 14 i dag har nå utviklet seg til å bli voldelig .
Det var flere tusen i gatene mellom Israels ambassade og Slottsparken , der voldelige demonstranter begynte å skyte fyrverkeri mot politiet .
De kastet steiner , flasker og planker .
Maskerte demonstranter
Maskerte demonstranstranter tok seg forbi vaktene og sto foran sperringene .
I 16.15 - tida ble det kastet mange fyrverkeribomber .
Klokka 16.30 brøt 50 , 60 demonstranter ut av folkemengden og forsøkte å ta seg gjennom sperringene .
Politiet forhindret dette ved å kjøre fram de store sperrebilene sine .
Klokka 16.45 iførte politiet seg gassmasker , og skjøt tåregass mot demonstrantene .

- De fleste fredelige demonstranter hadde forlatt stedet da vi valgte å bruke tåregass .
Vi vurderer at dette er et lempelig middel tatt i betraktning aggresjonen og voldsutøvelsen som fant sted , sier stabsjef Johan Fredriksen i Oslo politidistrikt i en pressemelding .
Politihelikopter fløy deretter over folkemengden med høyttalerbeskjed om at « alle må forlate åstedet » .
Etter politiets framstøt ble det roligere ved den israelske ambassaden .
- Dessverre forsøker noen å sabotere det som skulle være en fredelig og verdig markering .
Disse personene har avfyrt store mengder fyrverkeri i menneskemengden , og kastet steiner og andre gjenstander mot politiet .
Dette var helt klart en fare for fredelige demonstranter , og for polititjenestemennene som var der for å sikre deres ytringsfrihet , sier Fredriksen og utdyper :
FREDELIG : Rundt 2000 mennesker er samlet foran Stortinget i en fredelig markering .

- Bruken av fyrverkeri kunne også utgjøre en brannfare .
For å unngå ytterligere voldsutøvelse og skader på personer og gjenstander , måtte politiet benytte tåregass for å spre ansamlinger av mennesker som ikke var der for å ytre sitt budskap på fredelig vis .
Dette ble også gjort ut fra hensyn til beboere i området , sier Fredriksen ved Oslo politidistrikt i pressemeldingen .
Herjer
Politiet har innbrakt rundt 100 personer .
To personer er foreløpig pågrepet og siktet for blant annet vold mot politiet .
Etter at folkemengden ble spredt ved ambassaden , gikk et tog med 100 - 150 personer , deriblant en del blitzere , mot stortinget .
Mange av dem er maskerte .
De har kastet stein mot butikker og har nå beveget seg nedover Karl Johans gate .
Klokka 17.20 oppholdt bråkmakerne seg ved Trafikkanten ved Oslo sentralstasjon .
Klokka 17.40 kastet demonstranter fyrverkeribomber mot politihester i krysset Nedre Slottsgate / Karl Johan .
Hestene ble redde og løp av gårde .

Demonstranter har også skutt raketter inn i lokalene til Frimurerlosjen .
Arrangørene prøver å rydde opp
Arrangørene av demonstrasjonen har hatt mange vakter i toget i dag som har bedt folk være rolige og uttrykke sin mening på en fredelig måte .
Toget var fullt av familier , barn og unge - mange av dem rømte vekk fra demonstrasjonen .
På oppfordring fra politiet prøvde arrangørens vakter å få folk til å fjerne seg på grunn av sin egen sikkerhet .
- Ikke gjem dere bak kvinner og barn , ikke gjem dere bak uskyldige .
Dere kan komme hit , ropte en frustrert vakt som sto ved sperringene .

Mange av arrangørens folk var frustrerte og raste mot bråkmakerne .
Vaktene deres gjorde en svært god jobb , og laget en menneskelig mur og prøvde å få folk lenger vekk .
Like etter klokka 16 ga arrangørens vakter opp å holde folkemengden i sjakk .

no kommer tilbake til mer .
There was a very odd moment on This Week this morning when Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - CA ) and Sen. Schumer ( D - NY ) both said they opposed bank nationalization only to be followed by Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) who said that , painful as it is to contemplate , we need to seriously consider doing so .
Now , I ’ve said before that I think the term ‘ nationalization ’ mainly confuses and obscures the issue .
And since Geithner ’s speech last week there does seem to be a slow but steady movement in the direction of letting the big insolvent banks fail .
But this contrast points to something I ’ve been wondering about for a while , which is whether the idea might not end up getting some paradoxical support from more doctrinaire free market types .
The idea has never been to nationalize the banking sector as a matter of on - going national policy .
It ’s more like a highly structured and customized form of moving these institutions through Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
In fact , we have a whole system in place for how this is done by the FDIC .
But as long as you have this unworkable hybrid of keeping notionally solvent banks on taxpayer life support with the pretense that they ’re still viable private corporations you end up with government - mandated salary caps and lots of other government intrusions into the running of these business .
We ’re still working on this story .
But recently we we were told that just after receiving its TARP money , one of the mega - banks turned around and sent a whole bunch of stateside jobs to India to cut costs .
If and when that comes out I ’m sure you going to have a lot of calls to prevent TARP funded banks from doing that too .
And why not ?
Notwithstanding a marginal company ’s need to cut costs , why should taxpayers from state X directly underwrite bank Y to put tens of thousands of state X’s residents out of work ?
Organized bankruptcy for failed companies is not a radical or left - wing idea .
It ’s the junction where capitalism and the rule of law meet .
Very establishment stuff .
Needless to say , this is hardly the most compelling reason to stop subsidizing failed banks and the failed bankers who run them .
The current approach is n’t working .
It ’s amounting to a massive giveaway of taxpayer dollars .
But I suspect this may end up pushing some of these people over the edge too .
Late Update :
The whole “ retention fee ” issue seems very similar to what I was referring to above .
In theory at least , there ’s a logic to these companies needing to make sure their best employees are n’t poached by competitors .
In practice , I ’m skeptical there ’s such a great market out there for financial services wizards .
I know a lot of them .
And most are really glad not to have lost their jobs yet .
But the whole problem is an artifact of the illogic of propping up the failed banks in the first place .
Citi wants to protect the value of its shareholders ’ big asset , the company , the institution itself as a value proposition going forward .
But that ’s something they should have thought of before they let the board and executives drive the company into bankruptcy .
It ’s not clear to me why taxpayers care if Citi ’s best brokers go to Morgan Stanley or some new bank that gets set up from the ruins of one of the failed ones .
I ’ll admit I ’m not sure I have as clear an answer to the idea that foreign banks could poach the best people , etc .
So I ’ll defer to others who have a better handle on that issue .
But you still end up in these unworkable situations .
And I suspect it ’s a messiness that will lead many free marketeers to decide that biting the bullet is the way to go .
Until now the construction of homes has been the responsibility of the government but the state has failed over the last three years to fulfil its annual goal of building 100,000 new homes .
The shortage was compounded when three hurricanes hit Cuba last year levelling over half a million homes .
Rate limiting with memcached
On Monday , several high profile “ celebrity ” Twitter accounts started spouting nonsense , the victims of stolen passwords .
Wired has the full story — someone ran a dictionary attack against a Twitter staff member , discovered their password and used Twitter ’s admin tools to reset the passwords on the accounts they wanted to steal .
The Twitter incident got me thinking about rate limiting again .
I ’ve been wanting a good general solution to this problem for quite a while , for API projects as well as security .
Django Snippets has an answer , but it works by storing access information in the database and requires you to run a periodic purge command to clean up the old records .
I ’m strongly averse to writing to the database for every hit .
For most web applications reads scale easily , but writes do n’t .
I also want to avoid filling my database with administrative gunk ( I dislike database backed sessions for the same reason ) .
But rate limiting relies on storing state , so there has to be some kind of persistence .
Using memcached counters
I think I ’ve found a solution , thanks to memcached and in particular the incr command .
incr lets you atomically increment an already existing counter , simply by specifying its key .
add can be used to create that counter — it will fail silently if the provided key already exists .
Let ’s say we want to limit a user to 10 hits every minute .
A naive implementation would be to create a memcached counter for hits from that user ’s IP address in a specific minute .
The counter key might look like this :
ratelimit_72.26.203.98_2009-01-07-21:45
Increment that counter for every hit , and if it exceeds 10 block the request .
What if the user makes ten requests all in the last second of the minute , then another ten a second later ?
The rate limiter will let them off .
For many cases this is probably acceptable , but we can improve things with a slightly more complex strategy .
Let ’s say we want to allow up to 30 requests every five minutes .
Instead of maintaining one counter , we can maintain five — one for each of the past five minutes ( older counters than that are allowed to expire ) .
After a few minutes we might end up with counters that look like this :
ratelimit_72.26.203.98_2009-01-07-21:45 = 13 ratelimit_72.26.203.98_2009-01-07-21:46 = 7 ratelimit_72.26.203.98_2009-01-07-21:47 = 11
Now , on every request we work out the keys for the past five minutes and use get_multi to retrieve them .
If the sum of those counters exceeds the maximum allowed for that time period , we block the request .
Are there any obvious flaws to this approach ?
I ’m pretty happy with it — it cleans up after itself ( old counters quietly expire from the cache ) , it should n’t use much resources ( just five active cache keys per unique IP address at any one time ) and if the cache is lost the only snag is that a few clients might go slightly over their rate limit .
I do n’t think it ’s possible for an attacker to force the counters to expire early .
An implementation for Django
I ’ve put together an example implementation of this algorithm using Django , hosted on GitHub .
The readme . txt file shows how it works — basic usage is via a simple decorator :
from ratelimitcache import ratelimit @ratelimit ( minutes = 3 , requests = 20 ) def myview ( request ) : # ... return HttpResponse ('...')
Python decorators are typically functions , but ratelimit is actually a class .
This means it can be customised by subclassing it , and the class provides a number of methods designed to be over - ridden .
I ’ve provided an example of this in the module itself — ratelimit_post , a decorator which only limits on POST requests and can optionally couple the rate limiting to an individual POST field .
Here ’s the complete implementation :
class ratelimit_post ( ratelimit ) : " Rate limit POSTs - can be used to protect a login form " key_field = None #
If provided , this POST var will affect the rate limit def should_ratelimit ( self , request ) : return request .
method == ' POST ' def key_extra( self , request ) : # IP address and key_field ( if it is set ) extra = super( ratelimit_post , self ) .key_extra( request ) if self .
key_field : value = sha.new ( request .POST.get(self.key_field , '' ) ) .hexdigest ( ) extra += '-' + value return extra
And here ’s how you would use it to limit the number of times a specific IP address can attempt to log in as a particular user :
@ratelimit_post ( minutes = 3 , requests = 10 , key_field = ' username ' ) def login( request ) : # ... return HttpResponse ('...')
The should_ratelimit ( ) method is called before any other rate limiting logic .
The default implementation returns
True , but here we only want to apply rate limits to POST requests .
The key_extra ( ) method is used to compose the keys used for the counter — by default this just includes the request ’s IP address , but in ratelimit_post we can optionally include the value of a POST field ( for example the username ) .
We could include things like the request path here to apply different rate limit counters to different URLs .
Finally , the readme . txt includes ratelimit_with_logging , an example that over - rides the disallowed ( ) view returned when a rate limiting condition fails and writes an audit note to a database ( less overhead than writing for every request ) .
I ’ve been a fan of customisation via subclassing ever since I got to know the new Django admin system , and I ’ve been using it in a bunch of projects .
It ’s a great way to create reusable pieces of code .
Single mothers have created generation of ' uber - chavs ' who are costing taxpayer a fortune , claims deputy head
A deputy head who sat on a Government taskforce aimed at improving behaviour in schools yesterday condemned a generation of modern parents as ' uber - chavs ' .
Ralph Surman said the parents of today 's pupils were themselves the children of the ' first big generation of single mothers ' from the 1980s .
He claimed they - and in turn their children - have been left with no social skills or work ethic and may be impossible to educate .
Mr Surman spoke out in response to figures unearthed by the Conservative Party , which show that the number of 16 to 24 - year - olds who are not in education , employment or training - known as NEETs - is rising across Britain .
Uber-chavs : Deputy headteacher Ralph Surman believes that a new generation of modern parents are fast becoming a drain on the state
' We must talk about a class of uber - chavs , ' he said .
' They are not doing anything productive and are costing taxpayers a fortune .
' It is very difficult , almost impossible , to take these people now and provide basic social and work ethic skills .
' The offspring of the first big generation of single mothers were children in the 1980s .
' Now they are adults with their own children and the problems are leading to higher crime rates and low participation in the labour force . '
Mr Surman , 43 , a national executive member of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , has taught at Cantrell Primary School in Bulwell , Nottingham , for 20 years .
Bulwell has been identified as an area of socio- economic deprivation and the proportion of children entitled to free school meals is higher than average at the school , which is rated good by Ofsted .
Ralph Surman has coined the new phrase ' uber-chav '
Mr Surman was a member of the Practitioners ' Group on School Behaviour and Discipline , a group of experienced heads and teachers set up four years ago , which helped enshrine in law a teacher 's right to discipline a child .
As a result of its conclusions , the Government introduced legal powers giving teachers the right to discipline children beyond the gates .
Mr Surman , a father of three , was unavailable yesterday to comment further on his claims , made in a local newspaper .
It is not clear if he was referring to the parents of children at his school , in Nottingham as a whole or to modern parents generally .
But his attack was criticised by David Mellen , portfolio holder for children 's services on the Labour - run Nottingham City Council .
He said the number of young NEETs in Nottingham had bucked the trend and fallen .
The councillor , who is also a teacher , said : ' We are talking about young people here and ( uber- chavs ) is an irresponsible term to use .
' The comments are illinformed in light of the reducmatchingtion in crime in the city and the reduction in young people who are NEET . '
But Norman Wells , from the Family Education Trust , said that , while many single mothers do an ' excellent job ' raising their children , 'we cannot close our eyes to the evidence which shows that , on average , children fare better in terms of health , education and future career prospects when they are brought up by a mother and father who are committed to each other for life in marriage ' .
Official figures obtained by the Tories last month showed that the number of people aged 16 to 24 not in employment , education or training had leapt by 94,000 to 850,000 between 2003 and 2007 .
' Chav ' was a new entrant in the Collins English Dictionary in 2005 .
A chav was defined as ' a young working class person who dresses in casual sports clothing ' .
Uber means greatest or most extreme .
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said Mr Surman 's comments did not reflect the view of the union .
In A Wal - Mart Kind Of Hell / Censored magazines , banned music and pseudo - Christian fun at America 's scariest retailer
S top .
You 've found it .
This is the place .
Americana HQ .
Patriotism in a giant tin bucket .
This is where souls recoil , children wail , dreams die .
This is Wal - Mart .
The glorious consumer mecca , the epic wonderland / wasteland of prefab landfill merch , not only the world 's largest and most powerful retailer and the most aggressive snarling frightening happy - place marketer and quite possibly the most hideously overlit soul - draining monster empire you will ever know in your entire lifetime , but also the very multibillion - dollar pseudo - Christian kingdom that censors their offerings and refuses to sell certain music CDs and bans " risqué " beer - 'n ' - babes mags like Maxim and FHM and Stuff , because , you know , pretty girls are evil .
And Wal - Mart just recently decided to cover up the covers of other , less garish but apparently equally " naughty " women 's mags like Elle and Cosmo ( which , BTW , is owned by Hearst , as is SFGate ) and Vogue due to racy or suggestive images -- but will not , presumably , cover up the truly dangerous and psychologically debilitating mags like Better Homes & Gardens , Mary - Kate and Ashley and Cake Decorating & Dog Mange Monthly .
Go figure .
We must try to focus .
We must zero in .
Innumerable are the intellectual insults and karmic assaults Wal - Mart represents ( atrocious labor practices , reliance on foreign sweatshop slave labor , anti-union stances , saturation marketing , etc ) and hence we shall concentrate on the censorship issue .
Because it matters .
We wish it did n't .
But it does .
It might seem mild .
It might seem innocuous , this magazine cover - up , this prosaic Bible - lickin ' censorship , merely representing Wal - Mart 's ostensible pro-family nightmarish dystopian mega - ethos of perky corporate sweatshop happiness and their infamous claim that they are merely responding to their customers ' wishes when they remove products , block out words , cover up those horrible boobies .
People complain , they claim , customers call in and bitch that their kid might 've seen a racy magazine cover and asked one too many questions about just what " orgasm " or maybe " pleasure " or even " happiness " means , and the parent was all flustered and humiliated and confused and hence Wal - Mart , being the good falsely sanctimonious citizen , not wanting to offend the American Family , covers up the mags or removes them entirely .
How thoughtful .
Except there 's a bit more to it than that .
Except the groups that complain about the mags are often the same ones that cheer Wal - Mart 's censorship decisions , groups like the Tupelo , Miss . - based American Family Association ( AFA ) , one of those desperately hyper -Christian anti-choice anti-gay anti-porn asexual pseudo - ethical groups representing " traditional " family values -- like , you know , massive reeling intolerance .
And hellfire .
And the end of icky tongue kissing .
And , of course , the safety of America 's checkout lanes .
This is what they really care about .
Because as we all know , if there 's one overlooked extant hot spot of debased American culture , it 's our unbridled freewheelin ' checkout lanes .
Shield your eyes , little Timmy , it 's the new issue of Glamour .
Gasp .
Of course it should n't matter .
Of course we should n't care .
There is no shortage of Maxims or Cosmos in the world , and if you do n't like Wal - Mart , hey , do n't shop there , and if you live in one of the smallish Midwest towns the gluttonous and voracious Walton family hell - beast has invaded like a plague and you have no real remaining shopping options because Wal - Mart has killed all the small family - owned competition , well , too bad for you .
Here is why it matters .
Here is why you should care .
Because Wal - Mart is not merely a store .
Wal - Mart is not merely a hollow and deeply frightening Christian - values mega - retailer that makes you feel like you need a karmic shower and soul de-lousing immediately upon exiting the vacuum - sealed whooshing glass doors .
Wal - Mart shapes ideas .
They affect mind - sets .
They influence cultural perspectives .
This is frightening and wrong .
They ban ( or " sanitize " ) the latest Marilyn Manson CD ?
They do n't carry Maxim ?
Then for 100 million benumbed Wal - Mart regulars , Marilyn and Maxim might as well not even exist .
Why not choose a nice issue of , say , Guns & Ammo and the new Shania Twain instead ?
There there , Timmy .
Now hush up and let Daddy buy some bullets and a vat of Cheez Doodles .
Do you understand ?
Do you see the danger ?
That 's 100 million customers per year , $ 200 billion in annual sales , 3,000 stores and growing fast , and is n't it just wickedly telling that the state with the largest number of Wal - Marts in the entire country is , by a wide , wide margin , Texas ?
Pretty much says it all , really .
Wal - Mart manipulates the culture .
They represent a type of cultural myopia and a prefab brand of hollow sexless Americana and a value system that does nothing to promote any core conviction you genuinely care about , and censorship decisions like theirs are a threat to all that is good and sexy and alternative and righteous and naked and I do n't care how cheesy sexist frat - boy stupid Maxim magazine is , its message is n't 1/100th as poisonous or dangerous as much of the deleterious junk Wal - Mart hawks , the AFA lifestyle they endorse .
Let 's put it this way .
Wal - Mart is all too happy to pummel customers with mountains of toxic processed foods and Teen People and giant tins of barbecued popcorn and sweatshop - made T - shirts and gaudy porcelain - clown bookends and giant bins full of stuffed teddy bears made in Malaysia .
All well and good .
Hey , they 're a discount retailer , after all .
Horrible landfill merchandise and giant ads for Doritos and tons upon tons of plastic crap you really do n't need intermixed with a few things you actually do , and deep deep deep this nation is in a BushCo recession so of course Wal - Mart is flourishing .
Of course , they also sell guns .
Did we mention the guns ?
Oh yes .
How 's that for a message -- hey kids , do n't look at the impossibly pretty half - naked Photoshopped model on the cover of Elle because your undereducated little mind might get corrupted and you 're just not ready for the word " sex " in bold 48 - point Helvetica .
But here , have a nice Remington .
22 .
Now scamper off and go kill something , sweetie .
Wal - Mart is , in short , deciding what America needs based on the shockingly uptight whims and intolerant perspectives of the hard Right .
This is why you should worry .
This is why you should care .
The arbiter of taste for much of the country is not the media .
It is not the movies .
It is not Britney or Keanu or MTV .
It is a giant suckass superstore , one that aggressively works every single day to drain out any semblance of voice or personality or alternative viewpoint and works harder than any other company in the nation to kowtow to the masses and keep the nation in a nice big hole of casual blind lockstep sameness without the nation even knowing any better .
Ah , just like BushCo .
Just like America .
Except , you know , cheaper .
After having finished the English translation of MMK , I would like to have a short comment on Realty , Materialism , and the Autonomic Nervous System .
Because in 19th Century almost all human beings did n't know about the existence of the Autonomic Nervous Systenm ( ANS ) at all .
But in the 20th Century we , human beings , have found the existence of the ANS in our body and mind , and because of such important scientific progress , we have found very important change of explanation in Buddhist philosophies .
Before finding the ANS , it is impossible for human beings to find the difference between Matter and Reality .
But after finding ANS , human beings have find the difference between Matter and Reality for the first time .
After having the knowledge of ANS , haman beings have begun to understand the difference between Matter and Reality as follows .
ANS is divided into the two parts , that is , the Sympathetic Nervous System ( SNS ) and the Parasympathetic Nervous System ( PNS ) .
And when our SNS is stronger , we are prone to be spiritual attitude , and when our PNS is stronger , we are prone to be physical attitude .
But when we are too much spiritual in our daily life , we can never be human being , but being like gods .
And when we are too much physical , we can never be human being , but being like animals .
Therefore Gautama Buddha recommended us to be human beings at every momet .
In other words Gautama Buddha recommended us not to be like gods , or not to be like animals in our daily life .
Before finding the importance of balanced ANS , it is impossible for human beings to find the difference among the three kinds of situations , that is , the stronger SNS , the stronger PNS , and the equality between SNS and PNS , and so it was impossible for human beings to find the existence of the balanced state between SNS and PNS at all .
In other words human beings havenever find the balanced state of ANS at that time , then it was impossible for them to recognizethe true meaning of Enlightenment , that is , the equality between SNS and PNS , or the balanced state of ANS .
Therefore we can say that we have noticed the true meaning of getting Enlightenment in 20th Century for the first time .
In other words we have noticed the true meaning of the Enlightenment in 20th Century exactly , therefore we can say that Buddhism has left the characteristics of Religion , and has entered into Philosophy , which can be certified by schientic experiment too .
Therefore we can explain that Buddhism is just the ultimate philosophy in human societies .
We can say that Buddhism is not Religion , but it is just the ultimate Philosophy in the Universal History ..
Therefore when we have discussion about Buddhism , it is necessary for us to think about thedifference between before in the 20th Century and after the 21st Century .
Before the 20th Century Buddhism has included only the two kinds of philosophies , that is , Idealism and Materialism , but after the 20th Century because of finding the balanced situations of the ANS , Buddhism has found , not only the stronger SNS , and the stronger PNS , but it has found the three kinds of states , that is , the stronger SNS , the stronger PNS , and the balanced state between SNS and PNS , that is called the balanced state of the Autonomic Nervous system .
In such situations human beings have found the three kinds of situations in our ANS in the 20th Century , that is the stronger SNS , the stronger PNS , and the Balanced State between SNS and PNS .
The Balanced State between SNS and PNS has been found in the 20th Century scientifically for the first time , and that is just the state of Enlightenment .
In other words we , Buman Beings , have found Reality philosophically for the first time , and we , human beings , have found Reality relying upon the balanced situaton of the Autonomic Nervous System .

ggraham@repub.com
EASTHAMPTON - Car wash employee Stephanie M. Carpluk fought for her life Sunday morning when a spinning scrubber brush latched onto her scarf , cinching it tighter and tighter .
It was brief struggle .
" I pulled the scarf but it would n't go anywhere , " the 19 - year - old Chicopee resident said .
" I was scared , I did n't know what the outcome was going to be .
...
After that , I blacked out . "
Golden Nozzle customer John A. O'Leary , of Southampton , who had just paid Carpluk moments before , saw her strangling against the spinner and knew he had to act quickly .
" When I saw it happen I said , " This is not good , ' " O'Leary said .
O'Leary just happened to have a pocket knife in his pocket .
He leapt out of car , now moving on the car wash rails , and moved to cut her free .
" I remember looking at my knife , thinking if I cut this off , I am liable to cut her throat , " the Southampton resident said .
Instead , O'Leary used the knife to cut the end closest to the spinner and soon she broke free and slumped to the floor .
O'Leary pulled her out of the path of the machinery , realized she was n't breathing and began mouth - to - mouth resuscitation - a skill he learned in the 1970s when he was an undergraduate in college .
" It kind of came back , " O'Leary said , adding she was " pretty white . "
After a time Carpluk began breathing on her own .
Another customer , meanwhile , called 911 and brought a blanket .
O'Leary said he kept reassuring the woman that help was on the way and repeatedly told her not to go to sleep .
Carpluk , now with two black eyes and deep red welts around her neck , is in good condition at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield .
She is expected to be discharged Tuesday .
Carpluk said she plans to call her rescuer later and thank him for saving her life .
" No question about it , I would have been dead if he had n't come , " said Carpluk , a 2008 graduate of Chicopee High School .
O'Leary said he does n't consider himself a hero .
He said he acted to the best of his abilities with a pocketknife he has had since high school and his decades - old skill of rescue breathing .
" If she required anything more she would have been in trouble because I did n't know anything more , " O'Leary , a wildlife biologist , who works out of the state Department of Fish and Game in Westboro .
O'Leary said he had the knife only because he was planning on taking some cuttings at his greenhouse later that day .
Carpluk , the only employee at the Northampton Street car cash , said she had been cutting through the car wash tunnel to change some bills in the office safe .
Carpluk 's mother , Karol M. Johnson , also of Chicopee , said it was a miracle that her daughter is alive .
" If it was n't for that man she would n't be here now , " Carpluk said , adding that it scares her to think that the car wash was operating with only her daughter in attendance .
" It was miracle that he saw her . "
Johnson said she talked O'Leary on the telephone Monday night .
" It was very emotional , " Johnson said .
" A million dollars would n't be enough to repay him for what he has done .
She 's my one and only daughter and he saved her life . "
Carpluk said she has been Golden Nozzle for six or seven months and typically works at the car wash that it operates on Memorial Avenue in West Springfield .
Carpluk said wore her scarf to work every day and was never told that it was a dangerous thing to do .
" Everybody saw me with it , " she said .
A spokesman for the car wash 's parent company , F.L. Roberts of Springfield , told the Associated Press that it is investigating the incident .
Company president Steven Roberts said he thanks the " exceptionally courageous " O'Leary .
Richest 1 % owns more than TWICE as much wealth as 6.9 billion people – Oxfam
A super - rich one percent of the world ’s population has accumulated twice as much wealth as the remaining 90 percent , global charity Oxfam said in a newly - released report .
Kellogg Co. Stock -- February 2009 :
Out of the 5,600 company reputations Vanno monitors , Kellogg ranked ninth before it booted Phelps .
Now it 's ranked 83 .
Not even an industry - wide peanut scare inflicted as much damage on the food company 's reputation .
[ Business Insider ]
I 'm no expert on the stock market , but this does n’t look good for Kellogg 's :
As the chart shows , the company 's stock took an immediate dive following its decision to drop Michael Phelps over the infamous bong hit photo .
What began as a coordinated boycott by drug reform organizations quickly escalated into a full - blown media frenzy as major outlets picked up the story .
Pot - friendly websites like Digg.com began directing massive traffic to news coverage that was critical of Kellogg 's anti-marijuana posturing , thereby increasing the campaign 's visibility among likely supporters .
The cumulative impact of all this negative publicity is helpfully illustrated by The Vanno Reputation Index , which monitors the public image of leading corporations :
In the current economic climate , it would be silly to think we 're solely responsible for Kellogg 's falling stock .
Still , the Vanno data clearly shows that we 've dealt a substantial blow to the company 's reputation at the worst possible time .
Whether or not we actually had a considerable impact on Kellogg 's bottom line is beside the point .
What matters is that we sent an unprecedented message to corporate America that reefer madness is bad for business .
For far too long now , the drug war has been sustained by a corporate culture that embraces anti-drug propaganda at every turn .
Just as our press and politicians have struggled to come to terms with evolving public attitudes about drugs and drug policy , corporate America has remained enslaved by the tired mindset that a healthy public image is best secured through hardline anti-drug posturing .
The Phelps saga may soon be regarded as the moment when all of that changed , the unforeseeable , yet inevitable moment when the invisible hand of America 's marijuana culture finally became a fist .
Update : Many have pointed out , and I agree , that Kellogg 's falling stock is much better explained by the economy than the boycott .
I thought I did a sufficient job of drawing this distinction in the post , but I can understand how the title and tone of the overall post might lead some to conclude otherwise .
So for the record : the point of the post is not that the marijuana reform community crashed Kellogg 's stock .
I do n't believe that to be true .
The point is that our message gains much better traction at a moment like this .
The last thing Kellogg 's wants is a highly publicized boycott in the middle of an economic crisis .
I 've been skeptical of previous boycott proposals that have circulated among reformers in the past , but this effort has been a massive success .
In terms of media coverage and the subsequent slaughter of Kellogg 's corporate reputation ranking , we could n't have asked for a more visible impact than we 've managed to achieve .
Just because Kellogg 's has n't formally surrendered to us somehow does n't mean we did n't kick their ass .
I 'm sure they are utterly stunned by the backlash they received , and that 's what matters .
Introduction
This match - up needs no introduction — but I ’m going to throw one down anyway .
It ’s no secret that Intel has dominated our performance tests over the past year .
First , its Core 2
Duos at 45 nm gave enthusiasts a great platform for aggressive , yet relatively safe overclocking .
The company ’s Core 2 Quads cost quite a bit more , but they managed to deliver smoking speeds in the applications optimized for multi- threaded execution .
The recent Core i7 launch further cemented Intel ’s position as the performance champion .
Its Core i7 965 Extreme , clocked at 3.2 GHz , demonstrated gains straight across the board versus its outgoing flagship , the Core 2 Extreme QX9770 .
And the Core i7 920 , Intel ’s sub -$ 300 entry - level model running at 2.66 GHz , seems to have little trouble reaching up to 4 GHz on air cooling .
There was once a time when Intel did n’t handle its technology shifts as smoothly .
As recently as the Pentium 4 Prescott core ( OK , that was a while back ) , Intel struggled to maintain an advantage against AMD ’s Athlon 64 .
But now , with the marketing of its " tick - tock " approach to rolling out lithography advancements and micro-architecture tweaks , things have certainly turned around .
How is AMD expected to compete ?
Core i7 920 and Phenom II X4 940 go head - to - head
Up until now , AMD has relied on the loosely - translated term " value " to keep in the game .
On its own , the Phenom X4 - series is a moderate performer .
AMD knows this , and has priced the chip more competitively than Intel ’s quad - core offerings to attract attention .
However , the Phenom has n’t had to exist alone in an ecosystem backed by third - party vendors .
It ’s instead complemented by AMD ’s own chipsets , mainly the 790GX and 790FX .
Of course , those platforms extend comprehensive Cross Fire support for its own graphics cards , which have been capturing hearts since mid-2008 .
Combined , AMD ’s processors , chipsets , and GPUs have fared better than any one of those components would have alone .
Thus , we ’d consider the company ’s efforts to emphasize its Spider platform — the cumulative result of all three puzzle pieces — a success .
AMD Needs Something New
In light of a new competitive challenge — Intel ’s Core i7 — AMD is revamping its Spider platform with a new processor and the addition of software able to tie all of the hardware together .
As you no doubt already know from reading Bert ’s story , this latest effort is called Dragon .
But we ’re not here to rehash the details of Phenom II .
Rather , in light of significant enhancements to the CPU architecture ’s overclocking capabilities ( and indeed , confirmation from AMD that all of the " magic " that went into its ACC [ Advanced Clock Calibration ] technology is now baked into Phenom II ) , we ’re eager to compare the value of AMD ’s fastest 45 nm chip to Intel ’s entry - level Core i7 920 — the one most enthusiasts would be likely to eye as an overclocking contender .
In the pages that follow , we ’ll describe how each platform was overclocked , just how hot each system got , how much they cost , how well they perform at their top speeds , and , ultimately , which should be on the short list for your next upgrade .
( CNN ) --
If you 're feeling great today , you may end up inadvertently spreading the joy to someone you do n't even know .
This network from 2000 , colored for average mood , shows yellow as happy , blue as sad , and green as in - between .
New research shows that in a social network , happiness spreads among people up to three degrees removed from one another .
That means when you feel happy , a friend of a friend of a friend has a slightly higher likelihood of feeling happy too .
The lesson is that taking control of your own happiness can positively affect others , says James Fowler , co-author of the study and professor of political science at the University of California in San Diego .
" We get this chain reaction in happiness that I think increases the stakes in terms of us trying to shape our own moods to make sure we have a positive impact on people we know and love , " he said .
Watch more on how happiness spreads »
Sadness also spreads in a network , but not as quickly , the researchers found .
Each happy friend increases your own chance of being happy by 9 percent , whereas each unhappy friend decreases it by 7 percent .
This reflects the total effect of all social contacts .
When framing the question differently , the study found that you are 15 percent more likely to be happy if a direct connection is happy , 10 percent if the friend of a friend is happy , and 6 percent if it 's a friend of a friend of a friend .
The study , published in the British Medical Journal , used data from the Framingham Heart Study to recreate a network of 4,739 .
Fowler and co-author Dr. Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School charted friends , spouses and siblings in the network , and used their self - reported happiness ratings from 1983 to 2003 .
Do n't Miss
How to increase your attention span
Daniel Gilbert , professor of psychology at Harvard University and author of " Stumbling on Happiness , " called the study " a stunning paper by two of the most respected scientists in the field " in a statement he e-mailed to CNN .
" We 've known for some time that social relationships are the best predictor of human happiness , and this paper shows that the effect is much more powerful than anyone realized , " Gilbert said .
" It is sometimes said that you can't be happier than your least happy child .
It is truly amazing to discover that when you replace the word ' child ' with ' best friend 's neighbor 's uncle , ' the sentence is still true . "
If you are the hub of a large network of people -- that is , if you have a lot of connected friends or a wide social circle -- you are more likely to become happy , the study found .
But the reverse is not true .
" You might only have one friend or two friends or something like that , and if you become happy , you 're not going to try to get more friends .
You 're probably going to stick with what worked in the first place , " Fowler said .
The researchers are also looking at the phenomenon on Facebook , which has more than 120 million active users .
This study , which has not yet been published , looked at who smiles in their profile pictures who does n't , and whether their connections also smile or not , Fowler said .
" We find smiling profiles cluster in much the same way as happiness is clustering in the Framingham Heart Study , " he said .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
It 's not just happiness that spreads in a social network .
Fowler and Christakis have also looked at trends in cigarette smoking and obesity using the parts of the heart study network .
They found that when someone quits , a friend 's likelihood of quitting smoking was 36 percent .
Moreover , clusters of people who may not know one another gave up smoking around the same time , the authors showed in a New England Journal of Medicine article in May .
Social ties also affect obesity .
A person 's likelihood of becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given time period , Fowler and Christakis showed in a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2007 .
And , like happiness , both smoking behavior and obesity seem to spread within three degrees of separation in a social network , Fowler said .
Beyond three , things get fuzzier .
" Eventually you get out far enough in the social network that you 're competing with all these other cascades of happiness and unhappiness that are sort of duking it out , " he said .
" Happiness on average wins , but once you get far enough away from someone in a social network , it 's not possible to detect their effect anymore . "

By Steven C. Johnson
NEW YORK , Feb 27 ( Reuters ) - Governments on both sides of the Atlantic moved to tighten their grip over banks on Friday to stem a financial crisis that has pushed the U.S. economy into its deepest contraction in more than a quarter century .
U.S. stocks sank to a 12 - year low after Washington struck a deal in which it could end up with more than a third of crisis - hit Citigroup .
The World Bank and other development banks launched a $ 32 billion lending plan to help east European banks and businesses survive a deepening recession .
Citigroup C.N shares tumbled some 30 percent after the U.S. Treasury struck a deal to convert $ 25 billion of its preferred stock to common shares , which could give it a stake of up to 36 percent in the bank by diluting existing investors .
While the government will not add to the $ 45 billion it has already invested in what was once the world ’s largest bank , the stock conversion will shore up the most conservative gauge of the bank ’s health .
For details , see [ ID : nN27330392 ]
The U.S. government is struggling to shore up its banks as part of its approach to restoring growth .
Data showed the U.S. economy shrank a staggering 6.2 percent in the last three months of 2008 , its biggest slide since the first quarter of 1982 , as exports fell and consumers cut spending .
[ ID :nN26343320 ]
“ The fear is the government having a big stake in the company will create obstacles for Citigroup to be competitive , and there remain questions about the viability of the financial system , ” said Tim Ghriskey , chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills , New York .

DES MOINES , Iowa —
The keepers of the Dow Jones industrial average are not eager to boot General Motors Corp. off the index of 30 leading industrial corporations , but that could change if the government gives billions of dollars to the troubled automaker .
On Tuesday President George W. Bush ’s spokeswoman , Dana Perino , said the administration still was working on details of a possible bailout for the automakers and wants to hear from those involved .
The responsibility of choosing the components of the Dow falls to Robert Thomson , The Wall Street Journal managing editor , who frequently consults with other senior editors at the newspaper and with John Prestbo , editor and executive director of Dow Jones Indexes .
Bailout plays role
Prestbo , who has helped pick Dow stocks for nearly two decades , is the chairman of the Dow Jones index oversight committee .
He said the extent to which the government chooses to bail out automakers could determine whether GM , which has been in the Dow since 1925 , stays or is replaced .
" We ’re watching very carefully what the government does and the way in which the government does it , ” Prestbo said .
GM could follow the course of insurer American International Group Inc. , which was removed as a Dow component in September , after the U.S. government agreed to provide an $ 85 billion emergency loan .
Prestbo said the " 80 percent nationalization ” of the company changed the index committee ’s perspective .
" We felt that put AIG in a different ballpark than the rest of the companies and that did n’t work as part of the industrial average any more , ” he said .
GM shares have fallen drastically , off 83 percent so far year , closing at $ 4.08 on Tuesday .
Prestbo said GM still has a big footprint in the U.S. economy and it will stay in the Dow for now .

A major abortion bill is advancing at the Arizona Legislature in a new political environment that could provide social conservatives with their first big state - level win on the divisive issue after years of losses due to vetoes .
The House Health and Human Services Committee on Wednesday endorsed the Republican - sponsored bill on a 5 - 0 vote , with Democratic opponents boycotting the hearing and not voting on the measure .
The bill now goes to the full House after what is usually a routine legal review .
The legislation would require a pre-abortion waiting period and mandatory disclosures to women seeking abortions .
It also would allow pharmacists and health care providers to refuse to participate in abortion or emergency contraception on moral grounds .
Other provisions toughen the existing law on parental rights .
Former Gov. Janet Napolitano , a Democratic abortion rights supporter , vetoed every anti-abortion bill passed by the Republican - led Legislature during six years in office .
However , the new bill could find favor with new Gov. Jan Brewer , a Republican and former legislator who describes herself as �pro-life . �
Brewer spokesman Paul Senseman said Wednesday the governor has not taken a position on the bill .
But Brewer said in a 2006 candidate survey that she favored prohibiting abortion except when the woman 's life is in danger and requiring mandatory disclosures and a 24 - hour waiting period for abortions .
Cathi Herrod , president of the Center for Arizona Policy , said the legislation would not overturn abortion rights .
It would provide women with information enabling them to make informed decisions as well as protect and enhance rights of women , parents and health care providers , she said .
� This would not prohibit one abortion , � Herrod said .
� I do n't see why anybody should be opposed to this bill , � said Rep. Frank Antenori , a Tucson Republican who voted for the bill .
� It seems like a commonsense thing to me . �
Several pharmacists endorsed the legislation 's �right of conscience � provision , saying it would protect their civil rights .
� Anything less is unreasonable , � said Tucson pharmacist Marylyn Yee .
Democrats boycotted the 1 ½ - hour committee hearing , saying they were taking a stand against legislation that would crimp the availability of abortion services and emergency contraception , particularly in rural areas with fewer health care options .
The bill is a step toward making abortion unavailable in the state , which would force women seeking the procedure to travel to California , said Rep. Phil Lopes , D - Tucson .
� We do n't want to go back to that , � Lopes said .
Dr. Candace Lew , a Planned Parenthood Arizona leader and an obstetrician - gynecologist who practices in Tempe , said the so - called �informed consent� provisions are insulting to women .
� It is not government 's place to make a woman 's decision for her and this bill certainly attempts to do that , " Lew said .
Iconic civil rights advocate laid off by Village Voice Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 31 , 2008
Print This Email This Long - time civil rights advocate Nat Hentoff has been laid off by the financially troubled Village Voice .
The 83 year old Hentoff had worked for the paper since 1958 , only three years after its founding .
He responded to the news , which he received by phone on Tuesday morning , by saying ,  Im 83 and a half .
Youd think theyd have let me go silently .
Fortunately , Ive never been more productive .
Hentoff 's greatest prominent came in the 1960's , when he was known as both a jazz critic and a leading exponent of free speech .
He testified at the 1964 obscenity trial of comedian Lenny Bruce and helped launch the career of a young Bob Dylan .
In 1971 , a veiled reference in Hentoff 's column to the Pentagon Papers helped convince the New York Times to print the documents that revealed the Nixon administration 's lies .
In recent years , Hentoff has appeared to grow more conservative .
He supported the invasion of Iraq on humanitarian grounds and became an opponent of abortion to the point where he refused to support the candidacy of Barack Obama .
However , Hentoff remains a fervent supporter of the freedom of the press .
He wrote in his column for the Voice in 2007 , " In the more than half a century I 've been a reporter , there has never been as systematic an operation to intimidate and then silence the press as is now taking place under the Bush - Cheney - Gonzales administration . "
Earlier this month , Hentoff raised an alarm over the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005 , which is about to give give the federal government the power to collect DNA samples from anyone arrested for any crime .
 With all due immodesty , " Hentoff told the Times , " I think it doesnt help to lose me because people have told me they read The Voice not only for me , but certainly for me . "

The A - 12 trainer in flight HistorySpy planes need to collect information , but they also need to survive flying through unfriendly areas .
That means being hard to spot on radar , cruising high up out of reach , and flying fast enough to outrun anything in pursuit .
The A - 12 met all these challenges better than any plane had before .
The Skunk Works , a special classified projects group at the Lockheed Aircraft Company , made huge advances in aircraft technology to build the A - 12 .
Since the A - 12 was the first titanium aircraft , the project team discovered a lot about how to work with this challenging metal .
The A - 12 team developed new methods so fuels and oil could stand up to the extreme heat in the plane ’s engine .
They also tested new ways to make aircraft less visible to radar .
In the late 1960s , A - 12s flew 29 spy missions over North Vietnam and North Korea as part of Operation Black Shield .
In North Vietnam , the planes looked for missile sites .
They flew so fast that it took just over 12 minutes to fly the nearly 500 miles over North Vietnam , moving at three times the speed of sound ( Mach 3 ) at altitudes between 85,000 and 90,000 feet .
Missions over North Korea were extremely sensitive .
The first happened a few days after a U.S. spy ship , the USS Pueblo , was captured in January 1968 .
The missions were designed to see if North Korea was planning a major attack on South Korea .

Chimp Has Attacked Before , Woman Claims
The chimp that mauled a woman this week had allegedly bit another woman in 1996 .
Feb. 19 , 2009  -- A Connecticut woman said she was attacked in 1996 by the same chimp who mauled a women earlier this week .
Leslie Mostel - Paul told the NBC's " Today " show that the chimp , named Travis , had bit her hand and tried to drag her into a car .
She said she complained to police and the owner after the incident .
In two weeks authorities will decide whether to press charges against a Stamford , Conn. , woman whose 200 - pound domesticated chimpanzee mauled a friend .
Though police said Sandra Herold told them that shortly before the attack Monday she 'd given the chimp Xanax , because he was agitated , Herold backtracked Wednesday on whether she 'd administered the anti-anxiety drug to the animal .
Herold claimed she put the medication in the chimp 's tea but the pills never dissolved .
Police believe the drug may have contributed to the rampage .
" They were in the bottom .
They did n't melt , " Herold said .
An emotional Herold went to the morgue Wednesday to say goodbye to the animal she had raised since birth .
" I touched him , and I told him I was sorry .
I still love him as much as ever , " she said .
" I got to touch him and at least try to have some closure . "
Doctors said Xanax is often prescribed to animals , including dogs , for anxiety .
While it can be very safe , it 's also known for causing maniacal behavior in unstable patients .
Chimps as Children
Herold 's longtime friend Sabrina Taylor said the chimpanzee was treated more like a human than a chimp .
" He would have the onesies , " Taylor said .
" She 'd have the harness on him .
She 'd have the blue one , the pretty red one . "
" She would dress him like he was a little child , " Taylor added .
But animal behavior expert Nicolas Dodman said chimpanzees are anything but stable .
" To have a wild animal in that sort of situation is a terrible idea , " Dodman said .
" Most people with wild animals , they can do quite well for a period of time , but then something suddenly seems to go wrong , " he said .
" This particular chimp was 200 pounds .
You 're dealing with a 200 - pound superstrong athlete , and that 's potentially a dangerous weapon . "
Still some primate owners see their pets as children , calling them monkids .
" Richard helps me .
He 's an emotional support .
He calms me down .
He lowers my blood pressure , " said Debby Rose who owns a monkey .
The Dangers of Monkeys as Pets
But former monkey owner Angelle Sampey learned that the animals are n't always as lovable as they seem and do n't necessarily make great houseguests .
" He bit me everywhere he could bite me .
He ripped my elbow open , right across my wrist , on my hand , the back of my knee and it all happened within like three seconds , " said Sampey , who wanted a pet that would make her feel better .
In Travis ' case , Herold was forced to stab the animal as it attacked 55 - year - old Charla Nash .
" I stabbed him , and he looked up at me like , ' Why 'd you do that , mom ? '"
Herold said .
Dramatic 911 tapes reveal the trauma of the situation in which Herold initially believed the animal had killed Nash .
Nash barely survived and lost her nose , eyes and jaw in the brutal incident .
" The patient Charla received extensive facial and bilateral hand injuries which required four teams of surgeons operating , " said Dr. Kevin Miller at Stamford Hospital .
Doctors said she is showing signs of improvement but is still fighting for her life .
Richard Farinato of the U.S. Humane Society said it 's important to take precautions when dealing with monkeys as pets .
" Every time you touch that animal , take him out on a leash .
Take him , hold the monkey in your arms , show him to the kid next door .
This is dangerous stuff , " he said .
If global warming some day causes the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to collapse , as many experts believe it could , the resulting sea level rise in much of the United States and other parts of the world would be significantly higher than is currently projected , a new study concludes .
The catastrophic increase in sea level , already projected to average between 16 and 17 feet around the world , would be almost 21 feet in such places as Washington , D.C. , scientists say , putting it largely underwater .
Many coastal areas would be devastated .
Much of southern Florida would disappear .
The report will be published Friday in the journal Science , by researchers from Oregon State University and the University of Toronto .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and other agencies from the U.S. and Canada .
â€ œWe arenâ€™t suggesting that a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is imminent , â€ said Peter Clark , a professor of geosciences at Oregon State University .
â€ œBut these findings do suggest that if you are planning for sea level rise , you had better plan a little higher.â€ 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that a collapse of this ice sheet would raise sea levels around the world by about 16.5 feet , on average , and that figure is still widely used .
However , that theoretical average does not consider several key forces , such as gravity , changes in the Earthâ€™s rotation or a rebound of the land on which the massive glacier now rests , scientists say in the new study .
Right now , this ice sheet has a huge mass , towering more than 6,000 feet above sea level over a large section of Antarctica thatâ€™s about the size of Texas .
This mass is sufficient to exert a substantial gravitational attraction , researchers say , pulling water toward it â€ “ much as the gravitational forces of the sun and moon cause the constant movement of water on Earth commonly known as tides .
â€ œA study was done more than 30 years ago pointing out this gravitational effect , but for some reason it became virtually ignored , â€ Clark said .
â€ œPeople forgot about it when developing their sea level projections for the future.â€ 
Aside from incorporating the gravitational effect , the new study adds further wrinkles to the calculation â€ “ the weight of the ice forcing down the land mass on which it sits , and also affecting the orientation of the Earthâ€™s spin .
When the ice is removed , it appears the underlying land would rebound , and the Earthâ€™s axis of rotation defined by the North and South Pole would actually shift about one - third of a mile , also affecting the sea level at various points .
When these forces are all taken into calculation , the sea level anywhere near Antarctica would actually fall , the report concludes , while many other areas , mostly in the Northern Hemisphere , would go up .
If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet completely melted , the East Coast of North America would experience sea levels more than four feet higher than had been previously predicted â€ “ almost 21 feet â€ “ and the West Coast , as well as Miami , Fla. , would be about a foot higher than that .
Most of Europe would have seas about 18 feet higher .
â€ œIf this did happen , there would also be many other impacts that go far beyond sea level increase , including much higher rates of coastal erosion , greater damage from major storm events , problems with ground water salinization , and other issues , â€  Clark said .
â€
œAnd there could be correlated impacts on other glaciers and ice sheets in coastal areas that could tend to destabilize them as well .â€ 
Itâ€™s still unclear , Clark said , when or if a breakup of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet might occur , or how fast it could happen .
It may not happen for hundreds of years , he said , and even then it may not melt in its entirety .
Research should continue to better understand the forces at work , he said .
â€ œHowever , these same effects apply to any amount of melting that may occur from West Antarctica , â€ Clark said .
â€ œSo many coastal areas need to plan for greater sea level rise than they may have expected .â€ 
A significant part of the concern is that much of the base of this huge ice mass actually sits below sea level , forced down to the bedrock by the sheer weight of the ice above it .
Its edges flow out into floating ice shelves , including the huge Ross Ice Shelf and Ronne Ice Shelf .
This topography makes it â€œinherently unstable , â€ Clark said .
â€ œThere is widespread concern that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet , which is characterized by extensive marine - based sectors , may be prone to collapse in a warming world , â€ the researchers wrote in their report .
See what different areas of the world would look like with different levels of sea rise here .

I ’m told the group of ‘ centrist ’ senators ( Collins , Nelson et al. ) is meeting at this moment .
And the basis of their meeting is a staff paper that was just circulated with a total of $ 77.9 billion proposed cuts to the existing senate bill .
The biggest hit is on education spending .
A few examples of the recommended cuts …
$ 24.786 Billion on “ State Stabilization Money ”
$ 15 Billion for “ State Incentive Grants ”
$ 6.75 Billion for “ IDEA ” , proposed cut 50 %
$ 6.5 Billion for “ Title I Funding ” , proposed cut 50 %
Most of $ 5 billion from HHS for ‘ prevention and wellness ’ programs .
$ 5.5 Billion “ Supplementary Discretionary Grants Program ” at HUD Transportation

I ’ve been asking around a bit and everyone I ’ve spoken to says that most business groups support the stimulus bill in the House ( or even larger ) form .
That makes sense , because businesses do obviously want to avoid a prolonged recession .
I wondered , then , why they ’re not pushing Senate Republicans to vote for it .
Well , it turns out that they are :
the traditionally Republican - leaning business lobby is beginning to exert itself more as well .
In announcing his support Friday night , Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) pointedly read from a Chamber of Commerce endorsement .
The National Association of Manufacturers has also weighed in , telling Republicans that votes on the bill “ including potential procedural motions ” may be considered for designation as key votes in NAM ’s scoring of their legislative record .
The main purpose of the Republican party is to support the interests of big business ( this is also one of the primary purposes of the Democratic party ) .
I ’ve always thought , though , that some day the Republican party would become so insane that it would begin to frighten big business .
That day may have arrived .

According to Fox News , Obama is proposing a measly 10 % cut in the Pentagon 's declared budget .
Predictably , wingnut heads are exploding .
But Justin Gardiner of Donklephant has some real facts at his fingertips in an astute comment over at center - right blog Poligazette .
I 'm going to lift his comment in its entirety :
A few things …
1 ) The Pentagon ’s budget ( not including expenditures for Iraq and Afghanistan ) has grown from $ 316B in 2001 to $ 536B in 2009 .
This represents a 70 % increase .
So a 10 % decrease is funding will take us from $ 536B to $ 483B , which is still more than the $ 463B the Pentagon had for 2007 .
All Obama is doing is preventing the budget from growing an average of 10 % year after year when there ’s no discernible advantage to doing so .
2 ) Obama has said consistently that ALL government agencies will see cuts , but the military budget is the biggest so that has to be one of the first to be addressed .
3 ) The United States spends more than the next 40 + countries combined in defense spending .
How that ’s tolerated by our taxpayers is beyond me , but I ’d imagine they ’d like a little of that money back at a time like this , would n’t you ?
But to the broader point of this post , I think it would be refreshing to see these cuts being characterized as something other than an ideological win for the Dems .
Cutting back right now makes sense because our current budgets are n’t sustainable .
In other words , if McCain had won the election and was proposing these cuts , what would this post say ?
Would you call Republican voters gullible ?
Would you tell people to contact their congressional reps or senators ?
Well yes , exactly .
Plus , remember that the declared budget does n't include supplementary amounts for Iraq and Afghanistan or the defense spending spread around other departments like Energy ( nukes ) , veteran care and Homeland Security .
Add it all up and its closer to $ 1 trillion , or well over half of all government spending .
And no , defense spending is not good stimulus spending unless you work for a neocon think - tank .
If it were , increased spending since 9/11 - almost a trillion a year - would have had a far more noticeable effect on GDP .
Lets face it , we 've had tax cuts for the rich and defense spending out the wazoo .
If they were effective as stimuli to rescue the nation from depression , the economy would n't be in this state to begin with .

How Important Are the Top 25 Software Errors ?
We asked several of the participants why they thought this effort was important enough to merit a significant amount of their time and expertise .
Here are a few of their answers .
More are at the end of the announcement .
" Just wanted to commend the depth of the CWE / SANS Top 25 .
The code examples are particularly excellent .
I have asked all my developers to read one of these each day for the next 25 days .
I 'm taking my own advice as well , and even though I 'm still reading some of the " easy " ones ( like SQL injection ) , I still find that I am learning new things about old topics . " -- Mark E. Haase , OpenFISMA Project Manager , Endeavor Systems , Inc .
" Your document ( 2009 CWE / SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors ) is very useful .
I would like to publish it on our intranet , for illustrating threats and vulnerabilities about coding . " -- colonel Jean - Michel HOUBRE , from the french MOD .
" We included the top25 reference in a request for bid last year .
Project began in December and expect the project to be complete in October 2010 .
We are hopeful to have a much more secure and better application due to the reference and utilization of the SANS / MITRE Top 25 . " -- Richard Lemons , WV Department of Health and Human Resources

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Reports of undisclosed financial ties between researchers and drugmakers have eroded public confidence , and restoring it will require an end to some “ free ” perks , health policy experts said on Tuesday .

Doctors may have to give up not just pens and prescription pads , but cozy seminars put on by drug companies in the guise of education , while the companies may need to give up direct - to - consumer ads , the experts wrote in a series of commentaries in the British Medical Journal .
Concern over research integrity in the United States has become more pronounced following accusations last year by Iowa Republican Sen.
Charles Grassley that prominent Harvard University psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Biederman and others failed to fully disclose payments from drug companies .
“ We ’ve seen a lot of transgressions -- people who have taken advantage of the system for their own self - aggrandizement or profit .
It ’s got to stop , ” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz of Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut .
One solution , offered by Dr. Marcia Angell of Harvard Medical School in Boston , is for doctors to keep industry at arms length .
“ I believe there should be no relationship between the drug industry and either prescribers or patients , ” wrote Angell , former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine .
She argues that doctors should pay for their own continuing medical education instead of turning to drug companies for updates on prescription drugs .
And she said professional organizations should pay for their own meetings and publications , instead of going “ hat in hand to industry . ”
The meetings would be “ less opulent , ” Angell said in a telephone interview .
GOLF IN HAWAII
“ You might have to go down the local high school instead of playing golf in Hawaii , but the education would be better because it would be impartial , ” she said .
Gordon Coutts , a vice president and general manager of Schering Plough UK , argued that healthcare professionals should have access to drug industry information on medicines .
“ It is paradoxical that some do not consider doctors capable of separating good information from bad , ” Coutts wrote .
But Krumholz agreed that pens , lunches and even drug samples can have a subtle influence on a doctor .
“ I would often grab samples off the shelf because I thought I was doing patients a favor , ” Krumholz said in a telephone interview .
“ I was naive .
I did n’t realize this was a very effective marketing technique . ”
Krumholz argues that direct - to - consumer advertising influences patients to ask for costly treatments over cheaper options .
“ I think it has overshadowed the science , ” he said .
Scott Gottlieb , a health policy analyst in Washington who consults for pharmaceutical companies said drugmakers need to establish transparent guidelines governing their interactions with doctors and patients , and focus more on advancing science rather than marketing .
“ Relationships should be predicated on genuine scientific work , ” he wrote .
Earlier this year , many drugmakers said they would stop giving out small gifts such as pens and flash drives as part of new voluntary guidelines from Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , an industry group in Washington .
The group ’s 2002 code already bans more costly gifts like trips to resorts , and calls for companies that pay for medical education at conferences to leave the content to outside experts .
Barack Obama sure did n't shy away from the William Ayers / ACORN issue last night .
He confronted McCain 's smears head on , explaining the ridiculous guilt - by - association " connection " and denouncing them as petty , meaningless distractions .
In fact , Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Sen. McCain 's campaign over the last two or three weeks .
This has been their primary focus .
So let 's get the record straight . [...]
Let me tell you who I associate with .
On economic policy , I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker .
If I 'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy , I associate myself with my running mate , Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar , the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , or General Jim Jones , the former supreme allied commander of NATO .
Those are the people , Democrats and Republicans , who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House .
And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign , Sen. McCain , says more about your campaign than it says about me .
Full transcript below the fold :
In fact , Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Sen. McCain 's campaign over the last two or three weeks .
This has been their primary focus .
So let 's get the record straight .
Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago .
Forty years ago , when I was 8 years old , he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group .
I have roundly condemned those acts .
Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan 's former ambassadors and close friends , Mr. Annenberg .
Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois , the president of Northwestern University , who happens to be a Republican , the president of The Chicago Tribune , a Republican - leaning newspaper .
Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign .
He has never been involved in this campaign .
And he will not advise me in the White House .
So that 's Mr. Ayers .
Now , with respect to ACORN , ACORN is a community organization .
Apparently what they 've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks , and apparently some of the people who were out there did n't really register people , they just filled out a bunch of names .
It had nothing to do with us .
We were not involved .
The only involvement I 've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs .
Now , the reason I think that it 's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Sen.
McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling .
Let me tell you who I associate with .
On economic policy , I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker .
If I 'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy , I associate myself with my running mate , Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar , the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , or General Jim Jones , the former supreme allied commander of NATO .
Those are the people , Democrats and Republicans , who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House .
And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign , Sen. McCain , says more about your campaign than it says about me .
[ The following is a transcription of Friedrich von Hayek 's June 22 , 1975 interview on " Meet the Press . "

This transcript first appeared on JohnLocke.org .]
Will :
" Dr. von Hayek , in the 30 years since World War II , some nation 's economies have done very much better than others .
West Germany , for example , has done much better than Great Britain .
Are there any generalizations that you can draw from these ?
What is the secret to success and the secret to problems ? "
Hayek :
" Well of course it 's a very complicated issue but there is one simple point : the German trade unions were extraordinarily sensible , and they were sensible because they remembered what inflation meant .
However , there 's a certain implication ; this sense may not last long , because the generation which remembers it is now going off .
I 'm rather apprehensive about the future . "
Will :
" Dr. von Hayek , we have a basically conservative administration in the United States today , but even it is facing planned deficits ( more or less planned deficits ) exceeding perhaps $ 100 billion in the next two years .
Do you think this will cause a renewed and perhaps socially destructive inflation ? "
Hayek :
" It 's not unlikely , I 'm afraid .
So long as the governing people are persuaded that inflation of this sort is even beneficial in its effect , the tendency in that direction will be very great .
I think it all depends on persuading the responsible people of the danger of inflation . "
Rowan :
" Dr. von Hayek , you talked in response to Mr. Levine of a painful adjustment of the unpleasant effects that we would have to endure in order to beat inflation .
With all due respect , sir , are n't your theories somewhat unrealistic in a political sense ?
Do you visualize governments today being able to take such steps as you recommend ? "
Hayek :
" Perhaps I 'm unrealistic .
As long as people do not fully realize the danger of inflation , they may well pressure for more inflation as a short - term remedy for evils .
Though we may well be driven into more , until people have learned the lesson , but that means that inflation may still do more of a great deal of harm , before it will be cured . "
Rowan :
" Well to be specific , what rate of unemployment do you think that this country ought to be willing to tolerate in order to beat inflation ?
Twelve percent , fifteen percent ? "
Hayek :
" It 's not a question of what the country is willing to tolerate .
The longer you have inflation , the more greater unemployment becomes inevitable .
We will have no choice .
It 's all the matter that government can't avoid the unemployment which is caused by the previous misdirection of labor , which the inflation has produced . "
Rowan :
" But when you speak of unpleasant effects , just what are you talking about that the country would have to endure ?
It must be some level of unemployment that you 're thinking of that would result if we do cure inflation . "
Hayek :
" Well , a period of inflation , not a lasting inflation .
When if you want to achieve a tolerably stable position , you really have to go through a period of inflation , which would put off unemployment , which may well last more than a year . "
Rowan :
" And how high could that get ? "
Hayek :
" I could n't say .
I mean I would have to know much more about the specific conditions , but it would not exclude a temporary rise to thirteen , fourteen percent or something of that sort . "
Rowan :
" Do you think the social fabric of this country could tolerate a fourteen - percent rate of unemployment ? "
Hayek :
" For a few months , certainly . "
Shanahan :
" Professor von Hayek , your fellow Nobel laureate , Professor Leontief , is an advocate of planning , and two of our prominent senators , Humphrey and Javits , have introduced legislation to implement his idea , which is largely a matter of study by various government agencies and recommendations — nothing compulsory .
Do you see in that kind of planning the same dangers that you see in a more mandatory form ? "
Hayek :
" Well if it 's really nothing compulsory , it would also be completely ineffective and therefore would do no harm .
I think there 's a very simple answer .
He really imagines that somehow people are being made to do what he is planning . "
Shanahan :
" The thought , I believe , that they have expressed is that such things as foreseeing shortages of industrial productive capacity could be highlighted , and the industries encouraged to go ahead with building new plants , that sort of thing .
Do you encompass that in your thought that it would be completely ineffective ? "
Hayek :
" But why call that planning ?
If you can give industry better information , by all means do . "
Shanahan :
" Can we then say you would support that legislation , despite your fears of planning ? "
Hayek :
" Well , there 's nothing to do with planning . "
Host :
" Dr. von Hayek , did I understand you to say in answer to Mr. Levine 's question that the way to stop inflation is to stop the printing presses ?
Now are you suggesting that that 's what we 're doing here , that we 're just printing money , and that 's the way this inflation has started , and that 's the way this is continuing , and that 's the way it will continue ? "
Hayek :
" The sentence , ' stopping the printing presses , ' is a figurative expression , because it is being done now by creating credit by the Federal Reserve System .
But this is government action — all inflation is ultimately the result of activities which government determines and can control .
And all inflations have been stopped in the past by the government stopping creating money , or preventing the central bank from creating more money .
May I add just one thing ?
See , all inflations have been stopped by people who created or believed in a very naive form of the Quantity Theory , and acted on that .
It may be wrong , but it is the only adequate theory effective to stop an inflation . "
Host :
" Now you have been a student , I 'm sure , of the United States because you 've taught here for many years .
What do you think has started our inflation ?
We 've had inflation for a number of years , and I do n't think that we were printing money at that time , or that the Federal Reserve was necessarily dumping a great deal of money .
What do you think was responsible for the beginning of our inflation ? "
Hayek :
" The belief in the deliberate increase of aggregate demand , as a means of creating employment .
In effect , what 's popularly called belief in Keynesian policies to create employment . "
Levine :
" Dr. von Hayek , the general belief among administration economists now is that we are near or at the bottom of the recession that we 've been going through .
Do I understand you to be saying that we should be willing to experience a continuation of this period of low economic activity for another year or so rather than to take the kind of efforts that the government has taken — of a tax cut in order to stimulate the economy ? "
Hayek :
" The tax cut again aims at increasing aggregate demand and the present difficulty is not due to a deficiency of aggregate demand .
It is due to the fact that without continued inflation , you cannot maintain the people in the new employments in which they have been drawn by the inflation of the past . "
Levine :
" I would like to pursue the first part of my question : do you see a necessity , in order to avoid a resurgence of inflation , that the government undertake policies which will continue us at the present low level of economic activity for a period of a year or more ? "
Hayek :
" Well not necessarily at the low level , but we should not produce more than a very slow recovery .
I would like to add , the slower the recovery is , the better are the chances that it will last . "
Levine :
" In a speech before a congressional group not long ago , you said that the threat to the free - enterprise system of our society has never been more imminent than it is now .
What did you mean by that ? "
Hayek :
" Well because I am afraid that government will continue to inflate to combat unemployment , and we tried to meet the effects by imposing price controls .
And if you use price controls for that purpose , you are driven into a centrally planned system . "
Will :
" Thirty years ago when , Dr. von Hayek , you stressed , and have subsequently stressed , that political and economic liberties must either flourish together or perish together .
Do you see signs — specifically in the United States today ( or in Great Britain , with which you 're familiar ) — that political liberty is endangered ? "
Hayek :
" In Great Britain certainly , and it is quite clear that by the established democratic process , you cannot conduct the kind of economic policies the present governing party wants to conduct .
For the danger of a reduction of political liberty in Great Britain is considerable .
This country is not so imminent , very largely for the reason that the efforts have not been directed so much towards nationalization and direct government controls of industries .
But the attempts have been made by a redistribution of incomes by taxation .
And that is a much slower process .
I think it tends in the same direction , but much more slowly than the other one . "
Rowan :
" Dr. von Hayek , how do you rate the impact of market power wielded by either unions or corporations as a factor in inflation ?
You seem to be putting all of the stress on the quantity of money and the printing press .
Is n't part of our inflation and part of the inflations in some other parts of the world due to excessive market power of labor unions and corporations ? "
Hayek :
" Never directly .
Well it may well be , and frequently happens , that because of the power of the unions as well as the corporations government feels compelled to inflate .
It becomes the inducement for government action .
But the immediate cause is always the increase of the quantity of money by government , whatever the inducement to do so . "
Rowan :
" Well now returning to the crisis in Great Britain , the chancellor of the Exchequer told me on Wednesday that the Cabinet will consider a return to a formal wage - price - incomes policy .
What effect , if any , do you think that would have on the very high level of British inflation in wages and prices ? "
Hayek :
" I do n't think it will help at all .
See , it might be necessary as a temporary measure , at the moment when you are in a position to stop the increase in the quantity of money .
I do not see any prospect at all in the near future of the British government effectively stopping an increase in the quantity of money .
In that situation , you just disguise the effects of inflation for the time . "
Rowan :
" What would be your prescription for the ills that afflict Great Britain ? "
Hayek :
" Well it 's a problem of first persuading the public that , in the present situation , the pressure of the trade union does not deserve public support .
That you must achieve before you can do anything by legislation reducing the powers of the trade unions .
It must be a long process .
I do n't see any immediate cure . "
Shanahan :
" Professor von Hayek , you have always stressed government actions that inflate and government planning and controls as the great dangers to our political freedom .
Many Americans see another scenario for loss of freedom in this country , which is economic policies that now have unemployment in the center cities among black youths over forty percent , and that their anger and frustration can lead to violence , which in turn will lead to repressive governmental action .
What do you say to that scenario ?
Can we just sit idly by and let that happen ? "
Hayek :
" No , but it goes back to the same cause .
The unemployment of which you speak , which is the initial cause , is due to labor being temporarily directed into places or activities or industries where they cannot be maintained without further inflation .
Therefore you can only cure that by achieving a new redistribution of labor between employments .
Adaptation to a condition in which aggregate demand need not progressively increase to maintain that employment . "
Shanahan :
" But you have said in everything you 've written and said lately that this is a lengthy process , that we wo n't get back to stable money quickly .
Meanwhile , what do you do with these urgent problems and human hardships ? "
Hayek :
" We must n't assume that all problems are solvable in the short period .
There are problems that we cannot solve or which trying to solve them quickly may do more harm than good . "
Shanahan :
" But in the meantime , what do you do with the human hardship and the mounting rage that is certainly building up ? "
Hayek :
" Well , I do n't think there is anything I can do about it .
We 'll have to tide over the storm which may be threatening . "
Host :
" Dr. von Hayek , may we get a bit specific on one particular thing , and that is Great Britain ?
You 're a citizen of Great Britain ; you 've taught there , and I think you know something about the economy there .
As I understand it , their inflation rate may hit as high as fifty percent .
What is the consequence of something of that kind ?
What do you see is going to happen in the country of which you 're a citizen ?
Hayek :
" Well you get a very severe economic crisis with fairly extensive unemployment , the moment inflation stops .
It will probably have repeated attempts to restart the process by returning to inflation … would probably combat the wrong thing — the effects of inflation on prices by price controls — that will lead to a centrally directed economy , which will weaken the international economic position of Britain even worse .
And that will probably result in the position that somebody may decide that the direction of economic policy has to be completely changed .
I almost hope that the severe crisis will come soon .
There wo n't be a long dragged - out process of misery .
But I do n't see any immediate chance , with the present political situation in England , of such a complete change in economic policy as would be required . "
Host :
" Are you saying that England is either going to go bankrupt or that England is going to become a dictatorship ?
What specifically do you mean is going to happen in Great Britain ? "
Hayek :
" The English people are beginning to experience , which they hardly have yet , but they have become very much poorer and are rapidly getting poorer still .
And that will lead to the resolution or the recognition that the policy of the past was wrong .
The amazing fact is that the great majority of British people are not yet consciously aware that they are living in a very severe economic crisis .
For that reason , they are not willing to consider seriously a complete change in policy . "
Host :
" Well but what do you think is going to happen since you believe that ?
What 's going to happen there ?
Are they going bust ? "
Hayek :
" No country can go bust .
All that happens is that economic conditions of daily life are getting much worse , so there will be scarcities .
People will find that their income is no longer sufficient to maintain their standard of life .
They will come to distrust first the present government and present policies , and may then be willing to return to an altogether different system .
But I 'm no prophet ; I can't say how soon it will — "
Host :
" And do you think that if we follow along our present footsteps that the same thing 's going to happen to us ? "
Hayek :
" Yes , but in ten or twenty years ' time , not a problem for the immediate future . "
Levine :
" Dr. von Hayek , to try to translate some of the things that you 've been saying into the terms of the pocketbook of the average American , what advice would you give an American with savings of twenty , thirty , maybe one hundred thousand dollars ?
What should he do with that money to protect it against the problems of inflation that you 've been discussing ? "
Hayek :
" I still believe there is nothing better than putting [ it ] into equities , although even that does n't promise him today that it would actually preserve it , but it would give you a good chance of preserving a substantial portion of it . "
Levine :
" Dr. von Hayek , these theories that you 've gained such recognition for over a period of years have warned consistently , as has been pointed out , of the dangers and threats of inflation .
And yet this country has undergone inflation for a great many years , and the standard of living has consistently increased .
Does this lead you to question in any way your thesis ? "
Hayek :
" Not in the least , because the dangers of inflation are very different ones .
They are exactly the kind of unemployment which is now arising .
In the usual discussion , there is quite a wrong emphasis .
There are many bad effects of inflation , but the worst is that it draws labor into employments where they can be kept employed only by an accelerating inflation .
And the point inevitably arises where inflation cannot be accelerated sufficiently fast to keep them in that inflation .
We just make one short … the inflation is like overeating and indigestion .
Overeating is very pleasant ; so is inflation .
Indigestion comes along only afterwards , and therefore people do not see the connection . "
Will :
" Dr. von Hayek , capitalism and particularly American capitalism would seem to have a good record at giving people a rising standard of living .
Why are so many intellectuals , and particularly so many economists , skeptical about and even hostile to capitalism ? "
Hayek :
" Well , I 've been puzzling about it for a long time , particularly about the economists who ought to understand better .
It 's very difficult to know why they do n't .
I think it 's the intellectual attraction of a system you can deliberately control , which is fascinating to the intellectual . " $ 8 $ 5
Rowan :
" Dr. von Hayek , coming back quickly to Great Britain , is n't it possible that if we pursued your philosophy and theory , that we might destroy capitalism there rather than save it , looking at the analogy of the Italians ? "
Hayek :
" No , it 's not likely to become worse .
The present tendency would destroy capitalism inevitably .
I think the important thing is that people are given a chance to change their minds , before it is irrevocably destroyed … "

Asustek Computer ( Asus ) plans to offer fewer versions of its Eee PC netbooks this year to avoid confusion and lower production costs , executives said Thursday .
The company , which pioneered the netbook phenomenon with the Eee PC , put out over 20 different versions of the device last year , with different names such as the Eee PC S101 , Eee PC 1000H , Eee PC Surf and more .
This year will be different for Asustek .
The company will simplify the production and marketing of the Eee PC by reducing the number of models , said CEO Jerry Shen at an investors conference in Taipei on Thursday .
Although last year 's Eee PC strategy gave users a much wider range of choices , it did not help Asustek fight off competition from newcomers .
Acer , which launched a single netbook with one name , the Aspire One will likely soon announce that it shipped more netbooks than Asustek did last year , even though Acer entered the netbook market much later in the year than Asustek .
Acer launched the Aspire One in the second half of last year , well behind Asustek , which had Eee PCs on sale from the start of 2008 .
Yet on Thursday , Asustek announced it shipped 4.9 million Eee PCs last year , well behind Acer 's projected 6 million units .
Acer has n't announced a final shipment figure yet .
Acer 's sales of the Aspire One soared due to its simplicity , low cost , and the company 's ability to launch globally , analysts say .
The company reduced market confusion through its single netbook strategy , and offered variety by letting users choose from different configurations and software .
The strategy also allowed Acer also kept design and assembly costs to a minimum , and Acer passed the savings on to users in the form of low prices .
Asustek , by contrast , suffered due to its strategy of offering multiple Eee PCs .
Each run of a line of Eee PCs was more expensive , on average , than Acer 's runs of Aspire Ones because the Eee PC models were significantly different , costing Asus in design expenses as well as component procurement and assembly costs , analysts said .

Gordon Brown has urged global markets to abide by a system of " morals " , including " responsible risk - taking " and a " work ethic " .
After UK shares experienced their biggest one - day fall , the prime minister said successful economies had to have shared values .
He told a dinner in London the government would do " whatever it takes " to see out the current crisis .
The " good economy " would help create the " good society " , Mr Brown added .
On Monday the FTSE 100 list of leading UK shares experienced its biggest ever one - day points fall , losing 391.1 points - or 7.85 % of its value .
' Wider issues '
Speaking to MPs earlier , Chancellor Alistair Darling said the government would act to support the banking system as a whole as well as supporting individual banks
At the annual dinner of the United Jewish Israel Appeal , Mr Brown said ministers were working with European allies to regulate markets more effectively .
He added : " But there is a wider set of issues : this financial crisis has gone to the heart of how you create a good economy and a good society .
" We believe in markets .
We also know that our success as a market economy - and indeed the operation of the market itself - depends upon upholding values which the market alone cannot generate .
" Successful market economies need trust which can only be built through shared values .
" My values , the values of the country , celebrate hard work , effort , enterprise and responsible risk taking - qualities that markets need to ensure that the rewards that flow are seen to be fair . "
' Effort and enterprise '
Mr Brown said that risk - taking sometimes " crosses the line " between responsible entrepreneurship and irresponsible behaviour .
He added : " And that is why we back the work ethic ; we support effort and enterprise and responsible risk - taking .
These are the morals markets need .
" And where there has been irresponsibility we must now have instead transparency , integrity , responsibility , good housekeeping and international co-operation as the vital foundation stones of our financial system and the international financial system . "
Earlier , the prime minister addressed a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party .
MP George Howarth , one of Mr Brown 's leading critics , said : " Hostilities are over " .
He added that , at a time of national crisis , the Labour Party had to come together .
Gross domestic product ( GDP ) is the total value of everything produced within a country 's borders .
When economists talk about the " size " of the economy , they are referring to GDP .
To avoid double - counting , GDP includes the final value of the product , but not the parts that go into it .﻿﻿
For example , a U.S. footwear manufacturer uses shoelaces and other materials made in the U.S. , but only the value of the shoe gets counted ; the shoelaces do n't .
In the U.S. , the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) measures GDP quarterly , and it revises the quarterly estimate every month as it receives updated data .
The components of GDP include personal consumption expenditures ( C ) , business investments ( I ) , government spending ( G ) , exports ( X ) , and imports ( M ) . GDP is equal to C + I + G + ( X - M ) .
Types
There are many different ways to measure a country 's GDP , so it 's important to know all the different types and how they are used .
A country 's nominal GDP is the raw measurement that includes price increases .
It 's also known as the " current - dollar " GDP because it is measured with current market prices .﻿﻿
At the end of the first quarter of 2020 , the nominal U.S. GDP was $ 21.538 trillion .﻿﻿
To get the real GDP , the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) removes the effects of inflation .
The real GDP allows economists to compare figures from different years .
Otherwise , it might seem like the economy is growing when it 's actually suffering from double - digit inflation .
The BEA calculates real GDP by using a price deflator , which tells you how much prices have changed since a base year .
Incomes from U.S. companies and people from outside the country are not included , which removes the impact of exchange rates and trade policies .
Real GDP is lower than nominal GDP , and at the end of the first quarter of 2020 , it was $ 18.988 trillion .﻿﻿
As of May 22 , 2020 , the BEA uses 2012 as the base year for its real GDP data .
The GDP growth rate is the percentage increase in GDP from quarter to quarter , and it changes as the economy moves through the business cycle .
If the growth rate is negative , the economy contracts , and it signals a recession .
If it contracts for years , that 's a depression .
If the growth rate is too high , it creates inflation .
The BEA provides the U.S. GDP growth rate monthly , and at the end of the first quarter of 2020 , the U.S. nominal and real GDP decreased by 3.5 % and 4.8 % , respectively .﻿﻿
Many economists agree that roughly 2 % is an ideal growth rate that allows for sustainable economic growth .﻿﻿
Rates that are faster than that can lead to inflation and asset bubbles , both of which can contribute to economic downturns .
Some countries have a big GDP only because of their large population .
GDP per capita is the best way to compare GDP between countries because it divides the GDP by the number of residents , and measures the country 's standard of living .
In the first quarter of 2020 , the U.S. GDP per capita was $ 57,621 .﻿﻿
The best way to compare GDP per capita by year or between countries is with real GDP per capita .
This takes out the effects of inflation , exchange rates , and differences in population .
How GDP Affects
You
GDP impacts personal finance , investments , and job growth .
Investors look at a nation 's growth rate to decide if they should adjust their asset allocation , as well as compare country growth rates to find their best international opportunities .
They purchase shares of companies that are in rapidly growing countries .
The Federal Reserve , the central bank in the U.S. , uses the growth rate to determine monetary policy .
Interest Rates
The Fed implements expansionary monetary policy to ward off recession and contractionary monetary policy to prevent inflation .
Its primary tool is the federal funds rate .
For example , if the growth rate is increasing , then the Fed raises interest rates to stem inflation .
The federal funds rate affects any interest rate you encounter in your life , from mortgages to personal loans to yields on your savings account .
In this example , the Fed is raising rates , so you should lock in a fixed - rate mortgage .
Your payments on an adjustable - rate mortgage would rise along with the fed funds rate .
Unemployment
If growth slows or becomes negative , then you should update your resume because low economic growth leads to layoffs and unemployment .
It may take a few months to see the corresponding job loss because it takes time for executives to compile the layoff list and prepare exit packages , but when economic growth slows , it 's inevitable for many companies .
This delay between economic growth rates and the impact on individual workers makes unemployment a lagging indicator .
Finding Opportunities During Downturns
The BEA offers breakdowns of GDP data that examine specific sectors and products .
You can use these details to determine which sectors of the economy are growing and which are declining .
Even during hard economic times , particular sectors continue to add jobs , such as the health care industry during the 2008 financial crisis .﻿﻿
This report also helps you determine whether you should invest in , say , a tech - specific mutual fund instead of a fund that focuses on agribusiness .
Problems With GDP
The GDP is designed to measure the market value for all products and services within a country 's borders .
Since the measurement hinges on market price , there are many aspects of society — including many aspects that factor into economic well - being — that are n't included in the GDP numbers .﻿﻿
One of the biggest criticisms of GDP it that it does n't count environmental costs .﻿﻿
For example , the price of plastic is low because it does n't include the cost of pollution .
GDP does n't measure how these costs impact the well - being of society .
A more accurate measurement of a country 's standard of living may include environmental conditions .
Another criticism is that GDP does n't include unpaid services .﻿﻿
It leaves out unpaid child care and volunteer work , for example , despite the significant impact they have on the economy and a country 's quality of life .
GDP also does not count the shadow or black economy .
It underestimates economic output in countries where many people receive their income from illegal activities .
These products are n't taxed and do n't show up in government records , and although they can estimate , they cannot accurately measure this output .
One estimate that is referenced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the shadow economy 's size as 8.8 % of the GDP .﻿﻿

rePear is a very useful tool for all iPod users who , for some reason , are not happy about iTunes and want to manage their music files for themselves .
With rePear , you can copy music to the iPod with Explorer , Finder , Konqueror , Nautilus or any other file manager you like ( yes , cp will work , too ;) and have it played back by the iPod with ( almost ) no hassles .
The only thing you have to do is start this litte program just after plugging the iPod into your USB port and before unplugging it .
Please note that rePear is experimental software and may or may not work for you .
You should always create a backup of the / iPod_Control / iTunes directory before trying rePear .
Moreover , I wo n't take any responsibility or liability for any damage caused by the use of rePear .
How it works
rePear scans the whole iPod volume for playable files , retrieving metadata ( e.g. ID3 tags ) from these files , and moving them to a location where the iPod can find them .
The collected metadata and file names are then written to an iTunesDB file , which the iPod requires for proper blayback .
This process is called freezing .
rePear keeps track of the original filenames of the files added to the database .
Thus , it is possible to unfreeze the song database , i.e. move the music files back to the location where they came from ( all inside the iPod 's filesystem , of course ) .
How to use it
For detailed instructions , please refer to the detailed step - by - step manual on the usage page .

Netbooks have been called a " race to the bottom " .
If you were in any doubt that the winner will be the company that manages to make the cheapest , lowest specced machine that will still shift units , then stop .
Your uncertainty will be assuaged , massaged away by Dell 's seductively priced Mini 9n , a $ 250 version of its successful netbook .
What does the " n " stand for ?
" Nothing " , of course .
The 9n has stripped out memory , storage and webcam , resulting in a blind , slow and easy to fill computer , with just 512 Mb of RAM and a 4GB solid state drive .
My MacBook Pro has 4GB of RAM alone .
Still , it is cheap , and if you are into this new - fangled " cloud computing " business , this could be for you .
In fact , the decent keyboard alone might be enough to sell it .
That and its sweet , Mac - beating screen .

I come back from sick leave and there ’s a whole pile of wars in my “ in ” box , like one of those old office cartoons .
Still got to write up the dustup in Gaza , and then there ’s the so - called final victory of the Sri Lankan Army over the LTTE .
But for sentimental reasons I ’ve got to give first mention to my boyeez , the Somali pirates .
This is what democracy looks like : the Somali pirates .
This is what anti-globalization looks like when you do it for real , not like deadheads following the WTO from city to city , banker groupies in black masks and red armbands .
Not only are the Somali pirates doin ’ it for themselves , they ’re like a spotlight on all the most interesting stories out there .
Remember that Ukrainian freighter the pirates grabbed a few months ago ?
That freighter was veeeeeeery quietly carrying 33 Russian tanks and a few thousand AKs , with ammo , to Mombasa in Kenya .
But it was n’t the Kenyans who wanted all those Russian tanks .
It was the Sudan People ’s Liberation Movement , the gang that runs Southern Sudan right now , after using the Darfur distraction to force a ceasefire with those Arab hotheads in Khartoum .
It seems the SPLM , a sensible bunch who ’ve had years of experience in Khartoum treachery , decided that “ the best way to keep peace is to prepare for war . ”
Not that that slogan means anything , actually .
The best way to keep the peace — no such things .
Too many variables .
All those pundit - speak clichés are crap .
You can find counterexamples to all of them .
But knowing the sort of scum who rule Sudan , it just seems sensible to get as many tanks and aircraft as you can .
In third - world vs. third - world wars like the one in Sudan , that sort of mid-price Soviet hardware works perfectly well .
It ’s only when you go up against a first - world AF that it turns into scrap iron .
And we owe all this cool dirt on how the Sudan war ’s going to our friends the Somali pirates .
Nobody would have known that this ship was sending all those tanks to southern Sudan until they grabbed it .
That ’s what I mean when I say these guys are natural stars , born hams , scenery - chewers .
They ’re not in it for the publicity , they ’re strictly about the money , but they just ca n’t help stealing the show .
Like today : they officially handed back that Ukrainian freighter and collected their 3.2 million dollar ransom .
But that was n’t enough : they did it in style .
The pirates zoomed out to the drop zone in their little boats , right in view of two USN warships , collected their loot , counted it — I love that part , that they actually counted out the money , which must ’ve weighed a few kilos , right under the guns of the world ’s most expensive navy — then waved goodbye and zoomed off home , to turn their booty into SUVs , satellite dishes and extra wives .
I hear the price of virgins has zoomed in the most “ pirate - infested ” parts of Puntland since these multimillion dollar ransoms started pouring in .
This is the golden age , in Puntland .
And why should n’t they have their little fun time ?
It ’s not like there ’ve been a lot of golden ages in Puntland .
It ’s kind of hard to feel too sorry for the oil companies , Russian arms dealers , or other sleazy fat cats whose insurance is going up .
Especially when you remember that these pirates used to be fisherman , never bothering anybody , until the Asian trawlers took advantage of the fact that Somalia has no authorities , no government , to scoop every last sand - dab out of the fishing grounds .
If you saw that happen , and all you had left was guns and little boats , and you had to watch the wonderful parade of global commerce going by flipping you the bird for a few years , you might start thinking Jack - Sparrow thoughts your own self .
It ’s too good to last , of course .
When the costs really start biting , we ’ll go in — no use letting the Euros try to do it like we ’re doing now , they do n’t have the will to pull the trigger any more — and we ’ll turn a few boats into floating splinters , and the good times will be over for Puntland .
Too bad , too .
Once the pirates are wiped out or chased back to their little burrows on the coast , people will start missing them and realizing how great they were , what goddamn heroes , actual reallife Robin Hoods they were .
That ’s how we do it in the big world : kill ’em , then make movies about how great they were .
Just ask the Sioux or the Highlanders .
Now Gaza , that ’s not nearly as much fun of a story .
If I was in a mood to gloat , I ’d have to mention that it ended exactly the way I said it would : just before Obama ’s big day like I predicted .
On January 18 .
The IDF declared a ceasefire so the news crews could catch the planes to DC in time to see Jesse Jackson do his crying act again .
I swear , that man does the worst crying on cue since Stallone .
He needs crying lessons .
The lowdown on Gaza is simple : in the short run , Israel did a decent job of killing Hamas ’s cadre .
Gaza ’s a small place , and it was pretty much shooting fish with headscarves in a sandy barrel .
They blew up the place real good , made themselves feel better after getting roughed up by Hezbollah a couple years ago .
OK , so you ’re a Hell of a counterpuncher ; so what ?
Meaning , what happens five years from now when all those dead Hamas guys ’ little brothers are ready to graduate from the rebuilt Gaza I - Hate - the - Jews Academy .
You ca n’t kill some , like this , and hope to do much .
If this was Georgia or some other squeamish middleclass country , then killing a few locals like the Russians did with the Georgians would work .
Which it did ; the Georgians have gone real quiet , real peaceful , since they got that lesson in the dark alley .
But Gaza is n’t Georgia .
Israel spent twenty years driving these people insane , and that was n’t such a hard job in the first place .
You ca n’t stop them by blowing up their shitty slums or killing the eldest brothers in a thousand families .
Those are big families in Gaza ; the guy they elected has 13 kids , and he ’s nothing special in his neighborhood .
All they have is babies and hate .
There was probably a time when the Israelis could have done something that would really work .
Say , after the big win in the Six - Day War in 1967 .
Back then everybody still loved them , so if they ’d decided to expel all the Palestinians , there would n’t have been much blowback .
Or if they ’d gone the other way , bribed the Hell out of the Pals , killed them with kindness .
That might have worked … maybe .
But this , killing a few and driving the rest even crazier in their little prison camp on the beach ; it ’s stupid .
A lot of macho stupidity , short - term gratification and long - term disaster .
What a lot of people do n’t realize about war — and this is war , all of it , the demos and the weeping moms , the whole thing , all ways of making war — what a lot of people do n’t get about war is there comes a time when there ai n’t no smart moves any more .
Say you started playing chess against a master and messed it up so bad after twenty moves that they brought Bobby Fischer back from the dead to take over for you .
He ’d have to resign .
Nobody , not Subotai or Belisarius or Alexander , could save some situations .
And Israel , in the long term…well , they ’ve got those 200 nukes , and the US Congress … and that ’s about all .
They wo n’t get driven into the sea like Arafat used to screech , but they ’ll get meaner and smaller until all the smart people , the ones who can , will get out , and what ’s left will be another scrappy desert fort making deals with the locals .
A lot of Crusader kingdoms went out that way , just one decision away from getting re-absorbed into the Muslim soup .
If they ’d made a deal with the Mongols , maybe we could ’ve done something with this .
But nooooooo , they were too snotty .
Nope , does n’t look good , and worse yet it ’s going to be some ugly maintenance wars , where you have to blast a lot of schools and hospitals , and still do n’t get anywhere .
Like that scene in Fight Club where he bleeds all over the Mafia guy , till the wise guy screams he can use the basement .

Even during Picasso's youthful figurative stages , stark realism was never his forte … — Patricia Corbett , Connoisseur ,
The under - appreciated , indigenous Pakistani tradition of truck painting has an extraordinary history , starting in the days of the Raj .
As early as the 1920 ’s , competing transportation companies would hire craftsmen to adorn their buses in the hopes that these moving canvases would attract more passengers .
The technique worked so well that pretty soon you could n’t purchase a ticket without seeing dozens of beautifully painted trucks waiting to take you to your destination .
While the art does n’t serve the same purpose anymore , it is still as prevalent as ever and has become more intricate and developed a deeper cultural significance over time .
Even though truck art is n’t unique to Pakistan anymore , nowhere else in the world is the practice so pervasive .
In a country where the per capita income is barely north of $ 2,000 , it is surprising to see fleet owners ( the trucks are n’t owner - operated ) spend $ 3,000 - $ 5,000 per truck for structural modifications that convert these gas - guzzling , smoke - spewing , road - dominating monstrosities into beautiful moving canvases covered in poetry , folk tales , and ‘… religious , sentimental and emotional worldviews of the individuals employed in the truck industry , ’ making it one of the biggest forms of representational art in the country .
Unlike vanity plates and ‘ pimp - my - ride ’ style modifications , Pakistani truck art is about cultural history and tradition , storytelling , passion , and sometimes playful one - upsmanship .
As such , every little adornment on the trucks has a special significance .
Jamal Elias breaks down the motifs for truck art into the following 5 categories :
Idealized elements of personal and communal life .
Elements of political and national life .
Talismans , trinkets , and clothing .
Talismans or religious symbols .
Obvious religious symbols and images .
Partly due different ethnic heritage , partly due to the unique stories each tribe has to offer , even within Pakistan , each province has its own distinct style of truck painting .
While Sindh is famous for camel bone work , Balochistan and Peshawari fleet owners prefer wood trimmings , and Rawalpindi and Islamabadi trucks favor plastic work .
The materials , the color , the arrangement , and the overall art style ultimately serves as a cultural representative of the region .
Architect Proposes Human - Powered River Gym in NYC
January 22nd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Just looking at this mock - up of a human - powered river gym makes me seasick , but architect Mitchell Joachim and personal trainer Douglas Joachim ’s design won third place in New York Magazine ’s “ Create a Gym Contest ” .
The gym ’s creators explain , “ Often the average urbanite exercising at the gym performs controlled repetitive single plane movements using industrial fitness equipment .
All of this energy is summarily dissipated and ultimately exhausted for the sake of a single individual ’s wellbeing .
Other potentials exist to harness this vast human expenditure of caloric energy .
Why not have the simple transfer of this workout vigor supply New York with needed supplemental transport and amenities ? ”
Instead of letting all that energy go to waste , the Joachims propose using it to purify water in the Hudson and East Rivers , ease transportation burdens on ferry lines , and carry volunteer commuters .
The brothers have not , however , calculated exactly how much energy exercisers in the river gym could produce .
I ’m guessing that it wo n’t be nearly enough to purify water and transport the vessel .
And then there ’s the issue of customers having to wait for their gym to come to shore — something that harried Manhattanites are not likely to appreciate .

Till Death Do Us
Part is a new free dating site that purports to connect people with terminal illnesses .
I do n't think it 's a joke , but the creator is all about a sense of humor , quoting Robert Anton Wilson on the front page : " Please pardon my levity , I do n't see how to take death seriously .
It seems absurd . "
From the press release :
Till - Death - Do - Us-Part.com is profoundly different from other dating sites .
We 're dealing with people who know they are facing imminent death .
They are aware that their days are numbered and they know , more or less , how long they have to live .
This service does not require members to answer the frivolous questionnaires other dating sites provide , although they can if they want to .
We are not interested , as we are sure our clients are not either , in the inane , trivial and essentially meaningless come-ons and delusional fantasies of finding the perfect mate .
We assume our members do n't care if someone 's eyes are blue or green , whether they wear glasses or not .
According to Marketing Director Joseph DiAngelo , " This site is designed to cut through the superficiality and embrace issues we think are most meaningful — the desire and need for understanding , compassion , empathy and comfort between human beings facing their greatest challenge … "

Linda Pressly
Producer , BBC Radio 4 : Law in Action
Max Mosley - the President of the FIA , the body that governs Formula 1 - is on a mission to fundamentally transform privacy laws in the UK .
Mr Mosley is the son of the late Sir Oswald Mosley the founder of the British Union of Fascists .
Last July , he won a legal action against the News of the World newspaper over claims he took part in an orgy that had Nazi overtones .
The court found no evidence of a Nazi theme , and ruled that his privacy had been breached .
He was awarded £ 60,000 in damages .
I think most people recognise there are some human activities that people prefer to do in private
Max Mosley
His experiences in the High Court have turned him into a champion for privacy law reform and he spoke candidly to Radio 4's Law in Action programme about his campaign .
" I think most people recognise there are some human activities that people prefer to do in private " he says .
" With sex , it would in my opinion be very , very rare that the public have any need - to - know basis for their interest whatsoever . "
Following Mr Mosley 's triumph in the High Court , he is pursuing his case across Europe , and wants to force the UK parliament to introduce privacy legislation that will set out journalists ' responsibilities .
Bad news for journalists
The editor of Private Eye , Ian Hislop , says this is bad news for journalism .
Ian Hislop believes the changes proposed are bad news for the press " The problem with Mosley 's case is he would like to make a general principle out of what happened to him .
" Now what happened to him was the law - as everyone expected - supported him .
He won .
He now wants to change the law and make it more punitive .
" Bad law is always advanced by a case like Mosley 's that seem on the surface to have some merit , and is then extended to people who do n't have any merit , and want to cover up what they are doing . "
Max Mosley believes we have absolutely no right to know about certain types of activity that take place in private - including most sexual activity - unless the activity is relevant to a person 's public work .
" So if we have a transvestite who runs a huge company , and he goes to a little club in the evening with other transvestites and they all do that together , and he does nothing of that in the headquarters of his company , to me that 's irrelevant to his job " reasons Mr Mosley .
" Where it gets more difficult is if somebody puts forward a view which is completely inconsistent with his private behaviour , and which is at the same time relevant to his public persona . "
But Ian Hislop does not accept the principle that an individual 's sex life is off - limits to the press .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" I do n't think we 're yet at the point where we have a Mosley - style consensus that all forms of sexual activity , including paid prostitution , are acceptable behaviour in your private life .
" I think a lot of actions head into a grey area , where they help you assess character in those who are either in public office or who have official duties to perform .
" I think Max Mosley is extrapolating from one messy case into a much more absolute and much more dangerous privacy law . "
Further court action Across Europe Max Mosley is taking criminal cases against journalists who published the News of the World story .
" It 's a matter now for the public prosecutor in Berlin , and a matter for the courts , " he says about the case in Germany .
" But theoretically it 's possible journalists could go to jail .
And in France , it 's theoretically possible the editor and the chief reporter of the News of the World could go to prison . "
LISTEN TO THE PROGRAMME Max Mosley speaks to Law in Action on BBC Radio 4 Listen live on Tuesday , 17 February at 16.00 GMT Subscribe to the podcast or catch up on the BBC iPlayer Apart from the cases Max Mosley is pursuing in individual European countries , he is also taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights .
He is asking the court in Strasbourg to rule on ' prior notification ' .
This would mean that in a case like Mr Mosley 's journalists would be obliged to approach the subject of any investigation ahead of publication , and inform them of the details of any allegations against them .
The person who is the subject of the story would then be able to apply for an injunction to stop publication if a judge ruled the allegations represented an infringement of privacy .
If the European court rules in favour of Mr Mosley , under international law the British government will be obliged to implement the ruling here .
This could mean legislation in parliament and it would represent a seismic shift in the law in the UK , and it is n't one Ian Hislop supports .
Silencing the press A de facto law on privacy already exists as a result of a catalogue of cases including those of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones , Naomi Campbell , and now Max Mosley .
If you want to reveal something that someone does n't want you to , they now no longer claim libel , they just say , this is privacy
Ian Hislop
And Ian Hislop says the law is already preventing publications like his from publishing stories .
" If you want to reveal something that someone does n't want you to , they now no longer claim libel , they just say , this is privacy , and we 'll have an injunction please .
" Then not only will we have the injunction , but we 'll have another injunction that says you can't mention the original injunction .
" And if you try to challenge that , then we 'll appeal and you will never get this story into the public arena . "
Ian Hislop says this happens on a regular basis with the stories he seeks to publish in Private Eye .
" But obviously I can't tell you anything because of this privacy law .
" They get wind of the fact you want to write a story about them because if you put the facts to them - something Mr Mosley 's very keen on , and wants to imprison us all if we do n't - they then say , oh I 'll have an injunction on the grounds of privacy .
" That 's the end of the story . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Responsible journalists invariably put the case to the person they are accusing .
" What I 'm saying is that apart from being the very basic duty of a proper journalist , it should now be a legal obligation , because unfortunately there are journalists who do n't observe this convention .
" At the moment you have a tabloid ' judge ' taking the decision about whether he 's going to ruin someone 's life , and I do n't think he should be allowed to . "

Whistleblower : FBI lawyers knew warrantless wiretaps were ' probably illegal ' Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 15 , 2008
Print This Email This
The former FBI agent who blew the whistle on the Bush administration 's decision to circumvent the law in order to warrantlessly eavesdrop on Americans decided to go to the press after a senior government lawyer tried to steer him away from questioning the " probably illegal " surveillance program .
Newsweek investigative reporter Michael Isikoff profiled Thomas M. Tamm this weekend , revealing the circumstances surrounding the decorated agent 's decision to become a secret source for the New York Times reporters who would reveal the story of the warrantless wiretapping activities .
Tamm uncovered evidence of the extra legal surveillance while working with the Justice Department 's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review , which handled sensitive wiretaps of suspected terrorists , when he discovered that some surveillance seemed to be happening outside the boundaries of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
At one point , Tamm says , he approached Lisa Farabee , a senior counsel in OIPR who reviewed his work , and asked her directly , " Do you know what the program is ? "
According to Tamm , she replied : " Do n't even go there , " and then added , " I assume what they are doing is illegal . "
Tamm says his immediate thought was , " I 'm a law - enforcement officer and I 'm participating in something that is illegal ? "
A few weeks later Tamm bumped into Mark Bradley , the deputy OIPR counsel , who told him the office had run into trouble with Colleen Kollar - Kotelly , the chief judge on the FISA court .
Bradley seemed nervous , Tamm says .
Kollar - Kotelly had raised objections to the special program wiretaps , and " the A.G. - only cases are being shut down , " Bradley told Tamm .
He then added , " This may be [ a time ] the attorney general gets indicted , " according to Tamm .
( Told of Tamm 's account , Justice spokesman Boyd said that Farabee and Bradley " have no comment for your story . " )
Tamm became one of a dozen anonymous sources for Times reporters Eric Lichtblau and James Risen with a phone call to the paper 's newsroom from a payphone in a Washington , DC , subway station in the spring of 2004 .
It was more than a year until their story appeared in the paper .
The whistleblower " grew frustrated " at the delay in publication , Isikoff reports .
Tamm had hoped the story would appear before the 2004 election , but the Times delayed its publication more than a year based on the Bush administration 's arguments that publishing details of the surveillance program would harm national security .
Since the program 's existence has been revealed , the administration has fought every attempt to narrow its scope , although Congress did amend FISA earlier this year with what critics said was a weak law that essentially legalized parts of the program .
Bush 's Justice Department has , however , vigorously pursued Tamm and other suspected leakers .
In August of 2007 , FBI agents raided his home , confiscated his family 's computers and questioned his wife and children , Isikoff reports , and Tamm fears he could be arrested any day .
Isikoff reported on the raid at the time , and there was some contemporaneous speculation that Tamm had been posting Deepthroat - esque comments on liberal blogs like TPMMuckraker , leading to the raid .
In the Tamm profile , which appeared online over the weekend , Isikoff reports that the former agent " began blogging about the Justice Department for liberal Web sites . "
He offered no more specifics .
The Justice Department 's investigation into Tamm and other whistleblowers is expected to continue past Bush 's exit from the White House .
Isikoff notes that President - elect Obama , who was harshly critical of the warrantless surveillance program , could quietly drop the investigation into those who helped bring it to light .

President Bush is , so far as I can recall , associated with exactly one pretzel , lodged in the presidential throat ; President Clinton was known to have a weakness for junk food , but never from anywhere distinguished enough that he made it nationally famous ;
Bush senior ate pork rinds and disdained broccoli , although it later turned out he did n’t and that was just his advisers trying to make him look average - joeish ( “ Pork rinds , ca n’t get enough , ate ’em all the time in Skull & Bones ” ) .
Before that — hard to imagine Nixon , Eisenhower , Hoover as anything but steak and potato guys , though Taft looked like a guy who could down two dozen oysters as prelude to a rack of lamb .
And , of course , Martin Van Buren made a mean huevos rancheros .
But then there ’s Barack Obama , who is rapidly becoming the Calvin Trillin of presidents , to judge by his alleged love for various local Chicago joints , often obscure .
( This despite the fact that he has the physique of a tofu - eatin ’ sprouts - lover . )
His Hyde Park home is supposed to have a 1000 - bottle wine cellar ( no reports on how full it is ) , and his globetrotting childhood could make a Travel Channel show , since he admits in Dreams From My Father to having eaten dog , snake and grasshoppers as a boy in Indonesia .
( Where was the attack ad on that one ?
“ Barack Obama says he wants a dog for his family … but is it to play catch with , or to braise in a burgundy cream sauce ? ” )
He can pronounce “ arugula , ” and “ nuclear ” so it does n’t rhyme with it .
Forget the race barrier … have we elected our first foodie president ?
After seeing “ Obama Eats Here ” T - shirts on the staff at Hyde Park ’s Medici Bakery , I ’ve decided to keep a running tally of Obama - approved foods and food establishments , on the theory that it wo n’t take long for it to be longer than the LTHForum Great Neighborhood Restaurants award list , and to use them plus my Foodar to determine the pressing question of the day : Obama , First Foodie or Mere Expense Account Forkpusher ?
Medici Bakery .
T - shirts say “ Obama Eats Here , ” though no confirmation from press reports or the transition team .
On the foodie side , a wide array of Frenchy baked goods .
On the non -foodie side , when I pronounced “ Levain ” in the French manner ( “ leuhrrvehhnhhh ” ) , they did n’t know what I meant until I finally gave in and said “ Luh - vane , ” like it was the name of the woman who does your perm .
Non-foodie .
Spiaggia .
Chicago ’s priciest Italian restaurant is , at least lately , Obama ’s favorite for date night with the future first lady ; they ’ve been there at least three times this year , for Valentine ’s Day , back in June , and in early November .
Sure , it ’s a great restaurant , but liking Italian is n’t exactly staking out a bold new position away from the other candidates .
If he was eating offal at Riccardo Trattoria or Mado , that ’d be another matter , but lots of high - priced Loop attorneys eat at Spiaggia .
Non-foodie .
Topolobampo .
Alleged to be another longtime favorite , though there are no press reports of them actually going there lately .
Okay , so that makes two restaurants where they choose the more expensive half of a two - part restaurant .
Did I mention that both Obamas have been high - priced Loop attorneys ?
Still , admiring Bayless ’s nuevo Mex is a cut above liking Italian food .
Foodie .
Sepia .
The same article says Michelle likes Sepia these days .
Lots of people do .
Not foodie .
Italian Fiesta Pizzeria .
Kenwood area pizza joint is apparently the Obama ’s go - to delivery pizza place .
Like good Chicagoans , they know that the okay delivery pizza that ’s five minutes away is better than the great delivery pizza that ’s twenty minutes away .
Foodie , because true foodies know when not to insist on foodieism .
Kua ‘ Aina .
Hawaiian burger joint where Pico Iyer of Time ( who did n’t name it , but Serious Eats figured out what it had to be ) had lunch with Obama … and they ate avocado burgers .
( “ Barack Obama says he can relate to the problems of ordinary Americans .
But when he eats a hamburger , he puts an avocado on it .
We ca n’t afford a president who puts something where you ca n’t even tell if it ’s a fruit or a vegetable on his hamburger … ” )
Desecrating an American classic is very non-foodie , except when it works .
I ca n’t see this working if you ’re not already lulled into a persistent vegetative state by being in the tropics .
In the cold gray of a Chicago winter , this would look ridiculous .
Non-foodie .
Manny’s .
You ’re not going to get very far in Chicago politics not eating at Manny ’s Coffee Shop aka deli ; I ’ve never gone there and not seen either a pol I recognized , or someone I recognized had to be a pol ( you can tell , believe me ) .
Obama ’s recent appearance was quite an event .
This is the kind of place that brings out the inner foodie in non-foodies , so foodie .
Macarthur’s .
Soul food cafeteria on the west side is talked about in The Audacity of Hope .
So , Mr. President - Elect , you live near Army & Lou ’s and Cafe Valois , yet you trek all the way over to the west side for your collard greens and smothered pork chops ?
That ’s so totally foodie .
No doubt about it .
Dude ’s a foodie .
We will follow this story as it develops .

So lots of updates from readers ( hey , I did n’t miss Italian Fiesta , and note the reference to Cafe Valois as well ) .
Here ’s what more we know :
Harold ’s Chicken Shack ( as pointed out by its primary chronicler ) .
A very Trillinesque choice .
Totally foodie .
Roy’s .
I suppose it ’s inevitable that someone born in Hawaii ( and yes , my comment about eligibility is a joke , as is my dogmatic anti-avocado stand , though I still would n’t put one of them things on mah burger ) would go for the only upscale Hawaiian in the universe .
Not foodie .
12 Bones , Asheville , NC . :
At 12 Bones , he greeted diners and took ribs , brisket , pulled pork , corn pudding and sweet tea back to his motorcade .
“ That ’s a lot of food .
That ’s not all for me , ” he told staff .
Oh sure .
Not all for me .
Buddy , I been there , do n’t kid a kidder .
Foodie !
Bentoh’s .
Having recently been to Springfield , I wondered if he ’d have a favorite spot .
I do n’t know Bentoh ’s , though .
Judgement pending .
As state senators spent a second frustrating day locked inside the Capitol , Democrats and the governor began closing in on a deal with a GOP holdout that had the potential to resolve California ’s fiscal emergency .
The agreement would involve Sen .
Abel Maldonado of Santa Maria providing the final Republican vote needed to pass a spending plan with billions of dollars in tax hikes in exchange for the Legislature ’s rewriting election rules that Maldonado says are stacked against political moderates like himself .
The deal started to gel after seven votes held throughout the day and into the night .
Each time , the senators came up short of the support to approve the budget package devised by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders .
“ We are trying to decipher whether what Abel wants is workable , ” said Dean Florez of Shafter , the second most senior Democrat in the Senate .
The election law changes , which would undermine the influence of political parties and the special interests that fund them , are unpopular with Democrats .
But they say they are willing to deal .
“ My caucus understands we have to do some things we do n’t like , ” Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) said .

The day had begun with Dennis Hollingsworth of Murrieta elected as the new Republican leader in the state Senate , shortly after a midnight coup unseated Dave Cogdill of Modesto .
Hollingsworth promptly insisted that the three months of negotiations over how to close California ’s nearly $ 42 - billion deficit begin anew and lawmakers abandon the sales , income and gas tax hikes that are part of the fiscal package Cogdill helped negotiate .
“ We should reopen negotiations and we should pass a no - tax budget , ” Hollingsworth said .
“ The majority of the Senate Republican caucus said we want to stand for a no - tax budget . ”
But the coup appeared to have marginalized him and the 10 other GOP senators who have already cast their lot against new taxes .
Democrats and the governor refocused their efforts away from the caucus leadership and on the small group of GOP dissidents who have signaled they are prepared to vote for the package .
Three GOP votes are needed in each house for the two - thirds vote required to pass budgets ; they have already been secured in the Assembly , leaders say .
One more is needed in the Senate .

“ I want to be very clear :
We are not starting over , ” said Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) .
Schwarzenegger agreed , telling reporters at an afternoon news conference : “ We are still one vote short and we ’re going to find that one vote . ”
The Senate convened every few hours , but the debate on the chamber floor was unproductive .
Democrats read letters from constituents beseeching them to pass the budget so state services could resume .
Republicans parried with correspondence from their backers decrying the imposition of higher taxes on already struggling families .
Throughout the day , negotiators stayed focused on Maldonado and GOP Sen .
Dave Cox of Fair Oaks , both of whom had indicated they might be persuaded to cross the aisle and vote with Democrats to pass the budget .
Legislative leaders and Schwarzenegger ’s aides pored over wish lists from both senators .

After lunching on salmon and swordfish with Schwarzenegger at an Italian restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol , Maldonado emerged enthusiastic .
“ The governor is on board with my constitutional amendments , ” Maldonado said , referring to his request that state election law be changed to help moderate politicians such as him and to penalize lawmakers when the state ’s budget is late .
“ If everybody is happy with the drafts , we ’ll have a budget for the state of California , ” he said .
But Democrats said Maldonado ’s call for “ open ” primaries , in which candidates of all parties would compete in the same primary , followed by a runoff of the top two vote - getters , was too significant to be pushed through in a budget deal .
Some also accused Maldonado , who is in his last term in the Senate , of trying to leverage his budget vote to make a future statewide run easier .

“ I ’m not here to worry about Abel ’s political future , ” said Sen. Gloria Romero ( D - Los Angeles ) .
Maldonado denied such a motive .
But many lawmakers in both parties hold safe seats that would become competitive if Maldonado ’s request , which would require a nod from voters , were enacted .
Schwarzenegger has supported the notion , but even if Senate Democrats agreed to put such a measure on the ballot , it might alienate others who have agreed to vote for the budget package .
“ I ’m open to discussion on the merits of the open primary , ” said Sen. Joe Simitian ( D - Palo Alto ) .
“ But I ’m hard - pressed to understand what on earth it has to do with solving the state budget deficit . ”
Sen . Denise Moreno Ducheny ( D - San Diego ) said Maldonado ’s suggestion that legislators ’ pay be docked whenever the state budget was not on time was “ particularly offensive ” and could give wealthy legislators inappropriate leverage in negotiations .
Advertisement
“ You could have rich people telling everyone else , ‘ Vote now if you want to feed your family , ’ ” Ducheny said .
“ I think it ’s unethical . . . to tie your pay to your vote . ”
But the severity of the fiscal crisis has grown so much that Steinberg continued to court Maldonado .
Steinberg met with him Wednesday night , as did Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) and Assembly Republican leader Mike Villines of Clovis .
“ Darrell , the governor and I , we are close ” to a deal , Maldonado said as he rushed between offices .
“ We still have to make some rounds . ”

Negotiations with Cox appeared less promising .
Capitol officials said Schwarzenegger and Democrats have n’t agreed to Cox ’s call to postpone enactment of California ’s landmark law limiting greenhouse - gas emissions .
That law , which won Schwarzenegger international acclaim , is one of the governor ’s proudest achievements .
But many business groups in California complain that it would be expensive to implement .
Democrats also have not budged on other Cox demands : to give employers more leeway in scheduling meal and rest breaks for their workers , and his insistence that legislators reduce some of the $ 14.4 billion in taxes contained in the budget package .
Earlier in the day , Hollingsworth wasted no time trying to capitalize on his new position .
A flier for a $ 1,000 - per- person fundraiser for Hollingsworth scheduled for Wednesday night declared , “ You are cordially invited to a reception in support of the new Senate Republican Leader Dennis Hollingsworth . ”

Timothy Clark , a spokesman for Hollingsworth , said in an e-mail that Hollingsworth had postponed the event and “ is turning all of his energies to leading the Republican Senate caucus through this current budget debate . ”

Letter to president about Binyam Mohamed was blanked out , say campaigners as they prepare for Guantánamo prisoner 's release to UK
US defence officials are preventing Barack Obama from seeing evidence that a former British resident held in Guantánamo Bay has been tortured , the prisoner 's lawyer said last night , as campaigners and the Foreign Office prepared for the man 's release in as little as a week .
Clive Stafford Smith , the director of the legal charity Reprieve , which represents Ethiopian - born Binyam Mohamed , sent Obama evidence of what he called " truly mediaeval " abuse but substantial parts were blanked out so the president could not read it .
In the letter to the president [ PDF ] , Stafford Smith urges him to order the disclosure of the evidence .
Stafford Smith tells
Obama he should be aware of the " bizarre reality " of the situation .
" You , as commander in chief , are being denied access to material that would help prove that crimes have been committed by US personnel .
This decision is being made by the very people who you command . "
It is understood US defence officials might have censored the evidence to protect the president from criminal liability or political embarrassment .
The letter and its blanked - out attachment were disclosed as two high court judges yesterday agreed to reopen the court case in which Mohamed 's lawyers , the Guardian and other media are seeking disclosure of evidence of alleged torture against him .
Mohamed 's lawyers are challenging the judges ' gagging order , claiming that David Miliband , the foreign secretary , changed his evidence .
In a judgment last week , Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones stated repeatedly that Miliband claimed the US had threatened to stop sharing intelligence with the UK if information relating to Mohamed 's alleged torture was disclosed .
Miliband subsequently denied the US had applied such pressure .
The case will be reopened next month .
After a meeting with Mohamed 's US - appointed military lawyer , Lieutenant Colonel Yvonne Bradley , Miliband said yesterday that the US had granted permission for Foreign Office officials to visit Mohamed .
The Foreign Office said the officials would be joined by a Metropolitan police doctor , who would accompany Mohamed back to the UK if he is released .
Stafford Smith said he believed this trip was to check Mohamed was fit to fly after the hunger strike that he has maintained for over a month .
He stressed that no date for his client 's release had been fixed , but " I think we 're talking about a week , I sincerely hope so " .
Millband said the US administration had agreed to treat Mohamed 's case as " a priority " , adding that Britain was working with Washington for " a swift resolution " .
Bradley said later : " We have n't been given any specific date about Mr Mohamed 's release . "
Earlier , she told a press conference that Mohamed 's treatment " would make waterboarding seem like child 's play " .
Bradley and Stafford Smith yesterday met in private with members of the intelligence and security committee , the group of MPs and peers facing mounting criticism in Westminster over claims it failed to effectively scrutinise the activities of MI5 .
Stafford Smith said he told the committee it would have been " absolutely impossible " for it to have cleared MI5 of involvement in the torture of Mohamed had it seen 42 key documents in the case – as he has – that Miliband says cannot be released for reasons of national security .
Bill Delahunt , a senior Democrat congressman and chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee on human rights and oversight , said : " We can not let our governments stonewall ... I take offence at the idea that secrecy is being maintained in order to preserve national security . "
He told the all - party committee on rendition : " The treatment of detainees has done great harm to the security of both our nations . "
Lieutenant Colonel Nigel Wylde , who worked in intelligence in Northern Ireland , told the committee : " The use of torture is utterly counterproductive because it breeds hatred against us and encourages people to become extremists . "
David Davis , a former shadow home secretary , said torture was wrong morally and legally , ineffective and undermined the safety of British people .
" Was the government involved , was it a matter of policy or a matter of freelancing – failure of policy or a failure of control ? "
The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , Edward Davey , said : " Miliband 's bad judgment in blocking the courts from publishing this evidence of torture is being compounded by his refusal to press the new Obama administration to disclose this evidence freely . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Comcast Corp CMCSA.O lost more video subscribers than expected in the fourth quarter due to stiffer competition from phone companies , and said it would not complete its share buyback program this year , pushing its shares down 5 percent .

While the largest U.S. cable operator raised its annual dividend by 8 percent to 27 cents a share , analysts said the increase was conservative relative to a 56 percent rise in Comcast ’s 2008 free cash flow -- a measure of cash generated by its operations after expenses have been paid .
“ The shares are reacting to their capital allocation decision .
We would have favored a return of capital through a share buyback rather than a dividend , ” said Chris Marangi , a portfolio manager at Gabelli & Co , which owns Comcast shares .
Comcast , which had suspended share buybacks last quarter due to the uncertain credit environment , said on Wednesday it would focus its cash on reducing its debt load .
Excluding a $ 600 million writedown of its stake in wireless company Clearwire Corp CLWR .O and other one - time expenses , its quarterly profit was 27 cents a share compared with the average Wall Street estimate of 22 cents , according to a poll by Reuters Estimates .
Net profit fell 32 percent to $ 412 million , or 14 cents a share compared with $ 602 million , or 20 cents a share in the year ago quarter .
Revenue rose 7 percent to $ 8.765 billion during the quarter , beating the average Wall Street forecast of $ 8.63 billion .
“ I think the market may have been bracing for lower customer additions and for results to be disappointing but their financials were better than the market expected , ” said Collins Stewart analyst Thomas Eagan .
The company posted a significant slowdown in subscriber growth due to the recession and competition for customers .
It lost 233,000 basic video subscribers during the quarter , more than the loss of 117,000 expected by Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett .
Comcast added 247,000 digital video customers and 184,000 high speed Internet subscribers but Moffett had been expecting additions of 466,000 digital subscribers and 284,000 Internet subscribers .
Phone subscriber additions , previously the growth engine , totaled 340,000 subscribers , compared with Moffett ’s estimate of 425,000 .
Cable companies have been winning phone customers from companies such as AT&T Inc T.N and Verizon Communications VZ.N.
But Comcast and its peers have started to see the same ' cord cutting ' that the phone companies face as more households drop traditional phone lines for cell phones only .
Comcast met expectations of total average revenue per user which came in at $ 113.80 a month .
Executives at the company have focused in recent quarter of improving this metric rather than chasing market share .
Shares of Comcast fell 5.04 percent to $ 12.24 in morning trading .
“ The declines in gasoline prices have been extremely large , larger than anything we ’ve seen in the past , ” said Dean Maki , chief United States economist at Barclays Capital .

Gasoline prices have dropped to $ 1.66 a gallon from their July peak of $ 4.11 as Americans drove less and the global appetite for oil waned .
Filling up a 15 - gallon tank now costs about $ 25 , compared with $ 60 this summer .
American consumers spent a seasonally adjusted $ 282 billion on gasoline and other motor fuels in November , down from $ 437 billion on an annual basis in July .
Economists have compared the impact of slumping gas prices with a tax cut worth billions of dollars .
“ It ’s a very substantial amount of money that ’s been freed up , ” said Abiel Reinhart , North American economist at JPMorgan Chase .
“ That ’s a definite positive for consumers .
It ’s probably the only positive at this point . ”
Oil prices continued to fall on Wednesday , declining $ 3.63 , to settle at $ 35.35 a barrel in New York trading .
Crude prices are 75 percent below their July highs of more than $ 145 a barrel .
The former head of the Manhattan Republican Party was sentenced to five years ’ probation on felony tax - evasion charges yesterday – but the ex-fund - raiser for Rudy Giuliani is still hoping to cast a vote in November ’s elections .
At a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court , James Ortenzio , 62 , told Justice Laura Ward , “ I acknowledge my mistakes ” before she sentenced him to the probation term .
Ortenzio , who was a key backer and fund - raiser for Giuliani ’s aborted Senate run in 2000 , has admitted “ knowingly and willingly ” lying on his 2004 financial - disclosure statement .
At the sentencing , Ortenzio ’s lawyer asked the judge if his client could apply for a certificate of relief from civil disabilities – a document that allows people convicted of felonies to vote .
Just read Conal Elliott 's draft paper Denotational design with type class morphisms .
I thought the same point was made more succinctly and with more substance in his earlier paper Simply efficient functional reactivity .
Many of us already know what is in the new paper , but it still makes a valuable point .
However , I think it should be a Functional Pearl , and it might work twice as well if it were half as long .
Conal is right to put forward type class morphisms as a design principle .
However , I think he oversells their utility .
In Section 6 , he states that the fact the laws of an applicative functor are satisfied for TMap come ' for free ' , but they are ' free ' only because he assumes you have already verified the same laws for ( -> ) , which is isomorphic to TMap .
The principle of type class morphisms is closely related to a design principle elucidated by John Reynolds in his paper Using Category Theory to Design Implicit Conversions and Generic Operators : implicit conversions between types should be homomorphisms on generic operators ( that is , on overloaded operations defined by both types ) .
I guess the major cultural note here is that it's not * that * bad .
The younger folks have started drinking more cold things .
I 've been trying out new Copic markers !
It makes me feel so warm and fuzzy when I use it .
The nib is so different from my usual Tomboys .
Inking with a rather thick pen , but not a brush pen .
I think I 've pretty much set the texting standard as in the narrative voice is in caps , while the smaller " notes " sort of text is in lower case .
Funny story :
When I was in Beijing to volunteer for the Olympics , our hosts actually : ( A ) got us each a whole pack of bottled water because so many people did n't know how to deal with hot water bottles , and ( B ) made a special arrangement with the dining hall people to allow us to put the bottles in their fridge .
I thought that there is too much white space , but various people said " Just put it up , Sushu " .
How a scholarly hippie got pulled into the orbit of the psychedelic revolutionary whom then - President Nixon labeled “ the most dangerous man in America ”
Lisa Rein conducts the first in - depth interview of Timothy Leary ’s longtime archivist , Michael Horowitz
Interview 1 : December 1969 – November 1970
LR : How did you become Timothy Leary ’s personal archivist ?
MH : I was uniquely suited for the role with my background working with rare books and manuscripts , and my immersion in the psychedelic counterculture , first in New York City and later in San Francisco .
The immediate catalyst was meeting Robert Barker in San Francisco at the tail end of the ‘ 60s .
Bob was a fellow consciousness explorer and an art book collector .
He ’s a Gemini from San Antonio , I ’m a Sagittarius from Brooklyn .
We clicked .
LR : What kinds of projects had you worked on during the Sixties ?
MH : I ’ve worked with rare books since my graduate days in the early ’ 60s , first as an assistant to the curator at the NYU library , then in the book department of an auction house on Madison Avenue .
Privately I scouted first editions on my travels in the U.S. and Europe .
In 1967 I landed in San Francisco and soon after began working at a high - end antiquarian bookshop .
Bob was ferrying people and supplies to Alcatraz during the Native American occupation of the island , while working a straight job .
He was connected to a group of Texas hippies who were influential in the local art and music scene .
What brought us together was our shared passion for book collecting and for mind - altering drugs and their history .
We set up a library in North Beach , the first devoted to that subject –the Fitz Hugh Ludlow Memorial Library .
The library is now at Harvard ’s Houghton Library as part of the Julio Santo Domingo Collection , the largest collection of it ’s kind in the world .
LR : Who was Fitz Hugh Ludlow ?
MH : Ludlow was a proto -hippie from the American Civil War era .
He started experimenting with drugs before college , and published his bestselling first book , The Hasheesh Eater , in 1857 , at age 21 .
MH :
It was the first book on drug experience by an American author and caused a wave of experimentation much as Leary did with LSD a century later .
Ludlow took psychedelic - level doses of hashish paste and cannabis extract .
He came to the West Coast by horse and stagecoach , and took Mark Twain under his wing in San Francisco , probably turning him on to hashish .
He was the epitome of a writer - adventurer , and his innovative methods of curing opium and morphine addiction , during the first American drug epidemic , included using cannabis during withdrawal .
He was praised by Twain , Aleister Crowley and the Beats , yet a pretty obscure figure when we first learned of him through the chance discovery of his most famous book .
We felt a spiritual bond with Fitz Hugh .
Later , when we became involved with Timothy , we realized his Millbook enclave was situated right beside Poughkeepsie , where teenage Ludlow hung out at the local apothecary shop .
LR : How did you and Robert Barker meet ?
MH : I was looking for a ride home from the Altamont Rock Festival .
It was supposed to be our West Coast Woodstock but the violence near the stage where the Rolling Stones were closing out the concert seeped into the consciousness of the huge crowd .
Walking back to the cars parked a few miles away in the darkness , fires burning here and there , made for an apocalyptic setting and a bad re-entry from the LSD many of us had taken in the sunshine when the concert began hours earlier .
I could n’t find the car nor my friends I ’d gone with and was looking around for a ride .
I began to wonder if I ’d be left there with a couple of thousand other equally stoned heads .
Barker saw me and motioned me into his packed VW bug .
After dropping off the other passengers , he and I went to Chinatown for a cheap delicious dinner at Sam Wo .
I invited him to drop by the bookshop where I worked , which he did the following week .
It turns out Tim and Rosemary were also at Altamont .
There ’s a vivid account in Flashbacks , worth reading for the distinction Leary makes between the peacefulness of the 300,000 strong audience and the violence around the stage .
Three months later he was in prison and we were his archivists .
LR : So , it ’s the end of the decade .
Nixon is President and declares a War on Drugs .
The Vietnam War is still going on .
We ’d just put a man on the Moon .
Woodstock had happened that same summer .
Altamont was supposed to be “ Woodstock West , ” but ended up creating a disappointing end to the decade , instead of a hopeful one ?
MH : Yes , the euphoria of the Summer of Love was receding in the face of the government ’s covert offensive .
Altamont mirrored the darkness and paranoia that was escalating with the war , the assassinations , Nixon ’s election , the Manson murders , the increasingly brutal suppression of the anti-war movement , Black uprising and student rebellion .
The Bay Area was ground zero of the struggle but also an outpost of writers , artists and musicians who continued to build on a vibrant underground culture .
Bob and I talked about merging our book collections with a third collector - friend in LA and opening a private library .
We needed a new direction for the new decade .
LR : Who was the LA collector ?
MH : William Dailey , another rare book guy from LA with an eye for fine illustrated French drug books .
Paris is where recreational drug use flourished in the 1840s , and over time the Ludlow Library became a kind of underground salon of aficionados of mild - altering plants and drugs .
We likened ourselves to the members of the Hashish Club who held elegant drug parties in Paris in the 1840s .
The literary and artistic underground had great appeal to us .
All underground movements had their recreational drugs of choice .
LR : What made you decide to start a library of drug - related books and literature ?
MH : Bob ’s vision of a private , drug - focused library was appealing , and he convinced me to give it a shot .
He went ahead and rented a one - room office at the intersection of Columbus and Stockton , and furnished it with a desk , chairs and bookshelves .
To help pay the rent , we sublet space to the Church of the Tree of Life , one of the first psychedelic churches whose sacraments were mostly obscure psychoactive plants not yet declared illegal .
Michael Aldrich , the first Ph.D of cannabis history and folklore and an early marijuana reform activist who marketed the first hemp rolling papers , came aboard as curator a year later .
We embraced a mission to archive the ‘ 60s counterculture with a library - museum .
The books introduced us to other historical countercultures and the drugs of choice that fueled them , and from there to the sacred plants of tribal societies , eventually back to the ancient history and to the myths of pre-recorded history .
Over time we amassed the largest library in the world on the subject , and hosted drug discoverers and scholars like Albert Hofmann , Gordon Wasson , Richard Schultes , Sasha Shulgin and Terence McKenna .
This was the setting the Leary Archives would fit into .
LR : Who came by to use the Ludlow Library ?
MH :
We were just two blocks north of City Lights Bookstore , which was a shrine to us .
Lawrence Ferlinghetti dropped by to welcome us to North Beach .
Our first visitors were Beat poets , underground cartoonists and psychedelic poster artists who donated signed copies of their work .
We also evolved into a museum of contemporary drug paraphernalia , rolling papers and handmade roach clips , pinbacks and all manner of beautiful psychedelic accessories made by local hippie artisans .
Once we had finished shelving the several hundred books , organized by drugs , with separate sections for poetry and fiction , women ’s writings , underground comics and art — anything that was drug - influenced — even official government anti-drug propaganda .
Lurid paperbacks and memoirs of narcotics agents sat together with scholarly works by psychologists and anthropologists , Works by De Quincey and Coleridge , Aldous and Laura Huxley , Burroughs and Ginsberg shared space with R. Crumb comic books and 1890s coca wine posters , Lenny Bruce record albums and movie posters from Reefer Madness and Marihuana : Weed With Roots In Hell to Easy Rider and The Trip .
LR : Do you think that these books about drug experiences allow people to learn from those who have taken the drugs without actually taking the drugs themselves ?
MH : Powerful descriptive writing about personal drug experiences mimics the effects of the drugs themselves .
Reading Aleister Crowley on how hashish aided his meditation , or Mezz Mezzrow on playing in a jazz band on marijuana , or Gordon and Valentina Wasson ’s otherworldly mushroom journey in a curandera ’s hut in Mexico , or Anais Nin describing how LSD turned her body into liquid gold can be mildly psychoactive in itself .
Especially so if you ’d had your own prior experiences .
We also collected books and studied the rituals of the peyote and mushroom cults , the history of the opium wars and laughing gas parties .
We learned that drug literature is endless , and drug - taking was one of the earliest and most common activities of mankind .
LR : OK , let ’s talk about the Leary archives now .
When and how did it happen exactly that Tim ’s archives ended up under your watch ?
MH : A few months after we ’d set up the Ludlow Library , Leary was sentenced to 10 years on federal charges for possession of a half ounce of weed , stemming from the Laredo bust in 1965 .
A week later he was sent back to California to face charges there from another bust In Laguna Beach in 1968 .
MH : Timothy Leary , whom neither of us had met , was sent to the California State Prison in San Luis Obispo for one to ten years for his Laguna Beach bust for two half - smoked joints .
Bail was denied , specifically on the basis of two published articles : ” Deal For Real , ” ( September 1969 ) a defense of psychedelic chemists and distributors , published in the East Village Other ( the leading underground newspaper in NYC ) , and a memoir of his Laredo pot bust , “ Episode & Postscript ( Playboy , Dec. 1969 ) .
LR : So , wait , Tim was in prison in the first place for possession of very small amounts of cannabis ?
And , for political reasons , he was denied bail by a Governor Reagan - influenced Judge ?
And then given an over - reaching sentence , by that same judge ?
MH : Exactly .
Bail was denied by a Reagan - appointed judge in Orange County , one of the most rightwing in California .
The judge held up the publications in the courtroom and during his ruling called Leary “ a pleasure - seeking , irresponsible Madison - Avenue advocate of the free use of LSD and marijuana . ”
“ Pleasure - seeking ” was a generic put - down of both Tim Leary and the hippie culture ; “ Madison Avenue ” simply meant “ successful . ”
Leary was being punished for being the public face of the Psychedelic Movement .
A more devious goal was to keep Leary from challenging the incumbent California governor as a candidate in the fall election .
Imagine Tim on TV debating Ronald Reagan !
LR : Tim ran for governor of California ?
MH : Yes .
He was stoked by the Supreme Count ruling in his favour on the Marijuana Tax Act ( later reversed , but that did n’t faze him — few things did ) .
He knew that attacking the power structure would be at great personal cost and he would lose battles along the way , but any time he saw an opportunity to spark a cultural evolution , why not give it a shot ?
The most radical proposal in his platform was legalizing marijuana and taxing it appropriately .
It was a lot like the model adopted by Colorado and Washington 45 years later .
LR : And John Lennon wrote his campaign song ?
MH : Yes .
John Lennon did compose his campaign song , “ Come Together , Join the Party , ” when Tim and Rosemary joined John and Yoko at the Montreal Bed In to end the war .
After it was clear that Tim ’s felony conviction had knocked him out of the race , John repurposed the song into the Beatles ’ hit , “ Come Together . ”
LR : Where does Holding Together fit in to all this ?
MH : That was the defense committee formed by Tim ’s wife Rosemary , with Joanne Ziprin , whose family sublet the Leary ’s Berkeley Hills home .
LR : Where did the name come from ?
MH :
It came from an I Ching reading she cast with Ken Kesey , the hexagram for “ Holding Together brings good fortune . ”
The event was covered in the Berkeley Barb , which closely followed Tim ’s trials and tribulations during these years .
LR : Tell me about the first Holding Together event ?
MH : Holding Together ’s first benefit event was the Om Orgy held in mid-April at the Family Dog rock venue on the Great Highway in San Francisco .
It was there Bob and I met Rosemary , told her about our psychedelic drug library ( which already included most of Tim ’s publications ) and offered to help .
We were not really sure what we were getting into .
Talk about understatement !
MH : Beat poet Allen Ginsberg , Leary ’s longtime friend and outspoken supporter , spoke at the Om Orgy about Leary ’s imprisonment as a political prisoner , and how it was unconstitutional for him to be held without bail for such a petty offense .
Allen went on to play a huge role in Timothy ’s defense on this issue over the next few years .
Tim had no more eloquent public supporter than Allen throughout his career , although there were occasional periods when they clashed on tactics .
LR : What were your first impressions of Rosemary ?
MH : Her beauty and haute hippie dress style made it impossible not to crush on her .
You could see she was under a lot of stress .
We wanted to do anything we could to help her .
She was somewhat cautious about us .
She herself faced felony charges of up to five years for possession stemming from that Laguna bust , and the Bay Area was crawling with undercover narcs in beards and jeans .
But our sincerity must have been evident , because she invited us to the Leary home in the Berkeley Hills to discuss the archives .
LR : What did Timothy ’s archives look like when you first saw them ?
MH :
By the time we finished talking and sharing a joint of Barker ’s best , she ’d made her decision and walked us behind the house to a detached garage .
Inside stood four or five four - drawer institutional grey metal file cabinets , the paint chipped with spots of rust .
I opened a drawer at random .
It was filled to capacity with neatly arranged and labelled manila file folders .
LR : That must have been very exciting for drug historians like you two .
MH : If here was any doubt about volunteering to take on the Leary archives , it ended in that garage .
The very first thing I pulled out was labelled : “ Nov. 1963 – Huxley . ”
Inside was a carbon copy of a typed letter Laura had sent to their closest friends detailing the circumstances of Aldous ’ death .
It was less than ten years since these events but , to us , it was like the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls .
I started reading it , standing in the chilly garage .
Bob and I were steeped in LSD history , and knew this was the first documented use of LSD during the end of life process .
Aldous Huxley was the toweringly influential figure whose books inaugurated the modern psychedelic age .
Link to the complete Laura Huxley letter .
LR : What else did you see that night ?
MH : Bob opened another drawer that was filled with dozens of mimeographed reports written by the prisoners at Concord Prison after Tim and Ralph Metzner had given them psilocybin in 1961 , with one taking it with the prisoners and the other acting as a guide .
There were letters between Tim and Aldous , Alan Watts , Ginsberg and Kerouac .
Manuscripts , purple ink mimeos and offprints from Harvard and Millbrook .
Invoices for psilocybin , LSD and DMT ordered from labs when those drugs were still legal .
We were like kids in a candy store .
Rosemary practically had to drag us away to continue talking about what to do with the archives .
LR : Had the archives been threatened or harmed in any way ?
Why was Rosemary asking you to take over looking after them ?
MH :
The archives at that point were unharmed and in perfect order .
Tim was a scientist , and felt certain his work — the personality research in the 1950s , and even more , the psychedelic research in the following decade — was of a momentous time in history that was going to change everything .
Like Huxley , he believed that the discovery of LSD was one of the two or three most important events of the 20th century .
The others being the fissioning of the atom and the discovery of DNA , all three happening within a couple of years of each other .
Rosemary had a specific reason for finding responsible people to look after the archives .
If Tim ’s legal appeals were unsuccessful , he was going to attempt an escape .
Of course , nothing was definite that early , and there was no escape plan yet , but Tim knew his archives would be vulnerable ( as well as his archivists ) .
They presented a detailed record of his life ’s work and the much maligned ( but lately resurrected ) Psychedelic Movement .
The FBI did n’t get around to us until much later , when Tim used his archives as a bargaining chip in winning his freedom .
That ’s getting far ahead of the story .
LR : So this meeting was when Tim had been imprisoned , but before he escaped ?
MH : Yes .
He was imprisoned March 20th .
We went to the house and saw the archives the first week of May .
LR : Did you know there was an escape plan ?
MH : Not at all .
They kept us in the dark because total secrecy was obviously needed , and because they wanted to protect us .
They needed someone to take care of his archives and keep them safe from seizure and potential destruction at the hands of the government , as Wilhelm Reich ’s had been in the 1950s .
And he got two archivists to do this .
Bob and I needed each other , and Tim and Rosemary needed both of us .
LR : What happened after you were given the archives ?
MH : After she next visited Tim , Rosemary told us that he was ecstatic to hear about our volunteering , and the fact that we were from the LSD culture and operating a drug library in San Francisco .
He immediately put us on the visiting list .
Bob visited first and came back with instructions to move the library out of the Queens Road house .
We rented a truck and moved the row of file cabinets to the historic Claremont Hotel in the Berkeley Hills .
He told us to contact his lawyers and find out if we could help with the appeal .
They paid for one month at the Claremont for initial research .
After that we moved them to North Beach , where we sequestered them within the Ludlow Library .
We felt they were protected there — but at the time we did n’t know precisely whom we were protecting them from .
LR : What was it like meeting Tim for the first time ?
Had you two ever met before that ?
MH : Challenging in ways I could not have foreseen .
I ’d read his books , gone to his talks and events in New York City , watched him on tv standing up to his hostile detractors in a focused , spirited way .
He was routinely called the devil , a menace to society , the Pied Piper leading the young to their doom .
He always smiled and patiently explained the factual situation to their deaf ears .
He freaked out almost every level of society but had a large and loyal following of mostly young people who shared his vision of a new and enlightened society based on the impact of the new consciousness - expanding chemicals like LSD , along with the shift from an alcohol to a marijuana - based society .
Even in 1970 , with the war , social breakdown and so much paranoia in the counterculture–even in prison , unjustly –he had the same upbeat approach to everything , and the belief that somehow the psychedelic culture would prevail , and the national consciousness would be raised .
But there was a lot going on underneath .
Prison was changing him .
Meanwhile , I was the proud archivist going to meet him .
Archiving for Leary was my niche in the revolution .
It was sort of like reporting for duty .
LR : What did n’t you foresee ?
MH : Something came up from my subconscious at the last minute .
I wanted to take LSD with him .
I just picked a really inappropriate day to do it , visiting him in prison .
LR : You took acid with him in prison ?
MH : Well , that was my plan .
I cut a hit of windowpane LSD into two equal parts , ate half at the airport and placed the other half under my fingernail .
It was so small I ’d knew it ’d be undetectable and I would n’t have to fish around for it when I saw him .
It was a light dose , but not light enough for going into a state prison for the first time in my life .
It hit me as the airport taxi drove through the prison gates and I panicked .
Why the fuck did I do that ?
It took all my concentration to hold back the acid waves that were swarming through my head .
At least half a dozen burly uniformed prison guards looked me over with disdain .
One guard shouted , “ Look at that freak visiting Leary ! ” Everyone ’s head turned .
I ’d toned it down , but still had the wild fro , the peace sign necklace , and the bell bottoms .
At least the shaded eyeglasses hid my dilated pupils .
At the registration desk I struggled with visitor forms , reluctantly giving them my personal information .
The tiny square of green gelatin under the finger of my writing hand felt like it was a glowing radioactive particle as I filled out forms .
The desk clerk was puzzled when I said I was Doctor Leary ’s archivist .
I explained that I was like a secretary who looked after his papers .
After an eternity he shrugged and pointed me toward the first of two iron gates that clanged shut behind me .
After this ordeal I was relieved to see Timothy waving to me from behind a window , flashing the hippie peace sign salute .
LR : Did he realize you were tripping ?
MH : Not at first .
He greeted me with a hug .
With that I could n’t hold back the acid waves any longer .
The vibes reached him .
LR : How did he react , once he knew ?
MH : Not well .
Visiting time was precious .
He had a lot of tasks to lay on me .
Help the lawyers with research for the appeal .
Edit and get his prison writings published — Playboy and Rolling Stone would pay something unlike the underground press , which would publish anything of his .
Messages to Rosemary .
Call Allen Ginsberg .
All that and more .
But I had showed up like a stoned graduate student arriving for a seminar on the evolution of consciousness .
Just as my first visit appeared to be going off the rails , Tim did an about face .
He transformed into that Harvard professor and gave me the crash course in his psychedelic drug theories that he could see I was craving .
LR : What was his rap ?
MH : For Leary and his associates , for Huxley and Watts , it was a given that LSD came into the world at exactly the time it was needed .
Allen Ginsberg provided a proper meme –“ God in a pill . ”
A triumph of technology , appropriate for a pharmaceutical society .
Remember , Albert Hofmann ’s psilocybin pills had won the endorsement of magic mushroom shamaness Maria Sabina .
LR : Where did his theories come from ?
Science , basically .
His training in psychology .
Leary liked to organize information in lists and charts .
For the psychedelic experience he turned to older models like Eastern philosophy .
The Tibetan Book of the Dead .
Ancient occult systems like Tarot , the I Ching , astrology .
And increasingly the science of atomic structure and quantum physics .
He ’d started out a clinical psychologist mapping interpersonal interactions and personality types before he took psilocybin and LSD .
The rap he gave me was a comparative analysis of the levels of consciousness triggered by every class of drug , from heroin to LSD .
Seven levels which expanded to an eight - circuit theory he called “ Neurologic , ” written in another prison three years later .
LR : Did you slip him the acid ?
MH : I was going to drop it in his soda , but when I looked at my fingernail , it was n’t there .
It must have fallen to the floor where it ended up in the janitor ’s mop .
I was n’t the only one who dosed him in prison , or attempted to .
Far from it .
Rosemary and Joanna passed a chunk of hashish directly into his mouth when they greeted him with a kiss .
Everyone assumed he wanted them to bring him LSD .
He did n’t , but they did .
He was the person who popularized the parameters of Set and Setting , so prison failed on the second count .
But I wo n’t attempt to account for the entire 4 - 1/ 2 years he spent in the slammer .
LR : So the LSD you took that day turned out to be the right thing after all ?
MH :
It has a way of doing that , and that day was no exception .
Huxley said when taking it under the right circumstances , it delivers exactly what the person needs , but sometimes even the wrong circumstances will do .
I felt my IQ was permanently boosted that afternoon .
When I got back to my friends in the Bay Area I was buzzing for days , rapping out what I ’d taken in .
Being with Tim was like getting off the local and boarding the express .
Reception - integration - transmission was his model for the yoga of communication .
It was the best class I ’d ever taken , and it happened in a prison visiting room !
After that I was ready to tune in to the more practical stuff .
I began taking notes .
I took notes for the next six years .
LR : What made Leary such an intellectual force ?
MH :
He thought creatively , made instant associations like one does on LSD .
It was a knock that became a cliche that he ’d fried his brain from the large number of trips he ’d taken , but that was actually his training as a psychedelic philosopher .
The foundation was his education as a psychologist .
He was greatly influenced by McLuhan ’s ideas about living in an age of transformative electronic technologies .
His conversations were often about adapting to the chaos of reality .
His creative style of thinking kept him from succumbing to the paranoia of being a caged prisoner , and later a hunted outlaw , and also produced a body of work in a variety of media over a lifetime .
LR : It sounds like Tim was getting fed up with the harassment of him and his family ?
MH : He was shocked and angered that his bail had been denied even while appealing his case on important first amendment issues , and that his wife and son were also convicted of drug crimes .
In prison he had time to obsess over his draconian sentences :
Ten years for a half ounce of pot ( a set up at the Texas - Mexico border ) , another dime for 2 roaches in the ashtray ( planted ) , up to eight more because visitors to his Millbrook enclave had been seen lighting up by Deputy Sheriff Gordon Liddy in the surrounding woods through binoculars .
He knew he ’d pushed the envelope , but he felt he played within the rules–never publicly advocating everyone use marijuana or LSD , just writing and speaking enthusiastically of its pleasures and potentials .
He did advocate a drug moratorium for a year and testified before Congress how best to deal with what they called a drug crisis which was more a law enforcement opportunity .
He ’d incorporated the League for Spiritual Discovery as a religious entity so members could use LSD as their sacrament , fought and won a Supreme Court marijuana case , published four books and 40 scientific papers on psychedelic drugs .
LR : So desperate times required desperate measures ?
And really , they were n’t playing by the rules anymore , by keeping him imprisoned for such a minor drug offense .
MH :
The government strategy was to shut down the psychedelic movement and its large role in the youth rebellion and anti-war movement by making an example of him .
Plus I think it really bothered them that he did n’t play the remorse card .
They could n’t shut him up and now he was running for governor of California !
He was a 49 - year - old political prisoner facing what amounted to life in prison , burdened with legal debts and cut off from his means of livelihood .
Bob and I were even selling his 1950s personality tests to educational and military institutions .
Like Lenny Bruce , he wanted to win on first amendment legal grounds .
He had three sets of lawyers fighting his federal , California and NY State cases , but those were dragging on .
For all that , the separation from Rosemary was the heaviest blow .
LR : What was the practical stuff you did for him ?
MH : Bob and I were bringing manuscripts in and out of prison under the guise of legal briefs .
After a while the authorities let us pass
It was a minimum security prison and he was something of a celebrity .
Huey Newton was being held at the same time in the medium security East Wing .
We spent the summer of 1970 splitting our time between buying books , soliciting donations for the Ludlow Library , and researching Tim ’s archives for the lawyers , editing his manuscripts with him , sending them out to magazine editors .
Tim was writing all the time .
Daily love letters to Rosemary .
A journal of his life in prison , including how he adverted a violent fight between prisoners .
Fiction , too : A fantasy about the Woodstock generation turning on the leaders in the White House .
Some of it was published in the book Jail Notes .
His most consuming text was his personal appeal brief directed to Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas , whom he thought would be the most sympathetic to his plight , in which he compared himself and his family to American eagles in captivity .
It was a legal brief in the form of a poem .
LR : What were his lawyers ’ strategy ?
MH : First of all , getting him out on bail on a writ of Habeas Corpus .
Then an appeal of the draconian terms of a sentence of up to ten years for possession of .025 grams of cannabis .
When bail was repeatedly denied , escape loomed as an option .
LR : Who represented him ?
MH : Michael Kennedy & Joe Rhine , whose offices were in a “ painted lady ” Victorian house in San Francisco , very stylish inside and out .
They were important figures in the network of radical left defense attorneys who included Charles Garry , William Kunstler and Gerald Lefcourt .
There were Bay Area attorneys like the Hallinans , Tony Serra and Michael Metzger who handled the higher profile dope cases .
Kennedy & Rhine worked on the Yippie conspiracy case in Chicago , the Black Panther Party cases in Oakland , won an acquittal for Los Siete de la Raza .
In their eyes Leary was a classic political prisoner with an unusual drug angle — he had started a religion .
His published writings and talks were cited in the courtroom .
First amendment issues everywhere .
Michael Kennedy was bold enough to consider all options of getting him out .
This copy ( above ) was revised in Switzerland the following year , with Tim ’s Algerian name ( Nino Baraka ) printed in and his typed note on the bottom : “ Since it is forbidden to send creative works about prison life from prison , this poem was typed as a legal brief ( which is protected from censorship ) . ”
LR : How did you feel when you first found out about the breakout ?
Did you really have NO IDEA that that was in the works ?
MH : We had no clue about such a plan .
Nobody thought that could possibly be in Tim ’s playbook .
People like him were not expected to try to escape from prison , let alone succeed .
But then , US citizens were n’t expected to be sentenced to ten years and have their bail denied , either , because of their writings and talks .
LR : Sounds like being Leary ’s archivists was consuming your lives .
MH : You could say that .
We kept it quiet except to our closest friends .
The library was a good cover for us .
Some idiot published it in one of the underground papers but our having the Leary archives was generally not known .
LR : How did you find out that Tim escaped ?
It was an early Sunday morning and I was asleep in my Berkeley pad .
Barker knocked loudly and woke me up .
He had driven over from his place in North Beach .
He was giddy with excitement as he told me that Tim had escaped the previous night .
Different feelings surged through me .
Shock to begin with .
Exhilaration that he was free .
Disappointment that our trip with him was over .
LR : But it was n’t .
MH : It was just the end of Act One .
Right then Bob laid on me what he ’d been thinking about on the drive over .
We ’d better expect the police .
Maybe the FBI .
We were exposed from our prison visits .
We had possession of his archives .
Oh , and Rosemary was unreachable .
Exhilaration gave way to paranoia as Bob continued to catch me up .
An old con , now on the outside , whom Tim had known in prison had been roughed up by federal agents earlier that morning .
After they left he phoned Bob to say they might be headed here .
If I had any dope in the house , I ’d better do something about it .
I grabbed the little stash box with my precious tabs of orange sunshine and chunk of Nepalese temple ball and , after looking for any suspicious parked car , ducked under the wood frame cottage and chose a spot to bury it in the dirt .
That done , Bob drove us to breakfast .
I stayed away from the house the rest of the day .
We drove out to Golden Gate Park and saw Creedence Clearwater Revival at the Carousel Ballroom in the evening .
LR : Did you expect the FBI would come for the archives ?
MH : That was one of our fears — which spiked from time to time until they did come for them five years later .
We did expect to be picked up for questioning .
That did n’t happen either .
We were not in their sights at that time .
Like everyone else in the counterculture , we waited to see what would happen next .
LR : How did the counterculture react to news of Tim ’s escape ?
MH : People were stunned — and jubilant .
The underground press covered it with banner headlines .
“ Proud Eagle Flies Free . ”
They printed full - page “ Welcome Tim Leary ” signs that people put on their front doors and in windows .
It was a bright flash in a dark year .
Violence in the streets and campuses .
Days of Rage in Chicago .
Convictions of the Chicago 8 . Murders of Black Panthers .
Kent State .
Manson trial .
Fatal OD ’s of Janis and Jimi the same month as the escape .
At least Tim was free !
A Harvard professor , a peaceful man , had successfully busted out of prison .
Peoples ’ minds were blown .
LR : And the Weather Underground made it happen ?
MH : It was a phenomenal coup for them .
They were starting to become a serious force and that act elevated them within the hippie culture .
Breaking Tim out and spiriting him and Rosemary out of the country was a wedding of the psychedelic subculture and the revolutionary left .
MH :
The symbolism of the escape could not be ignored , especially after the Weather Underground publicly claimed credit , while rumors floated up that the LSD orange sunshine makers and global distributors , the Brotherhood of Eternal Love–for whom Tim Leary was a kind of guru–had financed the operation .
His high - powered San Francisco lawyer Michael Kennedy confirmed the escape with a lot of fanfare .
LR : How on earth was he able to have typed up an escape note ?
MH : California Men ’s Colony
West was a minimum security prison and he had access to a typewriter .
It was just like him to write such a note , evoking Socrates and urging the prison guards to follow him to freedom .
The next letter , sent to the Berkeley Barb , when he was underground with the Weathermen , was much more militant .
He talked of waging revolutionary war against a genocidal government , of being armed and dangerous .
That sounded like it came from Weather , but Tim enthusiastically adopted the rhetoric of those who had freed him .
That they were middle class recent college grads made it even better .
It sparked a serious debate in the counterculture .
It was a radically different Timothy Leary for most people .
It got more polarized with his “ Shoot to Live ” statement .
He later softened that to “ Aim for Life , ” but by that time Allen Ginsberg , Ken Kesey and the followers of Eastern teachers were challenging his rhetoric in the press .
LR : How were you holding up with all this stuff going on ?
MH : Well , I remember walking past a newspaper kiosk in downtown San Francisco a month after the escape and seeing a bold black headline on the front page of the latest Berkeley Barb– “ Smoke It and Blow it Up ! ”
Smoke pot and make bombs .
It was another “ What the Fuck ? ” moment .
I had more than a few of those during those years .
Both he and Rosemary put their names to that .
It was not their style , but prison did that to him .
It was another over - the - top “ thank you ” to the Weather Underground , adopting their rhetoric .
The Learys were not violent , but he was a philosophical bomb - thrower for sure .
LR : So you went back to your life ?
MH : For the most part .
We did n’t hear from them directly , but from reports in the underground press we learned that Tim and Rosemary had landed in Algiers , under the protection of the now International Black Panther Party .
Expecting to hear from them , we rented a PO Box in Berkeley under the name Bodhisattva .
LR : Why Bodhisattva ?
MH :
We thought the word would give us suitable cover since it would be unfamiliar to anyone surveilling us .
It did not suggest revolutionary politics , except ironically .
It suggested , partly in jest , that when the dust settled sometime in the next century , that Timothy Leary might just be so regarded as an American bodhisattva .
Allen Ginsberg loved the name and reflected on Kerouac ’s use of it as a play on “ bohemian ” and “ hobo . ”
Timothy ’s longtime colleague and pal , Ram Dass ( Richard Alpert ) , was the bodhisattva of the two .
Tim was happiest being MVP — ” Most Valuable Philosopher . ”
LR : How long before you heard from the Exiles ?
MH :
The first letter arrived about six weeks after the escape .
Additions in [ brackets ] are for historical clarification .
Room 19
Hotel Mediterranee
El Djamila
Alger , Algeria
Nov. 4 , 1970
Beloved Friends …
Fast pace … moving moving … high energy tradewinds … playing complex game with Eldridge [ Cleaver ] guiding us around Middle East .
At present nicely settled working on Jail Notes … hoping for Jan 1st finish .
We hope that the last two months have not been confusing to you .
One thing must be remembered … AMERIKAN ATMOSPHERE IS SO POLLUTED WITH NIXON POLICE FOG…
It is hard to realize how heavy the bar - o - metric pressure is and how it pulls you down into Nixon thinking …
From here you realize that the freedom brotherhood is international … global … you see the complete total insanity of Amerika …how the system scares and frightens and co-opts .
During seven months in prison the only voices which made any sense to us were Huey [ Newton ] and Bobby [ Seale ] and Leila Khalid [ Palestinian airplane hijacker ] and the Weathermen .
We were puzzled by the Kesey note you sent .
Poor Ken .
That dreary old Calvinist death - wish … .
Would he drop acid and wander down to the ghetto office of the Panther Self Defense and talk about “ nuts with guns ” ?
[ Kesey had written , “ We do n't need another nut with a gun ” in response to Leary 's “ shoot to live / aim for life ” statement in an exchange the two had in the underground press . ]
We are passing through the cycle of Seven Revolutions : the Seventh is the Life - Death Passage ( Sundance , etc. ) in which you face death , spin the wheel and choose Life .
It helps to have a network of loving fearless friends who will face death with you .
Rosemary did .
Jeff Jones and Bernadine [ Dohrn ] did … Eldridge and Huey and Jonathan Jackson did .
It ’s a fascinating society of re-incarnates .
It ’s an old mythic game .
And it does produce New Life .
It ’s complex ( in that it has to be experienced ) and yet simple .
I have suggested to Mike S [ Standard , Leary 's NY attorney ] that he be available to you for legal and contractual help in publishing any of the materials we discussed : sale of archives , Psychology of Pleasure , Festschrift , Anthology , collected works , picture books , reprints of [ Psychedelic ]
Reader , [ Psychedelic ]
Prayers , Politics [ of Ecstasy ] , [ High ] Priest , Interpersonal Diagnosis [ of Personality ] , etc… .
We know that a lot of pressure has been placed on you both from without and from within .
Let us know how it looks to you and we ’ll respond as honestly and eloquently as we can .
We do thank you dear brothers for your help and love .
We are sorry that we had to keep you in the dark about the escape … but you will understand our decision was based in great measure on our desire to protect you .
From the vantage point of the Third World one gets an amazed sense of wonder at the American and European white middle class fearfully protecting its privilege .
We long to hear from you and to start moving energy behind our beautiful flower plans .
Thanks , love , write us , stay high , stay free .
( signed ) Tim and Ro
Coming next : Part 2 : Algeria !
Scientists are planning this week to start a highly controversial experiment in changing the composition of the oceans , in apparent contravention of international law .
The experiment – to be conducted in the Southern Ocean – aims to create a bloom of plankton so big that it will be visible from outer space .
But , at the last minute , the scheme has sailed into an international storm as environmentalists have called for it to be abandoned .
The researchers – mainly from Germany and India , but including two Britons – plan to add some 20 tons of iron sulphate to a 186 - square - mile patch of ocean about half way between Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope , to demonstrate a way both of combating global warming and of saving the whale .
As the waters are short of iron , this is expected to lead to an explosive growth of plankton , which will take up carbon dioxide from the air .
The scientists hope that , when the plankton die and their bodies sink deep into the ocean , they will take the carbon with them , keeping it out of the atmosphere for centuries .
Applied on a large enough scale , they believe this could help stave off climate change , while increasing food for whales .
Commercial firms have already announced plans to make money from such schemes .

But other scientists are deeply concerned that the practice could have devastating unintended effects on the oceans , including killing off large areas of sea , and releasing methane and nitrous oxide , which are even more potent causes of global warming .
They also fear that the plankton could absorb sunlight , heating up surface waters and hastening climate change .
Last May the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity banned the practice , allowing exceptions only for " small - scale scientific research studies within coastal waters " .
Nevertheless , the expedition – jointly organised by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven and the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa , India – set off this month .
Alarmed environmentalists , led by the Canada - based ETC Group , urged Germany 's Environment Minister , Sigmar Gabriel , to stop the experiment .
The German government suspended it while legal and environmental reviews were carried out , and the scientists expect to hear the result early this week .
Dr Richard Lampitt of the University of Southampton 's National Oceanography Centre , which has two scientists on board , says : " We desperately need to make this sort of experiment if we are going to make rational decisions in the future . "
The Alfred Wegener Institute accuses objectors of " indulging in disruptive activities merely to draw attention to themselves " .
This social stuff is , like , tend to be part of an anti-drug - using campaign .
Let ’s take a closer look on what this all about …
“ How it all begins : Some rich folks having plenty of vodka and meats start mixing vodka and probably some drugs – see one man is holding glass and another is giving his hand for a shot to the lady .
Remember this lady , we ’ll meet her one more time later .

Mon 5 Jan
Told by corpsman nurse my ideal weight was 168lbs .
Thu 8 Jan About 15:30 FCE [ Force Cell Extraction ] of brother , and his beating up and move to hospital for facial injury and broken wrist .
[ Prisoner was Ahmed Abdul Aziz from other unclassified source . ]
Fri 9 Jan
After days of request for medical to take interest in the hunger strikes since 5 Jan , a physician Capt came and asked why we were on hunger strike .
Cell and locker search – two papers taken , my Nov & Dec pray schedules .
Shower rule changed .
Mon 12 Jan Habeas envelopes or papers are being taken away for a period of 5 days cause they are being used to cover the strong lights and the AC vent due to the cold .
Tue 13 Jan
At about 10:00 , woke up from sleep and shortly after fell .
Was taken to the med room and after a vital test given 2 bags of IV ( saline solution ) , the physician came and said to me that I would be tube - fed if I continue missing meals , after taking more vitals she said that I was dizzy and dehydrated and my sugar level was low ( 68 ) so she said could not await the SJA [ Staff Judge Advocate – a government lawyer ] to resolve my issue and may have to tube - feed me for today and she was putting me on the list of those to be tube - fed .
She was going to tell her higher - ups to start tube - feeding .
I was given another bag of IV total ( 3 bags ) then I was ready to get back to my cell but as I got up I felt faint so I was left for another 10 min and another vital was taken .
My temp was 94 and when it got to 95 I was returned back to my cell .
Wed 14 Jan Weighed at 13:30 and weight was 127 without shackles I had weighed 124 with shackles on .
At about 14:45 , the physician Capt was on the block talking to the brother whose food was sorted so I asked to speak to her so she came and I told her about my swelling knees and that the IV went to my body and it was a sign of trouble .
She told me that I was on the list for tube - feeding and it was n't long before they did it ...
I told her to delay the tube for as long as she could but she said once the decision is taken to tube - feed meshe would .
At about 16:15 I was taken to tube - feeding without warning I was strapped to a chair and moved from block to block and tube - fed there for about 20 min .
They weighed me at 129 with shackles after tube - feeding ...
Fri 16 Jan Tube at 08:00 to 10:00 .
One of the brothers on tube was FCE 'd because of the tea issue .
The nurse said that no cafine [ sic ] so they are talking to the SMO ( senior medical officer ) who 's talking to the admin to allow us to get coffee and tea .
SMO still refuse to give me lactalose [ sic ] though I am constipated .
Weighed at about 14:00 – 127 without shackles – feeding from 16:10 - 16:45 about 25 min feeding very quick today .
Sat 17 Jan 06:00 according to norm calculations I should be between – 168 to 186 pounds .
I was below my norm weight by at least 40 pounds , 121 pounds , before they considered me for tube feeding .
I am at zero fat at 130 pounds let alone 121 .
At 6.0294 feet = 1.87 metres the ideal weight should be between 168 - 188 pounds depending on bone structure .
I am considered light bone build .

09:00 went for tube feeding .
weighed in at 128.5 with shackles ( 2.8 ) = 125.7 without shackles ...
16:30 feeding and given another lactalose [ sic ] , blood withdrawn & told I had to sit on the chair until 18:30 ( 2 hrs ) .
After a heated argument I was taken back to my cell at 17:43 prayer time 17:42 they had refused me the right to pray but I told them if I do n't get to pray then they can get the FCE team .
Sun 18 Jan 01:00 woke up in the middle of the night with pain in my stomach constipated ... my stomach was bloated and had difficulty sleeping .
06:00 Took an apple to help me with my stomach problem .
was given coffee and I asked the AOIC ( Administrative Officer In Charge ) to talk with him about prayer issue .
Weight 127.9lbs with shackles
Mon 19 Jan 05:30 another sleepless night .
At 09:00 taken to feed .
spoke to AOIC about why I had to stay strapped for 2 hours after feeding and why 6 - point strap if I am coming out compliant .
I had to use the toilet and was almost urinating on myself because I had to stay until 11:00
Wed 21 Jan 10:00 : I took shower and was refused soap .
When I asked why I was told I was on a soap loss .
Thu 22 Jan on Tue 20th a brother told me that in the British media it was reported that I was expected home soon .
Another brother told the same news about me on Wed .
At about 12:00 I was put on dis ( discipline or disciplinary ) one .
I do n't know why and I have n't asked .
There is about 5 - 6 brothers on soap loss .
Fri 23 Jan
At 08:35
I was taken for feeding weight lb = 127.1 with shackles , 124.3 without .
One of the brothers was FCE'd to the chair and they could not feed him as they could not stick the tube down his nose .
Reason was because they disciplined the hunger strikers for peaceful hunger strike .
I saw C7 & told him that the OIC [ officer in command ] said no more discipline except if you did something .
After checking he came back and said I was correct .
I was returned back to my cell and I found my stuff being taken then returned and they brought me orange linen .
At 16:00 taken for feeding , there was a Capt Navy watching us tube - fed .
The watch commander of dayshift said to me that FCE means we beat you up because you are not complying .
The brother who was FCE'd in the morning was complaining about being hit in his chest and knees .
We waited until night shift w/c came and we told him to write a report ...
13:00 Moved cells .
The room I was put in had spots of feces [ sic ] on the light and the walls ...
At 19:35 we was moved back from as they had finished extermination .
Sun 25 Jan at 08:25 taken for feeding .
Vitals = 86/52 , heart 62 told that the doctors says my blood pressure is fine through low .
Weighed 129.4 with shackles ...
Mon 26 Jan
I told the AOIC about the shower issue and explained to him about the privacy we needed while taking showers he said he would talk to his people to stop harassing us while we were in the showers as long as they could see our heads and necks ...
The brother FCE'd a few day [s ] ago showed me the scar on his chest .
At 18:35 dinner , I took dessert , salad , apple , dates , the guard were now passing extras .
Wed 28 Jan
This morning at feeding the nurse put the tube in my lungs and after an air check she had to pull the tube out & try again .
When the second time worked I told her she had stuck the tube in my lungs she said it usually happens and that ['s ] why they do an air check .
I told the AOIC who was watching the incident about it and all he could say was everything was fine now .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer announced today that the new and improved Windows 7 will be made available for netbooks , those tiny laptops currently out - selling conventional PCs .
With the current economic crunch , consumers are cutting down on purchases of more expensive notebooks and desktops .
Ballmer and the rest of the Microsoft family are feeling the strain , since PCs account for one of the largest markets for Windows software .
Ballmer has apparently taken note of the surge in netbook popularity and plans to release a full ( if somewhat " lighter " ) version of Windows 7 that will be able to run on the smaller computers .
( Source : networkworld.com )
Returned Linux Netbooks Fuel Win7 Need
Ballmer claims to have noted the importance of the netbook market as early as two years ago , when the mini-PCs were first introduced .
Initially many netbooks were distributed with Linux , the open - source operating system that has been touted as a substantial source of competition for Windows .
However , the rate of return on Linux - based netbooks was high enough to induce some excitement at Microsoft .
( Source : uselog.com )
Today , a majority of netbooks are running a lighter version of Windows XP , which will provide an easy platform for upgrades to the highly anticipated Windows 7 when it is released in the next year or so .
Ballmer hopes to maintain Windows ' dominance in the growing netbook market , despite the fact that the per-netbook revenue Microsoft earns is less than that for conventional PCs .
Because the netbook is smaller and has less memory than a larger PC , this emerging market will provide a number of opportunities for Microsoft .
Creating a " lighter " version of Windows 7 that will be suitable for netbooks will allow Microsoft a greater degree of interoperability , since a lighter operating system has more potential for adaptability with other devices such as phones or personal data storage devices .
( Source : informationweek.com )
Since Ballmer predicts that Google - based products will provide strong competition for Microsoft in the months ahead , greater interoperability potential for Windows 7 could give MS the advantage it needs to reclaim its dwindling market shares .

Sarah Palin was on Fox News ‘s On The Record With Greta Van Susteren , where she voiced her opposition to the Obama stimulus bill because Congress did n’t know what was in it , and it would add people to the rolls .
The problem is that no one , including Gov. Palin seems to know what she is talking about .
Palin said , “ I wish he would veto it and send it back until our lawmakers can read it and know what ’s in it .
I think I speak for a lot of Alaskans who say also understanding that the impacts on individual states that this stimulus package has , they are unknown impacts .
So until our guy and our gals in Congress can read it and understand what the impacts are , I do n’t want to see it signed . ”
Host Greta Van Susteren asked Palin if she thought that Obama should veto it , “ I would call for a veto , absolutely , and let ’s do this right , understanding that there is going to be some kind of stimulus package .
There is going to be some kind of attempts for economic recovery .
I say construction projects that put people to work , that fits the bill , but these big huge expanded social programs where we are adding people to the rolls , and then the economic stimulus package dollars from the feds are going to dry up at some point .
States then are going to be beholden to these programs .
We will have to pay for them .
That ’s not right , that ’s not fair .
We just want to make sure that whatever is it is that is passed makes sense for the states , for the residents of our individual states . ”
Advertisements
When Palin came out against adding people to the rolls , does this mean that she is against expanding unemployment benefits , and food stamps ?
Is she against expanding the SCHIP program to provide more children with health insurance ?
Maybe , she is against increasing Pell Grants ?
The only programs that will be adding people to the rolls are food stamps , unemployment , and SCHIP .
The Medicaid expansion was removed from the bill .
Frankly , I do n’t buy the excuse that the members of Congress do n’t know what is in the bill .
This bill had been going through the ringer for a couple of weeks before it was passed .
There was plenty of time to review the bill .
Also , Palin was completely wrong about federal stimulus dollars drying up and states having to pick up the tab .
States are dying to get this money , because it will help fund already existing joint federal - state program .
The stimulus bill does n’t create a single new program that the states have to pay for .
There are two reasons why Sarah Palin would hate this bill .
First , she wants to run against this bill in the 2012 election .
Her sloppy and inaccurate attempt at framing the stimulus as an unfunded mandate is a preview of her line of attack .
Secondly , anything that promotes green energy is bad for her state of Alaska .
The Alaskan economy is dependent on oil , which means that if the America goes green , Alaska will be hurting .
I sincerely believe that Sarah Palin has absolutely no idea what she is talking about .
She views every issue through a narrow ideological prism .
Her opposition to the stimulus bill boils down to her ideological belief that people should not be added to the rolls .
Thank you very much , President Hoover .
Palin is the female George W. Bush .
She does n’t have a good reason for opposing the stimulus bill .
She just knows that she should , and this is the reason why Sarah Palin poses no threat to Barack Obama in 2012 .
She is a sideshow , not a leader or a visionary .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A study of college freshmen in the United States and in China found that Chinese students know more science facts than their American counterparts -- but both groups are nearly identical when it comes to their ability to do scientific reasoning .
Neither group is especially skilled at reasoning , however , and the study suggests that educators must go beyond teaching science facts if they hope to boost students ' reasoning ability .
Researchers tested nearly 6,000 students majoring in science and engineering at seven universities -- four in the United States and three in China .
Chinese students greatly outperformed American students on factual knowledge of physics -- averaging 90 percent on one test , versus the American students ' 50 percent , for example .
But in a test of science reasoning , both groups averaged around 75 percent -- not a very high score , especially for students hoping to major in science or engineering .
The research appears in the January 30 , 2009 issue of the journal Science .
Lei Bao , associate professor of physics at Ohio State University and lead author of the study , said that the finding defies conventional wisdom , which holds that teaching science facts will improve students ' reasoning ability .
" Our study shows that , contrary to what many people would expect , even when students are rigorously taught the facts , they do n't necessarily develop the reasoning skills they need to succeed , " Bao said .
" Because students need both knowledge and reasoning , we need to explore teaching methods that target both . "
Bao directs Ohio State 's Physics Education Research Group , which is developing new strategies for teaching science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) disciplines .
For this study , he and his colleagues across the United States and in China decided to compare students from both countries , because the educational systems are so different .
In the United States , only one - third of students take a year - long physics course before they graduate from high school .
The rest only study physics within general science courses .
Curricula vary widely from school to school , and students can choose among elective courses .
In China , however , every student in every school follows exactly the same curriculum , which includes five years of continuous physics classes from grades 8 through 12 .
All students must perform well on a national exam if they hope to enter college , and the exam contains advanced physics problems .
" Each system has its strengths and weaknesses , " Bao said .
" In China , schools emphasize a very extensive learning of STEM content knowledge , while in the United States , science courses are more flexible , with simpler content but with a high emphasis on scientific methods .
We need to think of a new strategy , perhaps one that blends the best of both worlds . "
The students who participated in the study were all incoming freshmen who had just enrolled in a calculus - based introductory physics course .
They took three multiple - choice tests : two which tested knowledge of physics concepts , and one which tested scientific reasoning .
The first test , the Force Concept Inventory , measures students ' basic knowledge of mechanics -- the action of forces on objects .
Most Chinese students scored close to 90 percent , while the American scores varied widely from 25 - 75 percent , with an average of 50 .
The second test , the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment , measures students ' understanding of electric forces , circuits , and magnetism , which are often considered to be more abstract concepts and more difficult to learn than mechanics .
Here Chinese students averaged close to 70 percent while American students averaged around 25 percent -- a little better than if they had simply picked their multiple - choice answers randomly .
The third test , the Lawson Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning , measures science skills beyond the facts .
Students are asked to evaluate scientific hypotheses , and reason out solutions using skills such as proportional reasoning , control of variables , probability reasoning , correlation reasoning , and hypothetical - deductive reasoning .
Both American and Chinese students averaged a 75 percent score .
Bao explained that STEM students need to excel at scientific reasoning in order to handle open - ended real - world tasks in their future careers in science and engineering .
Ohio State graduate student and study co-author Jing Han echoed that sentiment .
" To do my own research , I need to be able to plan what I 'm going to investigate and how to do it .
I can't just ask my professor or look up the answer in a book , " she said .
" These skills are especially important today , when we are determined to build a society with a sustainable edge in science and technology in a fast - evolving global environment , " Bao said .
He quickly added that reasoning is a good skill for everyone to possess -- not just scientists and engineers .
" The general public also needs good reasoning skills in order to correctly interpret scientific findings and think rationally , " he said .
How to boost scientific reasoning ?
Bao points to inquiry - based learning , where students work in groups , question teachers and design their own investigations .
This teaching technique is growing in popularity worldwide .
Ohio State is exploring inquiry - based learning in its physics classes .
Here students use hand - held electronic devices called clickers to answer multiple - choice questions during lectures .
They work together to answer questions , and professors use the clicker interaction to guide student learning towards a more investigative style .
The department is also adopting an inquiry - based curriculum for undergraduate physics courses .

One Laptop Per Child program has a new twist for small deployments .
Rather than selling XO's to already funded projects wanting 100 or so XO 's for programs that have committed community buy - in and long - term project plans , OLPC is going to develop :
OLPC is doing what ?
OLPCorps Africa - $ 3,500,000 for 100 teams of college students to get $ 35,000 in support for 10 week projects in Africa .
Each group gets 100 XO laptops , assorted hardware , a $ 10,000 stipend , and 10 - day training in Kigali , Rwanda , before being sent out to projects they need to have arranged by March 27th .
While the OLPCorps Africa is a great idea - similar to the Peace Corps or Geekcorps - 10 weeks is wastefully too short , college students , while meaning well , are the wrong implementers , and $ 3.5 million could be much better invested in small deployments .
10 weeks is way too short
From painful experience as director of Geekcorps , where we sent mid-career ICT professionals to the developing world to effect change as volunteers , I can say that nothing of consequence happens in 10 weeks in Africa .
For an intervention to be effective ( vs. a photo op ) , you need to have long - term presence in the community .
It takes at least 10 months for a team of volunteers to get from idea through implementation to acceptance by the recipient community .
And that 's long before any measurable outcomes are apparent .
Ideally , you want the community to spend at least 10 weeks just thinking through why they want a new technology and how they will integrate it into their existing social interactions and cultural mores before you even start implementation .
College students are the wrong implementers
College students do have the time and enthusiasm to spend 10 weeks in Africa for OLPC .
But with all due respect , that 's all they have .
They often lack the experience to understand the nuances of change management that a new technology introduction requires .
And that very enthusiasm means they often lack the patience to allow a community to come to terms with change in their own time , or to reject change all together , for what to that community are very valid reasons .
Last but not least , a two week training course is way too short to teach the required project management and educational pedagogy skills .
The Peace Corps trains volunteers for three months before they go into the field alone .
At Geekcorps , volunteers overlapped with each other to cross train , and were directly supervised by international development experts on every project .
A better investment : supporting small deployments
But I 'm still wondering why OLPC is investing $ 3.5 million in unproven student projects to be somehow transitioned from dream to reality in just 10 weeks ?
There was a process to support already established small deployment opportunities .
Initiatives that had funding to buy XO's , not have them gifted , willing to invest their own money for training and implementation , and spend much longer than 10 weeks with the community .
$ 3.5 million invested in those self - organized small deployments would go a long way .
Oh right , OLPC ended support of small deployments , citing the cost to manage them .
And 100 teams of college students will be less work ?
Charles Darwin has been accused of many things – but never before of being a closet Tibetan Buddhist .
A leading scholar of human emotions and facial expressions has suggested Darwin 's views on human compassion and morality were strikingly similar to those held by Buddhists .
Professor Paul Ekman said that his studies of Darwin 's texts had revealed that the great Victorian scientist had identical views to those expressed by the Dalai Lama , a personal friend of Professor Ekman .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Darwin wrote at length on human emotions and compassion , and strongly believed in the unity of humanity as well as the commonality of emotions shared between humans and the animals we eat , Professor Ekman said .
" The words Darwin used are identical to those used by Tibetan Buddhists to describe compassion and morality , " Professor Ekman said .
" It is an amazing coincidence , if it is a coincidence , that his views on compassion and morality are identical to the Tibetan view .
When I read to the Dalai Lama some of Darwin 's passages he said , ' I will now call myself a Darwinian . '
" How did this coincidence occur ?
If it was contemporary , the issue of plagiarism would arise because the words are virtually the same , or exactly the same .
I 'm by no means accusing Darwin of plagiarism , " Professor Ekman told the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago .
Darwin could have learned about Tibetan Buddhism from letters written to him by his friend Joseph Hooker , who spent time in Tibet studying the local flora .
The Dalai Lama was surprised to find how similar Darwin 's writings on compassion and morality were to his views , said Professor Ekman , who added : " When I see you suffer , it makes me suffer and that motivates me to reduce your suffering so I can reduce my suffering .
That 's identical to the Tibetan Buddhist view . "
What is outside .in?
Outside .in is a hyperlocal news and information service :
Hyperlocal means news and information on a level beyond what traditional media provides .
Until now , most " local " sites did n’t actually get more , well , local than cities or towns .
They assumed that just because you live in a specific city or town you are looking for the same news as everyone else .
Hyperlocal content gives you the news and information for the area right around where you are , like the block around your office or the neighborhood where you live .

Why ?
We recently launched a Rails - based real estate search application and wanted to add some location specific content to the page that displays details about a particular listing .
Usage
require ' radarb ' r = Radarb :: Radar.new ( '40.714550 ' , '- 74.007124 ' ) r.blips.length
# blips are either tweets or stories r.stories .
length # just the story blips r.tweets.length # just the tweet blips r.blips.collect(&:author ) r.blips.collect {|b| b.places.first.name } r.blips.select {|b| !b.tags.empty ?
}.collect{|b| b.tags.first.name}
Future Enhancements
The Radar API poses a challenge in terms of automatically mapping methods to collections .
For example , place nodes exist under a places node which is exposed as r.places.places [ 0 ] .
In radarb , the driving means behind mapping nested collection nodes without this redundancy hinges on checking for a trailing ' s ' character in the node name .
Adding ActiveSupport as a dependency and using the Inflector to determine if certain tags are really plural might provide a more robust auto - mapping mechanism .
Another possible solution is to modify Happy Mapper to support passing options about nesting nodes via has_many .
I 'm also curious to know if any Ruby XML wrappers already exist that solve this problem .

Call Dr Arroway , because NASA has detected a deep space sound that defies belief or any explanation .
They do n't have a single clue about its origin , according to Alan Kogut from the Goddard Space Center :
The universe really threw us a curve .
Instead of the faint signal we hoped to find , here was this booming noise six times louder than anyone had predicted .
Advertisement
According to NASA , " the source of this cosmic radio background remains a mystery " .
It 's not primordial stars , it 's not any known radio source , and in fact , the problem here is that there is " not enough radio galaxies to account for the signal " .
In other words , nothing in the known cosmos is capable of producing this deafening sound .
University of Maryland at College Park's Dale Fixsen - part of NASA 's ARCADE team - says , that to get this kind of signal , " you 'd have to pack [ radio galaxies ] into the universe like sardines .
There would n't be any space left between one galaxy and the next " .
So in more scientific terms :
They do n't have a flying frak about what the hell this may be .

The sound has been detected by ARCADE , a balloon - borne probe which is chilled to 2.7 degrees above absolute zero .
The instrument itself is inside a tank of 500 gallons of liquid helium to reach that temperature , which is the same temperature as the cosmic microwave background radiation .

Court allows Oklahoma workers to have guns in vehicles
DENVER —
An appeals court said Wednesday that Oklahoma ’s law allowing employees to have guns at work in their locked vehicles is valid .
The Denver - based court ’s decision overturns a ruling by U.S. District Judge Terence Kern in Tulsa , who barred enforcement of the law .
Gov. Brad Henry and Attorney General Drew Edmondson appealed Kern ’s 2007 ruling .
" It was our opinion that the law is constitutional and the court agreed with us today , ” Edmondson spokesman Charlie Price said .
" We are thankful for the assistance of the National Rifle Association and its counsel — they provided great help . ”
Starting with a 2004 lawsuit , several companies challenged the law , including Weyerhauser Corp. ; Whirlpool Corp. , which later dropped out ; and more recently , ConocoPhillips .
" The safety of our employees is a top priority of ConocoPhillips and we are disappointed with today ’s decision , ” said company spokesman Rich Johnson , adding that the company has not determined whether to appeal .
The ruling
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided 3 - 0 that Kern erred in concluding the law is pre-empted by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act .
Kern said gun-related workplace violence was a " recognized hazard ” under the act and the state law interfered with employers ’ ability to comply with the act .
" We disagree , ” the appellate judges in Denver wrote .
" OSHA is aware of the controversy surrounding firearms in the workplace and has consciously decided not to adopt a standard ( banning firearms from the workplace ) . ”
The appellate judges said Kern ’s ruling " interferes with Oklahoma ’s police powers and essentially promulgates a court - made safety standard .
...
Such action is beyond the province of federal courts . ”
Edmondson , in an unusual step , had an attorney for the rifle association instead one of his own lawyers argue the case at the appeals court .
The court had allowed the NRA to submit arguments as a " friend of the court . ”
The court allowed the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence and several safety and business groups to submit arguments as friends of the court in support of Kern ’s ruling .
The law
The law , which allows nonfelons to lock legal guns in their vehicles while parked at work , was passed in two stages in 2004 and 2005 .
The law was proposed by legislators after Weyerhauser reportedly fired eight workers who violated policy by having guns in their vehicles at a mill in southeastern Oklahoma .
If new Attorney General Eric Holder really means what he said in his oath – that he will “ support and defend the Constitution of the United States ” – then he must give serious consideration to prosecuting crimes committed by the Bush administration , including its torturing of detainees .
And Holder might be advised to begin the process at his own agency , the Department of Justice .
To paraphrase Shakespeare , Holder might start by first jailing all of George W. Bush ’s lawyers .
The logic of targeting former Justice Department lawyers – the likes of John Yoo and Jay Bybee – is that they were the linchpin for justifying acts that were clearly illegal ; they provided the paper cover for both the interrogators in the field and the senior officials back in Washington .
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have repeatedly cited this legal guidance when insisting that the harsh interrogation of " war on terror " detainees – as well as other prisoners from the Iraq and Afghan wars – did not cross the line into torture .
In essence , the Bush - Cheney defense is that independent lawyers at the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel and elsewhere gave honest opinions – and that everyone from the President and Vice President , who approved specific interrogation techniques , to the interrogators , who carried out these acts , operated in good faith .
If , however , that narrative is false – if the lawyers colluded with policymakers in creating legal excuses for criminal acts – then the Bush - Cheney defense collapses .
Rather than diligent lawyers providing professional advice , the picture is of consiglieres counseling crime bosses how to skirt the law .
The evidence supports the conspiratorial interpretation .
For instance , in his 2006 book War by Other Means , Yoo describes his involvement in frequent White House meetings regarding what “ other means ” should receive a legal stamp of approval .
Yoo , who was a deputy assistant attorney general assigned to the powerful Office of Legal Counsel , wrote :
“ As the White House held its procession of Christmas parties and receptions in December 2001 , senior lawyers from the Attorney General ’s office , the White House counsel ’s office , the Departments of State and Defense and the NSC [ National Security Council ] met a few floors away to discuss the work on our opinion .
“ We sat at a large round table in a room in the ornate , Empire - style Old Executive Office Building where secretaries of state once conducted business . …
This group of lawyers would meet repeatedly over the next months to develop policy on the war on terrorism .
We certainly did not all agree , nor did we always get along , but we all believed that we were doing what was best for the nation and its citizens .
“ Meetings were usually chaired by Alberto Gonzales , ” who was then White House counsel and later became Bush ’s second Attorney General .
Yoo identified other key players as Timothy Flanigan , Gonzales ’s deputy ; William Howard Taft IV from State ; John Bellinger from the NSC ; William “ Jim ” Haynes from the Pentagon ; and David Addington , counsel to Cheney .
Yoo ’s Account
In his book , Yoo describes a give - and - take among participants at the meeting with the State Department ’s Taft challenging Yoo ’s OLC view that Bush could waive the Geneva Conventions regarding the invasion of Afghanistan ( by labeling it a “ failed state ” ) .
Taft noted that the Taliban was the recognized government of the country .
“ We thought Taft ’s memo represented the typically conservative thinking of foreign ministries , which places a priority on stabilizing relations with other states – even if it means creating or maintaining fictions – rather than adapting to new circumstances , ” Yoo wrote .
Regarding objections from the Pentagon ’s judge advocate generals – who feared that waiving the Geneva Conventions would endanger American soldiers – Yoo again stressed policy concerns , not legal logic .
“ It was far from obvious that following the Geneva Conventions in the war against al - Qaeda would be wise , ” Yoo wrote .
“ Our policy makers had to ask whether [ compliance ] would yield any benefit or act as a hindrance . ”
What Yoo ’s book and other evidence make clear is that the lawyers from the Justice Department ’s OLC were n’t just legal scholars handing down opinions from an ivory tower ; they were participants in how to make Bush ’s desired actions “ legal . ”
They were the lawyerly equivalents of those U.S. intelligence analysts , who – in the words of the British “ Downing Street Memo ” – “ fixed ” the facts around Bush ’s desire to justify invading Iraq .
Yoo and other OLC lawyers looked to be Bush ’s consiglieres on both brutal interrogation and aggressive war .
They floated novel legal theories , looked for loopholes or – in Yoo ’s phrase – they were “ adapting to new circumstances . ”
Congressional Probe
The importance of this question – whether the OLC lawyers were honest brokers or criminal conspirators – has not been missed by some of the congressional leaders pressing for a serious investigation of Bush ’s use of torture and other war crimes .
A year ago , Sens. Dick Durbin , D - Illinois , and Sheldon Whitehouse , D - Rhode Island , wrote a letter to the Justice Department ’s watchdog agencies requesting an investigation into the role that “ Justice Department officials [ played ] in authorizing and / or overseeing the use of waterboarding by the Central Intelligence Agency ... and whether those who authorized it violated the law . ”
In the Feb. 12 , 2008 , letter , the senators questioned whether the OLC lawyers were “ insulated from outside pressure to reach a particular conclusion ” and whether Bush ’s White House and the CIA played any role in influencing “ deliberations about the lawfulness of waterboarding , ” a technique that creates the sensation of drowning and has been deemed torture since the Inquisition .
Whitehouse , a former federal prosecutor , said those questions were designed to get to the point that having in - house lawyers dream up a legal argument does n’t make an action legal , especially if the lawyers were somehow induced to produce the opinion .
In the case of waterboarding and other abusive interrogation tactics , Yoo and his OLC boss Jay Bybee generated a memo , dated Aug. 1 , 2002 , that came up with a novel and narrow definition of torture , essentially lifting the language from an unrelated law regarding health benefits .
The Yoo - Bybee legal opinion stated that unless the amount of pain administered to a detainee led to injuries that might result in " death , organ failure , or serious impairment of body functions " then the interrogation technique could not be defined as torture .
Since waterboarding is not intended to cause death or organ failure – only the panicked gag reflex associated with drowning – it was deemed not to be torture .
The “ torture memo ” and related legal opinions were considered so sloppy and unprofessional that Bybee ’s replacement to head the OLC , Jack Goldsmith , himself a conservative Republican , took the extraordinary step of withdrawing them after he was appointed in October 2003 .
Whitehouse said the Bybee - Yoo memo was “ beyond malpractice ” and “ raises the specter that these things were overlooked ” just to advance policy .
[ For more on Whitehouse ’s recent comments , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ More Pressure for Bush Torture Probe . ” ]
Pending Probe
In response to the Durbin - Whitehouse letter , H. Marshall Jarrett , head of the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility , disclosed that OPR was examining the genesis of the Aug. 1 , 2002 , legal opinion , an inquiry that might be completed within the next month or two .
OPR ’s findings could give Attorney General Holder an opening to question Bybee , Yoo and other lawyers in the torture debate about whether they were pressured to come up with a legal opinion that would justify the abusive tactics that Bush and Cheney already wanted to use against detainees .
Did Bush and Cheney , in effect , lawyer - shop for the answers they wanted ?
By concentrating on the lawyers first , Holder could likely build a stronger case than he could against CIA and other interrogators who executed the orders from above to abuse and torture detainees .
While the interrogators might reasonably be able to claim uncertainty about the legality ( because they had orders from the Attorney General or the White House ) , Yoo , Bybee and other lawyers who crafted the legal arguments could make no such claim .
Bybee is now a federal appeals court judge in San Francisco .
Yoo is a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley
Yoo also has shown no remorse over his role in putting the United States on the path to torture .
Yoo even took to the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 29 to chastise President Barack Obama for ordering the phased close - down of the Guantanamo Bay prison and for ending the CIA ’s authority to harshly interrogate detainees .
“ While these actions will certainly please his base -- gone are the cries of an ‘ imperial presidency ’ -- they will also seriously handicap our intelligence agencies from preventing future terrorist attacks , ” Yoo wrote .
“ Eliminating the Bush system will mean that we will get no more information from captured al - Qaeda terrorists , ” Yoo wrote .
“ In his decisions taken so precipitously just two days after the Inauguration , Mr. Obama may have opened the door to further terrorist acts on U.S. soil by shattering some of the nation 's most critical defenses . ”
While
Yoo ’s rhetoric is typical of what came out of the Bush administration for eight years , it glosses over the basic fact that this approach leaves to one person – the U.S. President – the power to determine who is an “ enemy combatant ” and to subject that human being to barbaric practices .
It assumes that the President and his intelligence agencies are infallible in making those judgments even for a person apprehended far from any battlefield and with no apparent capacity to wage war , even U.S. citizens or legal residents pulled from their homes or off the street by government agents .
[ For details , see our book , Neck Deep . ]
For many Americans , the question during Bush ’s presidency was whether his imperial theories and their defenders represented a greater threat to the American constitutional Republic than did a scattered band of terrorists halfway around the world .
Yoo ’s Wall Street Journal column also is further evidence of his criminal intent .
He is stating clearly that he is all about achieving an outcome ( i.e. extracting information from suspected terrorists by any means that the President orders ) , rather than about protecting the sanctity of the law .
It is the ends , not the means , that matter to John Yoo .
If Holder takes seriously his sworn commitment to protect the U.S. Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic , he has little choice but to examine how political and ideological operatives , like Yoo , twisted the law to fit a President ’s criminal proclivities .
If the rule of law means anything , it ca n’t be that simply making a legal argument – no matter how baseless and absurd – permits the nation ’s top executive to break any law and commit any crime .
Possibly after some time behind bars or at least before a grand jury , lawyers , who put their ambitions and policy interests first , might have some heartfelt second thoughts – and might be willing to point the finger at which of their higher - ups got them to write these disreputable legal opinions .

For the second time in less than a week , graphics chipset maker Nvidia is at the center of a rumor that could turn the tech sectors upside down .
Last week , the California - based GPU maker was rumored to be pushed out of the console graphics market by none other than Intel .
This week , it seems as if the tables have turned , with Nvidia reportedly working on an x86 CPU .
According to The Inquirer , the GPU powerhouse is trying to produce an x86 chip .
While the legal implications may stop anything concrete dead in its tracks , that probably would n't stop Nvidia from producing the hardware and worrying about a financial settlement later .
When Nvidia started collaborating with Stexar back in 2006 , many were predicting that some sort of CPU would be the result .
It 's been over two years , so the market may finally be privy to the fruit of Nvidia 's labors .
" Word reached us a bit ago that Nvidia is definitely working on an x86 chip and the firm is heavily recruiting x86 engineers all over Silicon Valley , " says The Inquirer .
While producing an x86 CPU would certainly put a wrench in the works for Intel and AMD , the move seems to be off message for Nvidia .
For the past year or so , Nvidia has been pushing its GPGPU , or General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit , concept .
This rumored Nvidia CPU would completely go against that grain .
While Nvidia may not be able to snag a license from Intel , there may be another option .
If Nvidia collaborated with a company that already possesses an x86 license , VIA for example , you may see an Nvidia - branded CPU yet .
Enlarge By Peter Brown Image of LB1 " Hobbit " skull , as compared to a modern human skull .
The setting was a hidden island filled with pint - size men who feasted on pygmy elephants and battled dragons .
The story of paleontology 's " Hobbits , " the extinct human species called Homo floresiensis , packs plenty of drama .
But the 2003 discovery by an Australian - Indonesian of the undersize bones inside Liang Bua cave on the Indonesian island of Flores has long also suffered from a modern - day human rivalry .
Add in the scientific back - story — a five - year feud over the whether the original inhabitants of Flores were actually a separate human species — and you have enough material for a novel .
The latest chapter of this story comes in the next Journal of Human Evolution , which boasts four reports concerning the hobbits — five years after discovery was first disclosed in the journal Nature .
" Here we report the discovery , from the Late Pleistocene of Flores , Indonesia , of an adult hominin , " wrote the authors of that 2004 paper in the formal language of scientists declaring a new species .
( " Hominin " is what the cool kids among paleontologists say instead of " hominids " now , or what reporters call " human species . " )
Incredibly these " hobbits " stood less than 40 inches tall and had brains about a third the size of modern humans , although they were buried with Stone Age tools , which indicates they had some smarts .
" The combination of primitive and derived ( modern - looking ) features assigns this hominin to a new species , Homo floresiensis .
The most likely explanation for its existence on Flores is long - term isolation , with subsequent endemic dwarfing , " concluded the team led by Peter Brown of Australia 's University of New England .
The declaration made the bones of " Liang Bua 1 , " or LB1 , described in the study the " holotype " , basically the defining specimen of the new species , much like the fossil of " Lucy " defines the pre-human species Australopithecus afarensis , which lived 3 to 4 million years ago in Africa .
For something so sacrosanct , LB1's bones have enjoyed a rough few years , derided by critics such as Jochen Weber of Germany 's Leopoldina Hospital as belonging to a microencephalic victim of a small - brained pathology , not a new species .
Florida State University neuroscientist Dean Falk countered those claims in other studies , most recently in a 2007 Proceedings of the National Academies of Science paper that concluded , " Despite LB1 's having brain shape features that sort it with normal humans rather than microencephalics , other shape features and its small brain size are consistent with its assignment to a separate species . "
The bones even departed from their home in Jakarta 's Indonesian Centre for Archaeology without the permission of all of the discoverers , a move that left them damaged and pawns in the politics of paleontology in Indonesia prior to their return .
Another look at LB1's much - maligned noggin comes with the new Journal of Human Evolution papers in a study led by anatomical scientist Karen Baab of the Stony Brook ( N.Y. ) University Medical Center that examines the asymmetry of the skull .
Critics of the new - species designation had pointed out the two halves of the skull are lopsided , suggestive of microencephaly .
However , Baab 's report concludes that " the cranium is fairly asymmetrical , but within the range of asymmetry exhibited by modern humans and all extant African ape species . "
Packed under 10 feet of wet mud , the skull likely became a bit distorted , a process called taphonomy by fossil researchers .
The whole microencephaly debate is nonsense , original team members such as Peter Brown have argued , as they have turned up bones , if not skulls , from about a dozen " hobbits " underneath Liang Bua Cave .
The bones all display similar looks .
A graveyard for stubby microencephalics in a cave on Flores strikes the discoverers as unlikely .
Two papers look at those " post - cranial " remains of LB1 and kin , in other words every thing but the skull .
The hips , legs and feet of nine hobbits are examined in a paper led by William Jungers of Stony Brook University .
And the arms , collar bones , wrists and fingers of six hobbits are described in another led by his colleague Susan Larson .
Those bones " presents a unique mosaic of derived ( human - like ) and primitive morphologies , the combination of which is never found in either healthy or pathological modern humans . "
Larson 's group reports .
The leg bone finds indicate LB1 was most likely female .
Overall , the bones most resemble those of Lucy , Australopithecus afarensis , suggesting they arrived at the island of Flores a very long time ago .
The latest papers include a better description of that cave , which concludes that whatever hobbits were , they ate a lot of Stegodon pygmy elephants .
" There are at least 47 individual Stegodon represented in all excavated sectors of Liang Bua , " the researchers write , describing findings from 10 holes that held remains from 95,000 to 17,000 years ago , when a volcanic eruption appears to have bumped off both elephants and hobbits .
Komodo dragon and giant stork remains also litter the cave , though there is less suspicion the hobbits preyed on those species .
More likely they scavenged their carcasses .
One thing the cave lacked was seashells , suggesting that hobbits were not big on surf and turf .
" Homo floresiensis probably descended from a very early Homo erectus , or from Homo habilis , both human species that are not known to have used marine resources .
Homo floresiensis probably did not have the right behavior to exploit marine resources ( perhaps fear of entering the water , just like for instance orangutans ) , " says study lead author Gert van den Bergh of Holland 's Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum Naturalis , by e-mail .
Or perhaps modern humans lived on the coasts and hobbits were " restricted to the more inaccessible interior of Flores and did not venture into the coastal areas , " he says .
" You see , still many unanswered questions remain . "

If not fascism , what is ?
Without censure , a growing current in Israeli politics is calling for the outright killing of Palestinians By Khaled Amayreh in occupied East Jerusalem Adolf Lieberman . by Ben Heine
Feb 7 , 2009
His name is Avigdor Lieberman and he is widely expected to be the main surprise of the Israeli elections , slated to take place 10 February .
Many Israeli intellectuals dub Lieberman as the secular equivalent of Meir Kahana , the slain founder of the Kach terrorist group who advocated genocidal ethnic cleansing of non-Jews in Israel - Palestine .
Kahana was assassinated in Manhattan , New York , in 1990 shortly after giving a speech in which he called for the annihilation and expulsion of Palestinians from " the Land of Israel " .
According to most opinion polls , Lieberman 's party , Yisrael Beiteinu , or " Israel is our Home " , is projected to win 16 - 17 Knesset seats out of 120 making up the Israeli parliament .
This would allow Yisrael Beiteinu to overtake the Labour Party , led by Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak , to become the third largest party in the Israeli political system , after the Likud and Kadima parties .
Lieberman 's party will likely be a chief coalition partner in the next Israeli government .
Yisrael Beiteinu is not a party of marginal or pariah politicians .
A few months ago , several high - profile politicians joined the party , including former Israeli Ambassador to the US Danny Ayalon and Uzi Landau , a former Israeli cabinet minister and prominent Likud figure for many years .
Some observers expect the Obama administration and international Jewish circles to press Benyamin Netanyahu , who is widely expected to form the next Israeli government , to exclude Lieberman from government in order to avoid negative ramifications with regards to relations with the United States and European Union .
However , it is uncertain that Netanyahu would cave in to such pressure , given his rapport with Lieberman .
Lieberman was the director - general of the Prime Minister 's Office when Netanyahu was premier in 1996 - 1998 .
He later assumed key portfolios , including deputy prime minister , minister of strategic affairs and minister of national infrastructure .
Lieberman was born in Moldova in the former Soviet Union in 1958 .
In 1978 , at the age of 20 , he immigrated to Israel and received automatic citizenship under Israel 's law of return .
He now lives in the settlement of Nokdi in the West Bank .
A nightclub bouncer - turned - politician , Lieberman formed the Yisrael Beiteinu Party in 1999 when he was first elected to the Knesset .
Without controversy , Lieberman 's political and social ideas can be described as racist , even genocidal .
In recent weeks , he was quoted as suggesting that Israel should use nuclear weapons against the Gaza Strip .
In 2002 , Lieberman called on the Israeli government , under Ariel Sharon , to blanket - bomb Palestinian population centres in order to force Palestinians to flee to Jordan .
The Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot quoted Lieberman as saying during a cabinet meeting that the Palestinians should be given an ultimatum : " At 8 am we 'll bomb all the commercial centres ... at noon we 'll bomb their gas stations ... at 2 pm we 'll bomb their banks ... while keeping the bridges open . "
In 1998 , Lieberman called for flooding Egypt by bombing the Aswan Dam .
In 2001 , as minister of national infrastructure , Lieberman proposed that the West Bank be divided into four cantons , with no central Palestinian government and no possibility for Palestinians to travel between the cantons .
In 2003 , the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Lieberman called for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel to be drowned in the Dead Sea and offered to provide buses to take them there .
Further , Lieberman has proposed that a " loyalty test " be applied to those " Arabs " who desire to remain in Israel .
Those committed to making Israel a state of all its citizens , including the Palestinian minority , would be stripped of their voting rights .
In April 2002 , Lieberman stated that there was " nothing undemocratic about transfer " .
In May 2004 , Lieberman said that 90 per cent of Israel 's 1.2 million Palestinian citizens would " have to find a new Arab entity " in which to live beyond Israel 's borders .
" They have no place here .
They can take their bundles and get lost . "
In May 2006 , Lieberman called for the killing of Arab members of the Israeli parliament who meet with members of the then Hamas - led Palestinian Authority .
In recent months , Lieberman urged that Tehran be levelled if Iran went ahead with its alleged nuclear weapons programme .
He reportedly told listeners of Israel 's Radio Persian Service that " you will pay a high price ; you , the good Iranian citizens , will pay for your leaders ' actions . "
According to Israeli journalist Gideon Samet , the rising star of Lieberman in Israel should n't be dismissed as an anomalous development , saying that " Lieberman 's ideas [ are ] penetrating deeply in the Israeli society . "
Samet opined that the political class in Israel was expected to adapt to Lieberman 's reality .
" Netanyahu will not say openly he wo n't sit down with Lieberman in government .
After all , both Kadima and Labour had sat down with him in previous governments , " Samet wrote in Maariv .
In recent weeks , a large number of Israeli intellectuals , including ostensible leftists , have spoken in favour of the idea of waging a genocidal war against the Palestinians .
Left - leaning television personality Yaron London surprised many during the recent blitz on Gaza by urging a " no- holds - barred " campaign against Palestinian civilians .
London outlined his views in an article in Yediot Aharonot and then elaborated on them in a series of interviews published in the Hebrew media .
" The time has come to shock the Gaza population with actions that until now have nauseated us -- actions such as killing the political leadership , causing hunger and thirst in Gaza , blocking off energy sources , causing widespread destruction , and being less discriminating in the killing of civilians .
There is no other choice , " he wrote .
Responding to questions , London further argued that murdering civilians was a justified act .
" I am referring to both the population and their leadership ; they are the same , because the population voted for Hamas .
I can't separate between one who voted for Hamas and a Hamas leader . "
This clearly criminal mindset is not going unchallenged , but is gaining in popularity .
Former TV anchorman Haim Yavin has warned against including Lieberman and his ilk in the next Israeli government .
" Kahana may have died , but Kahanism is alive and well ; there is too much ' death to the Arabs ' and hatred for Arabs , " Yavin said in an interview with Haaretz this week .
Alarmingly , Yavin represents a dwindling minority in a society that is drifting fast towards fascism .

BARACK OBAMA'S gargantuan stimulus bill moves to the Senate on Monday February 2nd , after passing through the House of Representatives without a single Republican vote in favour .
That means that it is in trouble .
A party with a majority can usually pass whatever it likes in the House , but the same is not true in the Senate .
Debates in the Senate are not rigidly time - limited as they are in the House , and in order to end discussion and move to a substantive vote , a motion of “ clôture ” , or closure , has to pass .
The snag is that 60 votes are needed to pass such a motion ; and the Democrats have only 58 senators .
In theory , if the Republicans hang firm — and they held absolutely firm in the House — they could prevent the stimulus bill from ever being put to a full vote .
Will the Republicans opt to do this , given the gravity of the recession ?
They are in no mind to allow the bill to go through without substantial changes .
The Senate Republicans , just like the House ones , believe that the stimulus bill is something of a Trojan horse .
While no one disputes that a big fiscal punch is needed , many items in the current plan ( which has been hastily thrown together ) will take too long to deliver ; at least a third of the House 's $ 819 billion package will not have been spent 19 months from now , according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office .
The Republicans prefer tax cuts , which have the advantage of delivering their punch almost instantly .
The problem is that in tough times like these , people are likely to save rather than spend their tax gains especially if — as in this case — the cuts are strictly temporary .
Extra saving does nothing to boost demand in an economy that is suffering from a shortage of it .
Republicans also object to some of the protectionist “ Buy American ” provisions attached to some of the money , and to inanities such as a $ 200 m plan to returf the Mall in Washington , DC , ( this last has now been removed from the House bill ) .
Some prominent Republican senators , including Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Kent Conrad of North Dakota , want to seize the moment to turn the stimulus package into a broader “ grand bargain ” .
They worry , and rightly so , that America faces budgetary meltdown , as its ageing population places unbearable strains on pensions and health - care systems .
The stimulus package as currently scripted would push the fiscal deficit for this year up to some $ 1.2 trillion , or over 8 % of GNP .
If so vast a sum of money is to be spent , they argue , it should only be done in the framework of a deal that will address the long - term imbalances .
Because of the clôture rule , the Republicans have considerable leverage .
If they were to choose to make passage of the stimulus conditional on an agreement to address the long - term imbalances they could force Mr Obama to give some form of undertaking .
The question is , though , just what form that would take .
The two senators want to see the establishment of a bipartisan commission that would draw up a programme of budget reform to be submitted to Congress for a straight up or down vote , with no possibility of amendment , since amendments would surely cause the whole thing to unravel .
It is not yet clear whether this idea or anything like it would succeed .
The snag for the Republicans is that they will have to decide on whether or not to allow the stimulus package to go through long before it is clear whether any attempt to get to grips with budget reform will bear fruit .
They know that many Americans are deeply concerned about the prospect of the government slipping so deeply into the red .
But many Americans are deeply concerned about their jobs too .
It is a tough call for the Grand Old Party .
Her dad Lutz said : " I suppose it took me longer than my wife to accept it , but Kim is a very persuasive girl , she knows what she wants and how to get it .
I am very proud of what she has achieved , how she has managed to get there and how she sticks to her dreams no matter how hard and painful they are to follow . "
" The money is going to sit on the sidelines until [ regulators ] announce they ’re going to do something with these [ big banks ] .
Nobody is going to put fresh capital into the banking business when your major competitor is going to be continuously bailed out by the United States government with more and more money . ”
Rusty Cloutier , the president and CEO of MidSouth Bank
Rusty Cloutier , the president and CEO of MidSouth Bank , recently told major news outlets that “ [ c] oncentration is a bad thing ” and called for the feds to break up the “ miserable eight ” largest banks that , he said , control 60 to 64 percent of the country ’s assets , restoring competition to the banking industry and restoring investor confidence in the system .

This is an excellent point .
Most of the big banks can't raise capital because investors are afraid ofpreprivatization .
And small banks can't raise capital because investors are concerned that their competitors ( the large banks ) will be continuously bailed out by the government .

This class allows you or your players to play as a Papermaster , a class of individual from the Manga / Anime series Read or Die ( R.O.D . )
It 's something fun I whipped up for a game or two .
Like a cross between a wild mage and a psionist , these natural talents are born into their trades , and the skills they employ cannot necessarily be taught ( Unless the players and the DM agree to a workaround . )
As their name implies , Papermasters use only paper , and are limited only by their imaginations , turning it into anything from armor and rope to deadly weapons and massive forms of transport ( Like bridges , aircraft , etc . )
For obvious reasons , their worst enemies are fire and liquids .
This is a class for imaginative players and flexible DM's / Referees , but it can sure be alot of fun , especially when you 're dealing with a party that is mostly papermasters .
Nowhere are changes needed more in the Department of Justice than in Alabama , where former Governor Don Siegelman still awaits word from the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and a Congressional investigation in Washington , D.C. , on the fate of his political prosecution .
The New York Times carried a story Sunday about seismic shifts going on in the Justice Department to reverse course from the Bush years , when the department was turned into a political hit wing of the White House under Bush ’s political adviser Karl Rove .
The Justice Department , probably more than any other agency ( in Washington ) , is bracing for a broad doctrinal shift in policies from those of the Bush administration , department lawyers and Obama administration officials say .
Eric H. Holder Jr. , whom the Senate is expected to confirm on Monday as the nation ’s 82nd attorney general , plans to take the oath of office that evening to demonstrate a quick start , which will include overseeing the creation of a new detention policy for terrorism suspects .
The civil rights division , which had been reshaped in a conservative direction under President George W. Bush , is ripe for sharp change , as well , according to the Times , and expectations are that the division would be restored to its historic role of largely enforcing prohibitions against racial and ethnic discrimination .
Under the Bush administration , the division significantly diminished its involvement in those areas and shifted resources to fighting instances of religious discrimination .
Ridiculous .
One of the cases under review will provide a much needed opportunity to have a court assess the Bush administration ’s domestic wiretapping program , an issue of much concern to this news organization for the past three and a half years .
As Eric Holder enters the smoldering wreckage of the Justice Department , the challenges he faces will require extraordinary energy and exertion .
He will enter with only a few hundred political appointees , while far larger number of “ loyal Bushies ” have been burrowed ( illegally , as the Department acknowledges in its own internal probe ) deeply into the institution .
The first struggle on the horizon is likely to be a struggle within Justice for the institution ’s soul .
I expect sabotage and disinformation to flow freely for several months .
Hang on for the ride .
[ poll id = ” 3 ″ ]
Scott Horton , a contributing editor at Harper ‘s magazine , writes today about the anticipated changes in a post with the headline : Reversing Course at Justice
We ’ve been hanging on for the ride now for a long time .
Let ’s get the ride underway .
For starters , we would like to know when U.S. attorneys Alice Martin and Laure Canary are going to submit their resignations so change can come not only to Washington , but to the federal justice system in Alabama .
Birmingham African - American Congressman Artur Davis has denied protecting them in their jobs and even set up a competing committee with the state Democratic Party to recommend nominees for those jobs to the Obama administration .
But reports are that they are trying to stay in their jobs to delay real justice from coming to this state , and there are indications the appeals court in Atlanta is reluctant to rule on the Siegelman - Scrushy appeal until change comes to the Justice Department here .
We say what in the world are they waiting for ?
Bring on the change , and bring it on now !
Hey Bill Canary ’s “ girls . ”
Wo n’t you just resign now ?
The Times also carried an editorial on Sunday following our lead in applauding the House Judiciary Committee for A New Subpoena for Karl Rove .
Congress and the Obama administration should do everything they can to compel him to testify .
Americans deserve a full accounting .
We could n’t agree more .
Bring it on Mr. Rove !
You ’ve escaped truth and justice for too long now .
It ’s time to come forward , swear your oath to God and country on a Bible , and tell the truth .
Baby 's First Teratoma
I 'm a teratoma , short and stout ;
Here is my handle , here is my snout ;
When I get all steamed up and I shout ,
Poke a finger in and pull stuff out !
---
My teratoma , My teratoma ,
Wherever I go , he goes ,
My teratoma , My teratoma ,
Ill teach him everything I know
My teratoma and me
Like to climb up a tree
My teratoma and me
We 're the best friends that could be
My teratoma , My teratoma
My teratoma and Meeeee !

Finished Measurements Approximately the size of a grapefruit .
Will vary with felting .
Materials Teratoma Body : Cascade yarns Cascade 220 [ 100 % wool , 220yd / 201 m per 3.5 oz/100g skein ] ; 1 skein each in hot pink ( 9469 ) , light pink ( 9477 ) , and heather spring green ( 9461 ) Cascade yarns Cascade 220 Superwash [ 100 % superwash wool , 220yd / 201 m per 3.5 oz/100g skein ] ; 1 skein in olive green ( 888 ) 1 16" /40 cm US 15/10 mm circular needle OR 1 set of 10 " US 15 dpns 1 set of 8" /20 cm US 15/10 mm dpns ( if using a circular needle ) 8 - 12 empty plastic grocery bags Size J/6 mm crochet hook Safety pins Pillowcase Scissors Tapestry needle 8 stitch markers Waste yarn , several yards
Eyeball # 3 crochet cotton or other thread of your choice in white # 4 crochet hook Yard or so of blue yarn Blunt tapestry needle
Teeth # 3 crochet cotton or similar Steel crochet hook , about a # 3 or # 4
Hand and Foot Patons Kroy Sock Yarn in Muslin , color 24008 , or other suitable scraps Steel crochet hook , about a # 3 or # 4
Gauge Unimportant , as it will be felted .
You will probably notice that the green side has a larger gauge than the pink side ; this is ok .
The teeth an eyeballs can be any size , really , as the holes they will disappear into can be cut to size .
Desgin Notes
The teratoma body is knit and the accompanying bits are crocheted .
US crochet terminology is used .
The hot pink and light pink yarns are held together as one through the entire teratoma body pattern and are referred to as " pink " .
The olive green and heather green yarns are also held together as one and are referred to as " green " .
The teratoma body is a sphere that is knit like two hats .
You provisionally cast on what will be the middle of the sphere ( the brim of the hat ) and knit up to the top with a star decrease .
Then you undo the provisional cast on , pick up the sts , and do it again on the other side .
Be sure to stuff it with plastic bags before you are completely done knitting it , of course .
The entire teratoma body is double knitted so that you actually have two spheres when you 're done , one inside the other .
When felted , the inner sphere will be lumpy and gross because one of the green yarns is superwash wool and will not felt .
The pink outside sphere , however , will felt beautifully and evenly .
This is not a good first project to learn double knitting , as it will not be explained in the project instructions .
You can learn to double knit here : http://knittinghelp.com/knitting/advanced_techniques/
( scroll down to about the middle of the page ) Directions Body , First Half Provisionally cast on 64 sts with two separate length of waste yarn onto circular needle or long .
Alternate the cast on sts so that you have 32 sts from waste yarn A and 32 sts from waste yarn B .
The sts on the needle should be A B A B A B , etc .
Double knit 1 round : knit pink into cast on sts from waste yarn A and purl green into cast on sts from waste yarn B. PM at end of round to mark where new rounds begin .
Continue double knitting as established for rounds 2 , 3 , and 4 .
In round 5 , *k 8 , pm . Repeat from * 6 times .
k 8 . You should now have added 7 more markers ( total of 8 markers on needle ) and have a marker every 8 sts .
In round 6 , continue double knitting as established but work a k2tog for both pink and green before a marker .
This is tricky because if done incorrectly you will join the spheres together and see green yarn on the pink side .
To do it correctly , stop knitting when you have 4 sts before the marker ( 2 pink and 2 green ) .
Position your right - hand needle as if you were going to k3tog ( a pink , a green , and a pink ) .
Move your needle through the pink st , skip the green st , and through the next pink st .
Knit them together .
Drop the green st that was between them off the left hand needle carefully , pull it to the back so that you can't see green yarn on the pink side , and place it back onto the left - hand needle .
Purl the two green sts together .
Voila , your spheres remain autonomous .
Rnd 7 : double knit across round
Rnd 8 : decrease rnd
Repeat rnds 7 and 8 until you have 4 sts between marks ( 2 pink sts and 2 green sts ) .
Change to dpns whenever necessary if you are using a circular needle .
Repeat rnd 8 , removing markers as you go .
You should now have 16 sts ( 8 pink sts and 8 green sts ) .
Carefully separate the sts onto separate dpns or pieces of waste yarn .
†
Cut yarns , leaving 10 " tails .
Run pink yarn tail through pink sts and pull tight .
Fasten pink yarn on inside of pink ( half - ) sphere .
You will probably have to turn the work so it is stilling like a bowl in your lap and fasten it to the inside of the pink while working through the opening in the green side .
Do the same for green yarn , and fasten it on the inside .
Body , Second Half :
Pull out the provisional cast on and place live sts on circular needle ( or long dpns ) .
Follow directions for First Half up to † .
Be sure to start stuffing with plastic grocery bags during the decrease section .
Cut yarns , leaving 24 " tails .
With green yarn tail and crochet hook , slip stitch through each live st , leaving a nicely defined hole .
Fasten green yarn inside green sphere .
Repeat with pink yarn tail .
Fulling ( Felting ) : Place your grotesque creation in a pillow case .
Fold the open end of the pillowcase onto itself and pin it shut with safety pins .
Agitate in the wash until it is grapefruit - sized ( about 20 minutes for mine with hot water , two towels , and a pair of jeans ) .
Poke your fingers in and remove plastic grocery bags .
Allow to dry completely , which will take about two or three days for the green sphere .
Eyeball : [ You cannot have a proper teratoma without at least one eyeball . ]
This is a bit like crocheting a golf ball .
There is a marked resemblance .
Make a slip knot and chain 2 .
Make 6 single crochet in slipknot .
Join .
Make two single crocket in each single crochet around .
Join .
One single crochet in next single crochet ; 2 single crochet in next single crochet .
Repeat around and join .
Work 3 rounds even .
Work two decrease rounds reversing increases made above .
Stuff with a knot of yarn ends .
Thread tail into tapestry needle and stitch shut .
With blue yarn , embroider an iris to taste .
I made straight stitches into the end , using a round of crochet as a guide for the length of the stitches .
Notice and appreciate the resemblance to a golf ball with personality .
Dampen slightly and roll in your palms to shape nicely .
Teeth : Two modes .
Choose , or do one of each .
Root up : Leaving a 6 " tail , make a slip knit , chain 4 and make 4 double crochet in the original slipknot .
Join to first double crochet .
Chain three ; one double crochet in each double crochet .
Join and finish off .
Bring both tails through to the base of the root [ beginning ] and knot together .
Knot at about ¾ inch intervals to represent the dendrites of the roots .
Snip off about 1 ¼ long .
Attach with a ribbon to the interior of the teratoma .
Crown down [ preferred method - it ' s toothier ] :
Make a slip knot , chain 2 and make 6 single crochet in slipknot .
Join ; chain two ; one single crochet n each single crochet .
Join .
Working in the back loops only of the single crochet , work one round of double crochet .
Join .
Working double crochet , decrease three times .
End off .
Bring both tails through to the base of the root [ beginning ] and knot together .
Knot at about ¾ inch intervals to represent the dendrites of the roots .
Snip off about 1 ¼ long .

This tooth benefits from a touch of damp forming with your fingers .
A bit of twist gives it more character .
Hand :
Make slipknot ; chain two ;
Make six single crochet in slipknot .
Join .
Chain 2 , work 2 single crochet in each single crochet of the previous round .
Join .
Begin fingers .
Work loosely for nice wormy fingers .
Chain 3 , slip stitch in 2 chains ; slip stitch in next single crochet of circle .
* Chain 5 , slip stitch in 3 chains ; slip stitch in next single crochet of circle .
Repeat from * three times ( to form a total of four fingers ) .
Slip stich in next single crochet and make thumb as first finger was made .
End off .
Use tail to crochet a chain to represent the atrophied arm .
Foot : Leaving an 8 inch tail , make a slipknot and chain 4 .
Make three more double crochet into slipknot .
Chain 3 , turn .
Double crochet in next 3 stitches .
Toes are formed of picots of assorted sizes .
The Great Toe is chain 3 , one single crochet in chain slipstitch in double crochets .
The remaining toes are chains of 2/3 stitches joined to the foot with a slipstitch .
Use the tail to crochet a chain for the atrophied leg .
Finishing : Grab a beer and start cutting random holes into the soft pink flesh of your teratoma .
Some of the holes can have corresponding holes in the green sphere , some can just be in the pink sphere .
When you are satisfied with the holes , blanket stitch around them using a single strand of hot pink yarn .
If you have a pink hole with a corresponding green hole , stitch through both spheres to keep them aligned .
Firmly sew tail ends of the various Parts inside the teratoma .
This will take some finger acrobatics .
Stuff Parts into the teratoma .
Poke your fingers in and pull Parts out of the teratoma .
Stuff Parts into the teratoma .
Repeat while singing " I'm A Teratoma " ad nauseum .
Is n't it fun ?

Trading Spaces , one of the earliest breakout cable reality TV shows , one that inspired an entire sub - genre , has been officially cancelled by its network after attempting to reboot it a year ago .
Paige Davis revealed the cancellation on Connecticut ’s NBC 30 on Friday , and TLC told the news station , “ We ’re not currently moving forward with producing new episodes of the show . ”
TLC ’s president Eileen O’Neill later said in a statement to Reality TV World that the show was done : “ TLC has ended production of Trading Spaces with its eighth season .
Trading Spaces helped put TLC ‘ on the map ’ as a breakout hit that brought new highs to cable viewership .
The show and its talent became household names and we ’ll always celebrate that success . ”
About a year ago , the network brought the show back for a ninth season , but with new producers ( longtime producers Banyan Productions were replaced by A. Smith and Co. ) and the return of host Paige Davis , who ’d been fired in 2005 .
That worked , at least at first , the show returned to its 2005 ratings levels , although those were n’t exactly spectacular .
Paige is moving on to host a series called Life for Dummies ; it ’s based on the Dummies books and will probably be syndicated .
It ’ll be produced by A. Smith and Co. , as TV Week reports .
This five minute video was made by Reza Dolatabadi as his graduate film in college .

Researchers have generated altered immune cells that are able to shrink , and in some cases eradicate , large tumors in mice .
The immune cells target mesothelin , a protein that is highly expressed , or translated in large amounts from the mesothelin gene , on the surface of several types of cancer cells .
The approach , developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , shows promise in the development of immunotherapies for certain tumors .
Expression of mesothelin is normally limited to the cells that make up the protective lining ( mesothelium ) of the body ’s cavities and internal organs .
However , the protein is abundantly expressed by nearly all pancreatic cancers and mesotheliomas and by many ovarian and non-small - cell lung cancers .
Although the biological function of mesothelin is not known for certain , it is thought to play a role in the growth and metastatic spread of the cancers that express it .
“ Since tumor cells are derived from the body ’s normal cells , the immune system often does not recognize tumor molecules as dangerous or foreign and does not mount a strong attack against them , ” said Ira Pastan , M.D. , chief of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in NCI ’s Center for Cancer Research , a study collaborator .
Moreover , even though it is possible to genetically engineer immune system cells to recognize molecules on tumor cells , most of the molecules found on tumor cells are also found on normal cells .
But , Pastan notes , “ Mesothelin is a promising candidate for generating tumor - targeting T cells , given its limited expression in normal tissues and high expression in several cancers . ”
Previous laboratory research has shown that certain immune system cells , called T cells , can kill tumor cells that express mesothelin .
In addition , studies in both animals and humans have shown that antibodies directed against mesothelin protein can shrink tumors .
In the new study , the research team genetically engineered human T cells to target human mesothelin .
To produce them , a modified virus was used as a delivery vehicle , or vector , to transfer synthetic genes to T cells .
These genes directed the production of hybrid , or chimeric , proteins that can recognize and bind to mesothelin and consequently stimulate the proliferation and cell - killing activity of the T cells .
In laboratory studies , the team found that the engineered T cells proliferated and secreted multiple cytokines when exposed to mesothelin .
Cytokines are proteins that help control immune functions .
The cells also expressed proteins that made them resistant to the toxic effects of tumors and their surrounding tissues .
To study the effects of the engineered T cells on tumor tissue , the researchers implanted human mesothelioma cells underneath the skin of mice .
About six weeks later , when tumors had formed and progressed to an advanced stage , the engineered T cells were administered to the mice .
Direct injection of the T cells into tumors or into veins of the mice resulted in disappearance or shrinkage of the tumor .
“ Based on the size of the tumors and the number of cells administered , we estimate that one mesothelin - targeted T cell was able to kill about 40 tumor cells , ” said study leader Carl H. June , M.D. , Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and director of Translational Research at Penn 's Abramson Cancer Center .
“ This finding indicates that small doses of these cells may have potential in treating patients with large tumors .
Clinical trials are being developed to investigate this approach in patients with mesothelioma and ovarian cancer . ”
The study appears online the week of February 9 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
HDi's Blu-ray player is one of the first great Blu-ray + digital file players we 've seen , being BD Live compliant and playing back DivX / XVid / WMV9 / H.264/MKV files .
Best of all , it 's got a built - in BitTorrent client .

There are various players like the Network player , BD Prime , HD Base and HD Center , all of which have various mix - and - match functions .
The best player , which will be priced at about $ 800 whenever HDi finds a distributor , will have all of the above functions plus a built - in hard drive bay ( plus hard drive ) so you can download BitTorrent files to — and play back from .
There 's 2 eSATA ports as well .
This type of player would be perfect for the guy who watches Blu-ray , yet also enjoys the occasional internet - procured movie / TV show .
Here 's hoping they find a distributor soon .

Pushing Daisies
Pushing Daisies ' final , unaired episodes are going to see the light of day — just not necessarily on television .
The canceled series ' three remaining eps will be presented during April 's Paley Television Festival in Los Angeles .
Closure for fans of the show , as well as those of its fellow ABC casualties Eli Stone and Dirty Sexy Money , has been elusive , with the final salvo for each awaiting air dates — if they 're ever set .
Last month , ABC exec Stephen McPherson said the scheduling door for the final episodes was still open , telling TVGuide.com that finding programming " real estate " was a challenge .
More recently , as reported in our Mega Buzz column , the talk is that ABC will broadcast Daisies ' final episodes sometime this summer , to spur DVD sales .
For the moment , Paleyfest attendees will be the first to see Daisies ' final hours , with a screening set for Sunday , April 19 , at Hollywood 's ArcLight Cinema .
Further sweetening the deal will be series creator and executive producer Bryan Fuller , on hand to introduce the event .
While neither DSM nor Eli will be featured , other April Paley panels will include Desperate Housewives , Battlestar Galactica , Dollhouse and Dr. Horrible 's Sing - Along Blog .

Iraqi journalist Muntadar al - Zaidi , who quickly became renowned throughout the world after chucking his shoes at President George W. Bush during a press conference in Baghdad last December , took the stand in court Thursday to defend his memorable act as a gesture of self - expression , on behalf of both himself and “ the Iraqi people . ”
The Washington Post :
Throwing his shoes , fastball style , at the leader of the free world was not , Zaidi argued , a crime .
Zaidi , 30 , who is charged with assaulting a foreign head of state , posited that Bush ’s Dec. 14 trip to Baghdad was not an official visit by a foreign dignitary because he arrived in the country without prior notice and did n’t leave the Green Zone , which at the time was still under U.S. control .
“ I am charged now with attacking the prime minister ’s guest , ” he said stoically , making his first public remarks since the incident .
“ We Arabs are famous for being generous with guests .
But Bush and his soldiers have been here for six years .
Guests should knock on the door .
Those who come sneaking in are not guests . ”

During his press conference on Monday evening , President Obama pledged to look forwards rather than backwards when it came to investigating the misdeeds of the Bush administration .
It was a carefully crafted answer , designed to neither anger nor encourage individuals either side of this contentious issue .
For possible victims of legal and political injustice during the Bush years , however , it was n’t nearly enough .
Don Siegelman , the former Governor of Alabama arrested on trumped up bribery charges allegedly linked to Karl Rove , wrote the Huffington Post on Tuesday to offer his opinion of Obama ’s answer .
Today , with a new President , everything seems brighter , more vibrant .
There is a sense of hope , a new optimism … we can see change for the better coming …. piercing the dark , pain of the past eight years .
I appreciate the president ’s desire to fix the problems created by the Bush Administration saying in part : “ … let ’s get it right moving forward . ”
However , if those who have abused their power are allowed to get away with it , then it is more likely to happen again .
We have seen our American Democracy threatened , our constitutional rights abused and our system of Justice subverted .
We know the Bush Administration led us into war under false pretenses , used illegal wiretaps and torture to get information and used the Department of Justice as a political weapon to win elections .
For the country to safely move forward we must repair the damage done to the foundations of our democracy .
That starts with digging until we get the truth as Chairman John Conyers has been doing and as Senator Leahy is now proposing and holding accountable those who have abused their power .
Restoring justice and preserving our democracy requires nothing less and that would in itself be a great legacy for our new President .
Siegelman was pivoting off of a speech given on Monday by Senator Patrick Leahy , who pushed the creation of a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate the Bush years .
On Monday , Obama said he had not read Leahy ’s proposal and , as such , could n’t render an opinion on it .
His aides have said they would provide an answer to the Huffington Post when one is formulated .
The president did say that people — presumably Bush officials included — “ should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen , ” implicitly suggesting that if illegality is proven it would be brought to court .
But , he added , “ Generally speaking , I ’m more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards .
I want to pull everybody together , including , by the way , the — all the members of the intelligence community who have done things the right way and have been working hard to protect America and I think sometimes are painted with a broad brush without adequate information . ”

Linux :
The hole trick to bypass firewall restriction
Have you ever wondered how P2P software like Skype directly exchanges data when both client desktop sitting behind a firewall that only permits outgoing traffic .
ADVERTISEMENTS
This article explains how Skype & Co. get round firewalls using the hole trick .
From the article :
Peer - to - peer software applications are a network administrator ’s nightmare .
In order to be able to exchange packets with their counterpart as directly as possible they use subtle tricks to punch holes in firewalls , which should n’t actually be letting in packets from the outside world .
This is a good article and a good idea carried out by Skype .
This is not exactly a new concept ( just search for NAT2NAT using google and you will get more information about this hack ) .
Author has doen good job explaining the whole concept in clear language .
How do I bypass Linux firewall restriction ?
This article also covers DIY hole punching using standard hping2 and nc ( netcat ) tools under Linux .
From the article :
Firstly start a UDP listener on UDP port 14141 on the local / 1 console behind the firewall :
local / 1# nc -u -l -p 14141
An external computer “ remote ” then attempts to contact it .
remote# echo " hello " | nc -p 53 -u local - fw 14141
However , as expected nothing is received on local / 1 and , thanks to the firewall , nothing is returned to remote .
Now on a second console , local / 2 , hping2 , our universal tool for generating IP packets , punches a hole in the firewall :
local / 2# hping2 -c 1 - 2 -s 14141 -p 53 remote
As long as remote is behaving itself , it will send back a “ port unreachable ” response via ICMP – however this is of no consequence .
On the second attempt
remote# echo " hello " | nc -p 53 -u local - fw 14141
The netcat listener on console local / 1 then coughs up a “ hello ” – the UDP packet from outside has passed through the firewall and arrived at the computer behind it .
Right now there is no perfect solution exists , if you are using Linux based firewall to avoid abuse .

The hole trick – How Skype & Co. get round firewalls
Mozilla 's poor continuous - integration story is a major source of stress and wasted time for Mozilla developers .
Andreas Gal , for example , recently lost two consecutive weekends tracking down test failures .
The story is all too common :
Numb to everyday " random orange " from intermittent failures , nobody noticed the new test failures until there were multiple new test failures .
Many patches occupied each regression window , due to long test cycle times , combined with many developers sharing few opportunities to land .
Backing out the potentially - responsible changesets one at a time required merging and waiting through the long cycles again .
Fixing these problems will require more than incremental improvements to the Tinderbox display .
It will require , at the very least , rethinking how we organize and visualize the data coming off of our build machines .
It may even require changes to the way we allocate build machines and check in code .
Recent work
Over the last few months , there has been an explosion of client - side Tinderbox modifications and mashups .
Here 's what we have now :
The current Tinderbox ( screenshot )
My TidyBox ( screenshot )
Justin Dolske's isthetreegreen.com ( screenshot )
Markus Stange 's tinderboxpushlog ( screenshot )
Other people in the Mozilla community are also interested in improving the continuous integration experience :
Why we load Tinderbox
Developers Can I pull safely ?
Can I push now ?
Did I avoid breaking the tree so far ?
Can I go to sleep now ?
Sheriffs / firefighters
Is any column missing ?
Has anything gotten slower ?
What patch caused that slowdown ?
What patch caused that test failure ?
How do I get the tree green again ?
Build engineers
Is any machine missing or unhealthy ?
Which columns have long cycle times ?
What changes needed clobbers , indicating makefile bugs ?
Test engineers
What tests do we have ?
What tests especially good at catching real bugs ?
What tests are we skipping ?
What tests are unreliable ?
What tests are unreasonably slow , and maybe not worth running on every build if they can't be sped up ?
Tinderbox tries to answer all these questions with a single < table > .
As a result , it answers none of them well .
We can design better systems for answering each of these questions , but first , I 'd like to present an idea for eliminating the need to ask the questions in bold .
Try - to - push
By integrating the Try concept directly into the way we work , we can make the answer to the first four questions be always yes .
Under this proposal , instead of pushing to mozilla - central , everyone pushes to a server that runs all the tests , and if the tests pass , automatically pushes the changes to mozilla - central .
Then it is always ok to pull or push , because mozilla - central is always green .
If my patch breaks something , it 's immediately clear that it was my patch , and I do n't have to be around to back it out .
I have n't wasted anyone else 's time or prevented anyone else from checking in .
When there are multiple pending changesets , the automatic push should include a rebase ( or hg merge , but that 's probably more painful ) .
If my patch 's rebase fails , my patch does n't end up on mozilla - central , but I claim that the occasional automatic - merge failure ( requiring additional action from only one developer ) is less painful than the frequent backouts we have now .
Developers should be warned up - front if a patch will require manual merging in the case that other pending changesets succeed .
We should have the option of basing changes on any pending changeset in addition to mozilla - central , with the caveat that if the base fails , our changeset will not go in either .
And of course , we should still be able to use
Try to test a changeset without intending for it to go onto mozilla - central immediately .
Reducing cycle time
We can decrease cycle times drastically by splitting up the testing work more sanely .
Instead of having four unit test machines each testing a different revision ( reporting to the same column ) , have each machine run a quarter of the tests .
When the tree is calm , results will be available in a quarter of the current amount of time ; when the tree is busy , it wo n't be any slower .
The cycle time goal for most machines should be the same .
Otherwise , we 're using our resources inefficiently , because a checkin is n't done cycling until all the tests are finished .
We can make exceptions for especially slow tests , such as Valgrind , static analysis , or code coverage , but these slow tests should n't be allowed to turn the tree orange in the same way as other tests .
Finding performance regressions
Do n't make me load 53 graphs , each of which takes 6 seconds to load .
Do n't even make me eyeball 20 graphs .
Instead , Just tell me if I make Firefox slower .
( Also tell me if I increase the variance enough to make it hard to spot future slowdowns . )
Using an algorithm frees us to track more performance data , such as the time taken on of each component of SunSpider .
If a patch makes a single SunSpider file 5 % slower , that might be noise as part of the total SunSpider score , but obvious from looking at just that one file .
An algorithm might be slightly worse or slightly better than a human at noticing numeric changes , but it 's a hell of a lot more patient .
Understanding test failures
Make it easier to see which test failed .
The " short log " is n't really short , and even the summary often includes extraneous information .
Just tell me which tests failed and show the log from the execution of those tests .
Ted Mielczarek is working on making Tinderboxen produce stack traces for crashes .
This will make it possible to debug many issues quickly , even if we can't reproduce them .
Samples for hangs would useful in the same way .
It would be great if at least some of the boxes used record - and - replay to make it possible to debug other issues , including timing issues such as non-hang timeouts and race conditions .
Ideally , I 'd be able to replay in a VM on my own machine and debug the issue as it unfolds .
Fixing unreliable tests
Random oranges do n't have to happen .
If IMVU can eliminate random oranges while testing with Internet Explorer , we can do it while testing our own products .
The first step to fixing unreliable tests is finding out which tests are unreliable .
Currently , it takes a very observant sheriff to notice that the same test has failed twice in a week .
Even then , we can't search to see when the test began failing , so we do n't know whether to disable the test or hunt for a regressing bug .
We need a searchable database of test failures .
The next step is figuring out whether the test or the code is unreliable .
For now , the answer is often " mark the test as ' skip ' and hope we can figure it out later " , which is better than distracting everyone with random orange , but not ideal .
Again , record - and - replay is probably the only reliable way to find out .
Another approach to fixing unreliable tests is to use tools designed to hunt for unreliability .
Valgrind 's memcheck can find the uninitialized - variable and use - after - free bugs that only lead to crashes occasionally .
Valgrind 's helgrind can detect many types of race conditions .
Unless we build our own botnet , Valgrind tests will be too slow to be allowed to turn the tree orange , but they will give us insight into some types of bugs that cause random failures on normal test machines .
Design lunch
It 's going to take a lot of work from designers and engineers to make continuous integration work well at Mozilla 's new scale , but I think the potential payoff in increased developer productivity makes it worth the effort to get this stuff right .
I 've only proposed ways to answer some of the questions more efficiently .
I 'm just an observer -- not really a Mozilla developer , and definitely not a build engineer -- so I might have missed some important points .
John O’Duinn will host a design lunch on this topic tomorrow ( Thursday , February 19 , noon in California ) .

Our next release is 17 March 2009 .
Enjoy !
War is teaching the children of Israel and Gaza that the other side is a bloodthirsty monster , and destroying any desire for peace
Israeli soccer matches were suspended during the assault on Gaza .
When the games resumed last week , the fans had come up with a new chant : “ Why have the schools in Gaza been shut down ? ” sang the crowd .
“ Because all the children were gunned down ! ” came the answer .
Aside from its sheer barbarism , this chant reflects the widespread belief among Israeli Jews that Israel scored an impressive victory in Gaza — a victory measured , not least , by the death toll .
Israeli pilots and tank commanders could not really discriminate between the adults and the children who hid in their homes or huddled in the UNRWA shelters , and yet they chose to press the trigger .
Therefore , it is not at all surprising that the lethal onslaught left 1,314 Palestinians dead , of which 412 — or nearly one third of all of the casualties — were children .
This latest assault underscores that Israel , not unlike Hamas , readily resorts to violence and does not distinguish between civilians and combatants ( only the weapons at Israel ’s disposal are much more lethal ) .
No matter how many times the Israeli government tries to blame Hamas for the latest Palestinian civilian deaths it simply cannot explain away the body count , especially that of the children .
In addition to the dead , 1,855 Palestinian children were wounded , and tens of thousands of others have likely been traumatized , many of them for life .
Every child has a story .
A Bedouin friend recently called to tell us about his relatives in Gaza .
One cousin allowed her five - year - old daughter to walk to the adjacent house to see whether the neighbors had something left to eat .
The girl had been crying from hunger .
The moment she began crossing the street a missile exploded nearby and the flying shrapnel killed her .
The mother has since been bedridden , weeping and screaming , “ I have let my girl die hungry . ”
As if the bloody incursion was not enough , the Israeli security forces seem to be keen on spreading the flames of hatred among the Arab population within Israel .
Hundreds of Palestinian citizens of Israel have been arrested for protesting at the Israeli assault and more than 200 of them are still in custody .
One incident is enough to illustrate the psychological effect these arrests will likely have on hundreds more children .
A few days after the ceasefire , several men wearing black ski masks stormed the home of Muhammad Abu Humus .
They came to arrest him for protesting against the killings in Gaza .
It was four in the morning and the whole family was asleep when the men banged on the door .
After entering the house , they made Abu Humus ’s wife Wafa and their four children Erfat ( 12 ) , Shahd ( 9 ) , Anas ( 6 ) and Majd ( 3 ) stand in a corner as they searched the house , throwing all the clothes , sheets , toys , and kitchenware on the floor .
With tears in their eyes , the children watched as the armed men then took their father away and left .
Chance would have it that Abu Humus , a long - time peace activist and member of the Fatah party , is a personal friend of ours .
In 2001 , he joined Ta’ayush Arab - Jewish Partnership , and since then has selflessly organized countless peace rallies and other joint activities .
During the past eight years , we have spent many hours at each other ’s homes and our children have grown up respecting and liking one other .
It is hard to believe that just one month ago he attended the Bar Mitzvah of Yigal ’s son in a Jerusalem synagogue .
Muhammad and Wafa Abu Humus have tried over the years to instill in their children a love and desire for peace , and while the security forces may not have destroyed this , the hatred they have generated in one night cannot be underestimated .
Indeed , what , one might ask , will his children think of their Jewish neighbors ?
What feelings will they harbor ?
And what can we expect from those children in Gaza who have witnessed the killing of their parents , siblings , friends and neighbors ?
We emphasize the Palestinian children because so many of them have been killed and terrorized in the past month .
Yet it is clear that Israeli children are suffering as well , particularly those who have spent long periods in shelters for fear of being hit by rockets .
The one message that is being conveyed to children on both sides of this fray is that the other side is a bloodthirsty monster .
In Israel , this was instantly translated into gains for the hate - mongering Yisrael Beytenu party headed by the xenophobic Avigdor Lieberman , who is now the front - runner in mock polls being held in many Jewish high schools , with the hawkish Binyamin Netanyahu coming in second .
Hatred , in other words , is the great winner of this war .
It has helped mobilize racist mobs , and as the soccer chant indicates it has left absolutely no place for the other , undermining even basic empathy for innocent children .
Israel ’s masters of war must be happy : the seeds of the next wars have certainly been sown .

Every Geek can find this Book Shelf
Tree a simple and very viable solution as seen in InformationNation .
I mean , what is wrong with it ?
Creativity is totally accepted this holiday .
The 2nd one from JingJunk is another Geeky way to arrange books to bring in the spirit .
It may have been done to lure people to come in the shop , but c’mon… it is a new Christmas Tree either way .
Math Geek Christmas Tree
I for one do not want to be solving Geeks Math problems for Christmas , but this Tree from TVSnob is a really great creation .
What is it for I have no idea , but it is still funny to look at .
Video Game Christmas Tree Wishes
This was a Christmas Wish from Gamertell just last year , and it is highly creative remake of the old classic video game .
When I see things like these , it makes me appreciate the holiday season .
Frat Party Christmas Tree
So this may have been a frat initiation or creativity to celebrate the holiday .
Either way , this Christmas Tree from FunnyHub is a great way to build a tree with whatever you have available .
It is funny though that the barrels and lights were available , but they did n’t think of using an actual tree .
Why ?
More barrels available ?
LED Christmas Trees
I was n’t sure about this one from DVICE , but then I thought , simplicity is sometimes extra special .
It may not be made from paper , but it still is n’t too extravagant and just there to prove a point … Merry Christmas .
On second try , I found this other Christmas Tree project from HackedGadgets which is really impressive , lighting up as it ’s spinning .
Ok , so third time is a charm .
Make has showed a Battery Christmas Tree DIY that may be tiny but the result is beautiful .

You may be alone for the holidays or unable to get a real tree , so this is a great alternative to have …without the huge expense .
Papercraft Christmas Trees
Ok , so calling this Christmas Tree from Cambodia4kidsorg may be far fetched , but it is the thought that matters .
Someone may have provided a challenge to use whatever is within arm ’s length , and so this papercraft creation with a CD hanging above came about for the Season ’s end .
The second one from CoolBusiness Ideas may be a little neater , but does n’t stand tall next to the other .
Still , it is also nice Christmas
Trees ideas for those having to work late and still want to celebrate the spirit in one way or another .
Another DIY Christmas Tree Project from Make , it is a Tree Projector which should not be overlooked .

The single most helpful thing that can happen to a nethack character is getting to make a wish .
In nethack , a wish means you get to type in the name of an item , and that item will be added to your inventory .
If you know what to wish for , a single wish will approximately halve your chances of not winning .
How to get a wish
The main way you ’ll get your first wish it by finding a magic lamp .
Your first job is to find a lamp .
Lamps are n’t all that uncommon , and about 20 % of them are magic .
Your second job is to find out whether your lamp is magic .
Do this by casting identify , or , alternatively , try dropping it in a store ( or , if it ’s already in a store , try picking it up ) .
If the price is more than 30 gold , it ’s magic .
Buy it if you have to .
Now your job is to bless your magic lamp .
You do that by finding out whether it ’s blessed or cursed already .
If it ’s cursed , you have to remove the curse ; you can do that mainly by dipping it in holy water or wielding it while reading a noncursed scroll of remove curse .
If it ’s uncursed , you need to dip it in holy water to bless it .
You get holy water by dropping uncursed water in a chaotic altar and praying there .
Once you have a blessed magic lamp , #rub it over and over .
Eventually a djinn will come out , and will give you a wish 80 % of the time .
You can also get wishes by finding a throne – a “ \ ” – and #sitting on it over and over until it vanishes .
Make sure to drop all your gold first ; the only negative effect of sitting on thrones to speak of is to remove all your gold .
One of the random positive effects is to grant you a wish .
The other place you ’re likely to get a wish is in the Castle , which is around dungeon level 15 - 30 .
It ’s tough to miss .
If you survive to storm the castle , there ’s always a wand of wishing in one of the four towers , and never any other kind of wand in one of the towers , so when you get a wand there , it ’s a wishing wand .
There are other ways to get wishes , but they ’re all fairly unlikely .
If you ’re interested , read this .
How to wish
Wishes are rare and valuable enough that you should go out of your way not to typo them .
I suggest going to this post or to the wishing spoiler above , highlighting the exact text of the item , and pasting it into your terminal .
BE CAREFUL .
Think before every keystroke .
Do not accidentally touch the keyboard .
What to wish for
This section assumes you ’re a wizard with a book of identify .
For more general guidelines , read the wishing spoiler .
If the wish came from a Wand of Wishing , and you do not have any scrolls of charging , wish for :
2 blessed scrolls of charging
Reading one of these after you ’ve depleted your wand ’s wishes will replenish it ( once per wand ) with 3 more wishes .
Otherwise , the first thing you should wish for is always :
blessed +3 silver dragon scale mail
The armor wo n’t always be +3 ; it has a 50 % chance of being +0 instead .
It does n’t really matter ; either way it provides excellent armor class , which means you ’ll take much less damage from physical attacks .
Unlike most strong armor , it will not make your spells more likely to fizzle , and it is not very heavy .
Also , it provides the second most important intrinsic in the game ; reflection .
All directional magical attacks will bounce off you and probably hit their casters .
That means that when a dangerous wand gets picked up by a monster , as often happens , their lightning bolts or fire blasts wo n’t hurt you .
It also lets you physically attack floating eyes and Medusa with impunity to their gaze attacks .
The reason you ’re going for the second most important intrinsic is that , as a wizard , you already have the most important one ; magic resistance .
You get that from a cloak you start the game with , that you will later swap out for Magicbane .
What you spend your second wish on depends on whether you have two or more unique artifacts .
When you do , your wishes for more unique artifacts can fail ; you do not want to take that risk .
You almost certainly have Magicbane by the time you get your second wish , so it comes down to whether you ’ve found a second random artifact lying around or finished the quest .
It ’s quite likely that your second wish comes from the wand of wishing in the castle , which will be after you ’ve completed the wizard Quest , which gives you an artifact .
Do not delay completing the quest so that you can wish for an artifact .
The Quest artifact is worth getting early , and artifact wishes are not _that_ much more important than normal ones .
If you have only one or zero artifacts in your inventory when it ’s time for your second wish , wish for :
blessed Master Key of Thievery
( Do n’t wish for it if you ’re low on health ; it will do 2 - 20 damage to you when you first touch it and every time you pick it up . )
Just having it in your inventory gives you the ability to choose your destination whenever you teleport , making it a very attractive proposition to eat leprechaun , nymph , or tengu corpses , all of which will make you automatically teleport every once in a while .
It reduces all physical damage you take by half .
Last , every time you #apply it to unlock a door or chest ( which always succeeds ) , it will tell you a “ rumor ” about the game .
As long as the key remains blessed , the rumor will always be true .
Any remaining wishes you ’re lucky enough to make , in order :
blessed fireproof + 2 pair of speed boots – unless you already have speed boots .
They let you take 1.6 more turns than normal .
Technically , they slow the rest of the game down .

blessed amulet of life saving – unless you already have one .
If you die while wearing one of these , it uses up the amulet , restores you to full health , and cancels all status ailments ( which otherwise might just kill you again immediately )
– unless you already have one .
If you die while wearing one of these , it uses up the amulet , restores you to full health , and cancels all status ailments ( which otherwise might just kill you again immediately ) blessed bag of holding – unless you have a bag of holding already ( which is quite likely ) .
These quadruple the amount of stuff you can carry around with you , which is likely to be a concern by the time you get this many wishes , if you do .
– unless you have a bag of holding already ( which is quite likely ) .
These quadruple the amount of stuff you can carry around with you , which is likely to be a concern by the time you get this many wishes , if you do .
uncursed magic marker –
If you have no scrolls of charging , the first thing you do is write one of those .
When the marker is used up , you can recharge it with that .
Then you use this to write scrolls of enchant armor .
You use them to get all your armor up to +4 or +5 ( going beyond that can destroy the armor ) .
Only write on blessed scrolls of blank paper ; you can make scrolls blank by dipping them in fountains , then dropping them , then picking them back up .
You can make them blessed by dipping them en masse into holy water .
You get holy water by dropping potions of water on chaotic altars and then #pray ing there .
You get water by dipping useless potions in fountains .

blessed rustproof +3 gauntlets of power – unless you already have some , you have gauntlets of dexterity , or you have a +2 or +3 ring of increase damage .
These will hinder your spell casting , but increase your strength to 25 , making you do more damage and letting you carry more .
If you need to cast the more difficult spells , you can always take off your gloves .

– yes , a second one , and even a third one , if it takes that many to get all your armor up to at least + 4 . blessed ring of slow digestion – unless you already have one
– unless you already have one blessed ring of polymorph control – if you do n’t already have one , and you do have a spell or wand of polymorph , and you have a lot of useful but expendable rings and amulets .
Take off your armor , polymorph yourself into a Xorn , and eat all your rings of increase damage , increase accuracy , invisibility , polymorph control , protection , searching , see invisibile , stealth , and teleport control .
Also eat any amulets of magical breathing .
Each of these has a 1/3 of permenantly granting you the benefit of the ring / amulet without you having to wear it .
Your xorn - ness will wear off after a little while , and you can put your armor back on .
You might notice that Xorns can only eat some of the rings listed above – it ’s the ones that were described as some kind of metal before you identified them .
You can also polymorph into a Gelatinous Cube as well to eat more rings – the organic ones – if you want / need to .

Most Apple fans have seen the Apple product cycle parody .
Actually , it 's barely a parody .
In the immortal words of Homer , " It 's funny because it 's true ! "
Well , Hannibal 's recent post reminded me of a well - known variant of the Apple product cycle .
This one usually involves Steve Jobs directly , and it goes something like this .
Some new product or technology enters the realm of feasibility .
( Feasibility of implementation , that is , not necessarily of production at a reasonable cost . )
Slavering Mac enthusiasts discuss how cool it'd be " if Apple made one of these . "
" Discussion " becomes " rumor " within weeks .
The widespread rumors cause reporters to ask Steve Jobs if Apple is , in fact , doing what the rumors suggest .
Jobs says that Apple does not discuss future products , but then goes on to explain why this particular kind of product or technology is really , really stupid .
Enthusiasm wanes among the Apple faithful as Jobs repeatedly bashes the rumored product idea .
Jobs continues to bash the idea , but starts to change the language subtly .
For example , " I ca n't imagine anyone actually using such a thing " becomes " All the existing products of this type suck " or " No one has figured out how to do it right yet . "
Apple either introduces the rumored product , claiming that it 's finally been Done Right™ , or Apple kills the project internally .
Somewhere in that list of steps is another , implied step : " Apple starts working on the rumored product . "
I suspect that it usually comes between steps 1 and 2 .
The final step is the really tricky one .
Since there 's no public announcement if the project is killed internally , the rumor can linger on for years afterwards .
( The Apple PDA is a great example of this . )
Also , the cycle can restart itself multiple times for the same product idea .
( cf. the Mac tablet . )
But the most important steps are 3 and 5 .
By step 3 , you can be assured that Apple has at least considered the product idea , and may have started a project to investigate or implement it .
By step 5 , you can be nearly certain that Apple has a project well underway .
The only remaining question is whether it 'll make it out of incubation and into the market .
This may seem like a wishy - washy list with no predictive powers , but it has its uses .
For example , back in January of this year , I was arguing with Cringely over email about the prospect of a video iPod or iTunes Movie Store .
Cringely was convinced that an announcement was imminent .
He had a lot of good circumstantial evidence to support his position : technologies like H.264 , cheaper Macs , decreased bandwidth costs , etc .
I argued that the idea was n't ripe yet , and my sole source for this prediction was the cycle described above .
Cringely acknowledged the nature of the cycle , but he failed to account for step 5 .
His theory was that Jobs criticizes a product idea right up to the point where he triumphantly enters the market .
But he neglected to look for that subtle change in tone .
As of January 2005 , Jobs had not yet softened his rhetoric .
He was still expressing unequivocal doom and gloom about the entire idea of portable video .
There 'd been no " cooling off " period .
He had n't yet reached step 5 .
January 's MacWorld Expo came and went without a video iPod or iTunes Movie Store announcement .
Granted , that 's hardly scientific , and really proves nothing .
But without any inside information , my educated guesses based on past experiences with pubic statements from Jobs / Apple and the subsequent Apple product announcements ( or lack thereof ) are all I have to go on .
Here 's another example of The System in action .
This quote from an Apple earnings conference call shortly before the introduction of the Mac mini convinced me that Apple planned to introduce a sub -$ 800 Mac sometime soon .
" To date , we have chosen to not compete in the sub $ 800 desktop market and have put that R&D investment into expanding our products in the music area and software and hardware . "
The key words were " to date " and " chosen . "
These soften the statement in comparison to earlier dismissals of the " cheap PC " market .
My translation of Apple 's statement was , " We plan to compete in the sub - $ 800 desktop market in the future . "
It was as plain as day .
So , applying The System to the video iPod , we see that it 's just hit step 5 .
It 's nearly assured to be a real project .
The only remaining question is , will it make it to market ?
At this point , I think the odds have tipped in its favor .
I say this not just because of The System , but also because , as Hannibal pointed out , Sony has already gotten a head start in the market .
While Apple has become the " Sony " of the post - WalkMan era , the last thing they want is for Sony to become the " Apple " of the post - iPod era .
Right now , the PSP is most comparable to the Rio and Archos devices in the early days of the digital music market .
As a portable video player , the PSP is merely a geek curiosity .
But that could change in a hurry if it attains a critical mass of content , customers , or both .
If Apple wants to continue the iPod 's dominance of portable digital media , it needs to act soon .

If your university has been shut down due to COVID - 19 or your lectures have to be conducted remotely , you may be thinking about leaving your student accommodation .
Here ’s everything you need to know if you need to leave your university accommodation due to Coronavirus restrictions .
Ruby on Rail is made up of a variety of code modules packaged as Ruby Gems .
For example , Rails is composed of gems such as ActionController , ActionView , ActionRecord , and few other gems .
It might sound surprising at first , but you can use ActiveRecord without the other Rails components .
ActiveRecord is an Object Relational Mapper ( ORM ) , it binds database records to Ruby classes that act as models to your data .
ActiveRecord models allow you to post and query data to and from a relational database .
To use ActiveRecord , you will need to have it installed in your system .
If you already have Rails , ActiveRecord is already part of your Ruby gems environment .
If not , you can install it via the following command .
sudo gem install activerecord
Once the ActiveRecord gem is installed in your system , you can require it in your Ruby scripts .
require ' rubygems ' require ' active_record '
In a Ruby on Rails project , the only configuration not defaulted through convention is the information required to setup your database connection .
In Rails , you usually have a config / database .yml file to point to the right database used in your web application .
This information is passed to ActiveRecord to establish a database connection .
In a Ruby script , a non-Rails project , you can manually create a database connection with the following snippet .
ActiveRecord ::Base.establish_connection ( :adapter => ' mysql ' , : database => DB_NAME , :username => DB_USERNAME , : password => DB_PASSWORD , :host => LOCALHOST , : port => DB_PORT )
Obviously , you would need to replace the placeholders for the correct database name , username , and password to connect to your database .
There are times when you might need to enable the logger .
You might get an undefined method or nil object error if you do n’t set a value to the ActiveRecord logger .
You can configure ActiveRecord to log to the standard error or standard output .
To accomplish this , first require the logger gem then initialize and set the ActiveRecord logger .
ActiveRecord :: Base.logger = Logger.new ( STDERR )
That is essentially all that is required .
Once you have a database connection , you can create models as you would in a Rails project .
class Post < ActiveRecord :: Base end p = Post. new ( : title => title , : body => body ) p.save
If you require ActiveRecord in your Ruby script , you can also use it to create database schema migrations .
Once you have established an connection to the database you can run a schema migration such as the following .
create_table " users " , : force => true do |t| t.integer " twitter_id " , : default => 0 , :null => false t.string " user_name " , : limit => 20 , : default => " " , : null => false t.string " screen_name " , : limit => 30 , : default => " " , : null => false t.string " location " , : limit => 50 , : default => " " , : null => false t.string " url " , : limit => 50 , : default => " " , : null => false end
There are a few other ORMs written in Ruby , such as DataMapper and Sequel .
One key factor of using ActiveRecord is that if you had dabbled with Rails before you already have it in your system , you do n’t have to learn anything new , and you can be productive with it rather quickly .
And as the great American economist Irving Fisher pointed out in the 1930s , the things people and companies do when they realize they have too much debt tend to be self - defeating when everyone tries to do them at the same time .
Attempts to sell assets and pay off debt deepen the plunge in asset prices , further reducing net worth .
Attempts to save more translate into a collapse of consumer demand , deepening the economic slump .
Are policy makers ready to do what it takes to break this vicious circle ?
In principle , yes .
Government officials understand the issue : we need to “ contain what is a very damaging and potentially deflationary spiral , ” says Lawrence Summers , a top Obama economic adviser .
In practice , however , the policies currently on offer do n’t look adequate to the challenge .
The fiscal stimulus plan , while it will certainly help , probably wo n’t do more than mitigate the economic side effects of debt deflation .
And the much - awaited announcement of the bank rescue plan left everyone confused rather than reassured .
There ’s hope that the bank rescue will eventually turn into something stronger .
It has been interesting to watch the idea of temporary bank nationalization move from the fringe to mainstream acceptance , with even Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham conceding that it may be necessary .
But even if we eventually do what ’s needed on the bank front , that will solve only part of the problem .
If you want to see what it really takes to boot the economy out of a debt trap , look at the large public works program , otherwise known as World War II , that ended the Great Depression .
The war did n’t just lead to full employment .
It also led to rapidly rising incomes and substantial inflation , all with virtually no borrowing by the private sector .
By 1945 the government ’s debt had soared , but the ratio of private - sector debt to G.D.P. was only half what it had been in 1940 .
And this low level of private debt helped set the stage for the great postwar boom .
Since nothing like that is on the table , or seems likely to get on the table any time soon , it will take years for families and firms to work off the debt they ran up so blithely .
The odds are that the legacy of our time of illusion  our decade at Bernie ’s  will be a long , painful slump .
Implementation of an idea for supporting certain kinds of GUI : that is state based , user - driven ones .
The GUI is intended to manipulate a state , and it is responsive rather than active .
Configuration is an example .
May 2020 Warning : there is a known issue that prevents many graphical of this mod from working .
The known workaround is to extract all the VPKs from both Half Life 2 : Episode 1 and Half Life 2 : Episode 2 into the mod folder .
Sorry for the inconvenience !
This is everything you need ( provided you have Half Life 2 Episode 2 and Steam ) to play the mod , including installation instructions .
The mod is a singleplayer adventure through a surreal facility .
It features many new textures and sounds , as well as 2 new guns .
“ Did he have rags on his feet instead of shoes ? ” Mr. Rosenblat said he asked her .
She said yes and he told her , “ That boy was me . ”
In a telephone interview Sunday , Ms. Hurst , who sold the book to Berkley for less than $ 50,000 , said she always believed the essential truth of Mr. Rosenblat ’s tale until last week .
“ I believed the teller , ” Ms. Hurst said .
“ He was in so many magazines and books and on ‘ Oprah . ’
It did not seem like it would not be true . ”
On Sunday , Ms. Hurst said that she was reviewing her legal options because “ I ’ve yet to see what kind of repercussions could come from this , and I was lied to . ”
Ms. Hurst said that Mr. Rosenblat did provide some documentation , including a 1946 letter from a warden with the Jewish Children ’s Community Committee for the Care of Children From the Camps that said Mr. Rosenblat had attended a technical school in London .
Evidence of an organization with that name did not appear in Internet searches on Sunday .
Susanna Margolis , a New York - based ghost writer who polished Mr. Rosenblat ’s manuscript , said she was surprised by his description of his first blind date with Ms. Radzicki .
“ I thought that was far - fetched . ” she said .
“ But if somebody comes to you , as an agent and a publisher , and says , ‘ This is my story , ’ how do you check it other than to say , ‘ Did this happen ? ’ ”
That so many would get taken in by Mr. Rosenblat ’s inauthentic love story seems incredible given the number of fake memoirs that have come to light in the last few years .
The Holocaust in particular has been fertile territory for fabricated personal histories : earlier this year , Misha Defonseca confessed that her memoir , “ Misha : A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years , ” about her childhood spent running from the Nazis and living with wolves , was not true .
A decade ago , a Swiss historian debunked Binjamin Wilkomirski ’s 1996 memoir , “ Fragments , ” which described how he survived as a Latvian Jewish orphan in a Nazi concentration camp .
It turns out the book was written by Bruno Doessekker , a Swiss man who spent the war in relative comfort in Switzerland .
Mr. Rosenblat , at least , appears to have told the truth about being a prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps .
The primary sleuth in unmasking his fabrication of the apple story was Kenneth Waltzer , director of Jewish studies at Michigan State University .
He has been working on a book on how 904 boys  including the Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel  were saved from death by an underground rescue operation inside Buchenwald , and has interviewed hundreds of survivors , including boys from the ghetto at Piotrkow in Poland who were taken with the young Herman Rosenblat to the camp .
Former NPD Official Speaks Out Hitler Salutes , Nazi Songs and Dreams of a New Reich
Uwe Luthardt was a senior member of the right - extremist NPD .
But he quit after three months .
In an interview , he describes the NPD as a deeply radical party where Hitler salutes and financial irregularities are common -- and which is bent on restoring the German Reich .
A photo making the rounds on the Internet appears to conform to descriptions of a next - generation Mac mini published by AppleInsider earlier in the year .
The photo shows the rear of a Mac mini that includes five USB ports instead of 4 , both mini DVI and Mini DisplayPort connectors , and FireWire 800 instead of 400 — all of which were specifications for a next - generation Mac mini first published by AppleInsider back in January ( 1 , 2 ) .
For what it 's worth , this is the second picture of a Mac mini seen by AppleInsider with such a port makeup , the first of which we were asked not to publish .
While we cannot vouch for the authenticity of this new photo , it shows a Mac mini that is identical in every way to the system in the unpublished photo , which was said to be a prototype from last fall .
People familiar with Apple 's plans have said that the new Mac mini , like Apple 's MacBook families and upcoming line of iMacs , will be powered by chipsets from NVIDIA Corp .
However , with no official announcement from Apple , and two photos of the same unreleased system making the rounds in as many months , there 's an outside chance the company may have recently changed its course for the next - gen Mac mini .

Gibbs : Obama a ' Restless Soul '
By Anne E. Kornblut
Is President Obama already feeling cooped up in the White House ?
Signs are beginning to emerge that point in that direction .
After telling a group of local school children that he was glad to get out of the house last week , Obama has now scheduled two back - to - back town hall meetings next week -- in Indiana and Florida .
" I think the president looks forward to getting out of town for a few hours , " White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters this afternoon .
Obama plans to hear directly from people affected by the economic crisis on those two trips , scheduled for Monday and Tuesday .
But first , this weekend , Obama is taking his family to Camp David for the first time , for a one - night stay on Saturday , Gibbs said .
And on Thursday , he is supposed to travel to Springfield , Ill. -- returning to Washington only to head off to Chicago for Valentine 's Day .
Less than three weeks into his presidency , Obama has proven to be more active in and around Washington than his predecessor , going out to restaurants and tonight taking Michelle Obama to the Kennedy Center for the first time .
Asked whether the additional travel is a sign that Obama is already feeling hemmed in , Gibbs did not deny it , saying his boss is a " restless soul . "

There has been a distinct change in tone from the Obama team today , as they seem to have become suddenly aware that there ’s a real risk that the stimulus plan will either fail to pass , or be emasculated to the point that it does n’t come close to doing the job .
Obama himself has warned of catastrophe if we fail to act , and — finally ! – denounced the tax - cut philosophy .
Meanwhile , Larry Summers has finally made the point I ’ve been pushing for a while — that we ’re at major risk of falling into a deflationary trap .
I thought it might be useful to present a bit of evidence behind that concern .
The figure above plots an estimate of the output gap — the difference between actual and potential GDP , as a percentage of potential — and the change in the inflation rate .
Both series are taken from the IMF WEO database , for convenience , and use data from 1980 - 2007 .
It ’s not a perfect fit — this is economics , not physics , and anyway stuff besides the output gap bounces inflation around from year to year .
But still , there ’s a clear correlation , driven largely but not entirely by the deep slump and disinflation of the early 1980s , and an implied slope of about 0.5 — that is , every percentage point by which real GDP fall short of potential tends to reduce the inflation rate by about half a point over the course of the year .
And right now the CBO is saying that in the absence of a policy action the average output gap will average 6.8 percent over the next two years .
Do the math : if anything like the historical relationship between output and inflation holds , we ’re looking at major deflation .
OK , maybe that relationship wo n’t hold — getting to actual deflation may take a deeper slump than merely reducing the inflation rate .
And maybe a regression driven in part by 80s data is n’t a good guide to current events .
But deflation is a huge risk — and getting out of a deflationary trap is very , very hard .
We truly are flirting with disaster .
January 5th , 2009 | Published in erlang , performance , scalability , web , yaws | 4 Comments | Bookmark on Pinboard .in
A few months back Klacke gave me committer rights for Yaws .
I ’ve made a few fixes here and there , including adding support for passing “ * ” as the request URI for OPTIONS , enabling OPTIONS requests to be dispatched to appmods and yapps , and completing a previously - submitted patch for configuring the listen backlog .
Klacke has just started putting a test framework into the codebase and build system so that contributors can include tests with any patches or new code they submit , and I ’ve contributed to that as well .
The biggest feature I ’ve added to date , though , is a new linked - in driver that allows Yaws to use the sendfile system call on Linux , OS X , and FreeBSD .
I never wrote a linked - in driver before , so I was happy and fortunate to have an Erlang expert like Klacke providing hints and reviewing my code .
I did some preliminary testing that showed that sendfile definitely improves CPU usage across the board but depending on file size , sometimes does so at the cost of increasing request times .
I used my otherwise idle 2 - core 2.4GHz Ubuntu 8.04.1
Dell box with 2 GB of RAM , and ran Apache Bench ( ab ) from another Linux host to simulate 50 concurrent clients downloading a 64 k data file a total of 100000 times .
I saw that user / system CPU on the web host tended to run around 33%/ 28 % without sendfile , while with sendfile it dropped to 22%/17 % .
The trade - off was request time , though , where each request for the 64 k file averaged 0.928ms with sendfile but 0.567 ms without .
With larger files , however , sendfile is slightly faster and still has better CPU usage .
For example , with a 256 k file , sendfile averaged 2.251 ms per request with user / system CPU at 8%/16 % whereas it was 2.255 ms and 16%/27 % CPU without sendfile , which makes me wonder if the figures for the 64 k file are outliers for some reason .
I performed these measurements fairly quickly , so while I believe they ’re reasonably accurate , do n’t take them as formal results .
On my MacBook Pro laptop running OS X 10.5.6 , CPU usage did n’t seem to differ much whether I used sendfile or not , but requests across the board tended to be slightly faster with sendfile .
I ran FreeBSD 7.0.1 in a Parallels VM on my laptop , and there I saw significantly better system CPU usage with sendfile than without , sometimes as much as a 30 % improvement .
Requests were also noticeably faster with sendfile than without , sometimes by as much as 17 % , and again depending on file size , with higher improvements for larger files .
User CPU was not a factor .
All in all , though , I do n’t know how much the fact that I ran all this within a VM affected these numbers .
Given that Yaws is often used for delivering mainly dynamic content , sendfile wo n’t affect those cases .
Still , I think it ’s nice to have it available for the times when you do have to deliver file - based content , especially if the files are of the larger variety .
Anyway , I committed this support to the Yaws svn repository back around December 21 or so .
If you ’d like to do your own testing , please feel free — I ’d be interested in learning your results .
Also , if you have ideas for further tests I might try , please leave a comment to let me know .
Five years ago , the thought of having to wear a GPS ankle bracelet so authorities could track your whereabouts may have been humiliating , but a suitable alternative to prison .
Now , thanks to online social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter , these tracking devices are on the path to extinction as millions of American choose to be voluntarily tracked , preferring a virtual imprisonment over a life of privacy .
Okay , so I ’m guilty of falling prey to these temptations — namely for networking reasons , finding long - lost friends , and helping the FBI shave off man-hours as they keep tabs on my subversive humor and satirical attacks on government institutions .
I realize that humorists / satirists are somewhere between Jehovah Witnesses and Salvation Army Bell Ringers on the FBI ’s watch list , but every minute I give back to the bureau can be better spent tracking down the real criminals : offshore bankers and video pirates .
By the way , did I mention I ’m a Conspiracy Theorist ?
Yeah , you heard me right Mr. FBI Guy ; stuff that in your secret computer file and smoke it .
Ever since I read George Orwell ’s “ 1984 ” in eighth grade , I ’m convinced that Big Brother is watching my every move .
For example , I refuse to use automatic toilets in public restrooms , sensing they are elaborate tracking devices that record your whereabouts and activities via the red lights .
Therapist Bob said this is absurd , but I ’m not about to take any chances and flush my rights away .
And now we ’re seeing the trickle down effects of Big Brother as local authorities are getting into the social spying networking game .
Just recently a female college student was reported missing in Iowa City after a night of drinking with her real friends .
Hmmmm ….
I ’m sure this never happens in a college town , thus raising red flags down at the police department .
Local peace officers eventually tracked her down , claiming they used Facebook to discover her whereabouts .
They did not say how they did this , but I imagine they sent her a Friend Request .
Nothing like getting one of these in you notification box : “ The Iowa City Police Department wants to be your friend : Confirm ? ”
By the way , if anyone receives the following status update from me , you know something is amiss and should text message the authorities immediately :
“ T.M. Lindsey is enjoying shopping for women ’s underwear at Wal - Mart . ”
Anyone who really knows me would know that I would not be caught dead shopping at Wal - Mart .
And if I was caught dead , the county coroner , thankfully , would be the only witness as to why I was shopping there in the first place .
I ’ll plea the fifth on this one .
Then along comes Twitter , for those folks who just can’t leave home without their personal trackers .
I will admit that I have yet to take the full plunge into Twitter , namely because I ’ve developed a false Messiah complex and worry that a bunch of my followers will start their own narcissistic pilgrimages into the blogsphere and start publishing their own musings from the basement while wearing pajamas and women ’s underwear .
I am not wired to handle this much responsibility .
And in Twitterville , if you are not being followed , you are following somebody else , thus completing the full circle of consensual stalking .
Iowa City ’s neighbor , Coralville , has gone Twitter , including its police department .
Not sure who would intentionally want the police department following them , but I imagine it ’s the same folks who actually talk to pollsters when they Break & Enter their phone lines .
But what does the Facebook phenomenon reveal about our need - for - attention culture ?
On a basic level , is n’t Facebook the mere equivalent of standing at the end of the diving board at the virtual pool and shouting to all of your friends : “ Look at me !
Look at me ! ” ?
Are you ready to take the Facebook plunge ?
Moreover , Facebook serves as a virtual playground for adults , who can tag and poke each other without fear of having their recess stripped from them .
These behaviors , however , serve as naughty gateway behaviors leading to bigger and more dangerous behaviors such as writing on friends ’ walls .
“ Friends do n’t let friends write on friend ’s walls . ”
It wo n’t be long before Facebook goes below the neck and launches an adult version that begs the status update question : “ What are you wearing right now ? ”
“ T.M. Lindsey is not wearing women ’s underwear at the moment . ”

Experts , you half - witted whelp of a mongrel bitch , think not .
Marc Bekoff , professor emeritus of evolutionary biology at the University of Colorado and author of The Emotional Lives of Animals : My Subtitle Is Too Long to Fit on the Page , puts it thus : " I would say that a lion could be — as could any other animal — but it 's extremely rare , because animals who live in social groups really depend on one another .
They need to be concerned with their own safety .
They need to be concerned about protecting their young .
They need to be concerned with getting food .
So they do n't really have a lot of time to misbehave .
" I guess a lion in a zoo could be an asshole to another lion — steal food or invite them to play and then beat them up — but they 're not dependent on the other lion to share food or help them get food .
If you look at a pride of lions in the wild , or a group of wolves , they really have close social bonds .
Coyotes that are overly aggressive — mean , if you will — usually do n't stay in the group .
Being mean for no good reason is something that other group members do n't tolerate .
In humans , we can get away with a lot , because we 're not that dependent on others . "
Tracey Barnes , animal keeper at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park , says , " The answer really is no .
Sometimes you end up with an animal that really just does better if he 's secluded and if you kind of leave him alone .
But to the best of our ability , we try to give them enrichment and to work through those issues . "
Keeper Barnes , by the way , will be heading the zoo 's team of experts in charge of Dick Cheney 's post - VP well - being .

On one occasion , Iran itself is understood to have destroyed a nuclear facility near Tehran , bulldozing over the remains and replacing it with a football pitch , after its existence was revealed to UN inspectors .
The regime feared that the discovery by inspectors of an undeclared nuclear facility would result in overwhelming pressure at the UN for tougher action against Iran .
As the U.S. Air Force celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 1997 , it is fitting that the man who did much to help bring the Air Force into being should be remembered .
William ‘ Billy ’ Mitchell was a crusader who had the vision to understand the potential of air power long before his contemporaries .
The name Billy Mitchell brings different images to mind .
To most , he was a hero , without whose dire warning the United States might never have been able to field the world ’s largest air force in time to fight World War II .
To others , he was an ambitious egotist and zealot who ran roughshod over anyone who opposed his views on air power , especially his military and civilian superiors .
In a sense , the barnstorming era of the 1920s was also the Billy Mitchell era , because it was his voice that first loudly proclaimed the need for strong air defenses .
Long before anyone else , he vigorously advanced the theory that the airplane would replace the fleet as America ’s first line of defense .
He also saw the flying machine as a strategic weapon that could take a war to an enemy ’s industrial resources .
Mitchell was born in Nice , France , in 1879 , the son of a U.S. senator .
At age 18 , he enlisted in the Army as a private when the Spanish - American War broke out .
He was commissioned and served in the Army Signal Corps in Cuba , the Philippines and Alaska before becoming interested in aviation .
As early as 1906 , however , he prophesied in the Cavalry Journal that ‘ conflicts , no doubt , will be carried out in the future in the air . ’
After the first aircraft was purchased by the Army , he wrote several more articles pointing out that airplanes would be useful for reconnaissance , for preventing enemy forces from conducting reconnaissance and for offensive action against enemy submarines and ships .
Mitchell was assigned to the Army General Staff in Washington in 1912 as a captain ; at age 32 , he was the youngest officer ever assigned to that important post .
He prepared a report on the needs of American aviation and argued that , with the advances then being made in aeronautics , the United States was being drawn ever closer to its potential enemies and that distance would soon have to be measured in time , not miles .
Promoted to major , Mitchell was considered too old and held too high a rank for flight training .
Convinced that his future lay in aviation , however , he paid for his own flying lessons at a civilian flying school at Newport News , Va. , and later received a rating as a junior military aviator .
In April 1917 , by then a lieutenant colonel , he was assigned to the American Expeditionary Forces in France and became one of the first Americans on the scene after the United States declared war on Germany .
He immediately fought for the creation of American air units in France but was frustrated by the delay in getting American planes and pilots into the war .
It galled him that the French had to provide air protection over the American lines , resulting in what Mitchell viewed as a lack of control and effectiveness .
Mitchell met British General Hugh ‘ Boom ’ Trenchard and quickly adopted his thesis that military air power could and should be used in a ‘ relentless and incessant offensive ’ in wartime and , if so used , would one day become much more important in military strategy than sea power .
Slowly , American pilots arrived , were assigned to squadrons and were put in the air in French planes .
In March 1918 the Germans began a desperate push against the Allies , and Mitchell was placed in charge of all American aviation units at the front .
On Sunday , April 14 , 1918 , a year after the United States entered the war , Mitchell declared that America had finally put its first squadron into combat .
His flair for combat leadership was subsequently proved at the Battle of Saint - Mihiel when he coordinated a force of 1,481 British , French and Italian planes to support American ground forces .
He was promoted to brigadier general and became more vocal about the importance of a strong military air arm .
He quickly earned the enmity of his nonflying contemporaries for his aggressiveness in building airfields , hangars and other facilities .
His flamboyance , ability to gain the attention of the press and willingness to proceed unhampered by precedent made him the best - known American in Europe .
Mitchell returned to the States as a hero in 1919 and was appointed assistant chief of the U.S. Army Air Service .
He was appalled at how quickly the organization he had helped to build in war had disintegrated in peacetime .
He decided that the nation must not be deluded into the belief that ‘ the war to end all wars ’ had really accomplished that end .
‘ If a nation ambitious for universal conquest gets off to a flying start in a war of the future , ’ he said , ‘ it may be able to control the whole world more easily than a nation has controlled a continent in the past . ’
Such statements embarrassed his superiors .
He soon provoked the Navy admirals into open hostility through his tirades against their super - dreadnought concepts .
Mitchell the hero soon became known as Mitchell the agitator as he tried to prove that airplanes could actually accomplish the things he forecast .
He proposed a number of daring innovations for the Air Service that stunned the nonflying Army generals–a special corps of mechanics , troop - carrying aircraft , a civilian pilot pool for wartime availability , long - range bombers capable of flying the Atlantic and armor- piercing bombs .
He encouraged the development of bombsights , ski-equipped aircraft , engine superchargers and aerial torpedoes .
He ordered the establishment of aerial forest - fire and border patrols , and followed that with a mass flight to Alaska , a transcontinental air race and a flight around the perimeter of the United States .
He encouraged Army pilots to set speed , endurance and altitude records in order to keep aviation in the news .
With each success , Mitchell became more determined that the nation ’s money should be spent on aircraft and not expensive battleships .
He stepped on the egos of the ground generals and the battleship admirals–especially the latter –with his fiery rhetoric and boasted that Army planes could sink any battleship afloat under any conditions of war .
Dynamic and impetuous , he sought out the American press and announced that if he were given permission to bomb captured German battleships , he would prove his assertions .
Newspaper reporters and editors , sensing open interservice warfare that would make headlines and sell papers , thought he should be given the opportunity to conduct tests against actual warships that were going to be scuttled or scrapped anyway .
The New York Times summarized the general feeling by saying that the country could not afford to ignore Mitchell ’s claims .
The Navy ’s ironclad die -hards fought the idea of actual tests and preferred that their word be taken that aircraft could never sink the super - safe , first - class fighting ships of any nation .
Strong pressure was brought to bear on President Warren G. Harding and Congress to withhold permission to use the German ships as targets .
An angry Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels offered to stand bareheaded on the bridge of any ship Mitchell chose to bomb .
Not all of the admirals disagreed with Mitchell , however .
Admiral William S. Sims , commander of U.S. naval forces in European waters during World War I , remarked : ‘ The average man suffers very severely from the pain of a new idea … .
It is my belief that the future will show that the fleet that has 20 airplane carriers instead of 16 battleships and 4 airplanes will inevitably knock the other fleet out . ’
Admiral W.F. Fullam , author of an exhaustive study of the use of air power , concluded that with the progress then being made in aviation , ‘ Sea power will be subordinated to or dependent upon air power . ’
Mitchell continued to expound his views in speeches and articles for national publications .
With the press strongly behind him and despite Navy foot - dragging , permission to demonstrate his theories was finally granted .
The tests were scheduled for June and July 1921 .
While the ships were being assembled off the Virginia coast , Mitchell amassed an armada of airplanes as the 1st Provisional Air Brigade and ordered exhaustive bombing practice against mock ships near Langley Field .
Army ordnance personnel produced the new 2,000 - pound bombs that would be needed to sink a battleship .
The tests began as scheduled , and the careful preparations paid off .
The bombers sank a German destroyer first , followed by an armored light cruiser and then one of the world ’s largest war vessels , the German battleship Ostfriesland , followed by the U.S. battleship Alabama–and later the battleships New Jersey and Virginia .
As far as Mitchell and the press were concerned , the assertion that air power should be the nation ’s first line of defense had been proved .
‘ No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them , ’ Mitchell declared .
Mitchell ’s subsequent writings and pronouncements –all duly carried by the nation ’s press–continually fanned the flames of interservice rivalry .
He proposed that the U.S. Army Air Service should take over all control of defense responsibilities for 200 miles out to sea .
In view of the bickering over the tests that had taken place , he asserted that fundamental changes in defense policy were necessary and called for a ‘ Department of National Defense … with a staff common to all the services ’ and with ’subsecretaries for the Army , Navy and the Air Force . ’
Mitchell staged a simulated bombing attack on New York City and mock bomb runs over other eastern cities , and he let the press carry the message to the public .
To quell the resultant fury of the battleship admirals and get Mitchell off the front pages , his superiors sent him to Hawaii .
However , he returned with a scathing report on the inadequate defenses he saw there .
He also went to Europe and the Far East to study the advances being made in aviation .
After returning from the latter trip in 1924 , he wrote a shocking 323 - page report–probably the most prophetic document of his career –that stressed that , when making estimates of Japanese air power , ‘ care must be taken that it is not underestimated . ’
Mitchell believed that Japan was the dominant nation in Asia and was preparing to do battle with the United States .
He predicted that air attacks would be made by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines and described how they would be conducted .
His report was received with all the enthusiasm of ‘ a green demolition team approaching an unexploded bomb , ’ according to one writer .
The report was ignored ; it is said that even his boss did not read it for two years .
In the following months , Mitchell wrote many articles expounding his theories and demanding national awareness of the new dimension of warfare that he perceived .
Despite his efforts , large appropriations for new aircraft were not forthcoming .
The Air Service was still flying aging de Havillands .
Crashes occurred frequently , and with each one , Mitchell lambasted the shortsightedness of the War Department and Congress for allowing them to happen .
Mitchell ’s attacks became more vitriolic and were embarrassing to his superiors as well as to Capitol Hill and the White House .
When his term with the Air Service expired in April 1925 , he was not reappointed .
He reverted to his permanent rank of colonel and was transferred to Fort Sam Houston , Texas , as air officer for the VIII Corps .
On September 1 , 1925 , a naval seaplane was lost on a nonstop flight from San Francisco to Hawaii .
Two days later , the U.S. Navy dirigible Shenandoah was destroyed while on a goodwill flight .
Mitchell ’s reaction was prompt .
From his post in ‘ exile , ’ he released a scathing denunciation of the Navy and War Department and dropped the heaviest bomb of his career .
He released a 6,000 - word statement saying that these and other accidents were ‘ the result of incompetency , criminal negligence , and the almost treasonable negligence of our national defense by the War and Navy departments . ’
Mitchell added that ‘ all aviation policies , schemes and systems are dictated by the non-flying officers of the Army and Navy , who know practically nothing about it . ’
He ended his denunciation by saying that ‘ I can stand by no longer and see these disgusting performances …at the expense of the lives of our people , and the delusions of the American public . ’
Reaction in Washington was immediate .
Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis announced that Mitchell would be disciplined and implied that it would be by court - martial .
Mitchell said he would welcome a court - martial if it ’stung the conscience ’ of the public .
Press reaction was mixed .
The New York Times charged Mitchell with ‘ insubordination and folly . ’
The Herald Tribune called him ‘ opinionative , arrogant and intolerant . ’
However , the Kansas City Star editorialized that although he was ‘ a zealot , a fanatic , a one - idea man , ’ someday his dream might come true .
Mitchell was put under technical arrest , and a court - martial began in Washington on October 28 , 1925 , for insubordination under the catch - all 96th Article of War .
Twelve generals ( two of whom were later dismissed ) and a colonel were appointed to sit in judgment , the highest ranking court ever convened to try an officer .
None of them was a flier .
The court - martial dragged on for seven weeks .
When it was over , the board deliberated for about half an hour and rendered its verdict–guilty of the charge and all eight specifications .
The sentence was suspension from rank , command and duty with forfeiture of pay and allowances for five years .
The verdict was widely debated on Capitol Hill , and veterans groups passed resolutions condemning the outcome .
President Calvin Coolidge approved the sentence handed down by the court , but altered the court ’s verdict by granting him full subsistence and half pay because Mitchell would not be able to accept private employment while still in uniform .
Mitchell said he would not accept the modified sentence because it would make him ‘ an object of government charity . ’
Mitchell resigned effective February 1 , 1926 .
He immediately embarked on a four - month , coast - to - coast lecture tour , showing films of the ship bombings and continually expressing his by now familiar theme of the necessity for military preparedness in the air .
His sweeping charges appeared in major American magazines and aviation journals .
He continually called attention to the rapid strides being made in aviation in Europe and Asia and warned of Japanese plans to seize the Hawaii , Alaska and the Philippines .
He also predicted , accurately , that the Japanese would not bother to declare war formally .
‘ We not only do nothing in the face of all this , ’ he said , ‘ but we leave our future in the air to incompetents . ’
Mitchell wrote more than 60 articles , several newspaper series and five books , never deviating from his appeal for public understanding of the promise and potential of air power .
He made his last public appearance on February 11 , 1935 , when he addressed the House Military Affairs Committee .
Weakened by his struggle , the old campaigner died in a New York hospital on February 19 , 1936 , at the age of 56 .
He had elected to be buried in Milwaukee , his hometown , where he enlisted in 1898 , rather than at Arlington National Cemetery .
In 1955 , the Air Force Association passed a resolution to void Billy Mitchell ’s court - martial .
In 1957 , Mitchell ’s youngest child , William , Jr. , petitioned the Air Force to set aside the court - martial verdict .
Secretary of the Air Force James H. Douglas unhappily denied the request , saying , ‘ It is tragic that an officer who contributed so much to his country ’s welfare should have terminated his military career under such circumstances . ’
Although the conviction was not removed , Billy Mitchell had already received a measure of official recognition from a grateful nation when President Harry S. Truman signed legislation in 1946 bestowing a special medal posthumously on Mitchell ‘ in recognition of his outstanding pioneer service and foresight in the field of American military aviation . ’
Should Billy Mitchell be remembered today ?
The answer is a definite and strong affirmative .
He not only foresaw that an air force was essential for national survival but also educated the public and its leaders on the role that the airplane would eventually play in national life .
For his foresight and willingness to sacrifice his career for his beliefs , the nation owes to this unorthodox visionary a debt of gratitude it can never repay .

Solar Panel Installer Tells of Near Death Experience on San Francisco Rooftop
December 14th , 2008 by Clayton
Former solar installer David Llorens nearly plunged four - stories to his death after faulty instructions from the building owner .
“ Ma’am , what ’s the best way to get to your roof ?
We need to see where we ’d put the solar panels and we do n’t have a four story ladder . ”
HER : “ I think this door goes out on to the roof , but I ’ve never been out there . ”
ME : “ OK … wait , it does n’t seem to open …
I think it ’s just painted shut though , you mind if I … ” * motions of shoulder nudging it *
HER : “ Sure , go ahead . ”
ME : * Nudge * Nothing .
* Harder Nudge * Nothing .
* Three more violent shoulder rammings *
HER : “ Let ’s go try the window . ”
ME : * One last goodbye give - it - my - best ramming attempt . *
( It gives a about a milimeter ) “ Hey !
I think I can get it , it ’s moving ! ” * Ultra violent running shoulder ramming *
* It gives more , about 3 MM now . *
HER : “ Hey , that door looks like it may fall off its hinges if you keep ramming it .
Do you think you will be able to close it if you get it open ? ”
ME : “ ….. hmm …
You ’re right ” * Disappointed look *
“ OK , let ’s try the window . ”
On another day , David might have had a one - way ticket to the sidewalk .
He had this to say about the incident :
This story is real , it happened to me a few months ago on this house , right down the street from my apartment .
I ’m thankful for being alive .
It ’s a funny story , but seriously , man , I could have ended up in the darwin awards .
Fortunately I ’m laptopping it now instead of up on roofs being an idiot .
I order to leverage his skills at the internet , and avoid placing himself in near death experiences , David worked with two other San Franciscans to cofound the solar energy aggregator called One Block Off the Grid .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
By a narrowly partisan vote , the Senate on Tuesday approved a massive $ 838 billion economic stimulus package , including $ 7 billion in funds to promote broadband deployment .
But with a slew of differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation remaining to be resolved in a conference committee this week , enormous uncertainty remains about the specifics of the plan — a situation that has many policy experts and advocates combing the details in search of the devil .
The most obvious open question concerns the total size of the broadband subsidy .
Earlier drafts of the Senate bill appropriated $ 9 billion for broadband , of which $ 2 billion were cut over the weekend as part of a compromise designed to win over enough Republicans and centrist Democrats to overcome a filibuster threat .
The House bill allocates $ 6 billion for the same purpose .
At the tech advocacy group Public Knowledge , however , there 's at least as much concern about the rules attached to broadband funding as about the total dollar amount .
The nonprofit sounded an alert Tuesday about an amendment introduced by Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) ( though not brought to the floor for consideration ) , creating a " network management " exception to the " open access " conditions imposed on any government - funded broadband networks .
Though the conditions themselves are somewhat vague — the Federal Communications Commission and National Telecommunications and Information Administration would hash out the specifics — network neutrality advocates expect that they would be used to bar various forms of discriminatory routing by ISPs .
Feinstein 's amendment , however , would construe the statute to permit " reasonable network management practices such as deterring unlawful activity , including child pornography and copyright infringement . "
Neutrality proponents fear this would create a loophole that permits ISPs to use deep packet inspection to automatically block copyrighted content — but automatic filters are notoriously hard pressed to distinguish between simple copyright infringement and legally protected fair use .
They also pose significant concerns about subscriber privacy .
There are also broader structural questions about the wisdom of including broadband spending in the stimulus package at all , as well as more specific concerns about the focus on subsidizing broadband deployment in rural areas .
Economists and policy experts voiced a welter of such concerns at a panel hosted by the conservative American Enterprise Institute on Tuesday afternoon .
The wisdom of stimulating broadband
Robert Crandall , an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution , argued that there was " little reason to provide a specific targeted subsidy for broadband , " rather than providing a more general cash infusion and allowing the market to determine which projects were deserving of support .
Crandall worries that grants or loans designed to accelerate broadband deployment could end up investing in technologies that may well be superseded a few years hence .
Perhaps ironically , Crandall 's own research has been the basis for ambitious claims about the job - creating potential of a broadband stimulus — claims Crandall himself now says are a " gross overstatement . "
Even if a targeted broadband subsidy were a good idea , Michael Katz , formerly chief economist at the FCC , wants to know : " What 's the rush ? "
Notwithstanding stimulus advocates ' emphasis on " shovel - ready " projects , much of the money allocated for broadband — especially funds that come in the form of loans and grants subject to an application and approval process — would likely not be spent for at least a year or two .
Under the circumstances , though he agrees that it's " important to send to the market signals that we 're doing something , " Katz worries that cramming broadband into a rushed stimulus bill will lead to poorly crafted legislation .
Taking a bit more time with broadband , he argues , would ensure that the government is not " paying people to do what they'd be doing anyway or even crowding out private investment . "
Moreover , as one attendee noted during the question - and - answer period , if the goal of a national broadband strategy is to improve the United States ' rates of broadband penetration , laying costly fiber in sparsely populated areas makes far less sense than promoting adoption in denser urban areas where there 's preexisting infrastructure .
Katz also questions the emphasis in both versions of the stimulus on rural broadband deployment .
The House version of the package puts half of the broadband funds under the control of the Department of Agriculture , and an amendment proposed by Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) would create a similar split in the Senate version , which currently puts all the money in the hands of the NTIA .
But Katz argues that it's " environmentally hostile " to subsidize the choice to live in those " underserved " rural areas — and perhaps unequitable as well , given that rural residents enjoy far lower housing costs than denizens of highly wired urban areas .
( He even offered his own tongue - in - cheek proposal to require rural residents to buy their own broadband service unless it would cost more than the difference between the cost of rural living and that of keeping a flat in Manhattan . )
Moreover , as one attendee noted during the question - and - answer period , if the goal of a national broadband strategy is to improve the United States ' rates of broadband penetration , laying costly fiber in sparsely populated areas makes far less sense than promoting adoption in denser urban areas where there 's preexisting infrastructure .
Robert Shapiro , formerly a principal economic advisor to Bill Clinton , was more sanguine about the general idea of a temporary broadband stimulus — but took pains to stress that he did n't wish to defend the specifics of the legislation currently under consideration , " because I do n't think it 's very well designed . "
Shapiro said his own research had shown that in general , there was no evidence for a systematic market failure in broadband , and argued that the so - called " digital divide " was better cast as a " digital lag " of about five years between those at the top and bottom rungs of the economic ladder .
" This is not something one would do in the absence of a crisis , " he said , and warned that " there is a real danger of this becoming a permanent program because it is in the economic interest of certain companies . "
Apropos of which , Shapiro claimed to have been told that the speed requirements for broadband networks funded under the stimulus package — hailed by proponents of government broadband subsidy — would originally have applied only to FiOS networks , until panicked telecoms complained .
Gigi Sohn of Public Knowledge stressed that the broadband spending should not be seen purely as a short - term form of economic stimulus , but as a means of guaranteeing broad - based democratic participation .
To that end , Sohn argued that targeted grants and loans should be preferred to tax credits for broadband providers , which play a significant role in both versions of the bill , since these must be individually approved and monitored — and because tax credits provide little benefit to companies not currently turning a profit .
Echoing the other panelists , she worried that without the checks that come with such grants , money would simply flow to incumbent firms to underwrite deployment they 'd undertake anyway .
If tax credit language proposed by Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) is incorporated in the final bill , some analysts project that Verizon alone could capture as much as $ 1 billion of the total broadband stimulus .
As several panelists noted , however , the varied goals of broadband subsidy in the context of a stimulus package often conflict .
Short term jobs for workers in the ailing construction sector are created by rural deployment , though that 's not the most effective way to get the largest number of people online .
Similarly , if the goal is to spend funds in a way that creates a near - term economic boost , then the logical recipients of those funds are incumbent telecoms , who are in the best position to quickly add capacity , rather than newer startups — which would have its own distortionary effects on the broadband market in the longer terms .
( Sohn countered by questioning " the obsession with shovel ready , " asking : " Do n't we want to stimulate this economy over a little longer time horizon than just the next six months or year ? "
The perhaps surprising consensus across the political spectrum — among those broadly supportive of the theory behind broadband stimulus and those who remain skeptical — was that the stimulus bill in its current form is at best profoundly imperfect , packed with provisions that do more to advance the interests of specific companies ( incumbent providers and rural telcos , primarily ) rather than sound broadband policy .
And if that 's what it looks like now , wait until we see what they do with it in committee .
For too many years , Wal - Mart 's high - profile CIOs and much - discussed IT department were trapped in what now seems like an archaic mindset :
They relied almost exclusively on retail applications that were developed in - house , because they believed that no vendor 's packaged apps could scale to meet the global retailer 's complex requirements .

How Wal - Mart Lost Its Technology Edge
Did IT Help Wal - Mart 's Quarterly Financial Results ?
Wal - Mart Is Dead Serious About RFID
Wal - Mart's Green Strategy : Supply Chain Makeover Targets Chinese Manufacturers
In October 2007 , CIO.com published " How Wal - Mart Lost Its Technology Edge , " an article that examined how Wal - Mart 's internal IT department had contributed to the retailer 's fiscal problems that began with stagnant sales in 2005 and ran into 2006 and 2007 .
The ISD group , as it's known internally , had distracted itself with a cutting - edge radio frequency identification ( RFID ) program that frustrated its suppliers .
In addition , the ISD group had yet to adjust to the realities of the new Web 2.0 world .
Consequently its online sales lagged rivals ' efforts .
Wal - Mart and its IT shop — with former CIOs and IT leaders such as Bob Martin , Randy Mott , Kevin Turner , Rick Dalzell and Linda Dillman — had been known for its killer instinct and pushing too far , too fast with some supply chain applications that flustered its suppliers and sourcing partners , those partners say .
Wal - Mart 's ISD group lost its reputation as a cutting - edge business - technology leader , the article contended , and the " take no prisoners " attitude had , in some ways , backfired .
The world 's biggest retailer and the ISD group were at a crossroads .
But by late 2007 and on into 2008 , Wal - Mart began to ( quietly ) change its one - note software tune :
It purchased Oracle 's retail price - optimization application and HP's Neoview data warehousing and BI platform to crunch the customer data it collected in its 4,000 U.S. - based stores .
In addition , Wal - Mart announced that it was implementing SAP's ERP Financials package for its global operations .
( Wal - Mart brass expected the first phase of the ERP project to be rolled out in 2010 . )
Wal - Mart had even sought help with its Web 2.0 e-commerce efforts , which it desperately needed .
At some point , Wal - Mart also began to explore ( again , quietly ) a " remote sourcing model for IT activities , " according to the company , a change that was both economically sensible and a bit surprising .
Wal - Mart Considers BPO Outsourcing Deal ?
Now comes news that Wal - Mart executives and ISD leaders are considering the once unthinkable : Wal - Mart is evaluating a business process outsourcing ( BPO ) contract worth approximately $ 300 million to $ 500 million in India , as it evaluates whether " to outsource non-core processes of procurement , merchandising , finance , accounting and payroll , " according to a recent article in The Economic Times .
Sources told The Economic Times that IBM , TCS , WNS and Wipro are in various stages of discussions with Wal - Mart .
Though Wal - Mart has never signed on to a BPO or IT outsourcing deal , the current economic challenges " are making the retailer seek more cost saving options including outsourcing of non-core processes , " according to one source quoted in the article .
Without elaborating on specifics , Wal - Mart spokesman John Simley writes via e-mail to CIO.com that facts in the Economic Times article are " entirely false . "
( A follow - up e-mail to Simley was not returned . )
Of course , Wal - Mart already has some presence in India .
Wal - Mart states on its website that it " will expand staffing of certain elements of IT application maintenance and development with some of India 's leading information technology firms , " according to a 2008 Wal - Mart fact sheet .
This being a hot - button issue for a company that tries to cultivate a pro-America image , the fact sheet also notes that the Wal - Mart is " hiring hundreds of new positions in Northwest Arkansas this year . "
If Charles Darwin had lived to see his 200th birthday he probably would n't have held his party in Rhea County , Tenn .
But that does n't keep one Wisconsin - based group from making sure the evolutionist 's legacy is heralded near the site of the famous Scopes trial .
The Freedom from Religion Foundation installed a 12 - foot - by - 25 - foot billboard on U.S. Highway 27 at the Hamilton - Rhea county line reading " Praise Darwin " with an ornate , Biblical - style " P " and a border designed to look like stained glass .
" If you 're going to be controversial , we think it should at least be pretty , " said Annie Laurie Gaylor , co-president of the Madison , Wis. - based foundation .
A branch of the foundation was listed as a plaintiff in the 2002 court case that banned Bible classes from Rhea County schools .
The group has posted similar billboards before , but officials decided to create this round of signs in advance of Mr. Darwin 's 200th birthday on Feb. 12 .
" When we hear from people it 's usually positive , but we 'll see , " Ms. Gaylor said .
" We 've never been in that area before ( with billboards ) .
It 's our first foray into Tennessee . "
The group already has encountered some resistance , according to Ms. Gaylor .
She said the group wanted to lease a board in the city of Dayton but could n't find a billboard company that would let them rent advertising space .
" I did n't even want their revenue , " said Dennis Tumlin , who owns five billboards in the city .
" I did n't want their business . "
Mr. Tumlin said the group offered him $ 900 to be on a downtown sign for a month , but he turned them away once he found out their message .
" I had to inform her that I was a Christian and I would not be displaying any sign that supported Darwin or celebrating his birthday , " he said .
" I felt like they were trying to take a swipe at Bryan College and Dayton . "
Bryan College , located in Dayton , is named after William Jennings Bryan , a creationist famous for squaring off in the famed 1925 trial against teacher John Scopes , who was accused of teaching evolution .
After the billboard setback , the foundation chose a billboard maintained by Fairway Outdoor Advertising near the county line .
" There are times when we disagree with an advertising message , but at all times we value our clients ' opinions and their rights to express those opinions , " said Todd Powers , sales manager for Fairway 's Chattanooga region .
The foundation 's chief billboard scout was Knoxville resident and Oak Ridge National Laboratory retiree Sharron King .
" That was the closest ( billboard owner ) we could find that would accept it , " she said .
She said she did n't expect everyone would agree with the board 's message , but that some people would appreciate it .
" The majority probably will not be happy about it , but I think there are always a few people who have to keep their views to themselves because they 're so outnumbered ( who ) will be happy , " she said .
The Rev. J. Milton Knox , pastor of First Baptist Church of Dayton , said many residents would get " bent out of shape " over the sign but look past more subtle anti-Christian messages every day .
" This mindset continues to be propagated whether it's on a billboard or not , " he said citing advertising messages like " What Happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas . "
As for the sign 's effect on the community , Mr. Knox said it 's nothing new for his Baptist congregation near the epicenter of the creation - evolution debate .
" It 's something we 've been countering for years , " he said .
" I do n't think the whole world 's going to change its mind . "
The Detroit News and The Wall Street Journal are reporting that Motown automakers ’ pensions funds are no longer fully - funded .
“ The outgoing director of the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. warned Friday that Detroit ’s Big Three automakers face a $ 41 billion pension shortfall .
“ We ’re not trying to tell people that the pension house is on fire , ” quoth E.F. Millard in the DetN .
“ The point is that in many ways this has a similar look to other situations , such as a Bethlehem Steel . ”
Not surprisingly , the WSJ has an even more alarming sound bite .
“ An awful lot of people seem to think these plans are well funded or overfunded .
Each of these plans is significantly underfunded [ and ] in three years I do n’t want people coming back and saying , ‘ How come the PBGC never told us that ? ' ”
Let ’s drill down , then .
The three automakers reported $ 130.5 billion in pension assets , which represents only 76 percent of their combined liabilities .
GM ’s pension is 20 percent underfunded , Chrysler ’s is 34 percent underfunded , and Ford is short by 27 percent . ”
“ When GM last gave a year - end update on its pension funds , the funds covered more than 400,000 retirees and were overfunded by $ 18.8 billion .
But in November , GM said its plan for hourly workers was underfunded by $ 500 million because of restructuring expenses . ”
So where did the money go ?
Heavy losses in investment portfolios , declining interest rates on assets and ( as stated above ) Detroit ’s reliance on pension funds to pay for early retirement .
“ It is certainly possible that none of these companies ever files for bankruptcy , ” Millard said .
“ It is certainly possible that they all do . ”
He said the risk to the PCBG ’s reserves is “ significantly greater than it was six or seven months ago . ’
And then … ?
“ If all three automakers were to collapse and turn their plans over to the pension corporation , the agency estimates it would pay out $ 13 billion of the $ 41 billion , because of limits set by Congress on how much the pension corporation can cover .
The agency generally has a yearly cap of $ 54,000 in benefits for people who are 65 . ”
To - day is the parent of to - morrow .
The present casts its shadow far into the future .
That is the law of life , individual and social .
Revolution that divests itself of ethical values thereby lays the foundation of injustice , deceit , and oppression for the future society .
Theused tothe future become its cornerstone .
The collective brain of New Scientist has come up with 8 scientist heroes of the year and people to look out for in 2009 , 3 non-scientists who deserve special mention – and two possible bad guys .
Heroes first :
Steven Chu
Chu , Nobel laureate and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab director , was named in December as US energy secretary in Barack Obama ’s incoming administration .
The blogs erupted with excitement at the news .
As a strong advocate both for scientific solutions to climate change and for carbon - neutral renewable sources of energy , Chu could well have made our list anyway – as energy boss of the most energy - hungry nation in the world , it seems certain that Chu will be one of the most influential scientists in 2009 .
George Church
Church , of Harvard University , launched the first company to offer complete genome sequences to customers ( Knome , tagline : “ know thyself ” ) , started the first phase of an effort to publish 100,000 complete genomes , and is engineering bacteria to produce biofuels .
On top of that , he published a cool paper showing that soil microbes – “ ultra - bugs ” – can use antibiotic drugs as their sole source of food .
Svante Pääbo
Pääbo , of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , pioneered the sequencing of ancient DNA in the face of impossible - looking odds .
This year , Pääbo and colleagues announced they had almost finished sequencing the genome of a Neanderthal ( other researchers completed a rough draft of the genome of the extinct woolly mammoth ) .
A real - life Jurassic Park remains science fiction – a Pleistocene Park might not be .
In any case , Pääbo ’s lab is doing amazing things on the technical side of sequencing and genome assembly that should pay dividends in biomedicine and forensics , as well as evolution .

Alan Stern
Stern , former NASA space chief .
Stern resigned this year after refusing to cut costs on basic space research programmes .
In late November , he wrote a scathing criticism of cost overruns at NASA for the New York Times and earlier in the year joked that the new term for distant , Pluto - like objects – plutoid – sounded like “ hemorrhoid ” , so it ’s likely that we ’ll hear from him again on a variety of topics in 2009 .
John Pendry
Pendry , of Imperial College London , works on a subject that caught the public imagination again this year : invisibility cloaks .
While it ’s going to be a while before we can play at being Harry Potter , Pendry gets credit for bringing fiendishly complex physics into the mainstream media .
Peter Smith
Smith , of the University of Arizona , is NASA ’s chief scientist for the Mars Phoenix lander mission .
Phoenix , the first mission to touch down in the Martian arctic , returned good news for people who want to find that there is or has been life on Mars , and thrilled millions with its images of the Martian surface .
Ken Caldeira
Caldeira , of the Carnegie Institution , has been investigating geoengineering claims for years .
This year he was brought in by the British government to talk about ways in which we could geoengineer the climate to save us from global warming .
If we do n’t get greenhouse gas emissions down , we ’re going to need a Plan B – and people like Caldeira to do the research for us .
He ’s also been asked to organise a session on geoengineering in Copenhagen next year , where world leaders will meet to sign the successor to the Kyoto protocol .
Lyn Evans
Evans , the boss of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN , is the figure behind the biggest science story of the year .
When the LHC was switched on in September it seemed that everyone was talking about God particles , dark matter , and whether other dimensions exist .
A billion TV viewers watched the switch - on : physics has never been so sexy , and once the thing is repaired , we can look forward to getting some answers .
Special mentions
Philip Munger , a music teacher and blogger in a Wasilla , Alaska , high school , did his bit for science in September .
Munger confirmed that Sarah Palin , then the US Republican nominee for vice - president , believed that dinosaurs and humans coexisted 6000 years ago .
Plenty of scientists offered their advice to the presidential candidates , but we nominate Munger for doing his bit to counter creationism .
Claudia Castillo suffered a collapsed windpipe after a severe tuberculosis infection , and was barely able to breathe .
She then made world headlines by becoming the first recipient of windpipe tissue constructed from a combination of donated tissue and her own cells .
As one of the surgeons involved said , Castillo helped usher in a new age of surgical care .
Barack Obama promised a new era of scientific innovation when he was elected in November , and has already picked an all - star science team to form his first administration .
Environmentalists can now hope for leadership from the US when it comes to dealing with climate change .
Villains of the year ?
Bruce Ivins , the US army biodefence expert now blamed for the 2001 anthrax attacks in the US , died in July – an apparent suicide .
The FBI are confident that Ivins was behind the attacks , which killed five people , and if they are right , Ivins is surely the “ evil mad scientist ” of the year , if not the decade .
Yet whether the FBI ’s evidence would have stood up in a court of law is unknown , as the scientific details of any genetic link between the anthrax spores posted in the attacks , and those in his lab , have not been released .
Dale Hall , director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) , was instrumental in getting the polar bear listed as threatened under the Endangered Species
Act – the first species listed because of the threat of global warming .
But a month after the polar bear was listed , Dale ’s agency found itself in hot water when it was accused of granting oil companies the right to harass polar bears .

A lot of time and money is spent thinking about special needs children , says Florida State University professor Steven I. Pfeiffer , while there is an assumption that no educational resources need to be provided for ' gifted ' kids to help them thrive in school .
" There is a view occasionally expressed by those outside of the gifted field that we do n't need programs devoted specifically to gifted students , " Pfeiffer , member of the Department of Educational Psychology and Learning Systems , said .
" ' Oh , they 're smart , they 'll do fine on their own ' is what we often hear .
And because of this anti-elitist attitude , it 's often difficult to get funding for programs and services that help us to develop some of our brightest , most advanced kids -- America 's most valuable resource .
" A key problem in working with gifted children is one of definition .
What exactly does it mean to be ' gifted ' ?
Part of Pfeiffer 's research has been finding ways to best identify those children .
To that end , he led a group that developed a diagnostic test which complements the widely used intelligence test in identifying children who might be gifted .
Pfeiffer 's test is now being used in more than 600 school districts across the nation and has been translated for use in a number of other countries .
( For more information on the Gifted Rating Scales , visit www.fsu.com/pages/2006/11/20/gifted_rating_scales.html . ) " For almost a hundred years , schools used one measure , the IQ test , " stated Pfeiffer .
" Our own research indicates that the IQ test , although it works fairly well , is not without limitations in identifying giftedness .
We launched a project to develop a test that would be a companion to the IQ test in helping educators better identify those children who have potential but perhaps are missed on IQ tests .
" But once that is accomplished , how do we help them best ?
Harder classes is n't necessarily productive .
Pfeiffer discusses the issue of defining giftedness , how to best nurture it and many of the emotional and social challenges facing gifted children in a new paper , " The Gifted : Clinical Challenges and Practice Opportunities for Child Psychiatry , " published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child &Adolescent Psychiatry .
"
Even within the gifted field , there is considerable controversy regarding definitional , conceptual and diagnostic issues , " Pfeiffer said .
" However , as a generally agreed - upon definition , gifted children are those who are in the upper 3 percent to 5 percent compared to their peers in one or more of the following domains : general intellectual ability , specific academic competence , the visual or performing arts , leadership and creativity .
"
In other work involving gifted students , the state of Florida recently asked Pfeiffer and his team to lead an effort to help Florida 's best and brightest high school students reach their potential so they can help the state reach its .
The result was the establishment of the Florida Governor 's School for Space Science and Technology , which was created by the Legislature in 2007 .
( Visit www.fsu.com/pages/2008/04/08/space_science_and_tech.html to read more . )
" The Florida State University -- in partnership with the Florida Institute of Technology and Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University -- was fortunate to be asked to develop a plan to design a state - of - the - art residential academy for Florida 's most capable high school students , " Pfeiffer said .
" Essentially , the Florida Legislature was interested in providing resources for Florida 's brightest students in high schools , particularly in terms of a curriculum which would emphasize science , math , engineering and technology .
" Pfeiffer is working with the national organization SENG ( Supporting Emotional Needs of the Gifted ) to develop a certification system so that professionals working with gifted children -- educators , mental health providers , pediatricians and others -- will be able to receive an official designation citing their expertise in this area .
DraganFly Innovations of Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , Canada , has created a new unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) designed specifically for remote controlled digital photography and digital video streams .
The helicopter is designed to self - stabilize during flight , making it much easier to control than other remote controlled helicopters and supports four interchangeable cameras including a 10.1 megapixel still camera , a 1080 p high definition video camera , a low light video camera , and a thermal imaging video camera .

The DraganFlyer X6 helicopter is approximately 36 inches long , 33 inches wide , and 10 inches high when deployed .
It weighs 36 ounces and supports up to a 12 ounce camera payload .
It can fly for up to 25 minutes at altitudes up to 8,000 feet high .
It uses three pairs of rotors made of carbon fibers and the motor connects directly to the rotors , removing the high maintenance gears used by most helicopters .
The helicopter includes two wireless links to the ground – a bi-directional channel for the controller and a helicopter - to - ground channel sending the captured photographs and video in NTSC and PAL - compatible formats .
There ’s also a MicroSD card that acts as a black box recorder capturing data from the onboard sensors including the orientation , altitude , direction , and speed of the helicopter .

The handheld controller features a large OLED display and permits control of both the helicopter itself and its onboard camera ( including camera angle , zoom , and shutter control ) .
Video glasses help the operator see exactly what the helicopter sees at any given time , allowing for more precise controls and adjustment as well as the ability to zoom in on details in real time .
A second MicroSD black box recorder is kept on the controller in case the helicopter is lost .
One of the most interesting features of the DraganFlyer X6 helicopter is its ability to fold for transport and storage .
The arms collapse inward like a tripod in closed position , resulting in a vehicle that ’s only 27 inches long , 12 inches wide , and 10 inches high .
Given its light weight of just over two pounds , the folded helicopter can be easily carried by nearly anyone .
The DraganFlyer X6 UAV has many potential applications in both the commercial and military sectors .
In addition to surveillance and reconnaissance , the helicopter can be used to capture news footage , for nature photography in rough terrain , for aerial shots of golf courses and buildings for promotional films , for inspections of property or of new construction , and for environmental assessment tasks .

" THE TWO STEVES " - Pinker vs. Rose - A Debate ( Part I ) [ 3.25.98 ]
Introduction by
John Brockman
On January 21st , Steven Pinker and Steven Rose debated each other in an event chaired by Susan Blackmore and held at London University 's Institute of Education under the sponsorship of Dillon 's and The London Times .
Over a thousand people attended - and the event was sold out within three days of being announced .
I wish I had been there .
No two individuals better illustrate my notion of a " third culture " which " consists of those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who , through their work and expository writing , are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives , redefining who and what we are . "
In this culture , there is no canon or accredited list of acceptable ideas .
The strength of the third culture is precisely that it can tolerate disagreements about which ideas are to be taken seriously .
Unlike previous intellectual pursuits , the achievements of the third culture are not the marginal disputes of a quarrelsome mandarin class : they will affect the lives of everybody on the planet .
The Two Steves have serious disagreements .
But whether it 's Steve Pinker weighing forth on the notion that the " problems for our ancestors were subtasks of one big problem for their genes " or Steve Rose asserting that " it is in the nature of living systems to be radically indeterminate , to continually construct their - our - own futures , " their debate , their disagreement sharpens and clarifies .
-JB
The complex structure of the mind is the subject of this book .
Its key idea can be captured in a sentence :
The mind is a system of organs of computation , designed by natural selection to solve the kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their foraging way of life , in particular , understanding and outmaneuvering objects , animals , plants , and other people .
The summary can be unpacked into several claims .
The mind is what the brain does ; specifically , the brain processes information , and thinking is a kind of computation .
The mind is organized into modules or mental organs , each with a specialized design that makes it an expert in one arena of interaction with the world .
The modules ' basic logic is specified by our genetic program .
Their operation was shaped by natural selection to solve the problems of the hunting and gathering life led by our ancestors in most of our evolutionary history .
The various problems for our ancestors were subtasks of one big problem for their genes , maximizing the number of copies that made it into the next generation .
Steven Pinker
From How the Mind Works
( My task is to ) offer an alternative vision of living systems , a vision which recognizes the power and role of genes without subscribing to genetic determinism , and which recaptures an understanding of living organisms and their trajectories through time and space as lying at the centre of biology .
It is these trajectories that I call lifelines .
Far from being determined , or needing to invoke some non-material concept of free will to help us escape the determinist trap , it is in the nature of living systems to be radically indeterminate , to continually construct their - our - own futures , albeit in circumstances not of our own choosing .

To the Debate
Questions and Answers
If you 've ever studied economics , you 've probably heard at some point that economics is referred to as the " dismal science . "
Granted , economists are n't always the most upbeat bunch of people , but is that really why the phrase came about ?
Origin of the Phrase " Dismal Science " to Describe Economics
As it turns out , the phrase has been around since the mid-19th century , and it was coined by historian Thomas Carlyle .
At the time , the skills required for writing poetry were referred to as the " gay science , " so Carlyle decided to call economics the " dismal science " as a clever turn of phrase .
The popular belief is that Carlyle started using the phrase in response to the " dismal " prediction of 19th - century reverend and scholar Thomas Malthus , who forecasted that the rate of growth in the food supply as compared to the rate of the growth in population would result in mass starvation .
( Luckily for us , Malthus ' assumptions regarding technological progress were overly , well , dismal , and such mass starvation never transpired . )
While Carlyle did use the word dismal in reference to Malthus ' findings , he did n't use the phrase " dismal science " until his 1849 work Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question .
In this piece , Carlyle argued that reintroducing ( or continuing ) slavery would be morally superior to relying on the market forces of supply and demand , and he labeled the profession of economists who disagreed with him , most notably John Stuart Mill , as the " dismal science , " since Carlyle believed that the emancipation of slaves would leave them worse off .
( This prediction has also turned out to be incorrect , of course . )

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Muntadher al - Zaidi , the Iraqi journalist on trial for throwing his shoes last year at then - President George W. Bush , said the former American leader 's " bloodless and soulless smile " and his joking banter provoked him .
TV reporter Muntadhar al - Zaidi , shown in a file photo , appeared in court to loud applause and cheers .
Al - Zaidi threw both of his shoes at Bush during a December news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki in Baghdad .
Neither shoe hit the president , and other people in the room quickly knocked al - Zaidi to the ground before security officials arrested him .
He explained his actions in an hour - long appearance on Thursday at the Central Criminal Court of Iraq .
Asked if anyone pushed or motivated him to do this , al - Zaidi said he was spurred on by the " violations that are committed against the Iraqi people . "
" I could only see Bush and feel the blood of the innocents flow under his feet , as he was smiling that smile -- as if he had come to bid farewell to Iraq and with the last support and more than 1 million martyrs , " al - Zaidi said .
" At that moment , I felt this is the man who killed our nation ... the main murderer and the main person responsible for killing our nation . "
Watch more on the trial »
Speaking in his first public appearance since his arrest two months ago , al - Zaidi told the court he " got emotional and threw the shoe at him " and " the second one was involuntary . "
" I had no intention to kill the commander of the occupying forces ... even if I had a weapon ...
I was expressing my inner feelings and those of all the Iraqi people from east to west and north to south and the feelings of hatred they hold for him , " he said .
Al - Zaidi told the judge that he had intended to humiliate Bush in the past .
As Bush listed the gains made in Iraq during the mid-December news conference , al - Zaidi said he was thinking about the millions of civilians who had been killed , widowed or displaced .
He talked about the sanctity of mosques being violated , the rape of women and daily humiliations .
" I do n't know what accomplishments he was talking about .
The accomplishments I could see were the more than 1 million martyrs and a sea of blood , " al - Zaidi said .
" There are more than 5 million Iraqi orphans because of the occupation .
...
More than a million widows and more than 3 million displaced because of the occupation . "
Al - Zaidi also said he was beaten up in front of the prime minister and the world when he was taken from the room where the press conference was held .
The trial will resume March 12 while the court asks the Cabinet to clarify whether Bush 's visit was official or not .
Al - Zaidi is charged with " assaulting a foreign head of state on an official visit to Iraq . "
In December , al - Zaidi 's defense team filed an appeal requesting the charge be changed from " assaulting " to " insulting . "
According to the Iraqi penal code , anyone who assaults a foreign head of state is punished by " imprisonment for a term of years , " with the court deciding the sentence .
Lawyer Dhiyaa al - Saadi told CNN in December that his client could face 15 years in jail if convicted .
Watch more on the incident »
On the other hand , insulting a foreign head of state is punishable by a two - year prison sentence and a fine .
Dressed in an olive - green suit and black shoes , al - Zaidi entered the courthouse to loud applause and cheers .
Some family members and supporters , who were waiting outside , draped an Iraqi flag around his neck .
A woman in the crowd shouted , " You hero ! "
His 6 - year - old nephew , Haidar , stood outside the courtroom reciting the poem " Throw the shoe ... at the vampire . "
As he left , the crowd pressed forward to get close to al - Zaidi , who waved as he was led away .
Earlier , lawyer al - Saadi told the al - Baghdadia television network that his client 's " morale is high . "
Al - Baghdadia is the journalist 's employer and has been calling for his release .
By tradition , throwing a shoe is the most insulting act in the Arab world .
His angry gesture touched a defiant nerve throughout the Arab and Muslim world .
He is regarded by many people as a hero , and demonstrators have taken to the streets in the Arab world demanding that he be set free .

Want to play video games and learn lessons you can apply elsewhere in life ?
Look no further than NCAA Football 09 , in Dynasty Mode .
In Dynasty mode , you coach a college football program through multiple seasons and you can only improve your team long term by mastering the recruitment process .
NCAA Football 09 Dynasty Mode Recruitment Rules
The relevant rules for recruitment :
Recruit enough players to play each position , or you will have to choose a walk - on from your college class
Recruit enough players to play each position , or you will have to choose a walk - on from your college class
You have 25 scholarships to hand out and 35 slots on your recruitment board
You have 10 “ hours ” a week to recruit ( in real life , this takes about 3 minutes ) .
The computer will spend any leftover time recruiting players on your behalf
Players will rank aspects of each school based on how good they perceive it to be and how important it is to them .
Their perceptions will affect how easy / hard it is to recruit that particular player .
Life Lessons – Goal Setting , Prioritizing , and Persistence
As I got better at NCAA Football 09 , I ’ve noticed that my strategy based on the various rules hold broader lessons for my life .
Lesson # 1 : If you do n’t go after what you want , you wo n’t get it .
Spend your time chasing what you really want .
Example : Automatic CPU Recruitment –
The first season I played , I did n’t want to do any recruiting .
I spent none of my 10 hours per week , the CPU automatically recruited for me .
At the end of the year I looked at my new players and what did I have ?
Garbage .
The players were terrible and the computer did n’t pay any attention to how the players would fare in my lineup down the road .
Real Life : Life happens to all of us sixty seconds at a time , whether we are ready for it or not .
Make the most of your time , and make sure you choose how you spend it – going after what you desire , or you ’ll just get the scraps that happen to fall your way .
I ’m reminded of this quote :
“ Your time is limited , so do n’t waste it living someone else ’s life .
Do n’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people ’s thinking .
Do n’t let the noise of other ’s opinions drown out your own inner voice .
And most important , have the courage to follow your heart and intuition .
They somehow already know what you truly want to become .
Everything else is secondary . ” – Steve Jobs ( emphasis mine )
Lesson # 2 : Recruit and fill the roles you must with what you want , or they will be filled for you .
Example : Walk Ons – After I stopped letting the CPU control my recruitment , I recruited for everything but one particular position : center .
I ignored it and had a walk - on fill the gap .
This turned out to be a disaster .
While the average player on my team was a 65 or 70 ( on a scale from 40 - 100 ) , my walk - on was in the high 40s and useless .
Real Life : I have always tried very hard to find jobs and companies that challenge me and that further my career .
If I had n’t made a conscious decision to do this , I am sure I would have taken any job that came my way that paid the bills .
I also try to surround myself with friends who are intelligent , interested in fitness and health , and successful – if I do n’t make a conscious effort to surround myself with quality people , I ’ll just take whoever I can get .
Every day we can make a choice : do we fill our lives with what we want , or will we just accept whatever life provides us ?
Lesson # 3 : Play to your strengths – know what you are good at , and where your advantage lies .
Example : Recruiting Players : Their Priorities versus My Program – I noticed that some of the players I recruited were a better fit than others ( e.g. , my Athletic Facilities were Excellent , and it was their Most important criteria ) .
These player were an easy sale and generally ended up signing with me .
For other players , their athletic facilities interest might be “ Average ” – they were interested , but it was n’t their top criteria , no matter how good my facilities were .
These were much tougher sells , and occasionally I could swing them , but it was n’t easy .
Real Life : I ’ve learned that I have an easier time achieving goals and getting things that are in line with my strengths .
I experienced this firsthand when trying to get my first real job .
When I finished college , I wanted to develop software .
My strongest competency was Java development , but I was hungry to develop any software database work , software in other languages ( C++ , Python , Perl ) .
I was pretty good all around , but I had a hard time convincing managers to hire me – they always found someone that was better than me for that specific position , with the specific skills they wanted .
I finally landed a job at DirecTV , and developed other skills , but furthered my Java software development skills .
My next two jobs since then ?
Both heavily Java based , and both relatively easy to get .
Lesson # 4 : Just because you can chase a large number of opportunities does n’t mean you should .
Example : Recruitment Board Slots –
When I started recruiting , I noticed I had 35 slots .
I immediately filled all 35 with players I wanted and tried to recruit as many of them as I could .
With only 10 hours a week , however , I was spending less than 20 minutes a week on each player .
I would later learn that realistically , it takes between 1 and 2 hours a week consistently to recruit a quality player .
Unable to spend a sufficient amount of time on any of the players , you can guess what happened – I often did n’t get most of them .
I had to prioritize , and as I ’ve gotten better , I now typically only recruit about 8 - 10 quality players a year at any given time .
Real Life :
We can do anything we want in life , but we ca n’t do everything we want all at once .
I used to have a large todo list – not anymore .
Since implementing the system outlined in Getting Things Done , I now have a “ Someday ” bucket .
While I have many items on the backburner , at any given time I keep my commitments and priorities to the most essential – everything else , I let it slide .
Lesson # 5 : It wo n’t come easy , but if you set your mind to it , you can usually get what you truly desire .
Example : Recruiting Poorly Matched , But Desired Players – Sometimes , all I want is a good quarterback – but there are no quality quarterbacks available that want to play for me .
I learned that while I could n’t recruit the one quarterback I wanted with just an hour every week , I could if I spent 2 - 3 hours a week .
One year I spent one third of my whole season ’s recruiting time , every week , on a single player – a running back that was faster than anybody else .
My persistence paid off , and the last week of the season , he finally signed on .
He was the cornerstone of my team for the next four years .
Real Life :
If you want it bad enough , sure you can have it – but you need to put in the effort - and perhaps make some sacrifices .
My freshmen year in college I was skinny and tired of it .
I am an ectomorph ( translation : people with my body have difficulty gaining large amounts of muscle ) , but in spite of the disadvantage I started out with , I wanted to improve my physical appearance and bulk up .
I made my workouts a priority ( including the days of final exams ) , ate lots of food , drank 6 - 8 glasses of chocolate milk a day and slept 8 - 10 hours a night consistently .
My commitment paid off , as I gained more muscle , about 40 lbs , in a shorter time frame than I ever have since .
Lesson # 6 : It ai n’t over till it ’s over .
[ digg-reddit-me ]
Example : Recruiting Players That Have Already “ Committed ” – In NCAA 09 , there are two types of commits – a soft commit and a hard commit .
A hard commit means the player has signed and there ’s no turning back – he ’s playing for your team .
A soft commit on the other hand signals that a player has made up his mind , and is about to commit to a team – but there ’s still a chance they can change their mind .
Whenever a player has a soft commit to another team , if I really want them , I recruit them hard that week .
If they stay as a soft commit , I keep hammering on them – and about half the time , I can swing them to a soft commit to me , and then a hard commit to me .
Real Life :
It ’s almost never really over , and a client / hiring manager / etc saying no is only a temporary setback – the equivalent a soft commit .
As an undergraduate in college , I wanted to run for student government .
I inquired in September , but they told me elections are held at the end of each school year , in April / May , and to come back next year .
One day I noticed they had put a small sign in the window about special elections .
I learned that because some senators had dropped out , I could run for office and complete their term .
I won , entered the senate , and had the opportunity to serve a year longer than I would have if I had just thrown in the towel the first time they told me no .
Life Lessons from Unusual Places
Some of the ways I often learn things is through books , my favorite blogs and of course my parents – the older I get , the smarter they are !
Just like this example though , I ’m sure many of you have learned things in non-traditional areas , that have carried broader lessons in your life .
What video games do you enjoy ?
Are there unusual ways / places / experiences that have shaped your life ?
Or any life lessons you ’ve learned from people in your life you ’d like to share ?
I ’d love to hear from you in the comments .

If you think dying can keep you out of court , look at Charles Darwin .
The celebrations of his 200th birthday coincide with an anti-evolution lawsuit that has just landed him on the doorstep of the U.S. Supreme Court .
A Christian schoolteacher from Roseville ( Placer County ) who takes the Bible literally says a UC Berkeley Web site about evolution is unconstitutional , like a cross in a public park .
The Web site , " Understanding Evolution , " is supported by government funds and violates the constitutional separation of church and state , according to the suit by Jeanne Caldwell .
Rebuffed by lower courts , she has appealed to the nation 's highest court , and UC joined the battle this week , saying in its response that the Internet is not like a park and that , in fact , Caldwell has no right even to file the suit .
The sides wait to see whether the justices will take the case and tackle the unsettled issue - not of evolution , but of whether the Internet is a public space that needs new principles to enforce the state - and - religion barrier .
At issue is one page , out of 840 on the Web site , that says Darwin 's theory and religion can co-exist .
The page - titled " Misconception : ' Evolution and Religion are Incompatible ' " - also features a drawing of a smiling scientist holding a skull and shaking hands with a smiling cleric holding a book with a cross on it .
Caldwell says UC 's government - funded assertion contradicts a religious belief that evolution and religion are incompatible and amounts to a state position on religious doctrine .
This violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment barring Congress from making any law respecting the establishment or exercise of religion , she says .
She first sued in 2005 .
UC thwarted the suit in federal district court and the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco by successfully arguing that Caldwell 's exposure to the Web page is too minimal to cause the type of injury that would make her eligible to sue .
The lower courts threw the case out based on her eligibility and did n't rule on whether the Web page violates the First Amendment .
The Web page is presented as a resource for teachers , and Caldwell said she visits that section as a teacher and participant in the evolution debates and has the same right to sue as the plaintiff who was allowed to sue over a cross in the Mojave National Preserve .
Allowing the lower - court rulings to stand , Caldwell says in her Supreme Court appeal , " would make government Web sites an Establishment Clause free zone . "
Because the Internet is increasingly used by the government to communicate with citizens , the Supreme Court needs to address the issue , she says .
She is represented by the conservative Pacific Justice Institute in Sacramento and her husband , attorney Larry Caldwell .
Attorneys for UC say the lower - court rulings did not make the Internet immune to such claims but that existing legal principles are sufficient to dismiss Jeanne Caldwell 's eligibility to sue .
They also say deciding a new standard for the Internet would violate the role of the Supreme Court , which is not to open new legal frontiers but to resolve issues that arise from a body of lower - court rulings .
Roy Caldwell , director of Cal's Museum of Paleontology , the site 's sponsor , said some UC officials worry that the high court may want to clarify standards on " standing , " or eligibility to sue .
( He 's not related to Jeanne Caldwell . )
On the eve of Darwin 's birthday last Thursday , a new Gallup Poll was released showing that 39 percent of Americans believe in evolution , with 25 percent not believing in it and 36 percent holding no opinion .
Among weekly churchgoers , 24 percent believe in evolution and 41 percent do not .

Ireland Testing Water - Powered Streetlights
February 12th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Residents of Donegal County , Ireland , will soon get their evening light from water - powered street lamps .
LH Ecotech ’s “ hydro light ” is being installed for a test run on a footbridge over the River Finn in Ballybofey .
The € 3,000 light works when water flowing downstream passes through a 110 watt turbine , which then charges batteries to run the 30 watt LED .
The micro - hydro turbine is not yet installed , as officials are waiting until water levels drop .
And while the turbine can generate enough energy to power three lights , Ballybofey is sticking with one for now .
Each light will also be outfitted with a small solar panel as a back - up for the summer and when water levels in the river are low .

KIEV / MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian gas flows to four European Union countries dipped below normal on Saturday after Moscow cut off supplies to Ukraine in a pricing row , and there were no talks in sight to resolve the dispute .
Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom 's headquarters is seen in Moscow , December 3 , 2009 .
European Union president the Czech Republic said on Saturday it did not intend to become a participant or mediator in gas contract disputes between Russia and Ukraine , but urged both sides to reach an agreement soon .
REUTERS / Sergei Karpukhin
Temperatures were under zero overnight in Europe , and Bulgaria ’s Bulgargaz joined energy firms in Poland , Romania and Hungary in saying they had noted falls in supply , though flows to Europe ’s biggest economy , Germany , were not affected .
The European Union , which gets a fifth of its gas from pipelines that cross Ukraine , said it would call a crisis meeting of envoys in Brussels on Monday and demanded that transit and supply contracts be honored .
It also urged both sides to reach an agreement soon , but added that it did not intend to become a mediator and that the bloc had sufficient gas reserves for now .
The prospects of a swift settlement to the row appeared remote as Russian gas monopoly Gazprom said President Dmitry Medvedev had approved its move to take Ukraine to the arbitration court in Stockholm over gas transit to Europe .
Moscow alleged Kiev was stealing gas intended for Europe and playing political games .
Ukraine accused Russia of using “ energy blackmail ” and of not providing enough gas for the proper functioning of the transit system .
Three years after a similar dispute briefly disrupted supplies , European fears of gas flows dropping off in the dead of winter were once again becoming a reality -- and Russia ’s reputation as a reliable gas supplier was under new scrutiny .
Russia halted all supplies to Ukraine on New Year ’s Day in what it called a purely commercial dispute .
But in the background is a fierce disagreement over a drive by Kiev ’s pro-Western leaders to join NATO and Ukraine ’s strong support of Tbilisi during Russia ’s war with Georgia last year .
Poland , which had earlier reported a drop in Russian supplies , said deliveries via Ukraine were now down 11 percent .
Hungary said pressure in its pipeline from Ukraine had recovered slightly but was still below normal levels .
Gazprom said it was increasing deliveries to Europe by 52 million cubic meters per day , about 16 percent , but said its ability to compensate for the fuel lost on the Ukrainian route was limited .
The extra deliveries were being pumped around Ukraine -- through Belarus and Turkey -- and from underground storage facilities in Europe .
Gazprom said Kiev was not ready to resume talks .
“ They are not negotiating because there is nobody to negotiate .
It looks like they are not thinking about their own country , just playing political games , ” said Gazprom deputy CEO Alexander Medvedev .

RULES OF Behavior
Medvedev had talks with officials in the Czech Republic , holder of the EU ’s rotating presidency , just hours after a delegation from Ukraine had also been there to lobby for European support .
“ Europe must be interested in helping to solve the dispute as quickly as possible ...
What we need from the EU is their help to persuade Ukraine to follow the rules of behavior at the negotiating table , ” Medvedev told Reuters in an interview .
Ukraine , already reeling from the effects of the global financial crisis , denied it was stealing gas intended for Europe and instead alleged Gazprom had itself cut flows via Ukraine .
“ Gazprom ’s position breaches international practices of holding negotiations ... and amounts to energy blackmail , ” Ukrainian state energy firm Naftogaz said in a statement .
Naftogaz chief Oleh Dubyna said his officials were ready to go to Moscow at any moment to resume talks and sign a mutually acceptable deal .
The gulf between the two sides is vast .
Russia said it was prepared to charge Ukraine $ 250 per 1,000 cubic meters this year before talks collapsed and now wants Kiev to pay $ 418 .
Dubyna said that price could tip Ukraine into a humanitarian crisis .
Dubyna also said that even if Ukraine agreed to pay $ 250 instead of the current $ 179.5 , it would ask Moscow to raise gas transit fees it pays to Ukraine by 40 percent .
Moscow says transit fees cannot be revised before 2010 .
Naftogaz also said Moscow could choose to return to the old practice of paying for gas transit to Europe with gas instead of cash , which Medvedev described as “ beyond commercial logic . ”
European Union customers pay about $ 500 per 1,000 cubic meters of Russian gas , though that price is set to drop in line with the falling price of crude .
In Sofia , Bulgargaz CEO Dimitar Gogov said supply levels had not fallen below a critical level but further reductions could force the company to introduce restrictions for customers .
“ The pipeline pressure has dropped and we are getting smaller deliveries as of Saturday morning , ” Gogov told Reuters .
Standard & Poor 's recently shocked investors with an announcement that reported earnings for its S&P 500 Index for the fourth quarter of 2008 are forecast to be negative for the first time since such data were calculated in 1936 .
S&P further reports that for all of 2008 , earnings are expected to be less than $ 40 per share , indicating that the market now has a price / earnings ratio over 20 , well above its historical average of 15 .
What this dismal news actually reflects is the bizarre way in which S&P ( and most other index providers ) ...
Graphane crystal .
This novel two - dimensional material is obtained from graphene ( a monolayer of carbon atoms ) by attaching hydrogen atoms ( red ) to each carbon atoms ( blue ) in the crystal .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers at The University of Manchester have produced a ground - breaking new material , graphane , which has been derived from graphene .
Graphene , which was discovered at the University in 2004 , is a one - atom - thick crystal with unusual highly conductive properties , which has quickly become one of the hottest topics in physics and materials science .
It is also tipped for a number of future applications in electronics and photonics .
But research published today ( Friday 30 January , 2009 ) by Professor Andre Geim and Dr Kostya Novoselov , who led the group that discovered graphene in 2004 , suggests its uses could be far greater .

That 's because the scientists , from the University ’s School of Physics and Astronomy , have found that graphene will react with other substances to form new compounds with different properties - opening up further opportunities for development in the field of electronics .
As part of the research , published today in the leading scientific journal Science , Professor Geim and Dr Novoselov have used hydrogen to modify highly conductive graphene into a new two - dimensional crystal - graphane .
The addition of a hydrogen atom on each of the carbon atoms in the graphene achieved the new material without altering or damaging the distinctive one - atom - thick ‘ chicken wire ’ construction itself .
But instead of being highly conductive , like graphene , the new substance graphane has insulating properties .
The researchers say the findings demonstrate that the material can be modified using chemistry - clearing the way for the discovery of further graphene - based chemical derivatives .
“ Graphene is an excellent conductor and is tipped for many electronic applications , ” said Dr Novoselov .
“ However it was tempting to look at ways to gain additional control of its electronic properties through the use of chemistry .
“ Our work proves that this is a viable route and hopefully will open the floodgates for other graphene - based chemical derivatives .
This should widen the possible applications dramatically . ”
The unique electronic properties of graphene have already led researchers to look at ways the material could be used in the development of increasingly small and fast transistors .
However , the absence of the energy gap in the electronic spectra forced scientists to use rather complex graphene - based structures like quantum point contacts and quantum dots for this purpose .
The discovery that graphene can be modified into new materials , fine tuning its electronic properties , has opened up the increasingly rich possibilities in the development of future electronic devices from this truly versatile material .
Professor Geim said : “ The modern semiconductor industry makes use of the whole period table : from insulators to semiconductors to metals .
“ But what if a single material is modified so that it covers the entire spectrum needed for electronic applications ?
“ Imagine a graphene wafer with all interconnects made from highly conductive , pristine graphene whereas other parts are modified chemically to become semiconductors and work as transistors . ”
The Manchester researchers produced high - quality crystals of graphane by exposing pristine graphene to atomic hydrogen .
The approach shows a way of making many other ultra - thin crystalline materials based on graphene .

CMOS image sensors are used in most digital and mobile phone cameras Researchers in Scotland have been given nearly half a million pounds to try to improve digital camera images .
The team , lead by scientists at the University of Glasgow , are developing small nanostructures that would be used on light detecting image sensors .
These new hi-tech chips would be used in camera equipment to produce sharper and more colourful images .
The project is being funded by a £ 489,234 grant from the Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council .
We 'll be using nanotechnology to manipulate particles ... to create a new optical effect
Professor David Cumming
The researchers are using a phenomenon called surface plasmon resonance , which is an effect exhibited by certain metals when light waves fall onto their surfaces .
In digital cameras , this is the metal film used on microchip image sensors - known as a CMOS ( Complementary Metal - Oxide Semiconductor ) - that detect light waves and convert them into digital signals .
When light shines on the metal film , electrons on the surface absorb the energy of the light waves and begin oscillating , or shaking , in groups .
The resultant combined waves are called plasmons , and they modify the way light is distributed around the metal .
The CMOS then measures the light and assigns it a digital value which is then used to build up the bigger image .
The Scottish scientists hope to find a way of creating patterns or small nanostructures in the metal film on the CMOS .
This should increase the sensitivity of the sensor and result in higher quality images .
" We 'll be using nanotechnology to manipulate particles , so as to take advantage of the properties of electrons to create a new optical effect , " Professor David Cumming of Glasgow University who is leading the research team .
" Digital imaging has come a long way in recent years and this project aims to further improve the ability of digital devices to produce high - quality pictures , " he added .
Researchers also want to try and " tune " resonating plasmons into the same frequency as light , which could improve colour discrimination .
The project is expected to last until the middle of 2012 .

Dazzling new scientific techniques are allowing archaeologists to track the movements and menus of extinct hominids through the seasons and years as they ate their way across the African landscape , helping to illuminate the evolution of human diets .
Piecing together relationships between the diets of hominids several million years ago to that of early and modern humans is allowing scientists to see how diet relates to the evolution of cognitive abilities , social structures , locomotion and even disease , said University of Colorado at Boulder anthropology Professor Matt Sponheimer .
Sponheimer organized a session titled " The Evolution of Human Diets " at the annual American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting Feb. 12-15 in Chicago .
Sponheimer specializes in stable isotope analysis , comparing particular forms of the same chemical element , like carbon , present in fossil remains to help reconstruct past lives of hominids .
Zapping hominid teeth with lasers , for example , frees telltale carbon gases from the enamel , allowing scientists to pinpoint the types of plants consumed by the hominids and the environments where they lived , said Sponheimer , who also relies on the microscopic wear of ancient hominid teeth for data on food consumption .
" Darwin surmised more than 150 years ago in ' The Descent of Man ' that changes in the subsistence or environment of human ancestors likely led to the advent of modern humans , " Sponheimer said .
" Dietary resources can be a force for evolution . "
One hominid genus under study by Sponheimer is the 2 million - year - old Paranthropus , a short , upright member of the australopithecine family that includes the Ethiopian fossil , Lucy .
Discovered in 1974 , Lucy , believed to be roughly 3 million years old , is regarded by many anthropologists as the matriarch of modern humans .
A 2006 study by Sponheimer of Paranthropus robustus documented its diverse diet , clouding the notion that it was driven to extinction by its picky eating habits .
And a 1999 study led by Sponheimer indicated 3 - million - year - old australopithecines may have even have been catching and eating small animals .
" Paranthropus is sometimes referred to as a nutcracker because its flat teeth and powerful jaw muscles appear designed to eat hard foods , " he said .
" But some research suggests that the most mechanically challenging foods like nuts were eaten only at limited times of the year .
" In addition , foods not previously considered to have been consumed in significant quantities , like sedges , grasses , seeds and perhaps even animal foods , were a significant part of the Paranthropus diet . "
Roughly 2.5 million years ago , the australopithicenes are thought to have split into the genus Homo and the now - extinct genus Paranthropus , including South Africa 's Paranthropus robustus and East Africa 's Paranthropus boisei , said Sponheimer .
Research presently under way at CU - Boulder indicates that while Paranthropus robustus and Paranthropus boisei are almost indistinguishable anatomically , they may have had very different diets .
Other intriguing research under way by Sponheimer and his colleagues hints that some female australopithecines , including members of the Paranthropus genus , died in different geographic areas than where they were born .
The researchers are comparing such data to social patterns of chimpanzees , in which females generally migrate away from their original ranges and move into new areas -- the opposite of behavior charted in most other primates , said Sponheimer .
" Textbooks treat these ancient hominids as static piles of fossil bones , " said Sponheimer .
" We treat them as biological organisms moving across the landscape .
It 's entirely possible that many things we thought we knew about them were wrong , and pages of textbooks will have to have to be re-written . "
The Bridge House , Little Venice
It 's odd that the pub should in one sense be the ultimate English tourist attraction , since all countries have their own bars and cafés , but somehow the English pub has become part of international culture .
And deservedly so , because there really is something special about English pubs .
A good English pub is almost like a communal living - room ; a kind of home away from home .
That is , the good English pubs are like this .
They are of course outnumbered by the indifferent or even bad pubs , which are just boozers like those you find anywhere in the world .
The Harp , London
In January this year I took a few days off in London , and spent them just walking around the city visiting pubs , which is a marvellously relaxing way to spend a few days .
Especially if you start and finish early , before the pubs fill up .
And if you stick to half - pints of British cask ale , which is generally low in alcohol , and keep a slow pace you can keep going all day and not really feel any effects .
I made use of the opportunity to take lots of pub photos , which is what this posting is mostly about .
The Harp , Covent Garden
The Harp is right in the heart of tourist London , in Covent Garden , but has somehow managed to absorb the tourists and remain a gem of a small , unpretentious English pub .
The decorations are kind of low - key and rambling , featuring historical photos and notices , the bar covered in pump climps from the many guest beers .
The staff are English ( which is not that common in central London ) and firmly working - class , friendly and unfussy , like the place itself .
There 's a good selection of cask ales , while food is limited to excellent sausage sandwiches .
As in many English pubs , no music is played , which is a real blessing .
The only sound is that of conversation , of which there is plenty .
People come and go , chatting seemingly indiscriminately with each other at the bar over a pint or two .
The Harp , London
The Prince Alfred , Little Venice
The Prince Alfred
The Prince Alfred is a completely different kind of pub again , as a glance at the facade will show .
It 's built in a palatial style with lots of carved wood and cut glass .
This type of pub was common in late 19th century London , but today there are n't that many examples left .
I enjoy visiting pubs like these just to gape at the architecture .
Inside , the pub is no less remarkable .
Compartment screen
The area around the bar is divided into compartments by elaborately carved and decorated screens like the one shown above .
To pass between compartments you have to bend low , or go out on the street , since each compartment has its own street door .
Today this looks strange , but Victorians were obsessed with privacy , and this is just one of many privacy - enhancing features in pubs from that period .
Another is the so - called snob screens , which prevented customers from seeing other customers round the bar , while still allowing customers to see the bar staff .
The bar
In addition to the bar area there is a fine restaurant as part of the pub .
Some decry this as a violation of the spirit of the place , and as creeping gentrification , but personally I thought it was a nice touch .
While the idea of preserving the original pub as a kind of living museum sounds wonderful , I 'm not sure it can be done in practice .
As for the beer , the most interesting on offer was Young 's Bitter on cask .
Ah well .
The Warrington Hotel , Little Venice
The entrance
From the Prince Alfred it 's only a short walk to The Warrington Hotel , which is no longer a hotel , but a pub on the ground floor , and a fine restaurant on the first floor .
Again , for sheer architectural exhuberance there is little to beat this art nouveau gem .
When I arrived there were just three people there , two of them sleeping , so I settled happily down on the leather couches with my Ale Lang Syne and a book .
In the pub
I enjoyed the peace and quiet so much I stayed on for an Adnams Broadside from cask as well .
Then , on leaving I stumbled across one of those minor historical footnotes that can be found all over London : a small blue plaque announcing that David Ben -Gurion had lived just a stone 's throw from the pub .
Then , a little further down the street , I walk past Alan Turing 's birthplace .
The bar
The Jerusalem Tavern , Clerkenwell
Reading
The sign above the door of the Jerusalem Tavern says " anno 1720 " , and the interior makes this seem plausible , being done out in bare concrete , unpainted wood , and old - fashioned porcelain tiling .
The interior does indeed date from that period , but it 's only been a pub for a couple of decades .
Still , it 's a wonderfully athmospheric place .
There was no music , and the only sound when I was there were two bar staff conversing with a friend at the bar , over glasses of red wine .
( Visible on the bar in the last photo . )
The pub is tied to the St. Peter 's brewery , which provides an additional reason to visit .
There were six cask ales from that brewery on when I was visiting ( including the dark mild ) , plus a good pale lager from Taddington on keg .
And then more St. Peter 's ales in bottles , which they give you the option of either having from the fridge ( too cold ) or from the shelf .
I recommend the ones from shelf , which were perfect at room temperature .
St. Peter 's is highly respected for its well - made traditional English beers , which have a definite house character , and easily remembered for their distinctive logo and bottles .
With all the fuss over extreme beers it 's nice to see someone still making low - alcohol beers with lots of flavour and subtlety .
Enemies of the stimulus package are outcalling the suppporters of economic recovery by enormous numbers .
I hope that someone smart does an analysis about what that means regarding the power of talk radio vs. the internet , which is where I think the fault line lies .
In the meantime , call your Senators now - no matter which party they belong to - and tell them to support the stimulus package .
From True Majority :
President Obama 's " American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan " will create jobs by rebuilding our roads and bridges , repairing our schools , doubling our renewable energy capacity , and more .
It 's much of what we 've been wanting for years - which is exactly why there is an organized conservative campaign to stop the economic stimulus .
The vote on this bill will come in the Senate as early as TODAY , Monday , Feburary 2nd .
Please ,
This is too important to let ideological political games get in the way .
Independent economic experts have said the plan will create up to 4 million new jobs1 by investing in American roads , schools and renewable energy , and also make sure the hundreds of thousands of us losing our jobs will still be able to eat and pay the rent .
We 've got to get this done .

Honestly , in the scheme of things and with so many people suffering because of this recession , getting this stimulus package passed is an easy lift .
Go through your email lists - think of people to ask to make a call and follow - up with them .
Consider this a warm - up for the coming health care battle , which will make this fight look like a poolside nap on a summer day .
There is no level of gay - bashing to which the Catholic Church will not stoop .
Via Think Progress , we learn that the Vatican opposes a U.N. resolution that would urge nations to de-criminalize homosexuality :
The Vatican is drawing criticism from gay rights groups and newspapers editorials after Archbishop Celestino Migliore , the Vatican ’s permanent observer to the United Nations , told a French Catholic news service that the Vatican opposes “ a proposed U.N. resolution calling on governments worldwide to de-criminalise homosexuality . ”
Migliore claimed that the resolution “ would create new and implacable discriminations ” against opponents of same - sex marriage .
The resolution has nothing to do with marriage .
It ’s aimed , in part , at nations that kill gays .
Killing gays .
How Christian .
That should make the Prada wearing Pope very proud .
The Catholics are now in some weird competition with their new friends , the Mormons , to see which church can bash gays more .
Of course , both churches should spend more time preventing young children from being molested by church leaders , but that ’s another story .
The Vatican and its U.S. subsidiary could n’t be bigger hypocrites when it comes to the gays .
There are plenty of gays in the Catholic Church , including a lot right here in D.C.
Some of them are n’t too subtle about it , either .
That may explain why the Catholic leadership spends so much time thinking about all things gay .
It ’s a very familiar subject .
Madam , -
We are well rid of the annus horribilis of 2008 .
It now looks , however , as if 2009 may be even worse .
It certainly is for the unfortunate inhabitants of Gaza .
As I write I am sitting within a hundred miles or so of the conflict watching Al - Jazeera , the only broadcaster providing live TV coverage from the area .
I have known both Israel and Palestine well over the past 30 years and have very good friends on both sides , and I am horrified , as they are , by what we are being forced to witness .
I have often supported Israel and deplored terror attacks and suicide bombings against her citizens .
Not even the most rabid Zionist dare call me either anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli .
Indeed at this very moment I have as a guest at my house here in Cyprus one of my close Israeli Jewish friends .
For all the nasty and inflated rhetoric of people like Ahmedinajad in Iran it is actually the Israelis , under the protection of the Washington - Jerusalem axis led by Bush and Olmert , who are driving the Palestinians into the sea .
Where does all this horror and barbarism come from ?
More than 60 years ago Christian Europe was complicit in the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews as well as hundreds of thousands of gypsies , homosexuals and political dissidents .
Europe then attempted to assuage its guilt by helping to create the state of Israel , thus landing our problem in the lap of the completely guiltless Palestinians .
Tragically , it seems that , as sometimes happens with individual humans , the abused is becoming the abuser .
That is why the massive bombardment from land , sea and air of a civilian population besieged and entrapped within a tiny area carries such sinister resonances of the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto .
It is astonishing that there has been virtually no international condemnation at official level of the bombing of a mosque in Gaza during evening prayers with at least a dozen people militarily murdered in the process .
Had this been a church or a synagogue in Israel , one can only imagine the outcry .
Just as was recorded by the great Jewish scholar Richard Klemperer , trapped in Germany in the 130s and 1940s , language itself has become debased .
Words must have lost their meaning when persons such as the Israeli Minister Tzipi Livni and the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice can maintain that " there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza " .
Tell that to the mother in Gaza who saw her five daughters blown to pieces in front of her eyes , to the 11 - year - ld boy who had his face burnt off by an Israeli incendiary or the 1.5 million Palestinians with virtually no food , water , electricity or medical supplies and indeed no effective shelter from the US - supplied bombs raining down on them from the sky .
How dare the incoming Czech presidency purport to speak in the name of Europe in describing the Israeli blitz as defensive rather than offensive ?
And of course the United States has used its veto once more to prevent any statement emerging from the UN .
I have seen American - accented Israeli spokespersons repeatedly ask how European countries would react if they were subjected to sporadic bomb or missile attacks .
For two decades the United Kingdom , both in Northern Ireland and Britain , was subjected to just such sustained attacks by the Provisional IRA .
I am very glad to say that they did not invade Dundalk or flatten the city of Dublin in a series of air raids .
Of course it is to be deplored that Israeli civilians have also become casualties in this downward spiral of tit - for - tat violence .
However , when the casualties are running as they now are at 125 to 1 , one must question the proportionality of Israeli actions .
I have often raised both in the Senate and in the Foreign Affairs Committee the matter of the human rights protocols attached to the external association agreement between the EU and Israel .
So far both our own Government and the EU itself have steadfastly refused to ensure that these human rights provisions are even monitored , let alone implemented .
Alas for suffering humanity .
But thank God for the sparks of decency visible even in this terrible conflict .
I salute in particular the tremendous moral courage of those Israeli Jews whom I have seen on TV speaking out against the current violence and in support of peace .
- Yours , etc ,
Senator DAVID NORRIS ,
Cyprus .
Madam , —
With reference to the ongoing Irish Times coverage of Israel 's military action , including its ground incursion , against Hamas in the Gaza Strip , I wish to make the following points :
1 . The questions I have been asking the Irish people are fundamental to any discussion of Israel 's action : " What would you do if Dublin were subjected to a bombardment of 8,000 rockets and mortars similar to that endured by Israeli towns and cities for eight years ? "
And : " What would you do if you had only 15 seconds to run for shelter from rocket fire , not once or occasionally but almost every day for eight years ? "
2. Even leading Arab countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia , and the chairman of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas , have blamed Hamas for ending the ceasefire and triggering the current situation .
3 . The goal of the present ground operation is to destroy the terrorist infrastructure of Hamas - the rocket launch sites and the tunnels used to smuggle weapons and explosives into Gaza , in order greatly to reduce the quantity of rockets and mortars fired at the civilian population of southern Israel .
We are not interested in the reoccupation of Gaza , but in the creation of a more secure reality for almost a million residents of southern Israel and a life without the constant threat of rocket and mortar fire .
4 . All civilian deaths in this conflict , whether Palestinian or Israeli , are tragic .
The people of Gaza are not our enemies .
Israel makes every possible effort to avoid civilian casualties by leafleting and telephoning evacuation warnings to families living in houses used by Hamas as launch pads for rocket fire , or for storage of weapons and explosives .
It is Hamas that turns these places into military targets ; some of its members even boast about the use of women and children as human shields .
5. Since Israel withdrew completely from Gaza in 2005 , Hamas has been the enemy of normality there , and bears chief responsibility for the so - called " siege " .
Its rocket fire forced Israel to close the crossings periodically .
The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza remains closed because Hamas in 2007 expelled the European Union monitors charged with supervising the crossing under the agreement that accompanied Israel 's withdrawal .
Egypt refuses to reopen it until Hamas reinstates the European monitors and Palestinian Authority control .
Since the present operation began , Hamas has also rejected an Egyptian offer to evacuate injured Palestinians to hospitals in Egypt .
6. Israel has acted and continues to act to improve the humanitarian situation .
During the ceasefire period , even while smuggling and tunnelling continued , Israel almost doubled the number of truckloads of humanitarian supplies entering Gaza from Israel - to 17,000 , compared with 9,000 in the six months preceding the ceasefire .
7. Israel , a democratic state , is acting in self - defence , whereas Hamas , a terrorist organisation bent on Israel 's destruction , stands in the way of peace .

ZION EVRONY ,

Madam , - Israel is again displaying its outright disregard for international law .
One small example of its ruthlessness is more than evident in its programme of dropping leaflets on the people of Gaza warning them to leave their homes which are about to be bombed .
Given that Israel has the Gaza Strip surrounded , where do they expect them to go ?
It is time to boycott this pariah state .
We should send home the Israeli ambassador instead of allowing him space in this paper to peddle his lies and justify Israel 's crimes against humanity .

Madam , -
While some would argue that our Government has been unworthy of praise in recent months , Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin is certainly to be commended for his comments on Israel 's actions in Gaza .
Mr Martin 's comments were reasonably clear by comparison with the mealy - mouthed opinions offered by other governments .
Yet again the Israeli government has executed a grossly disproportionate response to the actions of Hamas , and in doing so has provided Hamas with its most efficient recruiting officer .
In the long term , the current actions will do nothing to resolve the " situation " , but will in fact make it worse for Israelis and Palestinians alike .
Israel , which regularly likes to point out that it is the only true democracy in the region , must recognise that Hamas was itself democratically elected , and ask the question why .
Only when Israel - and indeed the so - called western world - face up to the reasons Hamas has been able to take power democratically in Gaza can the problem start to be resolved .
Our Government , in concert with the EU , and hopefully America under its new leadership , must bring Israel to realise that it cannot beat a nation into submission .
The only workable solution will come through dialogue .

Madam , -
Here is a question for all those demonstrating on behalf of the Palestinians .
Which Palestinians do you support ?
The " moderate " Palestinians of the Fatah - controlled Palestine Authority , with which Israel is in negotiations based on a two - state solution , or the extremist Hamas Palestinians who control the Gaza Strip ?
Hamas has been labelled a terrorist organization by the UN , the EU and the US , and has refused to recognize the existence of Israel .
Not only did it take control of Gaza by an illegal coup in which many Fatah operatives were killed and injured , but during the current conflict , according to Khaled Abu Toameh , the Jerusalem Post 's Arab Affairs correspondent , Hamas has murdered 35 Fatah prisoners and " kneecapped " or mutilated 75 more detainees .
So let 's be clear , there is a vast difference between supporting the Palestine Authority and supporting Hamas in Gaza .
The former want a negotiated settlement with Israel while the latter wants to destroy Israel and then start a world - wide Caliphate .

Madam , - The World Press Photo of the year award 2006 was given to photographer Spencer Platt , who captured an image of four stylishly dressed young women and their driver cruising through the rubble of war - torn Beirut in a convertible .
The photograph , not surprisingly , caused controversy .
Nikola Solic 's photograph in your edition of January 2nd is equally striking , and will surely be remembered as an iconic image of the tragedy that is Gaza 2009 .
The image is of a group of young , clearly well - off Israelis , five females and one male , surveying from a hilltop distance an Israeli air strike on the Gaza Strip .
One young woman is laughing heartily ; another gazes languidly into the distance , and has a mobile phone glued to her ear ; another , armed with binoculars , is looking , presumably , at a scene of devastation .
An extraordinary photograph that narrates , even better than words can do , the attitudes of a nation .

CIARAN COSGROVE ,

Madam , - Much of the media and several of your letter - writers seem to have forgotten that Israel and the Palestinian Authority had an internationally supported workable peace until Hamas decided to abandon it , just as they did the recent ceasefire .
Several commentators who wanted no negotiating with Sinn Féin-IRA unless there was a ceasefire seem to think Israel should negotiate with Hamas , whose avowed determination is to drive Israelis from the Middle East .
And in all the talk of proportionality , one must n't forget who it is that supports Hamas .
- Yours , etc ,
PETER LYDON ,

Dublin 6 .
Madam , - Nadav Cohen of the Israeli Embassy ( January 3rd ) suggests that one of the elements that precipitated his country 's current slaughter of Palestinians - using US - supplied aircraft , let us not forget - was the blowing - up of a border fence .
He is ready to ignore the fact that there should be no fences at all around Gaza ; that fences , walls , refusal of food and medicines , targeted murder of Hamas leaders and other such events have turned Gaza into a ghetto from which its citizens have every right to attempt to escape , and every right to fight for their basic dignity .
He has forgotten his history if he cannot see - as many enlightened Israelis can , thankfully - the dreadful comparisons between what is happening around Gaza and the dark military violence visited on the ghettos of Poland six decades ago .
Thus has Israel , an abused child , been raised to become the abuser , complete with self - justification of its actions and an unwillingness to listen to others .
One excuse for violence follows upon another .
Does this rage not also have its root in Israel 's deep sense of guilt at having displaced so many Palestinian people in order to establish its own identity ?
No , Mr Cohen , it 's got nothing to do with blowing up a fence .
- Yours , etc ,

Apologies carry weight when they are accompanied by a clear explanation by the miscreants of what they did wrong and why .
And the problem with the sorries uttered by the former bosses of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS is that they lacked a detailed account of why they did what they did .
Mistakes were admitted - but motivation was glossed over .
Sir Tom Mckillop and Sir Fred Goodwin of Royal Bank of Scotland both conceded that buying the toxic rump of ABN after the start of the credit crunch in the autumn of 2007 was a howler of the first order .
Lord Stevenson and Andy Hornby of HBOS admitted their bank had become too dependent on unreliable finance from wholesale markets and had lent too much to property and construction companies , among other things .
But they gave little clue as to why they made these remarkable errors .
Were their banks gripped by a get - rich - quick bonus culture that led them to take excessive risks in the pursuit of short - term profit ?
There was a faint nod toward that , but no acknowledgement that the remuneration system that enriched the few at the expense of the many might have been a serious problem .
Did they lack the knowledge and skills to assess the risks they were running ?
They all denied that they were n't up to the task of controlling their huge , complex and sprawling banks .
Were there inadequate checks and balances in place , lousy governance , the wrong people on the wrong board committees ?
They all looked a bit nonplussed .
Perhaps it 's too early to expect those in part to blame for our economic woes to fully understand the motivation that led to the calamitous meltdown of their banks and the near collapse of the entire financial system .
Perhaps they never will grasp fully what went wrong .
But it matters that we learn the lessons , so we can design a sounder , safer financial system .
The impulse to acquisition , pursuit of gain , of money , of the greatest possible amount of money , has in itself nothing to do with capitalism .
This impulse exists and has existed among waiters , physicians , coachmen , artists , prostitutes , dishonest officials , soldiers , nobles , crusaders , gamblers , and beggars .
One may say that it has been common to all sorts and conditions of men at all times and in all countries of the earth , wherever the ...
Would you tell me , please , which way I ought to go from here ?'

' I do n't much care where ' said Alice .
' Then it does n't matter which way you go ,

Maj Gen
Khan 's troops have been involved in fierce battles " No permission is required - just open fire on anything that moves , " came the order from Maj Gen Tarik Khan , commander of Pakistan 's Frontier Corps .
We were sheltering in a traditional mud-walled compound in in the tribal area of Bajaur on the border with Afghanistan .
His men had seized it from militants the day before , after fierce hand - to - hand fighting .
Bursts of fire still rang out and shell cases smoked underfoot as I explored the network of tunnels connecting these compounds , some stretching for several kilometres underground .
The Taleban and al - Qaeda had dug in here over the years , threatening the local tribes and becoming the effective power in the land .
The Pakistani government in the past has been accused of not being committed to the US - led " war on terror " because offensives turned into truces before the job was finished .
But now the new civilian government led by President Asif Ali Zardari - whose wife , Benazir Bhutto , was killed by extremists a year ago - has declared that this time it is a fight to the death .
" If they do not lay down their arms , we will kill them , " declared Gen Khan .
" There is no other way to bring this to a close . "
Sanctuary Pakistan 's commitment to the fight against terrorism affects many of us - the majority of serious terror plots in the UK lead back in some way to Pakistan , which has also become a launch pad for the growing insurgency in neighbouring Afghanistan .
" It 's a life and death struggle for Pakistan as well as Afghanistan , " Brig Gen Mark Milley told me as we flew in a US army helicopter along the Afghan side of the border just a few miles away .
The scenery below was spectacular , rugged and wild , and clearly no barrier to the insurgents .
" The terrain and the culture lends itself to multiple groups , amongst them al - Qaeda , who have established a sanctuary here , " explained Gen Milley .
He has lost 16 men to well - trained and motivated insurgents in the past few months alone .
Pakistan is under intense international pressure to destroy the militants who established a safe haven and training camps after fleeing Afghanistan in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in the US .
That pressure has increased following the attacks in Mumbai , which India blames on a Pakistan - based Kashmiri group .
Both generals explained to me that the strategy now is to trap the militants between the hammer of the Pakistani army 's offensive in the tribal areas and the anvil of US forces ranged on the other side of the border .
Suicide bombers
This winter could be decisive in preventing the insurgents retreating back into the tribal areas - but only if the Pakistani army and government hold firm .
But a local Taleban leader who operates from the Pakistan side of the border was defiant .
" Pakistani and Afghan soldiers will die , " he said .
" We Muslims are not disabled and this war is not going to end . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .

This man trains many of the suicide bombers sent over the border to Afghanistan to attack coalition troops and Afghan civilians .
In Afghan jails there are 48 would - be suicide bombers from Pakistan .
This year there have been over 140 suicide attacks in Afghanistan - even the streets of the capital , Kabul , are no longer safe .
Abed , a young man we met in one jail , came from the Punjab .
He now repents of what he had done , telling me he was deceived by his Taleban handlers , who sent him to drive a massive truck bomb into what he was told was an army base full of foreigners - British and US troops .
But when he got near he realised the soldiers were speaking the local language .
" I had prayed in my heart that I would not kill any innocent Muslims , " he said .
" So when I saw they were Muslims I surrendered myself . "
Fighting back
We took a letter from Abed to his family back in Pakistan .
They were horrified to discover what he had become - he had disappeared the year before and they thought he had gone to study at a madrassa , or religious school .
Abed 's family were shocked to hear of his fate But Abed had been recruited by the Taleban and his family were angry and upset .
" The big religious scholars have taken him , " said his mother , Naseem , " and we do n't know how they persuaded him to do jihad " .
His family sent a letter back to Abed telling him they forgave him and asking him to seek forgiveness from God .
In the same jail we met another young bomber , 17 - year - old Khalil , who was still filled with hate against foreigners .
He had been caught before he could detonate his suicide vest .
He refused to speak directly to me , a western woman , but told our interpreter that " the Muslims can never be friends with the infidel " .
Pakistan needs to root out militancy and terror not only from the tribal areas but from the cities , the religious schools or madrassas and the countryside .
" Yes , it will be a difficult and expensive war to fight , " said Rehman Malik , the president 's counter - terrorism advisor .
" But we have two options - either we hand Pakistan over to the Taleban or we fight back . "
The future security of all of us depends on Pakistan 's will and ability to fight back .
Panorama : Britain's Terror Heartland will be broadcast on BBC One at 2030 GMT on Monday 15 December .

Nutrition experts predict that most Americans may be slightly more concerned with the economy than , say , their antioxidant consumption in the months ahead .
If that ’s the case , the quest for a healthful and cost - conscious diet suggests Americans will be eating more meals cooked at home , upping their produce and whole - grain intake and eschewing sodium .
“ It ’s the back - to - basics bailout diet , ” says Shelley McGuire , professor of nutrition at Washington State University in Pullman .
--
Benefits of grains
Advertisement
More and more people are realizing the health benefits of whole grains , says Joan Salge Blake , clinical assistant professor of nutrition at Boston University , who predicts that the year ahead could be a good one for popcorn ( which is , in fact , a whole grain ) .
Studies have shown that a diet rich in whole grains -- barley , oats , brown rice and newly trendy quinoa are other examples -- can help reduce the risk of heart disease , diabetes and stroke .
The high - fiber content of whole grains , which confers many of their health benefits , also means that “ they fill you up but do n’t fill you out , ” Blake adds .
Whole grains also lend themselves to hearty , home - cooked meals , Blake says .
When people eat at home , they ’re often likely to eat more healthfully , she adds , citing a number of recent food industry innovations -- pre-cooked rice in a bag , clean and chopped fresh vegetables and fruits , including the microwave - in - bag varieties -- that are facilitating the consumption of quick but nutritious meals at home .

Of course , eating in has an additional benefit , says McGuire , who is also a spokeswoman for the American Society for Nutrition .
“ You can eat for cheap if you do it at home , ” she says .

Eating out vs. in
But many Americans will still eat out , recession or no , and with good reason : “ Our culinary skills have vastly declined over several generations , ” says Greg Drescher , executive director of strategic initiatives for the Culinary Institute of America in Greystone , Calif .
Fortunately , from a nutrition standpoint , he says , restaurant chefs are showing an increased interest in adding innovative items featuring whole grains and a variety of produce to their menus .
Advertisement
The trend has arisen in response to a growing consumer interest in so - called “ stealth health , ” Drescher says .
“ People want to eat healthy but do n’t want to be reminded about it , ” he explains .
Americans have a much more sophisticated approach to healthful eating than they did five or 10 years ago , Drescher adds .
More and more , they ’re realizing that there are no “ magic bullet ” foods ( i.e. oats ) or food types ( i.e. low - fat versions of foods ) and are instead embracing a more holistic approach to healthful eating , one that emphasizes variety and whole , less - processed foods .
“ An interest in a broad spectrum of flavors is spreading throughout the country , ” Drescher says .
McGuire agrees , and predicts that -- combined with economic constraints -- such an interest could alter the choices consumers make in their pursuit of a healthful diet .
“ People are going to give up really expensive functional foods and vitamin drinks , ” she says .
“ We have an incredible agricultural system that produces inexpensive food , ” she adds , “ but we have been so frivolous with our food dollar . ”

Cutting back on salt
Americans have also been frivolous , arguably , with a seemingly innocuous condiment : salt .
“ Salt is by far the cheapest thing around .
It ’s an easy fix ” for any food item , says Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a Washington , D.C. - based nutrition advocacy group .
Studies have shown that high sodium intake can raise blood pressure , increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke .
As a result , salt ranks high on the list of things Americans are trying to avoid , says Barbara Katz , president of HealthFocus International , a market research firm in St. Petersburg , Fla .
Advertisement
This coming year , consumers may get some help from Uncle Sam .
Several government agencies are investigating ways to reduce sodium in the American diet -- particularly in restaurant and packaged foods -- as a way to prevent heart disease , Jacobson says .
“ The British government has made sodium reduction a top priority , ” Jacobson says .
“ Food companies are worried that the U.S. government may follow suit . ”
--
Safer foods
The number of reduced - sodium food items ( such as Campbell ’s sea - salt seasoned soup ) is already growing , but Jacobson predicts that consumers may soon see more manufacturers not just reducing salt , but replacing it with blends of herbs and spices and so - called “ bitter blockers , ” chemicals that block unpleasant tastes ( thereby reducing the need to mask them with salt ) .
Advertisement
Bitter blockers , however , may not be the best bet for food manufacturers in 2009 .
Chemical additives and preservatives also rank high on the list of items consumers are avoiding in their quest for better health , Katz says .
“ There ’s an interest in purity , ” she says .
“ People want to know what ’s in their food . ”
That interest , she says , is also driving people to shop local and cook at home more -- as are the recent chemical - contamination scares related to food products produced in China .
An American population that cooks more , consumes less salt and eats more whole grains and produce may turn out to be a reality in the year ahead -- or just wishful thinking .
But if one thing seems certain , it ’s this , says Linda Smithson , co-president of Food Watch , an Edina , Minn . - based research firm that tracks food trends :
Until the economy shows sure signs of recovery , most Americans , health - conscious or not , wo n’t be eating caviar and truffles .

Christopher Wellman lays out a clear and concise comparison between taxation and theft , on pages 3 to 5 of Is There a Duty to Obey the Law ? , which after the introductory paragraph on page 3 , was a pleasant surprise .
Evidently , though , he is “ not an anarchist ” , a decision he bases presumably on several “ plausible ” premises which must obtain in order to justify the state , the crucial element of which is the consequentialist appeal : “ States can render their services without imposing unreasonable costs upon those they coerce . ”
Now , unreasonable is a fairly ambiguous term , devoid of objectivity .
Who determines what is ( or is not ) unreasonable ?
Is it unreasonable if the poor man can’t find a job because of restrictive wage laws or occupational license requirements ?
Is it unreasonable if the wage - earner can’t escape the shackles of his Nine - to - Five in order to self - employ , because of onerous and often unfavorable tax codes ?
Is it unreasonable to destroy families in an unwinnable “ war ” on drugs ?
Is it unreasonable to use taxpayer money to bail out the Financial Elite responsible for bringing the world economy to its knees ?
Those are surely questions worth asking .
But instead , Wellman resorts to the Hobbesian war , of “ all against all , ” in which life is “ nasty , brutish , and short . ”
Perhaps the best way to get a sense of the benefits of political society is to imagine what life would be like if your state were to go completely out of existence .
Unless one lives in a very close - knit , face - to - face community where everyone knows each other and is invested in the group as a whole ( which almost none of us does ) , it seems unrealistic to think that life without a political state would be anything but a horribly chatotic and perilous environment where one would lack the security necessary to pursue meaningful projects and relationships .
In other words , for the vast majority of us , it would be virtually impossible to live a rewarding life .
Wellman qualifies his argument with an important assumption , that meaningful existence is not possible “ Unless one lives in a very close - knit , face - to - face community where everyone knows each other and is invested in the group as a whole ( which almost none of us does ) . ”
I believe that the question which really needs to be answered here is : why not ?
Why do n’t we have a vested interest in our communities ?
A simple answer is that we do n’t live in genuine communities .
Genuine communities have largely been co-opted or destroyed by governments .
Governments “ take care of the poor ” so we do n’t feel the responsibility to take care of ourselves .
Governments “ protect us ” so we do n’t responsible for our own protection .
Governments give us “ work ” so we do n’t need to be productive .
But in order to provide ( technically , this is just redistribution ) any of those things , the factions competing for control of the Government instigate class warfare , pitting individual members of society against one another , communities against communities , interests against interests .
The resultant decline in genuine community is then used as justification for even more government .
We do n’t look out for one another anymore , because those who aspire to rule have the population convinced : not only are the “ others ” not looking out for you , they ’re also your enemy .
The real “ enemy ” is anyone perpetuating this fiction .
What really happens , is the Hobbesian evil is concentrated , distilled by the existence of the State .
According to numerous philosophers , anthropologists , and sociologists , Hobbes was wrong
[ I ] it is civilization , and the technology we have organized ourselves to produce , that enables us to kill millions half - way around the globe at the push of a button .
This is the ultimate proof that Hobbes was wrong–civilization is the way we organize ourselves to commit mass violence , not the way we organize ourselves to contain it .
If we live in a violent world today , it is because life is out of balance , because our “ animal pity ” has not learned to cross the same distance that our missiles can .
The latter opinion is something I ’ve argued before , far from being the savior or protector , governments are the single greatest threat to the human species .
To be sure , some are less oppressive or less violent than others , but taken as a whole , they ’ve slaughtered many millions more than individuals ( no matter how evil ) could ever dream of doing on their own .
We need more “ community . ”
But government is n’t going to give it to us , we have to build it on our own .
— James Saft is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own —
Want to do well out of the rolling and ever expanding bailouts ?
Hold your nose , buy corporate credit and try not to read any news for the next five years .
First off , let ’s get one thing clear : the prospects for companies in Europe and the U.S. are absolutely awful and many will default , quite probably more than in any post - war recession .
But company debt is being priced for Armageddon , and while things will indeed get very bad we have good reasons to believe that governments will be there directing loans into the economy , effectively socializing many of the losses investors in credit would otherwise suffer .
Britain on Monday bailed out its banks for a second time in three months , taking steps including allowing its banks to insure themselves via the government for loan losses and instituting a fund to buy up to 50 billion pounds of securities to free up credit .
Job one for the incoming Obama administration will be to devise its own plan , both for how to spend the second half of a $ 700 billion bailout fund and what to do about its banks .
None of this may be enough for the banks , many of whose liabilities exceed their assets , a state sometimes rudely called insolvency , and many may be nationalized before they are able to earn their ways out of their current holes .
But in some ways none of this may even matter to credit investors , and could even be construed as a positive .
It is clear that we are seeing a massive transfer of risk and of doubtful loans from the banking sector to the taxpayer and further that government will step up and lend , directly or indirectly , to businesses needing credit .
The sooner this happens and the greater the scale , the more positive it is , in a broad sense , for credit .
Currently the Markit iTraxx Crossover index , made up of mostly “ junk ” - rated credits , is priced at just under 1000 basis points , meaning that investors wanting to insure against default over the next five years must pay 10 percent per year of the face value of the debt .
Assuming that creditors will be able to recover about 20 percent of the value of the debt from any companies that go under , that 1000 basis points implies that almost half of the companies will go under over five years .
For a similar index of higher rated credits trading at 162 basis points , and assuming a much higher 40 percent recovery rate from bankruptcies , the implication is that 13 percent default — even though 20 percent of the index are banks whose creditors will almost certainly be made whole by government .
“ I would guess that if these implied default probabilities come through it ’s the end of the system , ” said Jochen Felsenheimer , co-head of credit at Assenagon Asset Management in Munich .
“ If 50 percent of all European high yield companies were to default over next five years , that ’s worse than the Great Depression . ”
REFINANCING AND LIQUIDITY RISK
Of course those prices are not just compensating investors for the risk of default , but for uncertainty and for a variety of liquidity risks , not least that there will be many more forced sellers of corporate credit as the system seeks to deleverage .
In other words , the price might be okay on a fundamental basis , but could go lower if hedge funds or banks need to unload their very chunky exposures in order to build capital , or as the result of a forced sale .
From that perspective , any move towards full nationalization , or the quasi-nationalization of the “ bad bank ” schemes being considered could help to minimize that risk .
Instruments in a “ bad bank ” wo n’t be dumped all at once and may be managed to maturity , reducing the chance that big ugly investors drive prices lower once you ’ve bought in .
Similarly , the chances that otherwise healthy corporations are driven to the wall by banks without enough capital to lend is diminishing , though still high .
Government is stepping in and you can bet that there will be tremendous pressure to keep viable businesses alive .
Heck , some non-viable businesses will be kept upright as well , which may be lousy for the economy long - term but good for creditors .
And of course , this is what the bank bailouts and central bank interventions are intended to do — to make it attractive enough that some private capital decides to step up and take risks .
Equity risk in the financial services industry , no thanks , but corporate credit risk looks reasonably good .
None of this is to say that it will be a smooth ride ; we are going through a wrenching deleveraging and deep and prolonged economic decline that will doubtless take down many companies .
But , compared with equities especially , it just might be worth a shot .

WASHINGTON  The Federal Reserve entered a new era on Tuesday , lowering its benchmark interest rate virtually to zero and declaring that it would now fight the recession by pumping out vast amounts of money to businesses and consumers through an expanding array of new lending programs .
Going further than expected , the central bank cut its target for the overnight federal funds rate to a range of zero to 0.25 percent and brought the United States to the zero-rate policies that Japan used for years in its own fight against deflation .
Though important as a historic milestone , the move to an interest rate of zero from 1 percent is largely symbolic .
The funds rate , which affects what banks charge for lending their reserves to each other , had already fallen to nearly zero in recent days because banks have been so reluctant to do business .
Of much greater practical importance , the Fed bluntly announced that it would print as much money as necessary to revive the frozen credit markets and fight what is shaping up as the nation ’s worst economic downturn since World War II .
It felt like half a nation was pumping the air and singing along to " Born To Run " as the old rabble - rouser Bruce Springsteen blew through his half - time set at Superbowl XLIII on Sunday night .
For a tech - savvy younger generation , curious as to why someone who looked like their dad had just jumped on to a piano , an obvious response would have been to reach for the computer and head to Wikipedia .
Except that they'd have drawn a blank .
" Bruce Springsteen .
This guy kinda sucks . "
That was it .
A superstar 's entire history and discography had been wiped , an encyclopedia page replaced with a blogger 's venting .
Perhaps it was a Janet Jackson fan who had n't got over the sanitising of the Superbowl show since that famous wardrobe malfunction .

Later visitors to the page were given a little more to go on .
" Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen ( born September 23 , 1949 ) , nicknamed ' The Boss ' , is a FAG , " according to one unhelpful edit .
Hit refresh , and suddenly the entire entry appeared to be in Japanese .
Things righted themselves , of course , and quickly .
Before the final bars of " Glory Days " , one of Wikipedia 's grown - ups had locked anonymous users out of the editing process and The Boss had returned to form .
This has been Wikipedia 's organising principle .
Like the old barb that BBC staff used to use about Sky News , it is " never wrong for long " .
Wikipedia was a half - crazed vision when it was launched in January 2001 .
At a time when internet sages were discussing how much Britannica could get away with charging for a digital version of its dusty tome , here was an attempt to create an even bigger repository for human knowledge , all of it written and edited – from scratch – by absolutely anyone with a bit of time to spare .
Now it is one of the 10 most - visited sites on the web ( there are different measures of this list , but Wikipedia itself has agreed that it is the eighth most - visited ) .
Should you need to settle a bar - room row about the scorer of the equaliser in the 1993 FA Cup final , it is to Wikipedia that you instinctively turn .
Increasingly , when you want to find out the latest facts on a developing news story , Wikipedians are updating the site in real time for you , too .
As long as you have a critical eye , it can not be beaten for the bare - bones facts on any subject you can think of – and several million more you can't .
As a result , it is a godsend for stressed researchers and idle students .
One New York University professor shakes his head and tells
The Independent that he has given up trying to prevent his charges from citing Wikipedia as a source in their essays .
Instead , he now spends some time each week checking the accuracy of its entries on the subjects he teaches .
The site has more than justified its founders ' faith in the wisdom of crowds .
But it has also shown that every crowd has its share of fools and knaves .
Vandalism and error are endemic , and it has often driven users to the conclusion that the only way to increase accuracy is to reduce access .
The tensions are not new , but they are growing .
Events in recent weeks have seemed to bring Wikipedia to another crossroads .
Importantly , the direction it chooses will help shape a long - term financial future for the organisation , which is only now starting to be debated .
That battle over Bruce Springsteen , played out over five minutes on one of Wikipedia 's 12 million articles , was hardly unique .
At any given moment , there are hundreds of these skirmishes going on .
A dip into the methodically kept records of recent edits shows that a kind - hearted Celebrity Big Brother fan had amended Ulrika Jonsson 's entry to congratulate her ( " You rock my odd socks ! " was briefly scrawled on her entry ) ; for a short period recently , Dolly Parton 's breasts were matter - of - factly described as " monster - sized " ; Alistair Darling , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , was , for a minute or two , " nothing but a fat cunt " .
Hardly a week goes by without one of the more creative or subversive additions taking flight , adding greatly to the gaiety of the nation .
Most recently , Alan Titchmarsh – not-very - proud recipient of the Bad Sex Award for embarrassing passages in fiction – was said by his Wikipedia page to be penning a new Kama Sutra .
Robbie Williams was once declared to have made his pre-Take
That living " by eating domestic pets in pubs in and around Stoke " .
For a month and a half , a Wikipedia page was reporting that Margaret Thatcher was fictitious .
For celebrities , you know you 've arrived when you have a Wikipedia page created about you .
But you also know that you only hit the very top when you die in Wikiworld .
Miley Cyrus , Oprah Winfrey , the Apple founder Steve Jobs and the British presenter Vernon Kay have all been declared dead by hoaxers in the past year .
All are still alive , most of them kicking .
Barack Obama 's inauguration day was the day two senior senators , Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd , sparked a flurry of concern about their health when they left the inauguration lunch on Capitol Hill – in Kennedy 's case , in an ambulance after a seizure .
Anyone who reached for Wikipedia for the latest facts found that someone had prematurely filled in 20 January 2009 as the date of their deaths .
Whether the editors were motivated by malice or whether they were taking what journalists might call " a flyer " in the hope of being first with the news , the incidents prompted another round of unforgiving headlines about Wikipedia 's tendency to err .
Jimmy Wales , Wikipedia ’s founder and visionary - in - chief , is following the lead of the embattled TV bosses who agreed , after the revelation of Janet Jackson 's nipple during the 2004 Superbowl , to put a time delay on the broadcast .
From now on , he proposes , editing the biography of a living person will be a two - stage process ; anyone can still make a revision , but it will have to be flagged as " approved " by someone higher up the Wikipedian food - chain before it goes live on the site .
" This sort of nonsense would have been 100 per cent prevented by flagged revisions , " Wales thundered after the Kennedy - Byrd embarrassment , and he ordered a trial of the new restrictions .
But the very suggestion has stoked a monster of a controversy among the faithful , even by the standards of a group of obsessive - compulsives for whom controversy is a permanent state .
Wikipedia is , after all , the encyclopedia written by the people , for the people .
Wikipedians are engaged in a constant fight to rid it not just of vandalism , but of all opinion and contentious material , of anything that cannot be described as fact and supported by a link to a recognised source .
To click " edit " to muck in on an entry , or " history " just to examine the palimpsest on which it has been created , is like lopping off the top of an anthill , revealing the extraordinary industry inside .
It looks anarchic , but it is governed by a vast array of rules and conventions and manipulated by a hierarchy of editors and administrators , elected to their posts on the basis of their work .
They wield significant power to delete revisions and whole articles , and to block users .
Every single change to every single article is recorded and can be debated .
" Edit wars " between contributors who are pushing competing revisions are common .
Many are tedious – the debate about whether JK Rowling is pronounced " rolling " or with an " ow " sound ran for months – but participants console themselves with the knowledge that they are working towards a more perfect union of Wikipedia and the world it describes .
The new plan for flagged revisions only extends a current policy that denies editing rights to anonymous users on the pages of major political figures – a policy introduced during the constant war against vandalism to the pages of Tony Blair and George Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war .
Its detractors argue that a similar clampdown on the German - language version of Wikipedia has meant it can now take three weeks to see an edit appear there .
In Germany , since last summer , all edits to all pages have had to go through flagging .
" This will drive away newcomers , create a backlog of massive approval queues , cause an exodus of editors opposed to oversight by the WikiBureaucracy of their edits , cause umpteen edit conflicts , create a system of prior restraint , and place a chilling effect on the development of Wikipedia and the greater Project , " user Katana0182 wrote in response to Wales .
" This is like assuming bad faith on a massive scale . "
How big is the problem really ?
Reid Priedhorsky , who studies Wikipedia and similar social projects at the University of Minnesota , estimated in a recent paper that the chances of any one visitor seeing a damaged Wikipedia page are about one in 140 , as the average time it takes to repair damage is less than three minutes , and even less for heavily tracked pages .
However , vandalism appears to be on the increase and it is impossible fully to measure the scale of the problem .
" It 's the monster in the closet .
You know that it has not grown bigger than the closet and busted down the door , but you do n't know exactly how big it is in there , " Priedhorsky said .
However , the most startling fact about Wikipedia remains how accurate it is , not how inaccurate .
" As a researcher , I 'm baffled that it works , but Wikipedia is one of the wonderful things that has happened in the 21st century .
Many hands make light work .
There are millions of people who edit Wikipedia , and many of them track changes to the pages they are interested in .
I have 43 pages on my watchlist , for example , covering subjects I know things about .
Any controversial edit is likely to be quickly seen by many people . "
What opponents fear most from the new " flagged revisions " rule is that it could put off a new generation of writers and editors , slamming this extraordinary global phenomenon into reverse .
It 's not something that seems to worry Wales , a bookish , bearded guy who presents a Steve Jobs - style face to the world on behalf of the community he founded .
He describes himself as " pathologically optimistic " .
Wales recalls his wonderment as a child at the World Book that was his first encyclopedia , bought for him from the travelling salesman who showed up at the family home in Huntsville , Alabama , one of the scientific hubs of the US space programme .
Born in 1966 to a private - school teacher and a grocery store manager , young " Jimbo " Wales excelled at maths and made a beeline for a lucrative career in finance where , as an options trader in Chicago , he made enough of a fortune to support himself for the rest of his life .
He headed to Silicon Valley and alighted on the idea of creating an online encyclopedia .
Typically , the facts are contentious , as a glance at the interminable history of the Wikipedia entry on Wikipedia will attest .
Wales shares the credit with Larry Sanger , a website editor who also has an interest in philosophy – but he shares it reluctantly .
The two have been involved in a long - running dispute over exactly who came up with the idea for creating a Wikipedia community .
Wales sniffily highlights how Sanger was in fact only a hired help , employed to work on a professional online encyclopedia called Nupedia , built on the traditional model of editing by experts .
Wikipedia was conceived as a way of quickly building Nupedia content – " wiki " is Hawaiian for quick .
Sanger was firmly planted on the accuracy side of Wikipedia 's accuracy vs access debate , and he has made it a mission to prove to the world that there is a better way .
These days , he is the man behind Citizendium , a new Nupedia that 's edited by a cadre of academics expert in their subjects , which he launched with fanfare and not a few digs at Wales .
But it has failed to take off , and has fewer than 10,000 articles almost two years after launch .
A more credible challenger is Google , whose own effort , Google Knol ( " knol " means " a unit of knowledge " , the company has decided ) , is still most useful at the moment as fodder for Silicon Valley jokes .
The search engine giant professes itself satisfied with Knol 's first six months , however , and it has grown to 100,000 articles in less time than Wikipedia managed .
In an effort to pull itself into contention , Citizendium is trying to muster its users into a " global write - a - thon " tomorrow , while Google Knol is offering a $ 1,000 cash prize for the best new article written before March .
Even with these efforts , it seems difficult to conceive of any of these other projects eclipsing Wikipedia in the popular imagination , unless the market leader goes into some sort of self - induced meltdown , which is why Jimmy Wales remains a pivotal figure .
As a kind of philosopher - in - chief , he continues to dominate the organisation , to steer its debates , to calm its collective neuroses .
The once - ramshackle Wikimedia Foundation , the charity charged with guarding this great public resource , is edging towards a more professional structure under its ferocious executive director , a former Canadian journalist called Sue Gardner , who has been in situ since 2007 .
At the very least , Gardner is trying to impose order on an extraordinary bureaucracy and to put the foundation on a firmer footing so that it does n't require seat - of - the - pants fundraising efforts from Wales , who fronted an appeal to " keep Wikipedia free " in December that brought in $ 6 m ( £ 4.3 m ) .
The aim is to keep Wikipedia free of adverts , even though the costs of its hunger for bandwidth are rising exponentially as the site continues to grow and the records of changes lengthen .
The foundation 's finances are the biggest single threat to Wikipedia , according to Reid Priedhorsky .
" A successful community artefact like Wikipedia requires strong buy - in from the community , which I 'd wager is much harder to achieve under a for - profit model , " he said .
Instead of the nine - person staff crammed into an office in St Petersburg , Florida , which Gardner inherited in 2007 , she now employs 23 people in the heart of Silicon Valley .
They include lawyers , professional fundraisers and advisers keen to exploit Wikipedia 's brand with lucrative new ventures such as real - life book publishing .
The latest development has been to appoint Roger McNamee , a veteran from the tech industry who currently runs the venture capital outfit Elevation Partners along with U2 front - man Bono , to bring more business savvy to the foundation 's advisory board .
And , while the Wikimedia Foundation has no formal role in deciding policies within the Wikipedia community , it is watching closely and with trepidation .
At today 's crossroads , the signposts marked " accuracy " and " access " lead down very different paths .
The near - death experiences of Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd do more than confuse the public and distress their loved ones .
They tarnish the Wikipedia brand .
In monetary terms , " never wrong " is more valuable than " never wrong for long " .

Apparently only the latest victim in a growing trend , Israel 's ambassador to Sweden , Benny Dagan , had a shoe thrown at him , while giving a lecture at the University of Stockholm on Wednesday .
Dagan was discussing Israel 's recent military operation in Gaza – Operation Cast Lead – when a 35 - year - old man and a 25 - year - old woman threw a shoe and a book at him .
Both were apprehended by local police .
Dagan , who was not injured , continued his lecture despite the disturbance .
He told Ynet that such behavior would not stop him .
" This is not something that will deter me or prevent me from reaching out to the community in Sweden .
As advocates of Israel , it is our duty to present Israel 's just struggle .
My public appearances are important for the many friends of Israel in Sweden , " he told Ynet .
" My avoidance ( of public events ) and hiding is exactly the behavior my enemies want , " he added .
The Foreign Ministry said , in a statement , that " the incident is an expression of the atmosphere created by extreme elements and some of the media in Sweden , who are finding fertile soil for their baseless accusations against Israel to take root . "
Opinion 94 : The Human Obsession With " Formal Proofs " is a Waste of the Computer 's Time , and , Even More Regretfully , of Humans ' Time
By Doron Zeilberger
Written : Jan. 4 , 2009
The December 2008 issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society was dedicated to the activity of ( Computerized ) Formal Proof , with fascinating articles by Thomas Hales ( of Kepler fame ) , who gave a great overview of the state of the art , followed by an article by Georges Gonthier who has recently programmed a fully formal proof of the Four Color Theorem , and by computer scientists John Harrison and Freek Wiedijk , describing the " nuts and bolts " behind this endeavor .
Teaching computers how to discover and prove mathematical results is certainly the way to go , and I believe that mathematicians who continue to do pure human , pencil - and - paper , computer - less , research , are wasting their time .
If they learned how to program , in , say , Maple , and used the same mental energy and ingenuity while trying to use the full potential of the computer , they would go much further .
For example , it is very possible that if Andrew Wiles ' programming skills would have been as good as his proving skills , he would have already proved the Riemann Hypothesis .
Of course , there is a huge psychological barrier , and it is very hard to teach old mathematicians new tricks , but we should train the next generation to be able to take full advantage of the computer , and courses like my Experimental Math class should be mandatory to all students .
But the obsession with " Formal Proof " , so nicely described in the Notices issue , is not the optimal use of computers ' ( and humans ' ! ) time .
It is an unfortunate left - over from the Euclidean heritage , that was already a bad model for doing human mathematics , but is even worse for the forthcoming age of computer math , that should revert back to the Babylonian - Indo - Chinese model of algorithmic mathematics .
Ironically , Tom Hales , at the motto to his feature article , cites Francis Bacon 's suggestion , from the latter 's 1620 Novum Organum , that the " entire work of understanding be commenced afresh " .
The activity of " computerized formal proof " is not at all fresh , it is just harnessing the great power of the computer to redo , much more reliably , of course , the same - old - Euclidean - drivel that human mathematicians have beed doing for the last 2300 years .
The " axiomatic method " is not even the most efficient way to prove theorems in Euclidean Geometry .
Thanks to Rene Descartes , every theorem in Euclidean Geometry is equivalent to a routine identity in high - school algebra , see Shalosh B. Ekhad 's Plane Geometry textbook .
Analogous remark apply almost - every - where in mathematics .
Of course we do n't always have a complete decidable algorithm for every problem , but the language of generalized - high - school - algebra is much better than the Euclidean - Hilbertian - Bourbakian one .
Tom Hales is one of my greatest heroes , and his first proof of the Kepler conjecture was a major tour - de - force in demonstrating what computers can do when programmed by ingenious humans .
But he should n't have listened to those humans that raised doubts about the validity of computer - assisted proofs , who claim that " you can 's trust a computer " , and " computer programs always have bugs " .
True , of course , but computers and computer programs , properly empirically tested , are still orders - of - magnitude more reliable than those one - notch - above - apes animals commonly called humans .
There are so many open problems left to do , Tom , so do n't waste your time trying to find a " formal proof " version to Kepler , in order to appease these prejudiced humans .
Besides , I have news for you .
They will never be convinced .
The best way to respond to their criticism is to ignore it .
I concede that " formal proofs " are not completely without interest .
It is a nice game that computational logicians like to play , and it does have its uses in applied software development , in testing program - correctness , in addition to ( not instead ! ) empirical tests .
Also , it is nice that a few theorems , like 4CT , would have a completely formal proof , since Euclideanism is still the dominant religion at the early 21st century .
But enough is enough .
It was funny the first time , and just like the 3000th proof that a certain problem is NP - hard , the law of diminishing returns will hit very soon .
Real mathematics is ( or at least should be ) algorithmic .
The axiomatic method is like machine language or a Turing machine or a Tuxedo .
It is very stifling .
The logicist approach that takes several hundred of pages to prove that 1+1=2 is ridiculous .
Let 's be happy with the current standards of rigor in informal human mathematical discourse , and use computers with that level .
If anything , we have to be flexible , and relax the rigor , allowing semi-rigorous proofs , and even non -rigorous proofs ( as long as we state from the outset the level of rigor ) .
So let 's leave this formal proof game to professional computational logicians , but regular mathematicians , like Tom Hales used to be before he let his human critics push him around , should be pragmatic and try to optimize computers ' great potential .
Absolute certainty is impossible , so let 's settle with the same , or even diminished , level of " rigor " that we are used to in normal mathematical discourse .
Only this way would we have a reasonable chance to see a proof of RH , Goldbach , 3x+1 , P vs. NP , etc. in our lifetime .
