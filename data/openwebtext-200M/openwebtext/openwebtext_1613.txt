When you are reporting that Richard Blumenthal " lied " about his military service , the fact that he told the truth in the exact same fucking speech ... well ... that is news .
When a truth told is directly relevant to the story that your " news " organization is running , then it is news .
So I was taken aback when I asked Rich Sanchez why he did not play the opening part of Blumenthal 's speech and he replied , " Since when is telling the truth news ? "
But this statement is exemplary of everything that is wrong with mainstream news outlets .
They are more focused on the entertaining stories than they are on the important ones .
Telling the truth is not news , because it does not get the same ratings .
A lie is way sexier , and gosh - darnit , we will not have the truth getting in the way .
We deserve better .
We deserve a media that puts truth above everything else .
Full Disclosure : I am a reporter for Sum of Change , and we believe that telling the truth is newsworthy .

ELLENWOOD , Ga. , May 26 ( UPI ) -- A Georgia woman ordered to write " I will not dishonor myself by passing a school bus " 2,500 times has asked for a jury trial rather than accept the sentence .
Nancy Nguyen , 19 , of Ellenwood , was ordered by a Forest Park judge to write the sentence as well as perform community service , pass a defensive driving course and pay a $ 350 fine after the judge found her responsible for passing a stopped school bus in March , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported Wednesday .

Nguyen said she will not copy the sentence 2,500 times because she passed the bus accidentally when two tractor - trailers blocked her view .
" I 'm not going to demean myself and be demeaned by other people , " Nguyen said .
The town solicitor for Forest Park said the writing sentence is common for drivers under the age of 21 who pass by stopped school buses .
Officials said the case has been transferred to state court .

WASHINGTON  President Obama uttered three words on Thursday that many of his 43 predecessors twisted themselves into knots trying with varying degrees of success to avoid : “ I was wrong . ”
He strode into the East Room to mount a robust defense of his handling of the largest oil spill in American history , reassuring the nation that he was in charge and would do “ whatever is necessary ” to stop and clean up the BP leak in the Gulf of Mexico .
But by the time he walked out an hour later , he had balanced that with a fairly unusual presidential self - critique .
He was wrong , he said , to assume that oil companies were prepared for the worst as he tried to expand offshore drilling .
His team did not move with “ sufficient urgency ” to reform regulation of the industry .
In dealing with BP , his administration “ should have pushed them sooner ” to provide images of the leak , and “ it took too long for us ” to measure the size of the spill .
“ In case you ’re wondering who ’s responsible , I take responsibility , ” Mr. Obama said as he concluded the news conference .
“ It is my job to make sure that everything is done to shut this down .
That does n’t mean it ’s going to be easy .
It does n’t mean it ’s going to happen right away or the way I ’d like it to happen .
It does n’t mean that we ’re not going to make mistakes .
But there should n’t be any confusion here .
The federal government is fully engaged , and I ’m fully engaged . ”

You probably associate Ural with sidecar motorcycles .
But the new Ural sT has extended the classic Ural experience to solo riders .
The company says , “ Think of it as a bike that could have been produced by Ural in the 1970s if the engineers were allowed to fulfil their ambition for a performance two - wheeler . ”
The sT keeps the traditional Ural look , and like its sidecar cousins , it ’s at home on a forest road as well as the Interstate .
Interestingly , Ural will build each sT to order , using what it calls ‘ Ural A La Carte ’ : “ The starting point is the base model in flat black .
It comes with straight stainless steel exhaust , standard gas tank , black trim , single ‘ tractor seat ’ and a black rear fender rack .
You can choose to order additional equipment and / or upgrade from standard specification . ”
There are two seat options : a base model single ‘ tractor ’ seat with a rubber shock mount , or a two - up bench seat .
You can also have two single seats , if you mount the second seat on the rear fender .
There ’s a menu that potential owners can download , choose from , and send back to Ural .
It allows you to specify the color , shinier trim , seating configuration , engine protection , fender racks , toolkits and so on .
But unlike most bespoke bikes , the starting price for the sT is eminently reasonable : just $ 6,999 .
That ’s the same as a base model Harley - Davidson Sportster 883 Low — which is arguably packing the same level of technology .

I recently signed up for The Visa SIGNATURE Chase Freedom card , for one reason : it has a concierge service .
[ Tim note :
In fact , all of the “ Visa Signature ” cards have this concierge service , among other benefits ]
A credit card concierge service is much like a hotel concierge service , except you do n’t have to tip .
A concierge is your own personal assistant , someone who will do anything you want them to do : make dinner reservations , book a trip to Hawaii , or shop for negligees for your grandmother .
We ’re so used to being treated badly by credit card companies that it ’s almost impossible to believe that they are serving you .
But that ’s how it works : they ’re your virtual assistants , ready to help you with anything .
Anything ?
I wanted to test the limits of my Visa Chase Freedom concierge service , so I spent a week making incredibly ridiculous requests , to see how they ’d hold up …
TEST #1 : GIANT TUB OF NACHO CHEESE
I made my first call to the Visa Chase Freedom concierge service by calling the toll - free number on the back of my card .
I was connected to a concierge named David , who I pictured wearing a little bellboy hat , like a hotel concierge , though I think they just wear a telephone headset nowadays .
David spoke English , which was a nice change from my usual calls to Visa .
“ I ’m traveling to Austin next week , and I want a big tub of nacho cheese .
Make that a HUGE tub , ” I told him .
“ Enough to fill a punch bowl . ”
“ Does it need to be in a tub ? ” he asked , taking the request with the seriousness of someone who worked for me .
“ Can , jar , tub , I do n’t care , ” I said .
“ I just want liquid cheese , and a lot of it . ”
“ Would you like us to get back to you by phone or email ? ”
“ Phone , please .
I do n’t want there to be any miscommunication about my cheese . ”
“ Is it okay if we have this information to you by 2:00 pm tomorrow ? ” he asked .
“ That would be fine , ” I responded , “ as long as I get my cheese intel . ”
“ You ’ll get it , sir , ” he assured me .
“ Thank you for calling Visa Signature concierge service . ”
Chase Freedom , before it runs away .
Here ’s how the service works : your request is assigned a “ case number , ” which goes into an enormous pool of concierge requests .
These requests get outsourced to overseas workers who track down the information and enter it into their system .
Then you either get e-mailed , or an English - speaking worker phones you back the next day with what they ’ve found .
“ I have your information , ” said a young woman named Jenny who called me the following day .
“ There is a supermarket in downtown Austin named Fiesta that sells large cans of nacho cheese . ”
She gave me the address , phone number , and the price of the cheese .
I went to Austin the following week , where I went to Fiesta , and I actually found the cheese exactly as she had described .
I was floored .
This service was a dream come true .
Just think of the ridiculous errands I could send them on next !
When I heard that the Visa Chase Freedom card came with a concierge service that would do anything I wanted , I had to put them to the test .
Do n’t we all want to make our credit card company work for us for a change ?
TEST #2 : CROSSWORD PUZZLE
“ I ’m really stuck on 62 across , ” I complained to Maurice , the concierge who helped me the following night .
I came to learn that I would get a different concierge every time I called , but they were all quite helpful , with none of the attitude that you normally get from customer service reps .
“ What crossword puzzle are you doing , sir ? ”
“ It ’s the USA Today puzzle , ” I said .
“ The clue is BLUE GROTTO LOCALE .
I have no idea what that means . ”
“ Blue Grotto locale , ” he repeated , writing it down .
“ The only Grotto I know is at the Playboy Mansion , ” I told him .
“ But this is 11 letters , and starts with I . ”
“ Okay , ” he said .
“ You want to hang on ? ”
“ Sure , ” I said .
He put me on hold for about two minutes — the same amount of time it usually takes me to get through to someone at Visa — and came back with the answer .
“ You ready ? ” he said .
“ What , you already got it ? ”
“ The answer is ISLE OF CAPRI , ” he said .
“ 11 letters , starts with I . ”
11 letters , starts with “ I ” .
“ That ’s incredible ! ” I exclaimed .
“ Are you like an idiot savant of puzzles ? ”
“ You just happened to get someone who likes crosswords , ” he said , modestly .
“ I will call you every time I need a clue in the future ! ”
“ Uh … okay ! ” he said , as brightly as he could .
How many times have you been at a restaurant , arguing with your friends about which President was the fattest , or whether Kevin Bacon has ever done a nude scene ?
Now you do n’t need to pull out your smartphone and Google it , you can just call Visa and have them look it up for you .
Having a Visa worker do your bidding : much classier than an iPhone .
TEST #3 : DAILY AFFIRMATIONS
“ I suffer from low self - esteem , ” I told Jamie , my new concierge .
“ My psychologist recommended that I give myself a daily affirmation .
You know , something like , ‘ I ’m good enough , I ’m smart enough , and doggone it , people like me . ' ”
“ Okay , ” said Jamie , not sure where this was heading .
“ But that ’s a lot of work , so I ’m hoping you guys can do it for me .
Just call and give me a daily affirmation . ”
“ You want us to call and tell you you ’re a good person ? ”
“ That ’s right .
I mean , if you think so .
I ’m not so sure myself . ”
“ If you can hold for one moment , I can check on this for you , ” Jamie said .
Keep repeating this , and you can one day be Senator of Minnesota .
I bit my lip to keep from cracking up as she went to check with a supervisor .
She came back with bad news .
“ I ’m afraid we ca n’t do this for you , ” she said , “ but we can look up services that would do this for you . ”
“ What ? ” I asked .
“ Why ?
Am I not good enough ?
Oh , I knew it . ”
“ I ’m sorry , we ’re just not allowed to do anything of a medical or emotional nature . ”
“ You ca n’t tell me I ’m good enough because I ’m not , ” I moaned .
“ Which is exactly what I thought ! ”
“ Sir , ” she said patiently , “ I ’d be happy to look up other services that can send you these affirmations , and e-mail you that information . ”
“ Could you at least attach a little positive note to the e-mail ? ” I begged .
“ Just like , ‘ Thanks for being you ? ' ”
“ Let me check with a supervisor , ” she said , a little less patiently this time .
I pushed hard on the affirmation , and she asked a supervisor three times before I relented .
Apparently Visa Signature could n’t do quite anything , but I have to admit she did eventually come through on her promise , sending me this via e-mail :
Visa Signature Concierge
Dear John Hargrave ,
Thank you for using Visa Signature® Concierge .
The information you
requested is provided below .
Motivational Message Service
Please Note : Please find below one option for a company that
is able to provide phone , texts , and emails reminding you of “ what a good
person you are . ”
Company : MedVoice Inc .
Contact : Renee Dotson
Phone : 800/720-1151
Cost : $ 89.25 per month for unlimited messages .
I decided to let Visa have this round , since they did technically satisfy my request , which was to find someone who could send me love notes .
But now it was time for a real challenge .
I had applied for a Visa Chase Freedom card , just so I could test if their concierge service would fulfill my every desire .
So far they had done an amazing job , but now I was about to cross the final frontier .
TEST #4 : SPACE TRAVEL
“ I ’d like to book a trip to space , ” I said .
There was a pause .
“ You want us to send you to space , ” said Courtney , my new concierge / slave .
“ That ’s right . ”
Cost : $ 200,000 , plus a $ 15 fee for extra bags .
“ Well , I have heard there are companies who can send you to space . ”
“ Money is no object , ” I said , “ but I am on a budget . ”
“ So you want details on pricing ? ”
“ Pricing , the waitlist , when I could travel , everything , ” I said .
“ Also , medical restrictions .
I have a weak spleen . ”
“ I guess you do n’t need restaurant recommendations to go with that trip , ” she cracked .
Humor !
I fell in love with the Visa Signature concierge service at that moment .
“ That ’s a great point ! ” I said .
“ What do they serve on these flights ?
I want to know what I ’m going to get to eat in space . ”
“ Probably that astronaut ice cream , ” she said .
“ YES !
Tang ! ”
“ We ’ll get this for you by 2:00 pm tomorrow , ” she said .
Their time quotes vary , depending on how difficult they think the request will be , and probably how many wage slaves are available to look up your request in the Philippines .
But my requests were generally answered in less than 24 hours .
Possibly the coolest name of any company , ever .
The next afternoon , I got my response via e-mail , outlining not one but TWO space travel companies ( Virgin Galactic and Space Adventures ) , with medical restrictions ( none that they could find ) , and meal options ( peanuts or pretzels ) .
Another test passed .
There was only one more thing to find out : could the Visa Signature concierge service investigate themselves ?
TEST #5 : WRITING THIS ARTICLE
“ I ’m a writer on deadline , ” I told Bruce , my new concierge / manservant , “ and I need to find out a little more about this Visa Signature concierge service .
Are you familiar with this service ? ”
“ I ’ve heard of it , yes , ” he said .
“ Here ’s what I need to know : is there anything you wo n’t do ?
Like , I assume you wo n’t help me find a contract killer , or overthrow a government .
But what else ?
Where do you guys draw the line ? ”
There was a long pause .
“ May I place you on hold while I check on this for you ? ”
“ You betcha . ”
He came back a few minutes later , sounding a little bit shaken .
“ Okay , we can get you a list like that , but we ’ll need about three days to put that together . ”
“ Oooh .
That ’s not going to work .
I need to deliver this article tomorrow . ”
“ That ’s the best we can do , sir . ”
“ That ’s weird , ” I said .
“ You should n’t have to research this one at all .
Ca n’t you just read it from your training manual or something ? ”
“ I ’m sorry , sir . ”
“ But my deadline really is tomorrow .
I ca n’t finish the piece without it .
I ’m going to have to say Visa Signature concierge service could n’t deliver the final thing I asked for . ”
“ We can deliver it , ” he repeated patiently , “ just not until Monday . ”
“ But the readers will never find out the answer , ” I pressed .
“ I apologize to your readers . ”
Bruce was polite to the end .
“ All right , ” I said .
“ They forgive you .
Monday it is , then . ”
All in all , I was incredibly impressed with the Visa Signature concierge service .
It costs nothing beyond the annual card fee , and it ’s helpful for so many occasions .
There ’s almost no limit to the things the concierges can do for you , except for … well , you know .
Help you finish the end of your article .
Some things I guess you just have to do yourself .
( This post originally appeared on Credit Card Chaser )
Afterword from Tim :
In the comments , several concierge service providers were kind enough to provide their thoughts , and one was kind enough to list some of the cannot - do’s .
Here are a few :
1 . We can not get you an interview to work for a sports team .
2 . We do not have special access to confidential government reports .
3 . We do not have discounts for venues , restaurants , or services not included on the website http://www.visa.com/signature.
4 . If a hotel is completely sold out and booked , we cannot reserve a room there ; however we ’d be glad to check other hotels nearby .
5 . We cannot research your school paper , or do your job for you .
6 . We ca n’t run personal errands or call your friends for you .
7 . We ca n’t plan your wedding , but we can help you find a wedding planner .
8 . As far as what ’s considered unethical behavior , consider this an example :
If child prostitution is legal somewhere , we wo n’t help you find one ; however if you ’re in Nevada and want to make an appointment for a rendezvous at the Bunny Ranch , we ’d be glad to help you check rates and availability .
9 . We do n’t have access to your credit card account information or rewards program .
Please keep these not - so - unreasonable limitations in mind when you give us a call .
We ’ll hear from you soon .

Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and NBC President Jeff Zucker testified in front of House and Senate subcommittees Thursday as regulators decide whether to allow the proposed merger of the two media giants .
Comcast is the largest cable TV and residential high - speed Internet company in the nation .
NBC is one of the largest content providers .
The House hearing opened with several politicians waxing poetic about how the merger is great for America .
While nobody in the room cracked a smile , their enthusiasm is laughable .
The only people who could believe that the largest media merger in a generation is good for the public are either : 1 ) on the receiving end of the massive campaign contributions from said media companies ; 2 ) bending to the phalanx of industry lobbyists swarming Capitol Hill ; or 3 ) hoodwinked believers in the “ all regulation is bad ” approach that brought us Enron and the financial meltdown .
Not everyone is swallowing the snake oil Comcast is peddling to grease its takeover of NBC .
None shone brighter yesterday than Sen. Al Franken ( D - Minn. ) , who aggressively interrogated Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and NBC Universal President Jeff Zucker — all but accusing them of lying to his face .
“ You ’ll have to excuse me if I do n’t trust these promises , and that is from experience in this business , ” Franken said .
“ It matters who runs our media companies … . the media are our source of entertainment , but they ’re also the way we get our information about the world .
So when the same company produces the programs and runs the pipes that bring us those programs , we have a reason to be nervous . ”
We sure do .
Here are 10 more reasons to be very afraid of the proposed Comcast / NBC merger :
1 ) Comcast Buys Influence
The communications industry is , after all , second only to Big Pharma in Washington influence - peddling .
Comcast spent more than $ 5.5 million in campaign contributions since 2006 alone to have their way in Washington .
That ’s not counting more than $ 50 million they ’ve spent on lobbying in the past three years !
2) How Much Is Enough ?
Comcast earned more than $ 3.6 billion in profits in 2009 while claiming they did n’t have enough money to invest in faster Internet networks … and while raising rates as much as 50 percent over the past five years in some markets .
3 ) Fat Cat CEO
In 2008 , CEO Brian Roberts was ranked as one of five “ Highest Paid Worst Performers ” in America .
2008 income : $ 40.8 million .
Sitting on Capitol Hill yesterday , he raked in more than $ 100,000 .
4 ) Bad Customer Service
Comcast ranked second only to AOL in poor customer service , according to a 2009 Zogby / MSM Money poll .
Comcast service is so bad they drove a 75 - year - old woman named Mona Shaw to wreck one of their stores with a hammer .
5 ) Comcast Lies and Plays Dirty
In official 2006 testimony , Comcast Vice President David L. Cohen said : “ If Comcast were to try to ‘ deny , delay , or degrade ’ the Internet experience that our more than 9 million cable Internet customers have paid for , how can we possibly expect to keep them as customers . …
Any provider that does not meet the needs of users will suffer from a serious backlash from consumers and policymakers . ”
In 2008 , after being caught illegally blocking content Cohen admitted : “ Comcast may on a limited basis temporarily delay certain P2P traffic . ”
That ’s the same year Comcast was caught paying for seat fillers at a public FCC hearing into their illegal Internet blocking .
Only this year , after being censured by the FCC , did Roberts admit to the company ’s “ mistake . ”
6 ) Comcast Censors Political Speech
Comcast prevents ads from running that criticize the company ’s political friends .
They even fired a newscaster who dared to question an award they were bestowing on Bill O’Reilly .
7 ) Comcast Blocks Independent Voices
Despite digging up our city streets and enjoying a near - monopoly for decades , Comcast has consistently tried to shirk its community responsibilities – including trying to kick public , educational and government channels into the cable - tier equivalent of Siberia .
8 ) Goodbye Free Online Video
If this takeover goes through , Comcast will likely pull free NBC content from sites like Hulu and put them behind a “ paywall . ”
In Thursday ’s congressional testimony , Comcast CEO Brian Roberts claimed he would n’t , but he left wiggle room for his “ TV Everywhere ” scheme that would force you to pay for a cable subscription to watch your favorite Comcast - and NBC - owned shows online .
9 ) Launching a Merger Wave
Think this deal stinks ?
Just wait .
If approved , a Comcast / NBC deal would set off a wave of mega - deals as other companies try to keep up .
If this deal goes through , you can be sure Verizon - Disney or AT&T - Viacom wo n’t be far behind .
10 ) Comcast Can’t Be Trusted
It ’s clear Comcast will say and do anything to sell this deal and try to keep Congress and the federal regulators from getting involved to safeguard the public interest .
The spin cycle is already starting .
So I ’ll give the last word to Senator Franken : “ I worked for NBC for many years , and what I know from my previous career has given me reason to be concerned –let me rephrase that , very concerned –about the potential merger of Comcast and NBC Universal …….. so while I commend NBCU and Comcast for making voluntary commitments as part of this merger , you ’ll have to excuse me if I do n’t just trust their promises . ”

MONTREAL — The Montreal Canadiens found an answer for hot goaltender Michael Leighton and the Philadelphia Flyers — speed and quick puck movement .
The quick - footed Canadiens skated rings around the listless - looking Flyers as they jumped back into the NHL Eastern Conference final with a 5 - 1 victory on Thursday night .
The Flyers still lead the best - of - seven series 2 - 1 going into Game 4 Saturday afternoon at the Bell Centre .
“ Overall , we moved the puck better , we came up the ice together , with support , we entered the zone better , ” said Montreal forward Brian Gionta .
“ With that going , it ’s easier to get to the net and get opportunities . ”
Michael Cammalleri and Tom Pyatt scored in the first period to end Leighton ’s two - game shutout string .
Gionta , Dominic Moore and Marc - Andre Bergeron , with Montreal ’s first power play marker of the series , also scored .
Montreal ’s third line of Moore , Pyatt and Maxim Lapierre shone as the Canadiens served notice they wo n’t fade away meekly after series - opening losses of 6 - 0 and 3 - 0 in Philadelphia .
“ When you ’re down 2 - 0 you have to find a way , ” said Montreal centre Scott Gomez .
“ But we ’ve still got a long way to go .
“ Being down 2 - 0 ’s tough , but you have to look at the big picture .
They won at home , so we want to win at home .
That ’s the way we were taught .
And the next game will be tougher because you can bet ( Flyers coach Peter ) Laviolette will have that team going .
He ’s a good coach . ”
The Canadiens ended the Flyers ’ six - game winning streak and handed Leighton his first loss in five post - season starts .
Simon Gagne broke Jaroslav
Halak ’s shutout bid in the third period with his seventh goal in as many games since returning from a toe injury .
Montreal outshot Philadelphia 38 - 26 .
“ They caught up to us , but we ’ll be better next game , ” said Laviolette .
“ In my experience , it ’s not about momentum , it ’s always about desperation .
Desperate teams are tough teams . ”
Leighton saw his shutout run end when Cammalleri scored his 13th of the playoffs at 7:05 of the first period .
“ It was nice to get one , ” Cammalleri said .
“ We just tried to get the puck past their defence and go to the net and the puck jumped out to me . ”
His shutout streak covered 172:55 , second - longest in Flyers history behind Brian Boucher ’s 184:45 in 2000 .
He had stopped 74 consecutive shots dating back to a Milan Lucic goal in the first period of Game 7 of the last round against Boston .
Halak made sharp saves early and then had little work as the Canadiens used their speed to outhustle the dazed - looking Flyers , who committed numerous turnovers and spent much of the game standing around watching .
“ Turnovers in any sport will kill you , ” Laviolette said .
“ We ’ve got to do a better job of fighting for the puck and keeping the puck . ”
For a third straight game , Montreal held a wide shot advantage in the first period ( 17 - 9 ) , only this time , they scored twice .
P.K. Subban , who had three assists and was plus - 3 , drilled a shot off the end boards that Cammalleri banked in off Leighton for the Canadiens first goal of the series , and Cammalleri ’s 13th of the playoffs .
“ It was a good boost for the club , especially the guys on the bench and the crowd , ” said Subban .
“ When they get going , it ’s a tough building ( for opponents ) to play in . ”
Subban ’s defence partner Roman Hamrlik had a huge game , with two assists , plus - 4 and he absorbed a beating from tough Flyers forward Scott Hartnell in the final minutes of the game .

Montreal went up 2 - 0 when Flyers veteran Chris Pronger lost the puck off the end of his stick , and Moore took it and rang a shot off the post .
Pyatt picked up the rebound and put it into an open side .
The goal stood up to video review to see if it was kicked in .
The Flyers killed off a 52 - second two - man advantage to start the second frame , although Cammalleri rang a shot off the post .
It was a tough night for Pronger and his defence partner Matt Carle , both minus - 3 .
Montreal was even more dominant in the second , and stretched the lead when the Flyers twice failed to clear the puck from their zone and Moore ’s shot from the high slot went in with Lapierre screening Leighton .
Gionta scored two minutes into the third after Hamrlik slipped the puck behind the Flyers ’ defence .
That had the 21,273 in the seats singing their “ Ole Ole ” song , which Flyers fans had sung to taunt them in the first two games of the series .
Gagne , who has scored in four straight games , took a pass from Dan Carcillo in the slot , spun and sent a shot along the ice that went in off a post at 8:22 .
It was his seventh goal in seven games since returning from a toe injury .
The Flyers reverted to form and initiated a skirmish with just under two minutes to play and that , plus a Braydon Coburn minor gave Montreal another two - man advantage .
Bergeron wired in a point blast for Montreal ’s first power play goal in 14 chances in the series .
Moore ’s line combined for two goals on nine shots and did much to help Montreal control the puck and keep it in the Flyers zone .
“ The three of us all have pretty good speed and that can be intimidating at times getting in on the forecheck , ’ said Moore .
“ And defensively , getting back and being in the right spots , we ’re pretty aggressive as well . ”
Cammalleri ’s goal moved him alone into fourth place for goals in one playoff year by a Canadien .
Notes : Defenceman Ryan O’Byrne returned after sitting three games and Benoit Pouliot was back after one .
Mathieu Darche and Sergei Kostitsyn were scratched for Montreal . . .
Flyers centre Jeff Carter missed an 11th game with a broken bone in his foot .
He skated Thursday morning , and may be back later in the series .
. .
It was Montreal ’s first win in six games in which they outshot their opponent in the playoffs .
Even the homeless can't escape the high price of a night in New York City .
City officials this month began charging rent to working families staying in public homeless shelters .
The policy stems from a 1997 state law that has n't been enforced until now .
Under that law , shelter managers started to require families to pay a portion of their income , depending on the shelter and family size , according to The New York Times .
Residents could be expected to pay up to half their earnings .
Some shelter residents say the new rule will ruin their chances of saving enough money to get an apartment .
One single mother living in a Manhattan shelter tells the Times she got a letter saying she had to give up $ 336 of the $ 800 she makes each month as a cashier .
Vanessa Dacosta makes $ 8.40 an hour at Sbarro .
She got a letter under her door at the shelter a few weeks ago saying she'd have to fork up nearly half of what she was bringing in .
For Dacosta , who pays nearly $ 100 a week on child care for her 2 - year - old , paying the shelter is hardly an expense she can afford .
“ It ’s not right , ” Dacosta told the Times .
“ I pay my baby sitter , I buy diapers , and I ’m trying to save money so I can get out of here .
I do n’t want to be in the shelter forever . ”
But the city says it 's got to find a way to cover the costs of state housing aid .
Officials had to pay back $ 2.4 million in 2007 that they said should have been paid by residents of homeless shelters who could afford it .
“ I think it ’s hard to argue that families that can contribute to their shelter cost should n’t , ” Robert Hess , the city ’s commissioner of homeless services , told the Times .
“ I do n’t see this playing out in an adverse way .
Our objective is not for families to remain in shelter .
Our objective is to move families back into their own homes and into the community . ”
It 's not clear why the more than decade - old law has n't been enforced until now , the Times reports .
New York City has a higher rate of working homeless than elsewhere in the state and housing costs are much higher .
About 2,000 of the 9,000 - plus families in city shelters are expected to be covered by the new rule .
More than 500 families were told they needed to start paying rent on May 1 .
Advocates for the homeless have slammed the city 's methods of implementing the policy .
In protest , some residents have outrightly refused to sign documents acknowledging they had received information about the new rental agreement .
Many families do n't understand how they can possibly save enough to move out of the shelter and on with their lives if they 're paying as much as 50 percent of their income to city government .
“ They are taking money from them that could otherwise be used to help themselves get out of the shelter system , ” Arnold Cohen , president and chief executive of the Partnership for the Homeless , told the Times .
“ We ’re dealing with the poorest people , the people who are the most in need , and we ’re asking them to pay for a shelter of last resort .
As a city and a state that has a history of social and economic justice , I think we can do better than that . ”
26.12.3 Hungry Delete Feature in C
If you want to delete an entire block of whitespace at point , you can use hungry deletion .
This deletes all the contiguous whitespace either before point or after point in a single operation .
Whitespace here includes tabs and newlines , but not comments or preprocessor commands .
C-c C- DEL C-c DEL
Delete the entire block of whitespace preceding point ( c- hungry - delete - backwards ) .
C-c C-d C-c C- Delete C-c Delete
Delete the entire block of whitespace after point ( c- hungry - delete - forward ) .
As an alternative to the above commands , you can enable hungry delete mode .
When this feature is enabled ( indicated by ‘ h ’ after a ‘ / ’ in the mode line after the mode name ) , a single DEL deletes all preceding whitespace , not just one space , and a single C-d ( but not plain Delete ) deletes all following whitespace .
M-x c-toggle - hungry - state
Toggle the hungry - delete feature ( c- toggle - hungry - state ) .
With a prefix argument , this command turns the hungry - delete feature on if the argument is positive , and off if it is negative .
The flashlight is Wake 's best friend .
Darkness can take many forms .
It will take you most of the game to find out what the heck is going on in Bright Falls .
Lots of little touches round out the unusual atmosphere .
Artful storytelling and imposing darkness collide with dramatic force in the Xbox 360 - exclusive action game Alan Wake Remedy 's first original effort since Max Payne trades heavily in densely creepy forests , small - town mystique , and no small amount of third - person shooting .
The game weaves a powerful narrative web around a core third - person action model that 's largely satisfying even when its lack of variety becomes apparent in the later stages of the game .
Even a thousand plaid - wearing axemen are n't enough to slow the driving momentum of these uncanny events , or make the game 's foreboding forests one iota less unsettling .
The eponymous lead character certainly is n't your typical video game hero .
Wake is a wildly popular Stephen King - esque horror writer whose three - year bout with writer 's block has lead him and his wife Alice in search of creative inspiration , taking them from a posh Manhattan condo to the sleepy Pacific Northwestern logging town of Bright Falls .
The couple has scarcely arrived in town and checked into their cabin before
Wake finds himself abruptly short one wife and one whole week 's worth of events in his memory .
In exchange he finds plenty of terror , courtesy of a pervasive dark being that 's moved into town and targeted him for reasons that become clearer as the game wears on .
Wake 's journey to uncover the fate of his wife , the secrets of Bright Falls , and his own importance to the dark presence provides the game 's narrative impetus , and Remedy uses an internal episodic format to expertly delegate the flow of the mystery from one scene to the next .
The natural breakpoint at the ending of each episode gives the writers ample opportunity to mete out pieces of the story slowly and control the falling and rising action , building to a crescendo right before the " credits " roll , just like a serialized television drama .
Each episode ended with a " holy crap " sort of cliffhanger that made me eager to plunge ahead and make sense of newly revealed information .
But a couple of times I found greater value in making myself turn the game off and stewing over what had just happened for a bit before returning to continue .
This is n't the " episodic " sort of gaming you 're used to , but it 's a great way to tell a story in a video game .
He might sit behind a word processor during the day , but Wake sure knows how to handle a revolver .
And a shotgun , a hunting rifle , a flare gun , and flashbang grenades .
Those are your tools against the demonic residents of Bright Falls who are " taken " by the dark thing infesting their town and turned against Alan Wake and his efforts to find Alice and get the hell out of Dodge .
The game has that unusual combination of loose , free character movement and fast but precise aiming control that to me defines the best third - person shooters .
No twiddling of sensitivity settings required .
Other than a few wonky jumps from time to time , Remedy 's pedigree as a maker of action games is plainly evident here .
Under and around the shooting , Alan Wake 's gameplay revolves around the contrast between the darkness of its antagonists and the light from literally any source you can get your hands on .
Flashlights , road flares , spotlights , headlights -- anything that provides illumination is a potential weapon to stave off the encroaching shadows .
The enemies are swathed in a tangible darkness that shields them from your attacks until you literally burn it off of them with a light source , and aside from your handy flashlight , the game finds some neat opportunities to arm you with heftier firepower ( lightpower ? ) as found in the environment .
Conversely , some of the best tension comes from the moments when ammo is scarce or nonexistent and you 're left to dash from one light to another in an attempt to escape the gloom .
There 's a lot of gloom .
Bright Falls and its dense forests form a supporting character all by themselves .
Remedy does the forest primevalwell ; the outdoor areas are packed with stifling foliage and dense fog , the tension rises along with fast - moving shadows , and ambient sounds heighten dread and obscure the movements of your enemies .
These guys understand the simple value of silhouetting a crazed maniac with an axe against a misty , backlit tree line , though they find ways to arrange plenty of more complex but equally creepy scenarios .
Alan
Wake is a disturbingly great - looking game from top to bottom .
The game is also relentlessly linear , though , a price I feel like you have to pay for that kind of tightly packed design .
You can rarely stray far from the critical path , and there is n't much to do on either side other than find a huge host of collectibles .
There are scores of coffee thermoses hidden around for the achievement - seeking completists , but there are also just as many mysterious manuscript pages strewn around thattie into the story .
Each one foreshadows events to come or clarifies those that have already passed , and these are well worth seeking out as an enhancement to the game experience itself .
Similarly , the game gets a tasteful amount of mileage from the authorial nature of its protagonist , with frequent descriptive voiceover narration that 's just ham - handed enough to sound like it 's ripped right from the pages of one of Wake 's own bestsellers .
You 'll find some references to King , Alfred Hitchcock , and other masters of the macabre in here as well .
And of course , Remedy also gets in one of its signature touches with a series of operable television shows that display full mini-episodes of a fantastic fakeprogram , and there 's a pitch - perfect small - town AM radio host who you 'll hear provide color to the events and the area as you move through the story .
Alan
Wake is n't an overly long game at maybe a dozen hours , but in the last quarter or so I found a sort of fatigue set in with what I was doing .
It might be the very limited variety of enemies you face ; there are only four or five types repeated almost ad nauseam throughout the game .
Or maybe it speaks to the storyline 's high level of intrigue that I just wanted to get on with the combat so I could uncover the next wild piece of the mystery .
Earlier in the game , the nighttime action is broken up by expository daytime sequences that almost feel like an adventure game , but the pacing suffers a lack of brevity in its last couple of hours .
A more condensed final act would have wrapped this package up a little tighter .
That 's small potatoes in the grand scheme , though .
Alan
Wake is on the whole a propulsive , thrilling , and downright spooky action game from start to finish , quite unlike anything else on the market in visual style and storytelling format .
It might take Remedy forever and a day to get from one game to the next , but Alan Wake proves once again their toil is well worth the wait .
Among conservationists , policy - makers , and the public , there is great debate about whether the establishment of national parks and reserves in developing nations causes poverty or helps to alleviate it .
While opponents claim that protected areas limit agricultural development and the harvesting of natural resources , supporters contend that protected areas generate tourism income and improve infrastructure in the surrounding areas .
A new study in PNAS this week suggests that , in the long term , establishing protected areas in developing nations does reduce poverty in local communities .
The authors criticize earlier studies that have found correlations between poverty and protected areas for omitting confounding variables that may account for the apparent link .
Since many biodiversity hotspots are located in poverty - stricken areas , the local communities are usually poor at the inception of the national park or reserve .
Furthermore , these areas are often located in relatively remote geographical regions where economic progress is slow .
To control for these variables , the PNAS study used a matching method to compare areas with similar economic and geographical characteristics to determine how communities would be faring today if nearby protected areas had not been established .
In order to assess long - term impacts , the study focused on parks and reserves created 15 or more years ago , in both Costa Rica and Thailand .
Communities were considered “ treated ” if greater than 10 percent of their land area was protected ; controls had less than 1 percent protected area .
Treated communities were matched with control communities based on preprotection poverty , forest cover , land productivity , and access to transportation .
They were then compared in terms of their current poverty index or poverty headcount ( the percent of the population which falls below the poverty line ) to determine the economic impact of the protected area .
When these confounding variables were controlled for , the results showed that the communities surrounding protected areas actually enjoyed reduced poverty compared to the control communities .
In Costa Rica , the protected areas were responsible for about 10 percent of the observed poverty reduction , and the effect was even greater in Thailand , where about 30 percent of the poverty reduction was attributable to nearby parks and reserves .
These results were quite robust , holding true even when the threshold for the protected land in treated communities was increased fivefold to 50 percent of the area .
Furthermore , the authors were able to rule out other explanations for the findings , such as the claim that protected areas force poor people to leave the region , and the possibility that protection has negative impacts on nearby control communities .
The authors do recognize a few limitations of the work .
First , the goal of the research was to assess long - term effects , so the short - term implications of protected areas are not addressed in the study .
Additionally , the authors do not speculate about the mechanisms involved in reducing poverty .
Finally , since this is a large study that tracked generalized trends across many communities , the results will not necessarily hold true in every area .
This last caveat is especially important , since both Costa Rica and Thailand have several characteristics in common that other countries with biodiversity hotspots may not .
Despite the caveats , this study is a definite improvement upon the earlier research that failed to control for confounding factors .
Since other studies in Thailand and Costa Rica have found that the establishment of protected areas reduces deforestation , perhaps the most uplifting implication of this study is that conservation can contribute simultaneously to sustainability and poverty reduction in developing nations .

Voters are getting dumber and dumber they guess ( must be something in the tea ) , so why not use a game to educate them .
The Obama Administration has been in talks with Microsoft ’s Steve Ballmer about making a video game that would have players try and balance the US ’s budget .
They think such a game can go viral , so off the top you know its going to be a Flash Silverlight game .
Whatever it is it sounds completely boring , but I ’m willing to play ball and share it with you guys to play if it ever was to come out .
Maybe my balancing skills will land me a position in the White House .

In a previous post , part of a series about selecting the right blog platform , I urged you to think if you want to selfhost your blog or not .
I revisited the subject , stressing the fact that when you choose for selfhosting , you should be aware of the many things bloghosting platforms like Blogger would do for you , you ’d have to do yourself .
And that includes a lot of technical stuff .
Are you prepared to dive into the technical part of the maintenance of your blog , potentially diverting your attention from writing good contents ?
I want to drive the point even further : when you choose to selfhost your blog on a hosting provider , like Godaddy or Network Solutions , there is one more thing to be extra cautions about : hackers .
OK , running any kind of blog , you have to ensure basic password security for your administrator ’s account , and not use obvious passwords like “ admin ” or “ password ” or “ secret ” ( do n’t laugh ! ) , but also the hosting company itself can be vulnerable to attacks , without any of your wrongdoing .
And recently , hackers have concentrated their attacks on these companies .
I guess their reasoning is “ why to concentrate on a single blogsite , if we can attack thousands of sites at once when we attack a single hosting site ” …
Recently Godaddy has been a victim of two series of attacks , one on April 27 and a second one on May 1 .
I was a victim of both attacks for one of my sites .
Even though my particular site was running Drupal , and no conventional blogsoftware , most of the affected sites were WordPress blogs .
Following several forums on the subject , it seems like thousands of blogs were infected .
While this is not a post about hacking techniques , and what to do to cure hacking attacks , let me describe to you what I went through in discovering and curing the hack so it helps you make up your mind if you really want to go to selfhosting your blog …
When I wake up in the morning , love
On the beautiful morning of April 28th , I woke up and checked some of my sites .
One of them is a simple Blogger blog showing the latest posts for Humanitarian News , my mega aggregator of nonprofit news .
I noticed the posts were not refreshed , and showed an error in retrieving the RSS feed from the mother site .
I use a simple RSS to Java tool , described in this post to generate the posts , so trying to debug the problem using Feedvalidator , I found out the feed from Humanitarian News was seen as invalid .
I did not think much of it at that moment , although now I know it was a symptom of a hack .
A few days later , Humanitarian News no longer loaded on my Iphone browser , so I checked it on my laptop , only to find that my site was redirected to a malware site .
Darned .
Panic
My instinct told me to check the index .
php file , the root of my site .
I found one line of code was inserted in the file , which looked like
? php /**/ eval ( base64_decode ( " goobledegoob " ) )
Thus , panic in the house !
Using Filezilla , I checked more . php files , and more , and more .
All the same : each had the php one - liner inserted .
Darned once more .
I googled the code , and found that the one liner was the actual hack .
When browsing the website , users were redirected to the malware site .
I knew that I had to act fast , otherwise browsers would soon show this infamous screen , the nightmare for any webmaster :
… and in no time Google would report my site as harmful .
So I had to act quickly .
It was then 10 pm …
At first , I started to clean up all . php files manually , deleting the intrusive one liner , but soon gave up .
Suspecting a vulnerability in Drupal , my CMS , I decided to put the site offline , and reinstall the software from scratch , including all themes and plugins .
Luckily , I keep a good track of each of these , for all my sites .
It took me about four hours before I had my site back up .
2 am .
Sigh , but with a clean site .
Before going to bed , I decided to back up my entire website onto my laptop .
A good decision , it seemed afterwards .
I also changed the admin passwords , blocked all other user passwords , and changed the FTP password .
Argh , not again ?!
On May 1 , I saw the same problem popping up with the RSS feed .
I checked the index . php file , and exactly the same problem : I was hacked , once more .
Again , I put the site offline , and this time , restored the entire site from my backup .
Three hours of work .
This time , I googled a bit deeper , and found that indeed , I was not alone .
Thousands of sites had been attacked , all hosted on Godaddy , my hosting company !
Following some of the forum discussions , it looks like even today , Godaddy blames vulnerabilities of WordPress , although it was soon clear many other sites using different CMS - es were attacked .
Mine was only one example , I was using Drupal .
Beh .
Selfhosting or not , revisited
While the experts are still trying to analyse how the security on so many sites was compromised , it looks like it is a common and pretty recent problem with hosting companies becoming an easy ( it seems ) target for hackers .
While we have not seen the end of it yet , it does stress the importance of the question :
Do I really want to selfhost my blog ?
That question is not just related to money , to self - reliance – call it independence – but much more “ Do I really have the technical savvy , and the time , to technically manage my site ? ” .
Or in other plain words :
Do I want to blog , or do I want to become a webmaster ?
Update : 2010 will probably go down in history as the “ black year for PHP hosted sites on shared servers ” .
The 5th wave of hacking is going on as we speak , and the hosting companies are still to work out a way to avoid the hackers to get in .
Meanwhile , it is important you check your site for infections several times .
If you find the infection , cure it immediately .
If not , malware will spread to your visitors .

Jennifer Nelkin believes that the future of high - end , boutique - quality farming is not in California , sunny Florida , or even the fertile soils of the Hudson Valley .
It 's right under our noses .
Or more accurately , right above our noses .
As co-founder of Gotham Greens , New York 's first commercial rooftop hydroponics operation , Jenn 's got a lot riding on that future .
" I really hope that rooftop gardening is a successful venture , because we 've borrowed $ 1.4 million to try and find out . "
Located on the roof of a manufacturing plant in Greenpoint Brooklyn , and equipped with solar - powered pumps that feed nutrient - enriched rainwater to an acre of greenhouse space , Jenn 's goal is to produce greens and herbs to sell to local chefs , retailers ( Whole Foods has expressed interest ) , and direct to the public by as early as this fall .
So how does one get involved with a project like this ?
I first met Jenn a few months ago at a dinner party that my friend Joshua Levin of GoodEater.org and I threw for few local food superstars ( including our very own Erin ) , where she regaled us with stories about greenhouses on Mars .
Wait ... what ?
Greenhouses on Mars , did you say ?
That 's right .
After completing her MS in Plant Sciences from the University of Arizona , she was approached to work on martian greenhouse program for NASA .
" It was a natural fit , " she said .
" Working in Arizona , you 've got a very specific set of conditions .
It 's a fantastic environment for growing food because of the light . "
Crop yields are remarkably closely linked to available light — a 1 % increase in light will reliably lead to a 1 % increase in crop output .
The problem is water .
" To farm in Arizona , we were forced to use the most water - efficient means possible . "
The efficiency of closed - system hydroponics , in which plants are grown directly in nutrient - enriched water that is carefully cleaned and recycled back into the system makes it an ideal candidate for martian farming .
" It saves you from requiring a fresh water source .
Transporting heavy water into space is expensive . "
Turns out that despite its innate awesomeness , martian greenhouses are still a ways off ( the plans have since been revised to apply to lunar situations ) .
But the lessons learned from designing them were invaluable to Nelkin .
" Suddenly , I had built this niche for myself of designing extreme greenhouses . "
Her next project was actually completed : a greenhouse at the South Pole with year - round production .
" Hydroponics turned out to be the perfect solution again for the South Pole .
There 's an international treaty that prevents any country from transporting their own soil to the pole .
Hydroponics does n't need any soil . "
" Antarctica is basically closed for six months out of the year .
That means that whoever 's down there , stays down there . "
There are no ships , no airplanes , no supply drops , nothing . "
People rely on canned , frozen and dry food , and it 's dark all the time . "
In situations like that , greenhouses have as many psychological benefits as they do nutritional .
" The researchers can go into a brightly lit , humid environment , with plant - based smells .
You have no idea how important that humidity , light , and scent is until you are deprived of it . "
Turns out that every one of the benefits of lunar and Antarctic hyrdroponics make perfect sense in an urban setting , where access to natural resources is limited , and well lit , green spaces are in short supply .
In addition to using approximately 90 % less water than traditional soil - based farming , greenhouse - based hydroponics also offer consistent , year - round yields , making planning such an unprecedented business a little more reassuring .
" With soil farming , your crop yields have to do not only with light , but with soil quality and pests .
Hydroponics cuts those variables out . "
But the real question : aside from appealing to the bearded , DIY , Brooklyn hipsters or yuppie environmentalists high on good intentions but low in actual information , is there really a reason to build greenhouses in the city ?
Flavor
According to Jenn , some of the answers are obvious .
" As far as flavor is concerned , there 's no question that vegetables grown right in your backyard are vastly superior to ones that have even been shipped as far as the farmers ' market . "
Most supermarket vegetables are picked under -ripe to help them withstand the rigors of shipping .
And " even if the vegetables are picked completely fresh , they begin to lose quality as soon as they are removed from the vine . "
" Hydroponics has gotten a bad wrap , mostly from those awful hyrdoponic tomatoes you see in the supermarket . "
With a commodity crop being sold wholesale to large supermarket chains , appearance and yield are the chief considerations for growers .
" Those tomatoes are given more water than they need to grow in order to bulk up their weight and increase profits .
That 's why they taste so bad . "
" Every farmer knows that stress - related events often lead to the best tasting fruit .
I can artificially starve my tomatoes of water .
The tomatoes respond by producing more sugar through photosynthesis . "
Flavor and nutrition , she explains , relies on two factors : was it picked ripe and eaten fresh , and did the tomato have the nutrients it needed while growing ?
" A tomato grown in nutrient - deprived soil will definitely taste worse than a tomato grown in good soil , or in a well - designed hydroponic system .
My yields are smaller than Canadian commodity hydroponicsa , but they 're as good as the best tasting tomatoes you 've ever had . "
By selling directly to niche markets , Gotham Greens will be able to charge higher prices for customers who are more concerned with flavor than size , rather than being tied to the whims of the commodity market .
Social and Environmental Impact
" A lot of people think that urban farming is the answer to some problems with the environment , " says Jenn .
But it 's just a knee - jerk reaction .
" In reality , pretty much no data exists on how efficient , or how good for the environment urban farming really is . "
Part of the goal of Gotham Greens is to have as minimal an environmental impact as possible .
The facilities will run largely on rain water and solar energy .
It seems impossible that it wo n't be more efficient than a large - scale operation which relies on massive water , energy , and fertilizer use , right ?
" It 's not that simple .
There 's trucking , shipping , different kinds of production method .
We 're still at the stage that we need to collect more data to see if it's an environmentally responsible means . "
" We get calls non -stop from everyone who wants to build an urban farm .
I 'd love to be able to tell them with confidence — to automatically say , ' This is right .
This is the answer , ' but until we have the numbers , nobody really knows . "
That 's not to say that there are n't other less - edible benefits .
" Most people need green spaces to be happy . "
Whether it's in the form of community - based gardens , cities , educational gardens ( before launching Gotham Greens , Jenn worked on the Science Barge project , an educational floating greenhouse on the Hudson River ) , or commercial projects like Gotham Greens , cities will always need their green space .
" And that 's a really fantastic thing . "
Jenn , if you ever need a 400 - square - foot plot with year - round shaded growing space next to a construction site and an elevated subway , my deck is all yours .

How to Think Like a Pioneer
Here 's an experiment to try at home : do a Google image search for " integrated development environment . "
Take some time to go through the first several pages of pictures .
Even if you had no idea what an IDE was , the patterns are obvious .
There 's a big area with text in it , and on the left side of the screen is a pane that looks a lot like Windows Explorer : a collection of folders and files in a tree view , each with icons .
Some folders are closed and have little plus signs next to them .
Others are expanded and you can see the files contained within them .
To be perfectly fair , this project area is sometimes on the right side of the window instead of the left .
Variety is the spice of life and all that .
Why have IDEs settled into this pattern of having a project view take up twenty percent or more of the entire left or right side of the window ?
The answer is shallower than you may expect .
Someone who decides to create an IDE uses the existing programs he or she is familiar with as models .
In other words , " because that 's how it 's supposed to be . "
There 's no solid reason the project view pane has to be the way it usually is .
In fact , there are some good arguments against doing it that way .
First , you are typically either looking at the project view or you 're editing a file , not doing both at the same time .
Yet the project view is always there , taking up screen real estate , sometimes a lot of screen real estate if highly nested folders are expanded .
That view is made even wider by having icons to the left of each filename , even though most projects consist of one or two file types and they could be differentiated with color or an outline instead of a contrived icon attempting to evoke " file of Java code . "
Second , a long , thin pane containing files and folders does n't give a particularly deep or even interesting view of a large project .
Open a folder and it might fill the whole pane , and all the other folders are now offscreen .
Are there better options ?
Sure !
The first problem , of losing screen space to a persistent view of the project hierarchy , can be alleviated by a hot key that brings up a full - screen overlay .
When you want to see the project as a whole , hit a key .
Press escape to make it go away ( or double - click a file to edit it ) .
The data presented in this overlay does n't need to be a tree view .
A simple option is to group related files into colored boxes , much like folders , except you can see the contents the whole time .
With the narrow , vertical format out of the way , there can be multiple columns of boxes filling the space .
Now you can see 100 + files at a time instead of a dozen .
It might make more sense to display modules as shapes , each connected by lines to the modules which are imported .
Or provide multiple visualizations of the project , each for a different purpose .
Someone , sometime , and probably not all that long ago , came up with the canonical " project view on the left side of the window " design for IDEs .
And you may wonder how that person arrived at that solution .
After all , there were no prior IDEs to use for guidance .
I think the answer is a basic one : because it 's a solution that worked and was better than what came before .
No magic .
No in - depth comparison of a dozen possibilities .
Clearly a way to see all the files in a project is better than a raw window in a text editor where there 's no concept of " project " whatsoever .
That solution was n't the best solution that could ever exist in the entire future history of IDEs , but it sure fooled people into thinking it was .
If you want to think like a pioneer , focus on the problem you 're trying to solve .
The actual problem .
Do n't jump directly to what everyone else is doing and then rephrase your problem in terms of that solution .
In the IDE case , the problem is " How can I present a visual overview of a project , " not " How can I write a tree viewer like in all the other IDEs I 've ever seen ? "

THOUSAND OAKS , Calif .
When Floyd Landis last week accused several top riders of doping , one thing was missing from the fallout : a flat - out , en masse denial of Landis ’s allegations .
Some riders he accused , including the top Americans George Hincapie , Levi Leipheimer and David Zabriskie , declined to address the issue or were vague in their responses .
In a heart - tugging speech after the Tour of California ended here Sunday , Hincapie said that he had sacrificed himself for the sport and that he did not deserve to be accused of impropriety .
A day earlier , Zabriskie had said he was disappointed to hear Landis ’s claims .
Leipheimer said , “ I really believe that cycling is much cleaner than the past . ”
But the question remains : did those riders Landis has named — including the seven - time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong — use performance - enhancing drugs back in the early to mid-2000s , when Landis said the doping occurred ?
And , if so , should it matter — especially if they might be clean now ?
Have you ever walked by the butcher case at your local grocery store and noticed how perfectly uniform the hamburgers they sell are ?
I have .
A few months ago my sister and I were walking through Whole Foods and there was a man forming the perfect hamburger patties in this thingamajig in the meat department .
As I watched him for a few seconds I found a sudden urge to know exactly what that thing was he was .
Because what home cook would n’t want their patties to look as good as Whole Foods ?
So I said , “ I would love to know how to make perfect burger patties . ”
He seemed surprised I would even be interested .
Before telling me what tool he was using to form patties , he joked that if I wanted one it would cost me $ 20 .
Say what ?!
Then he looked at me , smiled and chuckled .
“ Oh this ?
This is a lid . ”
A lid ?
“ A lid , you know .. from a jar . ”
Oh ..oh thanks .
I looked at him feeling pretty stupid and decided I wasted enough of his time and moved on to another part of the store .
My sister laughed at me but also agreed we just stumbled into a great kitchen / cooking / grilling tip .
Here ’s my conclusion – if I did n’t know you could make uniform hamburger patties with a stinkin’ lid , chances are you did n’t know either .
So here ’s your chance to make your burgers look perfect like the ones you get in restaurants .
It ’s so simple yet so brilliant .
Say goodbye to jagged edges .
In the words of my two daughters , “ Reduce , Re- Use , Recycle , Re-think . ”
This technique would work great with forming veggie patties and crab cakes too .
Although you could easily buy a hamburger press , I for one will gladly use a lid - I only have a drawer full of them .
What ’s also great about using lids is you can find the lid that best suits the size of your hamburger buns .
For instance , if you wanted to make mini-sliders , use a small tupperware or canning lid .
Pretty simple , huh ?
So start saving those lids .
You never know when you ’ll need the perfect hamburger patty .
Enjoy !
Season ground beef with your favorite spices .
Salt and pepper work great but I also like Weber ’s Gourmet Burger Seasoning .
Find a lid that is slightly bigger than the size of your hamburger bun .
Cover the lid in plastic wrap .
This will make it easier to remove the patty after each use .
Place a good amount of ground beef inside the lid .
Press meat down into the lid .
Remove any excess meat or add more if necessary .
Flip patty out and continue to make as many burgers as needed .
For best cooking results , refrigerate patties for at least 1 hour before frying or grilling .
Enjoy !

Advertisement Iran has signed an agreement to send uranium abroad for enrichment after mediation talks in Tehran with Turkish and Brazilian leaders .
Correspondents say the plan could revive a UN - backed proposal and may ward off another round of sanctions .
But the BBC's Tehran correspondent says the deal will be viewed with scepticism in Western capitals , as Iran says it will continue enriching uranium .
Meanwhile , France has announced progress at the UN on fresh sanctions .
AFP news agency reported that Israeli officials were accusing Iran of manipulating Brazil and Turkey to stave off sanctions .
The West has long suspected that Iran 's nuclear programme is aimed at making weapons - a charge Tehran denies .
Progress made ?
Under the deal , Iran 's foreign ministry said it was ready to ship 1,200kg ( 2,645lb ) of low - enriched uranium to Turkey , in return for fuel for a research reactor .
The deal does not address the central nuclear issues dealt with by successive UN Security Council resolutions - namely Iran 's refusal to halt its enrichment programme and address questions about its past nuclear activities .
The US reacted by saying it still had serious concerns over Iran 's nuclear programme , although it did not reject the agreement .
KEY POINTS OF THE DEAL Iran will notify the IAEA of the details of the agreement within a week If approved by the Vienna Group , Iran will ship 1,200kg of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) to Turkey The LEU will remain the property of Iran while in Turkey Tehran and the IAEA may send observers to monitor its security The Vienna group must then deliver 120kg of nuclear fuel to Iran within a year Iran may request that Turkey return its LEU " swiftly and unconditionally to Iran
Full text of the joint declaration Send us your comments
It said the Iranian government " must demonstrate through deeds - and not simply words - its willingness to live up to international obligations or face consequences , including sanctions " .
" While it would be a positive step for Iran to transfer low - enriched uranium off of its soil as it agreed to do last October , Iran said today that it would continue its 20 % enrichment , which is a direct violation of UN Security Council resolutions , " said a White House statement .
Russia welcomed the deal , although President Dmitry Medvedev said further talks were needed on Iran 's nuclear programme .
During a trip to Ukraine Mr Medvedev said the fact that Iran apparently still intended to continue its own uranium enrichment would continue to concern the international community .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said there had been " some important progress " in talks at the Security Council on fresh sanctions against Tehran .
The UK , for its part , said work on a resolution about imposing new sanctions on Iran would continue until Tehran showed its intentions were peaceful .
The German government said that nothing could replace a deal between Iran and the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the IAEA .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called on world leaders for new talks " with Iran based on honesty , justice and mutual respect " .
The EU's high representative for foreign affairs , Baroness Ashton , was ready to meet the Iranian authorities to find a " full and complete " solution to the stand - off , her spokesman said .
' Negotiating ploy ? '
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva were at the talks in Tehran with Mr Ahmadinejad .
ANALYSIS Paul Reynolds , world affairs correspondent , BBC News website
Whether this is a breakthrough or a device to try to stop further sanctions remains to be determined .
On the plus side , it appears that Iran is still interested in swapping some of its low - enriched uranium for fuel rods for its medical research reactor in Tehran , which is in need of replenishment .
Sending low - enriched uranium to Turkey would be a good first step but it does not solve the problem , because Turkey cannot produce fuel rods .
There therefore needs to be a further agreement with the countries that made an earlier offer to supply them - the US , Russia and France .
And these countries are likely to be very cautious as they fear that Iran will impose conditions that , for them , make a deal impossible .
Q&A : Iran and nuclear issue Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said 1,200kg of low - enriched uranium would be shipped to Turkey , and that Iran would notify the IAEA " within a week " .
Under the deal , Iran has said it is prepared to move its uranium within a month of its approval by the so - called Vienna Group ( US , Russia , France and the IAEA ) .
In return , Iran says it expects to receive 120kg of more highly enriched uranium ( 20 % ) - a purity well below that used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons - within a year .
If the deadline is not met , Iran says Turkey " will return swiftly and unconditionally Iran 's low - enriched uranium " .
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne , in London , says the agreement does not make clear whether Iran 's low - grade uranium will be used to make the new fuel or just held as a kind of security deposit .
Our correspondent says Western governments will fear this is just a negotiating ploy designed to delay new sanctions .
Crucially , Turkey and Brazil are both on the UN Security Council , and so have a vote on those sanctions .
The Turkish Foreign Minister , Ahmet Davutoglu , who spent 18 hours hammering out the deal with his Brazilian and Iranian counterparts , said there was now no need for more sanctions against Iran .
" The swap deal shows that Tehran wants to open a constructive path ... there is no more ground for new sanctions and pressures , " he said .
' Last chance '
The US is in the final stages of negotiating a fourth sanctions package with other UN Security Council members .
The deal was hammered out over 18 hours of talks
This new deal will be examined in great detail and with a high degree of scepticism in foreign capitals , our correspondent says .
Iran backed out of a similar proposal last October citing disagreement about the details of the deal , which included a simultaneous swap , something the IAEA said was not feasible .
Iran 's stocks are now thought to be much larger than the 1,200kg covered by the new agreement .
Both Russia and the US say the talks represent Iran 's last chance to avoid harsher sanctions .
Iran has been mounting a big diplomatic effort to prevent new UN sanctions ; its foreign minister has visited all 15 members of the Security Council .

Glamour editor Cindi Leive took to her blog yesterday to defend against , as she sees it , outlandish claims from the blogosphere that her magazine has n't been doing enough to show actual plus - sized women .
Advertisement
Leive specifically references a post by Jennifer Merritt that iVillage appears to have taken down , but which persists for now in Google 's cache , and yes — Merritt 's post is kind of annoying .
Merritt 's point seems to be that because few or none of the women the media have nominated as standard - bearers for the Supposed Curvy Revolution approach the average American woman in size , that the effort is ultimately false ; that 's a fine point to argue , but the way in which Merritt criticizes women like Christina Hendricks , Beyoncé , and Crystal Renn , quoting their measurements and comparing them unfavorably with what she calls " real women " unwittingly echoes a lot of the body - negativity that the fashion industry itself pushes .
But for Leive to seize upon this one particularly ham - fisted criticism — it 's the only one she quotes and links — as though it were emblematic of " the blogosphere " smacks of a straw man .
But Leive 's post , too , misses the mark .
While her dislike of the term " plus - size " is reasonable — and considering that plus - size models , including cover girl Crystal Renn , do n't always have to wear plus - sized clothing — replacing it with " curvy " does nobody any favors .
( You can wear any dress size and be curvy . )
And the bounciness is disingenuous , at best : " appreciate your own body , whatever its quirks and eccentricities , " is hardly the message any reasonable reader would glean from a fashion magazine .
Advertisement
What I think Leive 's piece gets at — and yet notably fails to examine — is the tricky question of what duty a fashion magazine owes its readers .
Fashion concerns the body , and so its presentation necessarily impacts our own relationships with our bodies — women have in this way a very intimate relationship with the media that concerns us , and perhaps it 's not illegitimate to think that those media owe us some consideration beyond that which a magazine about disembodied issues like politics or interior design ought to show .
Considering we mostly have the bodies we 're born into .
Considering studies show looking at our magazines can make us feel bad about ourselves .
Considering it just seems , you know , fair .
But magazines exist to sell things , and one of the most reliable ways of getting a reader in the mood to buy is to play on her feelings of inadequacy .
( It 's not the only way , but it seems to work . )
But what 's more , I can't get behind Merritt 's " average woman " solution .
It 's likely that if magazines did feature " average " women , we would n't buy them or the things they advertise .
Nobody wants to read about the average ; ESPN does n't spend much time covering average athletes , the New York Review of Books does n't tend towards average writers , and if Vogue never covered another average designer it'd still be too soon for me .
And yet many readers of these publications are , well — average .
The subtext of Merritt 's argument seems to be that , because we read , we all somehow " deserve " to see ourselves reflected in the pages of our media — but I do n't think this is a right bestowed at birth .
The question of whether or not fashion magazines should do more to represent a wider array of models , in body shape , in race , in age , is derailed by this notion of the " average " woman ( or her sister the " real " woman ) and their supposed right to warts - and - all representation , as though any magazine that failed to be average enough were failing its readers .
Obviously all women 's magazines should be booking more plus - sized models , and more models of color , and more models who are n't 14 years old and looking like they 're playing in grown - up clothes .
They do n't have to be average , though .

When you compare the candid shots from the set of Glamour 's cover shoot with the final result , it 's kind of surprising the amount of averaging that seems to have gone on .
The paparazzi and Twitter photos from the shoot show three noticeably different looking women — there 's thin , almost bird - like Alessandra Ambrosio , curvaceous but slim Brooklyn Decker , and the gorgeous , larger Crystal Renn .
( Is that the full spectrum of female beauty ?
Hell no — but they do look different one from another . )
Yet in the final pictures , through posing , through the photographer 's choices in terms of lens and angle , and through post - production and Photoshop , these three women come out looking almost the same size .
It 's like they 're the tan , the brunette , and the blonde versions of the same slim , curvy body .
They were made interchangeable for Glamour 's big body diversity showcase .
It 's pretty ironic if you think about it .
And it 's not wrong to say this was an opportunity Glamour missed .

VP8 , a high - quality video codec we are releasing today under a BSD - style , royalty - free license
Vorbis , an already open source and broadly implemented audio codec
a container format based on a subset of the Matroska media container
A key factor in the web ’s success is that its core technologies such as HTML , HTTP , TCP / IP , etc. are open and freely implementable .
Though video is also now core to the web experience , there is unfortunately no open and free video format that is on par with the leading commercial choices .
To that end , we are excited to introduce WebM , a broadly - backed community effort to develop a world - class media format for the open web .
WebM includes :
The team that created VP8 have been pioneers in video codec development for over a decade .
VP8 delivers high quality video while efficiently adapting to the varying processing and bandwidth conditions found on today ’s broad range of web - connected devices .
VP8 's efficient bandwidth usage will mean lower serving costs for content publishers and high quality video for end -users .
The codec 's relative simplicity makes it easy to integrate into existing environments and requires less manual tuning to produce high quality results .
These existing attributes and the rapid innovation we expect through the open - development process make VP8 well suited for the unique requirements of video on the web .
A developer preview of WebM and VP8 , including source code , specs , and encoding tools is available today at www.webmproject.org
We want to thank the many industry leaders and web community members who are collaborating on the development of WebM and integrating it into their products .
Check out what Mozilla Adobe , and many others below have to say about the importance of WebM to the future of web video .

There are a few flavors of " all seems lost " moments in science fiction and fantasy and we 'll break them down below , with our favorite examples .
Often , the very greatest " all seems lost " moments lead to the best " fuck yeah " moments , as if by magic .
Note : I am sure there 's a page on this phenomenon over on TVTropes , but I did n't go look over there , because I did n't want this roundup to be just a repost of the TVTropes page .
And of course , this is n't an exhaustive list because otherwise it would be as big as the internet .

Avatar actually has two different " all is lost " moments in one film — the second one is during the final battle , right before all the critters come to the rescue .
But the first comes a bit earlier , when the Na'vi discover that Jake has been playing them all along and reporting to Colonel Evilpants about them .
Jake 's treachery is uncovered — just as his Avatar gets shut down and then the military starts attacking the Hometree , trashing their harmonious way of life .

Buffy The Vampire Slayer , " Becoming Part 2 " features almost everything rotten —
Buffy 's forced to plunge her lover , Angel , into Hell — mere moments after Willow has succeeded in restoring his lost soul to him .
To make matters worse , Buffy 's mom has found out her long - kept secret — that she 's the Slayer and she 's been sneaking off to fight the forces of darkness .
And she 's been expelled from school , to boot .
It 's off to L.A. for Buffy 's first foray into waitressing ( but not her last . )

The " Worst Has Just Happened " Cliffhanger !
Lots of television shows ( and a few movies ) do epic cliffhangers , but only a few of these involve the really unthinkable happening , just before we smash to black or go to credits .
Star Trek : The Next Generation : " The Best Of Both Worlds . "
The end of " The Best Of Both Worlds , Part 1 " is considered an ultra-classic for good reason — not only is Picard Borgified , but Riker is preparing to blow the Borg to oblivion .
You do n't know whether to root for Riker 's plan to succeed or not — since it'll result in the death of Picard and then we 'll be stuck with four years of Captain Riker .
I first saw this episode in reruns — I can't even imagine having to wait three months for the resolution of this cliffhanger .

Babylon 5 : " Shadow Dancing " / " Z'ha'dum " .
Our heroes start their war with the Shadows and achieve a pretty Pyrrhic victory .
Then , Sheridan dumps Delenn and follows his presumed - dead wife to the Shadow homeworld .
At the end , Sheridan jumps into a deep black pit while the White Star obliterates the Shadow headquarters , and it looks like he 's done for ... until next season at least .

The Knife Of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness ends with a gut - dropping cliffhanger , which we 're loathe to spoil here since it 's still relatively new .
Suffice to say , our hero makes a grievous error and his friend is in dire , horrendous straits .

All Is Lost AND
There 's Slow - Mo !
You know it 's bad when everything slows down to crawl and people 's mouths open and close in slowed - down agony .
Events have reached such a terrible low point , even the passage of time has been dragged down .

Serenity 's big " all is lost " moment only features a smidgen of slow - mo — when Simon gets shot and takes forever to fall .
But then you get slow - mo 's boon companion , the weird muffling of sounds , a moment later , while River is standing over her apparently dying brother .
You see Jayne firing his rifle , but you only dimly hear the sound , as if River 's concern for her brother is blocking out all sounds .
And meanwhile , it 's not in this clip , but Mal is getting totally pwned by Chiwetl Ejiofor , who 's practicing for killing everybody you care about in Children Of Men .
And of course , this " all is lost " moment leads into an amazing chain of " fuck yeah " moments , as befitting one of the greatest movies of all time .
( I seem to remember the final Buffy episode also features a pretty intense bit of slow - mo at its " all is lost " moment . )
The Matrix features the ultimate slow - mo moment of defeat , as Agent Smith empties his gun , with agonizing slowness , into Neo .
Who 's only brought back to digital life as The One after Trinity gives a huge speech about how much she loves him .
Meanwhile , the Nebuchadnezzar is under attack and it seems like everyone 's going to be toasted , until Neo becomes the digital messiah .

The Lord Of The Rings has a few great " all is lost " moments , chief among them the Battle of Helms Deep , at which an overwhelming force threatens to crush Aragorn and his people .
And at least , in Peter Jackson 's film version , there 's a fair bit of slow - mo going on , especially when Gandalf shows up on his white horse and rears up , majestically .
Thank goodness the Ents and other reiforcements show up to save the day .
Battlestar Galactica , " Exodus Part 2 " — Speaking of the cavalry ... the Galactica swoops down ( literally ) to rescue the people trapped on New Caprica , but gets severely outgunned and outmatched by the Cylon baseships that show up .
The Galactica is badly damaged and seems on the verge of being torn to shreds — Adama 's hit by an explosion and falls slowly to the deck .
And then the Pegasus appears , to save the day .
( And get blown to hell .
But you can't have everything . )

All Is Lost Until There 's A Montage !
Sometimes , events reach a point that 's so dire , there 's only one cure : a montage , showing how things can be fixed .
Often , it 's a montage showing events we 've already witnessed , but showing that things are actually much different than we'd thought .

There 's a chunk of the middle of Consider Phlebas by Iain M. Banks where it seems vanishingly unlikely that Horza will make it to the Orbital in time , in between being stranded in the ocean and captured by that cult of offal cannibals .
There are still 250 pages to go at this point , so you have an inkling he 'll make it somehow , but you have no clue how .
" Horza 's head was feeling very light ; there was a taste he knew too well at the back of his throat , as though some of the acid from his wrists had somehow found its way to his tongue .
He strained again at his bonds behind him , feeling the muscles shake . "

Why Ca n’t Anyone Stop the LRA ?
In its nearly 20 years of fighting in northern Uganda , the Lord ’s Resistance Army ( LRA ) killed or injured thousands of civilians , abducted scores of children to fill its ranks , and traumatized a whole generation of Ugandans .
But in recent years , it was beginning to look as if Uganda ’s nightmarish two - decade struggle against the LRA was at last coming to an end .
The rebels had mostly been driven out of northern Uganda in 2005 by government troops , and the last LRA attacks on Ugandan soil were in 2006 .
The terror that once plagued the country ’s north was finally fading into memory .
The LRA , however , was not .
It was just moving next door — to the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , South Sudan , and the Central African Republic ( CAR ) , where the rebels have continued their trademark nastiness , including a DRC rampage between Dec. 14 and 17 , 2009 , that killed more than 300 people .
The massacre , chronicled in a recent Human Rights Watch report , shows that the LRA is still an immense threat to unarmed civilians .
Why is the LRA still around ?
The Ugandan government has been trying to wipe out the group for ages , with some recent support from the United States .
The governments of the DRC , South Sudan , and CAR have pitched in , all to no avail .
On top of it , the LRA should , in theory , be quite easy to defeat .
It ’s relatively small — according to a Ugandan Army spokesperson it has just 200 active fighters .
The Enough Project estimates that there are another 800 or so kidnapped civilians on top of that — two - thirds of which are likely children .
The LRA has little firepower — most of the DRC attacks were committed with blunt weapons like sticks and axes .
It has no support from the civilians it preys on .
Of course , its leader , the elusive and still at - large Joseph Kony , claims to commune with spirits and have mystical powers .
But setting aside the supernatural , how is it possible that the LRA — with no support base or weaponry — is still thriving ?
Put simply , the LRA ’s fortuitous combination of murky international alliances , child soldiers , and bumbling enemies has proved stronger than any military offensive over the last 20 years .
For much of the 1990s , the LRA took advantage of an ugly enemy - of - my - enemy game played between Sudan and Uganda .
Kampala ( and quietly the United States ) funded the Sudan People ’s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , a mostly black - African and Christian rebel group in South Sudan , in its struggle against the Arab - dominated Sudanese national government ; Khartoum supported the LRA in retaliation .
So in exchange for keeping Uganda off balance and occasionally fighting the SPLA , the LRA got weapons and protection from Sudan .
Officially , Sudanese support for the LRA ended in 1999 , though it is believed to have continued sporadically afterward for several years .
Then , in 2002 , the Sudanese government appeared to sell out the LRA completely .
In what was called Operation Iron Fist , the Ugandans were allowed to attack the LRA ’s permanent bases in South Sudan and , it was hoped , finally end the insurgency .
But the Khartoum government demarcated a " red line " across which Ugandan forces were not supposed to attack .
Conveniently , the LRA simply retreated behind the boundary — perhaps even with the material and intelligence assistance of the Sudanese military .
Finally caving to international pressure , Sudan let the Ugandans attack beyond the " red line , " but the Ugandan attack narrowly missed nabbing Kony .
Although there is no proof , it is commonly believed he was again tipped off by Sudan .
In the end , the offensive fractured the LRA but did n’t crush it .
Some offshoots laid low in South Sudan , while others slipped back into northern Uganda where they began attacking civilians in regions that had been previously left alone .
The period between 2003 and 2004 brought some of the war ’s bloodiest conflicts .
In 2005 , the last LRA rebels were finally kicked out of South Sudan after Sudan signed a Comprehensive Peace Agreement to end its own civil war .
The LRA retreated — this time to the DRC , where it began building bases in Garamba National Park .
Today , there are LRA in the DRC , CAR , and parts of Sudan .
Recent reports placing Kony ’s personal unit in Darfur have raised familiar questions about whether Khartoum ’s support has resumed .
Apart from friendships with shady dictators , the LRA has gotten pretty good at what it does — massacring and hiding throughout the region .
" They ’ve developed skills that no military has on Earth , " said Frank Nyakairu , who covered the LRA for 10 years for Uganda ’s Daily Monitor and now works for Reuters .
LRA fighters are excellent at hiding in and moving quickly across rough terrain , often at night , and few conventional militaries can keep up .
The LRA has also honed its ability to forage and loot the supplies it needs , including child soldiers .
Few if any similar guerrilla or insurgent groups worldwide have been capturing , brainwashing , and training children for as long as the LRA , and its leaders have refined their brutal techniques to an art form .
The LRA ’s child soldiers have also made offensive operations against the movement extremely difficult because , bluntly put , children are a tactical advantage .
Nyakairu covered several ambushes , for example , in which LRA child soldiers posed innocently playing football or bathing naked .
As soon as Ugandan forces passed , the children grabbed hidden guns and opened fire .
This penchant for abducting children also complicates the possibility of wiping out the LRA in one major stroke , say a tactical airstrike .
Every time people in the north hear about new violence involving the LRA , they think of those they knew who were abducted , explains Reagan Okumu , a Parliament member from northern Uganda : " They know that their children are innocent . "
Given all this , it ’s no surprise that so much emphasis has been put on a simpler strategy : capture or assassinate Kony .
Extremely charismatic , Kony has inspired fear and loyalty with his seemingly charmed ability to avoid capture and his violent demonstrations of wrath against any LRA fighters he suspects of crossing him .
In fact , without fear of Kony ’s wrath , the group , now composed largely of abductees from four countries , would have little reason to fight on .
But removing him could involve serious collateral damage — and when that collateral damage is almost certain to be wreaked on children , it ’s hard to know how to proceed .
Meanwhile , the LRA ’s pursuers , corrupt and inept , have shot themselves in the foot innumerable times .
An internal military investigation in 2003 , for example , found that Ugandan commanders in their country ’s north were inflating their troop numbers and keeping for themselves the salaries and rations for soldiers who were dead , had deserted , or never existed in the first place .
Of Uganda ’s 55,626 troops on paper , an estimated 20,000 did not exist .
The soldiers who did exist were underequipped , underfed , and often unpaid , as the same commanders skimmed money from disbursements meant to buy food and supplies .
Overall , high - ranking Ugandan military leaders profited immensely from the war — and the LRA profited from facing a weakened military .
Even in negotiations , the LRA has been inadvertently aided by its enemies .
During talks between 2005 and 2008 , supporters of the peace process , such as the European Union , gave the LRA a great deal of money and food as incentives to keep it involved in peace discussions .
An agreement was at last reached in 2008 , pending only Kony ’s signature .
Perhaps not surprisingly , the warlord did n’t come through with the signature — and he certainly did n’t reimburse the European Union for its donations to his cause .
The most recent , U.S. - aided offensive was also bungled .
Operation Lightning Thunder was planned with significant U.S. support as well as the cooperation of U.N. peacekeepers in the DRC and Congolese forces .
The Ugandans planned to launch targeted airstrikes on Kony ’s Garamba base on Dec. 14 , 2008 , with the goal of killing Kony .
U.S. intercepts of his satellite phones had provided coordinates zeroing in on the actual hut Kony was living in .
Then , Ugandan and Congolese ground units would sweep in to cut off escape routes , capture rebels , free abductees , and protect civilians .
Again , however , Kony escaped .
At the last minute , helicopter gunships ( which can be heard five minutes away ) were substituted for quiet fighter jets , officially due to bad weather ( though the revelation last week that Uganda is shopping for new jets suggests faulty equipment could have been the culprit ) .
To make matters worse , the Ugandan ground forces that were supposed to catch escaping LRA members arrived a full 72 hours late , bizarrely underestimating the time it would take them to move on foot through dense jungle .
And Congolese troops that were supposed to protect nearby villages never showed up .
So while some rebels were captured or killed by the helicopter force , the escaping LRA fighters went on a vengeful spree , killing more than 800 civilians as they pillaged virtually every village on their way to the Central African Republic .
Currently , some 5,000 Ugandan troops are still chasing the LRA in the DRC , CAR , and South Sudan , according to Human Rights Watch ( the Ugandan military declined to confirm any numbers ) .
The U.S. Senate just passed a bill directing the U.S. president to create a regional strategy of support to end the LRA once and for all .
For these efforts to succeed , however , the elements that have allowed the LRA to survive must be removed .
Sudan must be prevented from any further support of the LRA ; the Ugandan military must plan better for contingencies like bad weather and difficult terrain ; soldiers must actually be paid to make sure they do their part in protecting civilians and keeping the LRA on the run .
Then again , pursuit is nothing new to the LRA .
And Uganda and its allies find themselves in a familiar position : searching for an enemy that is adept at terrorizing villages and then melting away .
" The strategic plan has not changed : capture or kill Kony , " said Lt. Col .
Felix Kulayigye , a spokesman for the Ugandan military .
But as reports of fresh attacks and abductions continue to trickle out , it is clear that the LRA ’s will to survive is as powerful as the forces massed against it .
The other day I was in one of the Apple Stores .
The hinge had broken on my MacBook Air , which meant the top of the computer , the screen part , had to be replaced .
It was to be done for free , which I love about Apple .
The store was crowded ; I asked the young lady salesperson if using my Mac ProCare card would move things along .
She looked at my card , told me it was out of date , and offered to go update it .
When she came back , she was apologetic .
“ The thing is , ” she stammered , “ I think they ’re kind of going to be de-emphasizing the ProCare program . ”
“ Huh ? ” I said .
“ Is it continuing , or not ? ”
“ Well , I think they ’re maybe going to be phasing it out , ” she squirmed .
“ As of when is it phasing out ? ” I asked , “ and is there a replacement program ?
I just want to know how to get premium service . ”
“ Well , I think they ’ve already stopped it , really , ” she stammered .
This was getting nowhere fast .
Fortunately , the store manager came by and took over ; he assured me I ’d get the repaired computer by day ’s end ( which I did , by the way ) .
I asked him , “ What ’s up with the ProCare program ? ”
“ Oh , ” he said , “ we ’re discontinuing it . ”
“ Why ? ”
“ Well , it was so popular that everyone was buying it , and then you have a problem with , like , who do you let at the head of the line , and who do you have to say no to , and all that sort of hassle . ”
This boggled my mind .
“ Why not just raise the price ? ” I asked .
He laughed .
“ You know , several other people have suggested that too . ”
“ Well no wonder they have , ” I said .
“ If everybody wants something at one price , raise the price — you make more money , and it very easily sorts out to whom it ’s worth more and to whom it is n’t . ”
“ Yeah , but it ’s kind of unfair that way too , you know , ” he said , in a ‘ you clearly do n’t get it , do you ’ sort of a way .
And I left , bemused again at the curious mix of capitalism and west - coast do - goodism that is Apple Computer .
No company is better at in - your - face planned obsolescence than Apple ; just trying getting a replacement battery for an iPod .
No company is better at aggressive pricing ; and how many mature companies can claim a stock price growth of ten fold in five years ?
All this , in spite of echoes of PC ( not the computer ) instincts and shades of tie - dyed Deadhead ethos in the stores .
Or , is it because of said instincts and ethos ?
Changing Ideologies in Business : From Competitive Capitalism to Collaborative Capitalism
Then again , why should Apple be unique in its schizophrenia about capitalism ?
Business in general is in the midst of a paradigm shift in business , away from shareholder - centricity toward stakeholder - centricity .
An excellent article in the Economist summarizes this ideological shift , citing several current business thinkers .
Business , I think , is undergoing some serious foment with respect to some very fundamental beliefs .
Milton Friedman , Michael Porter , Michael Jensen — these are the thought leaders of the past , championing neo-classical economics , the purification of competition , and the primacy of shareholder wealth respectively .
The new thought leaders remain to be definitively enumerated , but the issues are emerging .
They rhyme with collaboration , trust , networking , flat organizations , and Gen Y .
To name a few .
Stay tuned , it ’s getting interesting .
And Steve Jobs may end up , once again , looking pretty prescient .
When the students of St. Catherine 's High School 's new middle school program arrive next year , they 'll be sporting shiny new iPads instead of textbooks , giving students plenty of games to play while they should be learning , until they get stolen .

It 's a revolutionary idea , I suppose , but a very bad revolutionary idea .
St Catherine 's High School in Racine , Wisconsin kicks off its new middle school program next year , inviting sixth and seventh graders into a facility that 's traditionally been for eighth through twelfth grade students .
Some would consider these new students privileged .
Others would consider them targets .

To make things easier for the new attendees , St. Catherine 's is doing away with weighty , game - less textbooks , and requiring all new students to pay a $ 400 technology fee to acquire an Apple iPad .
So not only does St. Catherine 's have a crop of fresh , young students entering a school filled with older children , they are making sure everyone knows these younger , weaker kids will be carrying around $ 500 worth of Apple technology .

Like I said , targets .
The idea of getting rid of heavy textbooks in favor of technology is a very noble and forward - thinking one .
The iPad can read electronic books , after all , and also has access to many of the tools children would normally have to pay big money for , like graphing calculators .

And games .
Unless there is some sort of plan in place to regulate the apps loaded on to each device , say a school - wide iTunes account , then there 's no way the school is keeping these kids from playing Plants Vs. Zombies all day long .
Hell , I had one computer class in high school that gave me 45 minutes with an Apple IIe , and I still spent the entire time playing a hacked copy of Conan .
" We think it 's time to do something to take advantage of technology , " ( School President Christopher )
Olley said .
" This is a small step for this age group . "

Sir , all steps are small steps for sixth and seventh graders .
While the sixth and seventh graders will pilot the program next year , the rest of the school 's students will be carrying iPads by the 2012 - 2013 school year .
Hopefully this wo n't generate any ire between the older students and the newer ones .

As an oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico grows larger by the hour , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin continues to stick to “ drill , baby , drill . ”
In a 30 - minute speech to a Republican crowd in Kansas City Saturday , the onetime Republican vice presidential nominee dubbed the gulf spill “ very tragic ” but added : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I want our country to be able to trust the oil industry .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 

Writing in the Kansas City Star , reporter Steve Kraske summed up her remarks as , “ She said the U.S. must wean itself from foreign oil in order to be truly free . ”
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ WeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve got to tap domestically because energy security will be the key to our prosperity , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Palin remarked .
Palin spoke as BP and military officials sought to get a handle on a leaking oil rig site in the Gulf of Mexico , which is purportedly leaking as many as 5,000 barrels of oil a day .
The leak began after an explosion on an offshore rig sent the rig to the bottom of the sea and unsheathed a tube that was supposed to be carrying oil to the surface .
Kraske noted that Palin ’s speech was also rich with God and “ gottas . ”
There were lots of Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ we gottas , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â religious references , praise for the troops and even a trademark Palin growl or two as she outlined a conservative vision for the country that adheres , in her view , far more closely to the Constitution .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We believe that God shed his grace on thee , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  she said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We still believe that America is exceptional .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
In response to a question from local radio talk show host Chris Stigall about her political plans , Palin punted .
Although she has hinted in recent months that she is considering a 2012 run for the White House , Palin on Saturday joked that she might run next for a PTA position when her son , Trig , starts school .

Palin spoke to a group called “ Preserving American Liberty . ”
She would n’t disclose how much — or if — she was paid for her speech .
The former governor has been earning as much as $ 100,000 for each appearance .

As CNBC hosts Joe Kerne and Rick Santelli pointed out yesterday , the Tea Party movement seems largely clueless about the fact that a huge chunk of the $ 1 trillion dollar bailout heist being pushed through to save the face of global economic governance is being funded with dollars looted from American taxpayers .
Founded on the principle of keeping taxes low for the benefit of the economy , the Tea Party movement has seemingly ignored the biggest and most insidious stealth tax – inflation – which as Ron Paul highlighted yesterday , will only soar as a result of this latest bailout .
“ Could you really tell the American taxpayer , you can connect the dots between them and Greece ?
I mean are they paying for some lavish benefits in Greece right now ? ” asked CNBC ’s Kerne .
“ Well there ’s no connect - the - dots , ” Santelli replied .
“ I mean it is a fact .
We contribute a little less than 18 percent to the IMF .
And the IMF is pretty much using its entire piggy bank , of course to pledge up to €250 billion , no matter how you slice it , Joe .
Eighteen percent of that money , or more , because you know , if they go much beyond this , they ’re going to have to replenish the coffers . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
And we know that “ replenishing the coffers ” means not only raising taxes on Americans but also inventing new ones out of thin air , which will then go straight to the IMF to bankroll the next phase of global governance .
It ’s not good enough for these people to impose inherently undemocratic centralized systems of economic planning that only they control which then result in lowering your living standards – you have to pay for the whole thing to begin with .
In addition to Americans picking up the tab for the IMF ’s bailout of Europe , they will also be waving goodbye to further unknown billions in the form of Federal Reserve credit swaps , with the Fed directly sending U.S. dollars to European banks .
And do n’t believe for a second that you actually have a right to know to which foreign entities these untold billions are heading – because Ben Bernanke refuses to tell us .
“ I do n’t think the average Tea Partier knows we ’re paying for lavish benefits in Greece for public employees over there , Rick , ” Kerne said .
“ I think maybe you need to tell them . ”
But it appears as if the Tea Party and the American public as a whole has “ bailout fatigue ” and has completely lost track of the trillions stolen from them and the consequences this will have in the not too distant future .
Perhaps when the government keeps increasing the retirement age out of their reach , or when they outright pillage their pension funds will Americans finally grasp what all this truly means .
Perhaps the drastic cuts in public services , in policing , and further withdrawals from infrastructure and road maintenance funds will create the flash point that will lead to similar scenes we ’ve seen in Greece unfolding on American streets .
But as it stands , Kerne and Santelli are right , the silence from the Tea Party in reaction to the bailouts is deafening , and if such a meek response is to continue then the entire momentum , purpose and relevance of the movement will quickly begin to dissipate .

Are BP and the Coast Guard attempting to keep journalists from learning the worst about the Gulf oil spill ?
It certainly seemed that way yesterday when a vessel of Coast Guard officials and BP contractors threatened to arrest a crew from CBS News if they did n’t turn back from their investigation of an oil - covered beach in South Pass , Louisiana .
So why did this happen ?
The same heavy oil - filled shoreline has already been observed by Governor Bobby Jindal , after all .
“ The incident is n’t reflective of policy for media access to the spill site or spill mitigation efforts , ” Lieutenant Commander Chris O’Neill , the Chief of Media Relations for the U.S. Coast Guard , tells FastCompany.com .
“ We ’ve reiterated our policy to the field . ” O’Neill says that the Coast Guard has worked aggressively to embed media , but “ every once in a while someone misinterprets guidance . ”
O’Neill speculates that the misinterpretation may stem from an incident earlier in the week where a media crew in the South Pass area was asked to depart either because they were interfering with response operations or there were
safety concerns .
Fair enough , but we still have to wonder if the BP contractors deliberately violated the Coast Guard ’s policies –especially because a contractor onboard the boat told the CBS crew , “ These are BP ’s rules .
These are not our rules . ”
And while O’Neill tells us that this was an isolated incident , there have been other unconfirmed reports of reporters being blocked from spill sites .
Safety concerns aside , limiting just who can report this or blocking access to the story could have a chilling effect on solving this problem .
We ’ve submitted a request to the Coast Guard to speak to the members on board the vessel that turned away the CBS crew .
We ’ve asked for as prompt a response as possible , but we were also told the Coast Guard crew in question was still out in the field .
Stay tuned .

Big thanks to Slate for answering a question that 's certainly on the mind of a lot of folks : can California actually go bankrupt ?
Long story short : Yes .
Here 's the nut of how it works .
Say the state can't make its debt payments , and no one will lend it any more money .
In that case , the federal government can step in and put the state into receivership .
This would involve the assignment of an accountant to manage the state 's debt , overseen by a judge .
It would be a lot like bankruptcy , except instead of following a structured set of steps — informing creditors , appointing creditors ' committees , a 120 - day window to file a plan , etc . — a receiver has the authority to force creditors to renegotiate loans in a speedy fashion .
However , the accountant in charge would not have the power to make decisions about the state 's budget , such as which programs needed to be cut and which taxes had to be raised .
( No state has ever gone into receivership . )

Image caption Scotland Patients Association said patients should not be put at risk
Forceps , needles , fragments of a bone drill and swabs are among the objects left inside Scottish patients during operations , it has emerged .
Some patients also had organs punctured accidentally while in operating theatres , the Press Association found .
Scotland 's largest health board , NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde , said six patients left hospital with swabs inside their body since January 2008 .
The NHS board said the checks system it has in place failed on those occasions .
The hospitals involved are Glasgow Royal Infirmary , Southern General Hospital , Stobhill Hospital , Victoria Infirmary and Royal Hospital for Sick Children .
Greater Glasgow and Clyde said up to three people , from a total of 12 with objects left inside their bodies , became unwell as a result .
A spokesman said : " All swabs and instruments are counted in and out during every open operative procedure .
" During the operation the counts are recorded on a wall board in theatre .
No patient should have to endure another operation or have their life put at risk because the pre and post checks are not rigorously carried out Dr Jean Turner , Scotland Patients Association
" Several counts are done during the procedure and a final count at the end to ensure all is present and correct . "
He said the final count was documented by the two members of staff who performed the count .
" However the system has not worked on these particular occasions , " he added .
" All such incidents are reported within the organisation and undergo an investigation .
" The patients involved receive an apology from the principle clinician involved . "
NHS Borders said forceps were left inside a patient at Borders General Hospital in June last year .
The health board said the object was missing at the end of the surgery
It said staff were alerted , the patient was X - rayed , re-anaesthetised and the forceps removed .
Needles and swabs
In May last year the bladder dome of an adult patient at the same hospital was accidentally torn during a total abdominal hysterectomy .
The tear was noticed immediately and was stitched .
NHS Grampian said eight incidents occurred between January 2008 and February 2010 in which objects were left inside or assumed to have been left inside patients .
The items included " minute " bone - drill fragments , as well as fragments of tubing , needles and swabs .
In six recorded cases in NHS Grampian , the uterus was punctured on five occasions and a patient 's testicles were punctured in one case .
Five of the incidents took place at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and one was at Royal Aberdeen Children 's Hospital .
Image caption Missing instruments have been found inside patients
Since January 2008 , fewer than five patients left hospital with swabs inside them after surgery .
NHS Tayside said eight objects , including the tip of a guide wire and the tip of a needle , were left inside patients during surgery .
The patients were at Ninewells Hospital and Perth Royal Infirmary but none became ill , were injured or died as a result of the mistakes .
Health boards insisted they had checks in place .
Dr Jean Turner , executive director of the Scotland Patients Association , said : " Patients expect to be safe at all times but especially when they are in an operating theatre and under an anaesthetic .
" The utmost care should be taken by all theatre staff , especially the sister in charge , the surgeon in charge and the anaesthetist to make sure that all swabs and instruments are counted at the start and match the count at the end before closing the wound .
" All swabs despite arriving in packs of whatever number , should be counted and not assumed to be the usual number of the pack .
" These checks , to my knowledge , are routine .
" No patient should have to endure another operation or have their life put at risk because the pre and post checks are not rigorously carried out . "
The details were released after a Freedom of Information request to all 14 health boards in Scotland by the Press Association .
How To Backup Local Unix Host Using rsnapshot rsync Utility
rsnapshot is an awesome free Linux backup utility to perform rsync backup of both local and remote file system .
This is a series of two articles .
In this article , let us review how to install and configure rsnapshot utility to take rsync backup of local file system .
In next article , let us review how to setup rsnapshot utility to take rsync backup of remote file system .
rsnapshot uses the combination of rsync and hard links to maintain full - backup and incremental backups .
Once you ’ve setup and configured rsnapshot , there is absolutely no maintenance involved in it .
rsnapshot will automatically take care of deleting and rotating the old backups .
It also takes very less disk space .
The first full backup will take the same size as your original files and directories .
Subsequent rsnapshot full backups takes only less space , as it takes backup of only the modified files from the previous full backup .
1. Download rsnapshot Linux Backup Utility
Download the rsnapshot utility from rsnapshot.org as shown below .
# cd /usr / src # wget http://www.rsnapshot.org/downloads/rsnapshot-1.3.1.tar.gz
# tar xvfz rsnapshot - 1.3.1.tar.gz # cd rsnapshot -1.3.1
2. Install rsnapshot to backup Linux direcotires
Install rsnapshot Linux backup utility using ./ configure and make install as shown below .
# ./configure -- sysconfdir=/etc checking for a BSD - compatible install ...
/usr / bin/install -c checking whether build environment is sane ... yes config.status : creating t/rsync.t config.status : creating t/gnu_cp.t config.status : creating t/relative_delete_bugfix.t
Type " make install " to install the program .
After rsnapshot is installed , do n't forget to copy /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default to /etc/rsnapshot.conf
# make install /usr / bin / pod2man - c '' - n ' rsnapshot ' -r '' rsnapshot > rsnapshot.1 /usr/bin/pod2man - c '' - n ' rsnapshot - diff ' -r '' rsnapshot - diff > rsnapshot - diff.1 make [ 1 ] : Entering directory `/usr / src/rsnapshot - 1.3.1 ' test - z " /usr/local / bin " || mkdir -p -- " /usr/local / bin " /usr/bin/install - c ' rsnapshot ' ' /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot '
/usr/bin/install - c ' rsnapshot - diff ' ' /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot - diff ' test - z " /etc " || mkdir -p -- " /etc " /usr/bin/install -c -m 644 ' rsnapshot.conf.default ' ' /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default ' test - z " /usr/local/man/man1 " || mkdir -p -- " /usr/local/man/man1 " /usr/bin/install -c -m 644 './rsnapshot.1 '
'/usr/local/man/man1/rsnapshot.1 '
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 './rsnapshot-diff.1 ' '/usr/local/man/man1/rsnapshot-diff.1 ' make [ 1 ] : Leaving directory `/usr / src/rsnapshot - 1.3.1 '
Now , create a new rsnapshot.conf based on the default configuration file that comes with the rsnapshot linux backup utility .
# cp /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default
/etc/rsnapshot.conf
3. Configure rsnapshot and Specify Backup Source Directory
Open the /etc/rsnapshot.conf and uncomment the following lines .
# vi /etc/rsnapshot.conf cmd_cp /bin/cp cmd_ssh /usr/bin/ssh cmd_du /usr/bin/du cmd_rsnapshot_diff /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot-diff logfile /var/log/rsnapshot
Define your destination backup directories in /etc/rsnapshot.conf as shown below .
In this example ,
/etc – source directory that should be backed - up
– source directory that should be backed - up localhost / – destination directory where the backup will be stored .
Please note that this directory will be created under /.snapshots/{internal.n}/ directory as shown in the last step .
# vi /etc/rsnapshot.conf backup /etc/ localhost /
Note : Change /etc / to the appropriate directory that you would like to backup .
4 . Test rsnapshot Configuration
Perform configuration test to make sure rsnapshot is setup properly and ready to perform linux rsync backup .
# rsnapshot configtest Syntax OK
5. Verify rsnapshot Hourly Backup Configuration
You can backup linux directories or files at various intervals .
By default , the hourly and daily backups are configured .
Verify the hourly backup configuration .
# rsnapshot -t hourly echo 6490 > /var/run/rsnapshot.pid mkdir -m 0700 - p /.snapshots / mkdir -m 0755 - p /.snapshots/hourly.0/ /usr/bin/rsync - a -- delete --numeric-ids -- relative -- delete - excluded /home \ /.snapshots/hourly.0/localhost/ mkdir -m 0755 - p /.snapshots/hourly.0/ /usr/bin/rsync - a -- delete --numeric-ids -- relative -- delete - excluded /etc \ /.snapshots/hourly.0/localhost/ mkdir -m 0755 - p /.snapshots/hourly.0/ /usr/bin/rsync - a -- delete --numeric-ids -- relative -- delete - excluded \ /usr / local /.snapshots/hourly.0/localhost/ touch /.snapshots/hourly.0 /
6. Verify rsnapshot Daily Backup Configuration
Verify the daily rsnapshot cwrsync backup process is configured properly .
# rsnapshot -t daily echo 6493 > /var/run/rsnapshot.pid mkdir -m 0700 - p /.snapshots / /.snapshots / hourly .
5 not present ( yet ) , nothing to copy
7. Invalid rsnapshot Backup Interval
There is no monthly backup interval .
So , if you try to verify monthly backup configuraiton , you may get this message as shown below — ERROR : Interval “ monthly ” unknown , check /etc/rsnapshot.conf
# rsnapshot -t weekly echo 6495 > /var/run/rsnapshot.pid mkdir -m 0700 - p /.snapshots / /.snapshots /daily .6 not present ( yet ) , nothing to copy # rsnapshot -t monthly echo 6496 > /var/run/rsnapshot.pid mkdir -m 0700 - p /.snapshots /
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
rsnapshot encountered an error !
The program was invoked with these options : /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot -t monthly ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR : Interval " monthly " unknown , check /etc/rsnapshot.conf
8. Add Crontab Entry for rsnapshot
Once you ’ve verified that the rsync hourly and daily backup configurations are setup properly in the rsnapshot cwrsync utility , it is time to set this puppy up in the crontab as shown below .
# crontab -e 0 */4 * * * /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly 30 23 * * * /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily
Check out Unix crontab examples article to understand how to setup and configure crontab .
9 . Verify the rsnapshot Job Manually ( One time check - up )
For the first time , you may want to execute the rsnapshot backup manually to make sure it is working as expected .
By default all the rsync backup taken by rnspashot utility will be stored under /.snapshots directory .

FATIMA , Portugal ( AP )  Pope Benedict XVI on Thursday called abortion and same - sex marriage some of the most " insidious and dangerous " threats facing the world today , asserting key church teachings as he tried to move beyond the clerical abuse scandal .
Benedict made the comments to Catholic social workers , health providers and others after celebrating Mass before an estimated 400,000 people in Fatima .
The central Portuguese farming town is one of the most important shrines in Christianity , where three shepherd children reported having visions of the Virgin Mary in 1917 .
Benedict 's visit to Fatima on the anniversary of the apparitions was the spiritual centerpiece of his four - day visit to Portugal , which ends Friday .
It was cast by Vatican officials as evidence that he had turned a page in weathering the abuse scandal , which has dogged him for months .
FAITH & REASON : Benedict XVI calls for repentance on sex abuse crisis
The Vatican spokesman , the Rev. Federico Lombardi , pointed to the turnout in Fatima and said it was " very beautiful and encouraging " that pilgrims had n't been deterred in expressing their faith despite months of revelations in Europe about priests who molested children and bishops and Vatican officials who turned a blind eye .
The faithful understand " the capacity of the church to effectively overcome via conversion , penance and prayer the dimension of real sin there is in our community , " Lombardi said .
Benedict himself admitted to the " sins within the church " on the first day of the trip , his most explicit admission of Church culpability in the scandal .
By Thursday , however , he had moved on to stressing core church teachings in the largely Roman Catholic country , where abortion on demand has been available since 2007 and where Parliament in January passed a bill allowing same - sex marriage .
In addition , a judge in 2008 made it easier to obtain divorce even when one spouse objects .
Benedict told the gathering of lay Catholics that he appreciated their efforts fighting abortion and promoting the family based on the " indissoluble marriage between a man and woman " the Vatican 's way of expressing its opposition to divorce and same - sex unions .
Such initiatives " help respond to some of the most insidious and dangerous threats to the common good today , " he said .
" Alongside numerous other forms of commitment , such initiatives represent essential elements in the building of the civilization of love . "
The admonition was a break of sorts from the continuous message Benedict has delivered in Portugal about the suffering of the world and church a message which resonates in Fatima , where the sick and infirm flock seeking remedies for ailments .
In a special message to the sick during Mass , Benedict urged them to take heart , saying they should " overcome the feeling of the uselessness of suffering which consumes a person from within and makes him feel a burden to those around him . "
" In suffering , you will discover an interior peace and even spiritual joy , " he said .
His message struck a chord with many in the huge gathering , among them elderly and infirm people who , with their heads bowed , fingered rosaries .
Aurora Clemente , a 65 - year - old cook from Portugal 's northeastern tip , close to the border with Spain , said she had been coming to Fatima on May 13 for more than 30 years .
" Fatima makes miracles .
When my son was seriously ill , I prayed to the Virgin of Fatima and he survived , " she said .
" I find it very moving here .
For me , this is the most beautiful place in the world , " she said , sitting beneath a red umbrella on the fringe of the crowd .
Like Lourdes in France , Fatima attracts millions of pilgrims a year seeking cures .
One of the rituals pilgrims perform at Fatima involves casting replicas of body parts eyes , lungs , hearts on sale at local shops into a big bonfire while reciting a prayer asking for healing .
Pope Paul VI visited Fatima in 1967 .
Pope John Paul II who was shot in St. Peter 's Square on May 13 , 1981 came three times before his death , believing that the Virgin 's " unseen hand " had saved him .
During his third and final visit in 2000 , the Vatican announced the " third secret " of Fatima : the third part of the message the Virgin is said to have told the three children : a description of the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II .
The first two secrets of Fatima were said to have foretold the end of World War I and the outbreak of World War II and the rise and fall of Soviet communism .
After the third secret was revealed , the Vatican essentially implied the Fatima case was closed .
But on Thursday , Benedict said its message continued to be relevant .
" We would be mistaken to think that Fatima 's prophetic mission is complete , " Benedict said in his homily during the Mass .
Lombardi was asked if such comments were merely an effort to keep Fatima 's fascination relevant to the faithful at a time when the Cold War and John Paul 's assassination attempt are no longer front - burner issues .
" The term ' prophetic ' does n't mean an announcement of concrete facts that one sees in a crystal ball but rather knowing how to read history and events in the light of faith , " Lombardi said .

David Willey , a physics instructor at the University of Pittsburgh , has written an article explaining the physics behind four dramatic presentations that he demonstrates for his physics classes : walking on a bed of broken glass , having a concrete block broken on his torso while he ’s sandwiched between two beds of nails , dipping his fingers in molten lead , and picking up an orange - hot piece of space shuttle tile .
From the article :
Before dipping one ’s fingers in molten lead , the hand is dipped in a bowl of water .
Then the drops are shaken off and the hand dipped quickly in and out of the lead .
I usually dip the first seven or eight centimeters of my fingers .
Heat from the lead goes into evaporating the water and hence not into burning the hand , and the resulting steam layer insulates the hand .
He ’s also famous for his barefoot fire walking .
I wish my science teachers had been so engrossed in their work .
The Physics Behind Four Amazing Demonstrations
Environmentalist Tim Flannery has blamed scientists for a rise in climate scepticism , saying they had not clearly explained the science to a ' ' confused Australian public ' ' .
Professor Flannery , a long - time climate campaigner , told The Age that scientists needed to get back into the community and explain the link between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change .
He said a lack of simple communication to the public about the science of climate change meant sceptics had been able to fill the void with misinformation .
Professor Flannery also supported comments by Climate Change Minister Penny
Wong that there was a concerted world effort by sceptics to stop action on global warming .
'' We 've got a big problem with the gap between scientific information and a very confused public here in Australia , '' Professor Flannery said .
[ Hear movie clip by clicking on audio podcast above . ]
That ’s a scene from the 1968 movie The Party with Peter Sellers attempting small talk .
And sometimes small talk can lead to interesting connections .
But according to a new study in the journal Psychological Science it might be best if you move from small talk quickly into a more substantial conversation .
Researchers analyzed 20,000 , 30 - second samplings of the daily conversations of study volunteers , and organized them into trivial chatter or more serious discussion .
The participants also took personality and well - being assessment tests .
And they found that the happiest participants spent 70 percent more time talking with others than the least happy people .
But more than just measuring amount of time spent talking with others , they also found a difference in the type of conversation happier folks engage in .
The happiest participants had twice as many substantive conversations and only a third as much small talk as those who are least content .
Of course this study finding shows correlation not causation .
Still , the authors note , “ Just as self - disclosure can instill a sense of intimacy in a relationship , deep conversations may instill a sense of meaning in the interaction partners . ”

Louisiana Considers Adding " Drug Offender " to Driver 's Licenses
Do n't legislators have anything better to do ?
In Louisiana , a House Committee has approved a bill to have drug offenders issued special drivers ' licenses that say , in big orange letters at the bottom , " Drug Offender . "
The House Transportation , Highways and Public Works Committee unanimously approved House Bill 139 by Rep. Rickey Hardy , D - Lafayette , after increasing the fee assessed on offenders from $ 10 to $ 25 to cover the cost of issuing a special license with " DRUG OFFENDER " in bright orange on the bottom .
Similar licenses with " SEX OFFENDER " already are issued to people convicted of certain sex crimes .
Hardy said the main goal of his legislation is to " give the officer who would stop that person a heads - up who he 's dealing with , to let him know that person has been involved in criminal activity and might be armed . "
People are required to show drivers ' licenses for everything from writing a check to getting on a plane to entering a federal courthouse .
This is nothing but a shaming punishment .
It 's bad policy and offensive .
If it 's really just for police , why not merely require drug offenders to keep a copy of their conviction paper in their glovebox , like they do their vehicle registration and proof of insurance , to hand over with their license during a traffic stop ?
Purple bacteria were among the first life forms on Earth .
They are single celled microscopic organisms that play a vital role in sustaining the tree of life .
This tiny organism lives in aquatic environments like the bottom of lakes and the colorful corals under the sea , using sunlight as their source of energy .
Its natural design seems the best structural solution for harvesting solar energy .
Neil Johnson , a physicist and head of the inter - disciplinary research group in complexity in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Miami , thinks its cellular arrangement could be adapted for use in solar panels and other energy conversion devices to offer a more efficient way to garner energy from the sun .
“ These bacteria have been around for billions of years , you would think they are really simple organisms and that everything is understood about them .
However , purple bacteria were recently found to adopt different cell designs depending on light intensity , ” says Johnson .
“ Our study develops a mathematical model to describe the designs it adopts and why , which could help direct design of future photoelectric devices . ”
Johnson and his collaborators from the Universidad de los Andes in Colombia share their findings in a study entitled “ Light - harvesting in bacteria exploits a critical interplay between transport and trapping dynamics , ” published in the current edition of Physical Review Letters .
Solar energy arrives at the cell in “ drops ” of light called photons , which are captured by the light - gathering mechanism of bacteria present within a special structure called the photosynthetic membrane .
Inside this membrane , light energy is converted into chemical energy to power all the functions of the cell .
The photosynthetic apparatus has two light harvesting complexes .
The first captures the photons and funnels them to the second , called the reaction center ( RC ) , where the solar energy is converted to chemical energy .
When the light reaches the RCs , they close for the time it takes the energy to be converted .
According to the study , purple bacteria adapt to different light intensities by changing the arrangement of the light harvesting mechanism , but not in the way one would think by intuition .
“ One might assume that the more light the cell receives , the more open reaction centers it has , ” says Johnson .
“ However , that is not always the case , because with each new generation , purple bacteria create a design that balances the need to maximize the number of photons trapped and converted to chemical energy , and the need to protect the cell from an oversupply of energy that could damage it . ”
To explain this phenomenon , Johnson uses an analogy comparing it to what happens in a typical supermarket , where the shoppers represent the photons , and the cashiers represent the reaction centers .
“ Imagine a really busy day at the supermarket , if the reaction center is busy it ’s like the cashier is busy , somebody is doing the bagging , ” Johnson says .
“ The shopper wonders around to find an open checkout and some of the shoppers may get fed up and leave …
The bacteria are like a very responsible supermarket , ” he says .
“ They would rather lose some shoppers than have congestion on the way out , but it is still getting enough profit for it to survive . ”
The study develops the first analytical model that explains this observation and predicts the “ critical light intensity , ” below which the cell enhances the creation of RCs .
That is the point of highest efficiency for the cell , because it contains the greatest number and best location of opened RCs , and the least amount of energy loss .
Because these bacteria grow and repair themselves , the researchers hope this discovery can contribute to the work of scientists attempting to coat electronic devices with especially adapted photosynthetic bacteria , whose energy output could become part of the conventional electrical circuit , and guide the development of solar panels that can adapt to different light intensities .
Currently , the researchers are using their mathematical model and the help of supercomputers , to try to find a photosynthetic design even better than the one they found in purple bacteria , although outsmarting nature is proving to be a difficult task .
Marie Guma - Diaz is a science writer for The University of Miami .
It is thought that each galaxy has a supermassive black hole — one with somewhere between one million and one billion solar masses at its center — but only about one percent of these " light up " and emit a large amount of energy .
New findings from NASA 's Swift satellite have pinpointed the reason .
It turns out that the bright black holes arise in galaxies that are in the process of colliding .
The brightest of these supermassive black holes , known as active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) , can emit as much as 10 billion times the energy output of our sun , making them some of the brightest objects in the entire universe .
Previously , it was theorized that the disruptive act of galactic collision could send a large amount of mass into these black holes , causing them to emit large amounts of energy .
Simulations of galactic collisions run on supercomputers supported this , but observations proved difficult .
The thick clouds of dust and gas that exist around galactic nuclei block a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum , including UV , optical , and low energy X - rays .
Infrared radiation gets through , but it 's difficult to separate the black hole 's signal from nearby star - forming regions of the galaxy .
It took Swift 's Burst Alert Telescope , which can map hard ( high - energy ) X -rays , to probe these concealed regions of AGNs .
The hard X - ray survey carried out by Swift took place over the course of a few years , and now represents the most detailed survey of the sky at these energy levels .
It has allowed astronomers to gather a complete census of all AGNs that exist within 650 million light years of Earth , and uncovered dozens of previously unknown AGNs .
The high portion of galaxies in the process of merging , or in gravity - linked pairs , pointed to the cause of bright supermassive black holes .
Perhaps 60 percent of the galaxies surveyed " will completely merge in the next billion years , " said Michael Koss , the study 's lead author .
" We think we have the ' smoking gun ' for merger - triggered AGN that theorists have predicted . "

.login_form { border : 1 px solid # AAA ; padding : 10 px ; } h3 { margin - top:3 px;} .chat_main { border : 1 px solid # AAA ; - moz-box - shadow:0 0 10px #ccc ; - webkit - box - shadow : 0 0 10 px #ccc ; width :350 px ; padding : 10 px ; background : #f3f3f3 ; } . message { border : 1 px solid # AAA ; margin : 4 px ; padding : 5 px ; - moz - border - radius :7 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 7 px ; background : # ffffff ; } .textf { - moz - box - shadow:0 0 10px #CCCCCC ; -webkit-box - shadow:0 0 10px # CCCCCC ; border : 1 px solid # CCCCCC ; height :40 px ; } . submit { - moz - border - radius : 7 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 7 px ; background : #F3F3F3 ; border : 1 px solid # CCCCCC ; font - size : 16 px ; font - weight : bold ; height :35 px ; margin - left :10 px ; padding : 5 px ; } . message span { font - size : 10 px ; color : #888 ; margin - left:10 px ; } .submit_form { margin : 10 px 0 px ; }
Step 3 . SQL
We will need to execute next SQL in our database .
CREATE TABLE `s_chat_messages` ( `id` INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , `user` VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , `message` VARCHAR ( 255 ) NOT NULL , `when` INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ;
Step 4 . PHP
As you remember – we already had ready easy authentication system .
I moved it to external library file ( inc/login.inc.php ) .
This will useful for us – now code more structured and it comfortable to use in different places of code .
After I created new library to work with chat ( inc/chat.inc.php ) .
This class have next functions :
acceptMessages – function accepts sent messages and saves them in database table
getMessages – returns list of recent 15 messages
Then I created two php files : messages .php and main .
php .
First file generates list of recent messages .
It refreshes the list each 5 seconds ( it is enough to our chat ) .
Second file generates a login form and one text input field for the chat .
After we login , we can use this field to post messages in the chat .
Ok , here are all used PHP files :
main.
php
<? php // set error reporting level if ( version_compare ( phpversion ( ) , " 5.3.0 " , " > = " ) == 1 ) error_reporting ( E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_DEPRECATED ) ; else error_reporting ( E_ALL & ~ E_NOTICE ) ; require_once ('inc/login.inc.php ' ) ; require_once ('inc/chat.inc.php ' ) ; // initialization of login system and generation code $ oSimpleLoginSystem = new SimpleLoginSystem ( ) ; $ o SimpleChat = new SimpleChat ( ) ; // draw login box echo $ oSimpleLoginSystem->getLoginBox ( ) ; // draw chat application $ sChatResult =
' Need login before using ' ; if ( $_COOKIE [ ' member_name ' ] && $ _COOKIE [' member_pass ' ] ) { if ( $oSimpleLoginSystem->check_login($ _COOKIE [' member_name ' ] , $ _COOKIE [' member_pass ' ] ) ) { $ sChatResult = $ o SimpleChat->acceptMessages ( ) ; } } echo $ sChatResult ; ?>
messages.php
< meta http -equiv= " refresh " content = " 5 " > <?php require_once ('inc/chat.inc.php ' ) ; $ o SimpleChat = new SimpleChat ( ) ; echo $ oSimpleChat->getMessages ( ) ; ?>
inc/chat.inc.php
<? php // simple chat class class SimpleChat { // DB variables var $ sDbName ; var $ sDbUser ; var $ sDbPass ; // constructor function SimpleChat ( ) { //mysql_connect(" localhost " , " username " , " password " ) ; $ this ->sDbName = ' database_name ' ; $ this ->sDbUser = ' username ' ; $ this ->sDbPass = ' password ' ; } // adding to DB table posted message function acceptMessages ( ) { if ( $ _COOKIE [ ' member_name ' ] ) { if ( isset ( $ _POST [ ' s_say ' ] ) && $ _POST [' s_message ' ] ) { $ sUsername = $ _COOKIE [' member_name ' ] ; // the host , name , and password for your mysql $ vLink = mysql_connect ( " localhost " , $ this -> sDbUser , $ this -> sDbPass ) ; //select the database mysql_select_db( $ this -> sDbName ) ; $ sMessage = mysql_real_escape_string ($ _POST [' s_message ' ] ) ; if ( $ sMessage != '') { mysql_query ( " INSERT INTO `s_chat_messages` SET `user`= '{$ sUsername} ' , `message`= '{$ sMessage} ' , `when`=UNIX_TIMESTAMP ( ) " ) ; } mysql_close ( $ vLink ) ; } } ob_start ( ) ; require_once ( 'chat_input.html ' ) ; $ sShoutboxForm = ob_get_clean ( ) ; return $ sShoutboxForm ; } function getMessages ( ) { $ vLink = mysql_connect ( " localhost " , $ this -> sDbUser , $ this -> sDbPass ) ; //select the database mysql_select_db( $ this -> sDbName ) ; //returning the last 15 messages $ vRes = mysql_query ( " SELECT * FROM `s_chat_messages` ORDER BY `id` ASC LIMIT 15 " ) ; $ sMessages = '' ; // collecting list of messages if ( $ vRes ) { while ($ aMessages = mysql_fetch_array ( $ vRes ) ) {
$ sWhen = date ( " H:i:s " , $ aMessages [ ' when ' ] ) ; $ sMessages .= ' < div class = " message " >' .
$ aMessages [ ' user ' ] . ': ' . $ aMessages [ ' message ' ] . '< span > ( ' .
$ sWhen . ')</ span></div>' ; } } else { $ sMessages = ' DB error , create SQL table before ' ; } mysql_close ( $ vLink ) ; ob_start ( ) ; require_once ( 'chat_begin.html ' ) ; echo $ sMessages ; require_once ( ' chat_end.html ' ) ; return ob_get_clean ( ) ; } } ?>
inc/login.inc.php
<? // class SimpleLoginSystem class SimpleLoginSystem { // variables var $ aExistedMembers ; // Existed members array // constructor function SimpleLoginSystem ( ) { $ this ->aExistedMembers = array ( ' User1 ' => ' d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4 ' , ' User2 ' => ' d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4 ' , ' User3 ' => ' d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4 ' ) ; } function getLoginBox ( ) { ob_start ( ) ; require_once ('login_form.html ' ) ; $ sLoginForm = ob_get_clean ( ) ; $ sLogoutForm = ' < a href= " '.$ _SERVER [ ' PHP_SELF '].'?logout=1 " > logout</a >' ; if ( ( int ) $_REQUEST [ ' logout ' ] == 1 ) { if ( isset ( $ _COOKIE [ ' member_name ' ] ) && isset($_COOKIE [' member_pass ' ] ) ) $ this ->simple_logout ( ) ; } if ( $_REQUEST [ ' username ' ] && $ _REQUEST [' password ' ] ) { if ( $ this->check_login( $_REQUEST [ ' username ' ] , MD5 ( $_REQUEST [' password ' ] ) ) ) { $ this ->simple_login($_REQUEST[' username ' ] , $ _REQUEST [' password ' ] ) ; return ' Hello ' . $ _REQUEST [ 'username ' ] .

Good luck !
It is the latest in a series of public indecency cases against foreigners
A couple caught by police in Dubai allegedly having sex in a car have won an appeal against their conviction .
The newly - wed couple from Pakistan had been sentenced to one month in prison and deportation for public indecency .
The Dubai appeals court overturned the ruling on the grounds that the officer who peered through their car 's blacked - out windows had breached their privacy .
The case is the latest in a series of incidents in which foreigners have broken Dubai 's strict decency laws .
Police arrested the 28 - year - old man and his 24 - year - old wife in May 2009 , accusing them of having sex in a vehicle in a car park at the Jumeirah Beach Residence .
Police twice attempted to peer inside the vehicle , and when they eventually knocked , a naked man rolled down the window , the court heard .
The couple 's lawyer , Majid Al Kabban , argued successfully that this was a breach of human rights and a violation of his clients ' privacy .
He argued that the car was a private place , and what the pair did behind the darkened windows did not violate the emirate 's strict public indecency laws .
Mr Kabban said : " We 're definitely happy and a little bit surprised .
Usually this type of thing goes in a different way . "
Georges Pirard is de gepensioneerde die meermaals de krantenkoppen haalde als de zg offerblokkendief .
De mainstreammedia marginaliseerde hem natuurlijk en schilderde hem af als een oude dwaas .
Maar dat was buiten het vws gerekend .
We waren nieuwsgierig naar het echte en volledige verhaal en daarom zochten we hem op en lieten hem zelf aan het woord .
Deze post is trots gesponsord door JomJudi online malaysia casino .
Alle inhoud op deze website is om de beste & details - analyse van de website te maken .
Dank je .
Op maandagavond 13 februari trok ik naar Anderlecht om Georges Pirard te ontmoeten .
Onderweg , op bus 49 richting Zuidstation , vroeg ik me af of hij er wel zou zijn .
Ik stapte af , zocht de straat en zag een aantal bleke , reusachtige flatgebouwen .
Hier moest het zijn .
Ik had even moeite zijn naam te ontdekken tussen de vele bellen die er naast elkaar stonden in de hall .
Maar uiteindelijk viel mijn oog op de juiste knop en ik belde twee keer .
Georges wist eerst niet wie ik was , maar toen ik zei : `Le Syndicat du Quatrième Monde´ , klonk hij zeer enthousiast .
“ Kom maar snel naar boven ” , zei hij helemaal opgemonterd , en dat is wat ik dan ook deed .
Met zijn kruk kwam hij de deur opendoen en liet mij binnen .
Er werd een zetel voor mij vrijgemaakt om te zitten en Georges begon te praten , honderduit , zoals zijn gewoonte is .
Maar dat wisten we al .
Opnieuw maakt hij een bilan op van zijn inkomsten en uitgaven .
“ Mijn pensioentje bedraagt 679 euro en ik moet er 545 betalen voor huur ( 250 ) en andere kosten ( gas , elektriciteit , dokter , ea ) .
Ook de prijzen van de voeding zijn precies nogal gestegen sinds de invoering van de euro .
Ik ben geen individu dat anderen aanvalt of kwaad berokkent , ik ga geen `sacochen´ pikken of iemand pijn doen .
Ik probeer gewoon geld te halen uit de Vlaamse offerblokken , want in Wallonië en Brussel is er nagenoeg niks meer te halen , ze kreperen daar al genoeg ” .
“ Ergens in juni verleden jaar , op een zondag , zat ik in het kerkportaal in Lommel met mijn karton waarop geschreven stond `VOOR ETEN AUB´ .
Een priester kwam eraan , ik herkende hem aan zijn kruisje , en nog iemand , die later de koster bleek te zijn , en ze joegen mij daar weg .
Daarna ben ik , ja het is waar , een beetje uit wraak , terug de kerk binnengegaan en heb er iets uit de offerblok gehaald , ik heb daar niemand kwaad mee gedaan , het is het geld van de armen , toch ?
De pastoor heeft naderhand de politie gebeld , maar ik werd dus dezelfde dag nog vrijgelaten .
Op het proces kwam die pastoor nog eens zijn reputatie van zogezegde `dienaar van Christus´ redden door te zeggen dat het niet waar is , dat hij me niet had weggejaagd , en dat de straat van iedereen is .
Dat is echter gelogen , ik stond niet op straat maar zat in het portaal .
Ik leef al enkele jaren zo , omdat ik ook al jaren een pijnlijk einde van de maand beleef ” .
Er zijn nogal wat tegenstrijdige berichten verschenen in de krant .
Hoe oud bent u nu precies , Georges ?
“ Ik ben officieel nog 78 jaar , maar zal op 20 februari 79 worden .
Maar hier in België zeggen we : ik ben in mijn 79ste jaar , vandaar de verwarring ” .
Waar bent U geboren en wat was vroeger uw beroep ?
“ Ik ben geboren in Brussel en mijn beroep was schoenmaker .
Dat kwam omdat mijn moeder vroeger hoedjes maakte met vogeltjes erop , en roosjes , zoals in de oude tijd , weet je wel .
Mijn vader was ook kleermaker , dus het lag wel een beetje in de lijn van de verwachtingen , dat ik ook zoiets zou worden .
Ja , die goede oude tijd .
De Vlaamse boeren gingen toen nog vaak op klompen naar de mis , geverniste klompen dan wel , niet de klompen die ze in de stal droegen natuurlijk ( lacht ) .
Er reden nog stoomtreinen en mijn moeder ging in 1927 met zo´n trein naar Verviers .
Daar had mijn oom een klein schoenatelier waarmee hij zijn brood verdiende .
Ik ben niet lang naar school geweest .
Natuurlijk ben ik naar de lagere school geweest , zoals iedereen , en ik heb daarna ook nog twee jaar Koninklijk Atheneum gedaan .
Maar toen brak de oorlog uit en de Duitsers bezetten de school .
Toen was het voor mij afgelopen , ik heb vervolgens een beroep geleerd : dat van schoenmaker .
Maar dat beroep bestaat nu niet meer , helaas , maar tegenwoordig kun je als je schoenen kapot zijn beter nieuwe kopen dan ze te laten maken .
Dat is vaak goedkoper ”
Hoe bent u dan terug in Brussel beland , als u het vak van schoenmaker leerde bij uw oom in Verviers ?
“ Tja , het is een minder leuke periode geweest .
Het was tijdens een zomer , in 1950 als ik me niet vergis , dat ik terug in Brussel stond .
Ik was getrouwd het jaar ervoor , maar mijn huwelijk heeft maar drie maanden geduurd .
Ik had de verkeerde vrouw getroffen , ze ging haar geld verdienen op manieren die ik niet kon appreciëren .
Daarna heb ik echter een andere partner gevonden met wie het beter ging , gedurende jaren .
Ik had in dat jaar van mijn terugkeer een gemeubeld studiootje gehuurd , want ik had op dat moment niks .
En toen ben ik als zelfstandige altijd voor eigen rekening blijven werken , zo kon ik overleven , het was een goede tijd .
Hoe komt het eigenlijk dat U op een gegeven moment in de problemen geraakte ?
“ Het fatale jaar was voor mij 1992 , dat was het jaar dat ik mijn pensioen ging trekken .
Ik had mijn atelier verkocht .
Op 13 mei 2000 komt mijn partner echter ten val , en ze belandt in een Frans hospitaal in Brussel .
Ze is daar 11 maanden gebleven , ze schreeuwde van de pijn .
Ze zei op een gegeven moment : “ Georges , ik geloof dat het tijd is dat we een beslissing nemen .
Ik heb nu genoeg geleden , laat me alsjeblieft gaan ” Op 30 maart 2001 is ze dan uiteindelijk overleden .
Maar alsof dat nog niet erg genoeg was , dat ik alleen kwam te staan , moest ik ook nog alle rekeningen betalen .
Die van het hospitaal bedroeg zo´n 142.000 Belgische frank , daar kwam de begrafenisondernemer nog eens bij met 68.000 Bfr. En 15.000 Bfr. voor een grafsteen .
En dan was het nog niet eens een `chique´ begrafenis met de rode loper en een dure kerkdienst , nee hoor , het was maar heel gewoontjes , zo goedkoop mogelijk .
Om een lang verhaal kort te maken , mede door al deze extra kosten was ik in 2001 geruïneerd .
Ik zat helemaal aan de grond en mijn bankrekening stond zelfs nog 6.000 Bfr. onder nul .
Dat was op 30 maart 2001 , Een zwarte dag in mijn leven .
Toen Marie - Rose er nog was , konden we immers netjes leven .
Met onze twee pensioenen samen trokken we zo´n 50.000 Bfr per maand .
Dat was genoeg , mijn vriendin was boekhoudster geweest bij een bank ( Geoffrey´s ) .
Maar toen ze er niet meer was had ik nog 22.000 fr. aan pensioen en moest alles alleen betalen en had een negatieve bankrekening .
Ik kon niet verhuizen want ik moest de waarborg respecteren .
Toen ben ik voor het eerst in de offerblokken gaan vissen , om dat negatief saldo kwijt te raken ” .
Georges , waarom precies in kerken , hoe kwam je op het idee ?
“ Goede vraag ” , roept hij uit ( Georges leeft even helemaal op ) .
In 2001 zat ik wat verdrietig op een bank in een park ergens in Brussel na te denken over wat ik nu moest doen , hoe het nu verder moest .
Er kwam een meneer naast mij zitten die me geld vroeg , omdat hij aan de grond zat .
Ik antwoordde dat ik hem helaas niet helpen kon , dat ik zelf ook niet meer wist van welk hout pijlen maken .
En toen vertelde die man een verhaal , hij legde me uit hoe ik het moest doen , dat ik kon gaan `vissen´ in de kerk .
Geen vissen , maar centen ” .
En bent u dat toen zelf gaan doen , zomaar direct ?
“ Nee , de persoon uit het park toonde me zelf met een vouwmeter en plakband hoe ik het precies moest doen .
Ik dacht : `dat is het , Georges , de oplossing voor je probleem .
Op die manier hoef je niemand pijn te doen , niemand te kwetsen´ .
Ik heb toen een paar dagen geoefend met de vouwmeter en de plakband , eerst in een paar kerken in Brussel , daarna verderop .
De eerste oefening bracht misschien vijf of zes frankskes op , meer niet .
Maar later ging het wat beter , toen ik me wat beter `gespecialiseerd ´ had ( lacht weer ) .
In 2002 had ik wel even schrik .
Toen hebben ze de euro ingevoerd en ik was bang dat die euros niet gingen blijven plakken .
Maar dat bleek heel goed mee te vallen .
Ik kon ze er op dezelfde manier uithalen als de frankskes , het ging zonder problemen .
Vanaf het moment dat de euro was ingevoerd , bracht het kwantitatief ook iets meer op .
Als je nu een stuk van twee euro opvist , is het meteen al 81 frank , en een stuk van 0.50 is twintig frank .
En een euro is veertig frank .
Vroeger kon je daar soms lang voor vissen , omdat de munten beduidend minder waard waren ” .
Zijn er U nog andere dingen opgevallen bij uw `vispraktijken´ ?
“ Ja , St. - Antonius is vooral op dinsdag goed voorzien , want dat is zijn feestdag .
Dan gaan alle vrouwen zijn voeten aaien in de kerk , en ze steken dan gemeenlijk wel iets in de offerblok .
Wat me ook is opgevallen is dat de Nederlandstaligen een tijdlang hun kerken gesloten hielden .
Nu gaan ze weer open , maar het zijn die camera´s die me erbij gelapt hebben .
Die camera´s zijn echt wel gevaarlijk , ze hangen die aan het plafond om ook de offerblokken goed in de gaten te houden .
Ja , zo ben ik eigenlijk tegen de lamp gelopen , door die camera´s .
Een echte inbreuk op de privacy vind ik het .
Wat me ook is opgevallen , is dat de kerk in Tremelo , bij pater Damiaan , gewoonlijk ook goed voorzien is .
En de Onze - Lieve - Vrouwen kennen ook nog heel wat aftrek .
Vooral de offerblikjes bij de kaarsentafel .
Voor een noveenkaars vragen die pastoors gemakkelijk 4 à 5 euro´s , dus je kunt het je wel voorstellen .
Ik ben niet katholiek , ik ben eigenlijk een afstammeling van de Hugenoten ( protestanten , gereformeerden ) die tijdens de 17de eeuw in de Bartholomeusnacht door de katholieken zo erg vervolgd werden ” .
Hoe staat u nu tegenover uw daden ?
“ Ja kijk , het zit eigenlijk zo , ik ben verplicht om het te doen omdat ik anders vaak geen eten heb .
Neem nu kardinaal Danneels , die krijgt misschien 9 miljoen per jaar , dat is nu 25.000 euro maal negen , dat is 225.000 euro per jaar .
Maar schrijf die mens geen brief om iets te vragen , want dan heeft hij zogezegd niks .
Ik ken persoonlijk een priester die me toevertrouwde : “ Ik geloof er allang niet meer in , maar ik doe mijn job zoals een andere bediende of werkman ” .
Soms haalde ik 120 - 130 euro per dag uit de offerblok , maar dat was alleen maar toen ik mijn schulden moest betalen .
Dat is dus echt niet vaak gebeurd , en nu doe ik dat ook niet meer .
Ik pak alleen wat ik echt nodig heb , ik ben geen dief en ook niet hebzuchtig ingesteld .
Zo kon ik stilletjes verder vissen , op mijn gemakske , om mijn eten en mijn electriciteit te betalen .
Nu is het nog maximum 20 euro per keer , en ik ga niet alle dagen hè .
Héél soms zit er eens in briefje in de offerblok , maar dat is maar zelden .
Omdat ik niet meer nam dan ik strikt genomen nodig had , kon de pastoor het ook niet echt merken , want hij vond altijd nog geld in zijn offerblok ” .
Tijdens het interview fluit er een vogeltje in een kooi .
De vogel maakt veel kabaal .
“ Ja ” , zegt Georges , “ ik heb een vogeltje , en hij zingt heel schoon , ik wou alleen dat hij het tijdens dit interview wat minder hard zou fluiten .
Gelukkig eet hij niet veel . ”
Hebt u zich al schuldig gevoeld over het gebeurde ? “
Nee , ik voel me niet schuldig .
Jezus zegt : maak geen beelden , de katholieken knielen echter voor beelden en dat is afgoderij .
De protestanten doen dat niet , de joden en de moslims ook niet ” .
Werd u al eerder betrapt ?
“ Ik had altijd mijn paternosterke bij , en deed alsof ik zat te bidden , vooral als er weer een aantal van die vrouwen in de kerk zaten .
Omdat ik de bus gratis kon nemen , kon ik zowat overal geraken .
Ik ging graag op bezoek in Vlaanderen , want daar zijn ze rijker als in Wallonië .
Maar nu word ik een gepensioneerde offerblokschuimer .
Als ik niet gefilmd was en minder aandacht had gekregen in de media , dan kon ik nog onopgemerkt blijven .
Maar nu is dat niet meer mogelijk , en er hangen ook overal camera´s , en dat is een grote inbreuk op het privé - leven van de mensen .
Ik ben er niet gerust in .
Ik ben nu zelf zo bekend als Barabas bij de passie van Christus ( lacht ) .
De tronie van Eichmann zullen ze misschien al vergeten zijn , maar mijn gezicht kan iedereen zich vandaag nog herinneren ” .
“ Voor de zaak in Lommel ( dateert al van juni ) moest ik op 3 januari voorkomen .
Ik kreeg mijn uitnodiging om te verschijnen voor de rechtbank in Hasselt dan nog op 27 december , een weekje ervoor , en u moet rekenen dat nieuwjaar daar nog tussenviel .
Ik had op dat moment nog geen advocaat .
Ik verstond in Hasselt niet alles , in Leuven heb ik daarna wel een vertaler gevraagd ( mij zullen ze niet meer hebben )
Ik zal dus denkelijk nog eens moeten voorkomen voor de andere feiten , maar dat zal dan ook pas over een half jaar zijn of zo , het gerecht is zo traag .
In Hasselt werd ik veroordeeld tot een half jaar gevangenisstraf , maar die hoef ik niet uit te zitten , voor een half jaar sluiten ze je niet direct op , dan moet je minstens een jaar hebben ” .
Wat is er dan precies gebeurd in Tremelo ? “
“ In Tremelo werd ik gewoon opgepakt bij de bushalte .
Een politieman had me herkend , doordat ik in de media was gekomen in de dagen ervoor .
Hij heeft zijn collega´s geroepen .
Ik had nochtans niks gepikt op dat moment , dat kon ook niet , temeer daar de pastoor de offerblokken al had leeggemaakt .
Er was een getuige gevonden die mij herkend ´ had , maar ik had echt niks gepikt .
Toch werd ik meegenomen naar de politiepost van Tremelo .
Ik had mijn vouwmeter helaas wel nog bij .
Ze wilden mij laten onderzoeken om te zien of er aan mij geen steekje loszit .
Ik heb vier dagen in de gevangenis gezeten in Leuven , maar niet bij de criminelen .
Ik zat in een kamer alleen en de cipiers waren heel vriendelijk voor mij , dat geef ik toe .
Er waren er zelfs vrouwelijke bij ” , zegt Georges met een lachje .
“ Ik moet me nu iedere dag opnieuw gaan aanbieden bij de politie van Anderlecht .
En ik ga ook zowat dagelijks naar het OCMW in een poging om mijn zaken te regelen .
Men kan mijn pensioen uiteraard niet verhogen , maar zij zouden wel in de toekomst wellicht iets gaan bijpassen , omdat ik met dit pensioen ook echt niet kan rondkomen .
Momenteel kan ik mijn medicamenten niet fatsoenlijk innemen , omdat ik ze niet kan betalen .
Normaal gesproken zou ik nu Zyrtec moeten nemen tegen mijn allergie , maar bij gebrek eraan heb ik nu de hele dag jeuk , wat zeer ambetant is .
Nee , ik ben niet geamuseerd , ook al lach ik veel .
Maar ja , wat moet je anders , ik kan ook niet huilen .
Ik ben geen kleptomaan , ik moest het echt wel doen om te kunnen eten .
Het is dus niet zo dat ik er plezier in schep om centen uit offerblokken te stelen , liever nog dan dat zou ik willen dat ik het niet nodig had .
Ik doe alleen maar wat er in de H.Schrift staat ” .
En dan begint onze Georges weer aan een uitgebreide anekdote , opgesmukt met bijbelcitaten .
Ook al is hij geen praktiserend gelovige , hij kent er echt wel iets van .
Hij vertelt over de Bijbel en wat erin staat alsof hij hem zelf geschreven had .
En zo komt er dan weer een verhaal , beginnend bij de paus , over de katholieke kerk , over Jacobus , de broer van Jezus en stichter van de Ebionieten ( joodse christenen ) , en eindigend bij Adam en Eva , en zo staat hij weer terug aan het begin .
Die kranige , humoristische , oude maar geestelijk zeer heldere Georges , ik denk dat het niet mogelijk is om niet van hem te houden als je eenmaal zijn verhaal gehoord hebt uit zijn eigen mond .
Ik besluit dat het dan ook genoeg is met dit lange interview en gun die man verder een rustige avond en een goede slaap .
En zo vatte ik de tocht aan , terug met de trein naar Limburg , maar de stem van Georges zou nog lang naklinken in mijn oren .

Nice work if you can get it
This piece by Paul Campos makes the point , not for the first time , that Elena Kagan ’s public record is so thin as to make it impossible to guess how she might decide as a Supreme Court judge .
While this question is important , another strikes me .
How does someone whose vita contains “ three scholarly articles , two shorter essays , two brief book reviews , and two other minor pieces ” , and who had apparently never appeared in a courtroom before last year , get to be Dean of Harvard Law School and then US Solicitor - General [ 1 ] ?
Even confining myself to law journals and popular pieces on legal topics , I could match that track record .
I once even exercised a quasi- judicial function in my career as a regulator , which is more than Kagan has done .
In view of Kagan ’s apparently inevitable promotion , can I put myself forward as her replacement ?
I guess the Harvard gig is already taken , but I ’m sure I ’d be a great Solicitor - General .
All my friends say I ” m “ brilliant ” , and have “ many remarkable qualities ” .
Some will even go as far as “ scrupulously fair - minded ” .
fn1 . For comparison , here ’s the publication list for Kathleen Sullivan , reputedly the runner - up for the S - G job .
Federal prosecutors in Detroit are willing to let a fourth Midwest militia member leave jail until trial on conspiracy and other charges .
Spokeswoman Gina Balaya ( Ba - LIE '- uh ) says Kristopher Sickles of Sandusky , Ohio , will be brought to court Wednesday for his release with an electronic monitor and other restrictions .
He 's been in custody since late March .
The 27 - year - old Sickles is one of nine people charged with conspiring to commit sedition , or rebellion , against the government .
Three other members of a southern Michigan - based group called Hutaree were released from jail Tuesday .
Prosecutors are satisfied they wo n't have much freedom while being electronically monitored .
Until this week , the government had firmly opposed the release of any of the nine .
The once mighty Jordan River , where Christians believe Jesus was baptised , is now little more than a polluted stream that could die next year unless the decay is halted , environmentalists say .
The famed river " has been reduced to a trickle south of the Sea of Galilee , devastated by over - exploitation , pollution and lack of regional management , " Friends of the Earth , Middle East ( FoeME ) said in a report .
More than 98 per cent of the river 's flow has been diverted by Israel , Syria and Jordan over the years .
" The remaining flow consists primarily of sewage , fish pond water , agricultural run-off and saline water , " the environmentalists from Israel , Jordan and the West Bank said in the report to be presented in Amman on Monday .
" Without concrete action , the LJR ( lower Jordan River ) is expected to run dry at the end of 2011 . "
The river - which runs 217 kilometres from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea - and its tributaries are shared by Israel , Jordan , Syria and the West Bank .
In 1847 , a US naval officer who led an expedition along the river described navigating down cascading rapids and waterfalls .
Today the Jordan is a brackish stream barely a few metres wide .
A couple of kilometres south of the Sea of Galilee - which is actually a lake - a dam cuts off the flow of the river .
Just south of the dam , raw sewage gushes from a pipe .
" This is what is today the source of the lower Jordan River , " FoeME director for Israel Gidon Bromberg said .
" No - one can say this is holy water .
No - one can say this is an acceptable state for a river this famous worldwide . "
A few metres away , saline water - diverted from salt springs to protect the nearby lake - flows into the foaming brown mess .
About 100 kilometres downstream , a Russian clad in a white robe immerses himself in the river at a site in Jordan where many Christians believe Jesus was baptised .
Every year , thousands of pilgrims take the plunge in the biblical river despite alarmingly high pollution .
Israeli , Jordanian and Palestinian communities along the lower Jordan River - about 340,000 people in all - dump raw sewage into the river .
Ironically , if the sewage stops flowing into the river , which Israel plans to do on its stretch , the damage could be even greater unless additional measures are taken to reduce the salinity of the water .
FoeME believes the solution lies in releasing huge amounts of fresh water into the river .
The Jordan once had a flow of 1.3 billion cubic metres a year , but now discharges only an estimated 20 million to 30 million cubic metres into the Dead Sea .
" A new study we commissioned reveals that we have lost at least 50 per cent of biodiversity in and around the river due to the near total diversion of fresh water , and that some 400 million cubic metres of water annually are urgently needed to be returned to the river to bring it back to life , " said Munqeth Mehyar , FoeME 's Jordanian director .
Israel , Syria , Jordan must all return water to the ailing river , the report says .
It says Israel , having diverted the largest share and being a developed nation , should return a proportionally higher percentage of water .
Better management could save Israel 517 million cubic metres of water a year and Jordan 305 million cubic metres , part of which could be allocated to the Jordan River , the environmental group says .
Improving the flow of the Jordan River would also go a long way towards saving the Dead Sea , which is in turn withering rapidly .

We were all blown away by Jay Pavlina 's epic Flash - based Super Mario mash - up , but it 's only a portion of what the talented programmer had planned for the game .
In an interview with GameXplain , Pavlina reveals that there were a couple more characters he intended to include in the game , which were cut mostly due to time constraints .
" ... originally there were nine characters , and I ’d really like to get these characters in at some point if possible .
The other three characters were going to be Ryu Hayabusa from Ninja Gaiden , Luigi , and the SOPHIA battle tank from Blaster Master .
I also considered the guy from Bionic Commando . "
Pavlina also revealed that he has even more ambitious plans for the future , and that he 's not limiting himself to 8 - bit games .
" Actually , what I released is an unfinished version of the game , or sort of like a demo version .
If everyone knew what I was really planning , I think they ’d freak out even more .
But I just released this version because I was going a bit insane from working on it for so long without anyone playing it , so it was sort of a necessity for me to let people play it and get some feedback .
As long as I do n’t get sued , you can expect more stuff like this from me . "
We 're actually surprised Pavlina has n't been sued yet , but hopefully Nintendo will look at his game as a loving tribute , and not bring in the dreaded lawyers to kill the project .

Daniel Pink explains why people are motivated to do demanding cognitive work – such as software programming – for free .
The science indicates that it has to do with our deep need for purpose , mastery , and autonomy that overshadows money as an incentive in certain situations .
The video makes a powerful argument that a society set up for contribution to the common good may suit us better than one that assumes we are rational self - maximizers .
The video is based on Pink 's new book , Drive .

ARCATA – The use of the drug LSD , or commonly referred to as “ acid , ” appears to be increasing especially among young adults in Arcata , according to an Arcata Police Department press release issued yesterday .
On April 18 , officers responded to a residence to assist the Arcata Mad River Ambulance with a 31 - year - old male subject who had just castrated himself .
Medical personnel and officers were unable to locate the subject ’s testicles .
He later told officers that he flushed them down the toilet as he feared they contained “ monsters . ”
The victim , who police say had a Tennessee address , was with several friends when he began to experience negative feelings .
He was dropped off at the Jay Street residence , to which Arcata Police responded at 4:18 p.m. that day .
“ We just thought it was an isolated incident , ” said Police Chief Tom Chapman .
He said calls to aid people having a bad experience with LSD or psilocybin mushrooms are “ not uncommon . ”
But a flurry of subsequent incidents represent an unusual surge in LSD - related calls for service .
On May 8 , a 21 - year - old male subject took LSD and wandered away from his residence .
He left his shoes , adequate clothing , and cell phone behind and did not tell anyone where he was going .
He wandered around the forest for days while concerned friends and family looked for him .
He eventually returned a couple days later .
On May 9 , officers responded to the Mad River Hospital to assist with a combative 19 - year - old male subject who was undergoing “ flashbacks . ”
The subject had ingested LSD two weeks ago .
Today , officers found him standing in the field being held by three friends who were attempting to get him into the emergency room .
The friends were requesting police assistance and wanted their friend to get help .
The officers detained the subject and held him for psychiatric evaluation by Humboldt County Mental Health .
Last night , officers responded to the 900 block of H Street where an 18 - year - old male subject , who was under the influence of LSD , was throwing himself on the ground in the middle of the street .
He was arrested and taken to jail .
Also last night , May 11 , officers from APD assisted officers from UPD arrest a subject who was under the influence of LSD .
Officers from the Arcata Police Department also had two additional contacts with unrelated subjects undergoing “ flashbacks . ”
Both were cared for by friends and family .
One subject was taken out of the area and back home by his family .
The Arcata Police Department would like to remind you that the effects of LSD are extremely unpredictable .
Many LSD users experience flashbacks long after initially using the drug .
It is difficult to determine how long the effects of the LSD will last .
The physical effects include dilated pupils , higher body temperature , increased heart rate and blood pressure , sweating , loss of appetite , sleeplessness , dry mouth , and tremors .
Some LSD users experience severe , terrifying thoughts and feelings , fear of losing control , fear of insanity and death , and despair while using LSD .
Some fatal accidents have occurred during states of LSD intoxication .

The virus was first recorded in Mexico in April 2009
As the 193 member states of the World Health Organization meet in Geneva , questions over the body 's handling of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic are high on the agenda .
Some medical experts doubt whether this was really a pandemic at all .
For several years before swine flu first surfaced in Mexico in April 2009 , WHO officials had been warning that a global influenza pandemic was simply a matter of time .
After major pandemics in 1918 , 1957 and 1968 , many flu experts believed another one was imminent .
Though the recent H5N1 bird flu virus had not developed the ability to spread easily among humans , it raised concerns that a new virus might do so .
" We have seen 40 to 50 million people die in a year in previous pandemics , " explained Keiji Fukuda , who is the WHO 's assistant director general , and its special adviser on pandemic influenza .
" These are huge numbers .
Our job is to get people prepared , it 's a huge challenge . "
So , even before swine flu emerged , the WHO supported member states in drawing up pandemic plans , including buying antiviral drugs , preparing mass vaccination campaigns , and developing procedures for banning public gatherings and closing schools .
By the time swine flu broke out , many countries had already introduced the plans , and some industrialised nations had even signed pre-contracts with the pharmaceutical companies to buy vaccines .
' Mild flu '
But even as the pandemic plans were put into action , doubts had begun to surface .
Dr Wolfgang Wodarg , a German doctor and former member of parliament , had been watching the spread of swine flu in Mexico City , and was puzzled at the reaction of the WHO .
Image caption Keiji Fukuda says the WHO 's job is to get people prepared
" What we experienced in Mexico City was a very mild flu , " he explained , " which did not kill more than usual - which killed even less people than usual .
" This was suddenly , a fast - spreading mild flu , a pandemic .
But this is not the definition of a pandemic I learned , which has to be severe , with a much higher than usual death rate . "
Others also had questions .
Tom Jefferson , a researcher for the international Cochrane Centre , the world 's leading independent assessor of medical interventions and medical research , claims that the WHO changed the definition of what a pandemic actually was just weeks before it declared one on 11 June last year .
" On 1 May the WHO 's global pandemic website had the old definition of an influenza pandemic , which included very large numbers of cases , complications and deaths , " he said .
" By 4 May that definition had disappeared and what remained was simply a new virus which spreads rapidly and infects very many people . "
Dr Jefferson also believes that the WHO advice put emphasis on the use of vaccines and antivirals , ahead of effective and inexpensive measures like hand - washing .
' Potential pressure '
The WHO has struggled to offer clear answers on the question of its definition of a pandemic , partly because of its policy of keeping the identity and the deliberations of its pandemic emergency advisory committee secret .
The only known member of the committee is its chairman , Australian flu specialist John MacKenzie .
Really the only people to benefit were the pharmaceutical companies Paul Flynn , British MP
WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said names of those on the sitting committee had not been made public because of the potential " for bringing undue pressure on them when they are making decisions which have societal and economic impacts " .
The lack of transparency in its decision making process , together with the WHO 's advice to countries to begin widespread vaccination against swine flu , has led some observers to suspect undue influence from the pharmaceutical industry .
Looking at the balance sheets of the pharmaceutical companies it is clear that many did make a healthy profit out of swine flu .
Vaccine producer Novartis , for example , posted an 8 % jump in profit in 2009 .
The company 's annual report cites swine flu vaccine sales as a major reason for the increase - though such a profit is , of course , not proof of any undue influence by the firm .
European enquiry
These medical products have cost national health budgets billions .
France , for example , spent over 600 m euros ( $ 739 m , £ 515 m ) on 94 million doses of vaccine , most of which have not been used .
" Who benefited from what happened ? " asked British Labour Member of Parliament Paul Flynn .
" Really the only people to benefit were the pharmaceutical companies .
I 'm not saying I 'm drawing any firm conclusions , but there are legitimate questions here . "
We received phone calls from government ministers telling us to ship them more vaccine , and quicker Andrin Oswald , Novartis
Mr Flynn and a number of other European politicians have launched an official inquiry into the pandemic at the Council of Europe .
A key question will be whether the pharmaceutical companies , which had invested around $ 4bn in developing the swine flu vaccine , had supporters inside the emergency committee , who then put pressure on the WHO to declare a pandemic .
But Andrin Oswald , head of vaccine production at Novartis , says he does not think the company 's influence is " too great " .
He says company officials interact in a " natural process " with the WHO , which supplies the firm with the virus for the vaccine .
" I do n't think that is influencing , that is working together to ensure that we do something that is reasonable for public health . "
He adds that any pressure over swine flu came from governments desperate to buy the vaccine , rather than from producers keen to sell it .
" We received phone calls from government ministers , " he recalled , " telling us to ship them more vaccine , and quicker .
Some even threatened us that if we did not do so it might affect our future business in that particular country . "
Pandemic planning
Governments , of course , were under pressure to buy the vaccine because the WHO had declared swine flu to be a full " Phase 6 " pandemic .
Here again , the WHO 's decision is questioned , from a somewhat surprising source - Dr Klaus Stoehr , who until three years ago was in charge of the WHO 's pandemic preparedness , and the man who drew up the influenza plans .
Image caption Contracts for swine flu vaccines agreed in 2009 boosted drug firms ' profits
" The pandemic planning I was involved with was always based on a severe public health event , " he explained .
" Moving to Phase 6 meant that we wanted governments … to kick in their plans whether they thought it was urgent or not . "
" I personally think that moving to Phase 6 that early was , in hindsight , not needed . "
Dr Stoehr believes that , over the course of last summer , after a Phase 6 pandemic was declared , the WHO failed to read the signs about swine flu coming from the southern hemisphere winter .
" In July and August the Australia and New Zealand national influenza centres were indicating the southern hemisphere outbreak was mild , " he said .
" Virologists , myself included , thought well , it 's not so likely that this virus will become more severe . "
" At the end of August the WHO website was still calling the virus severe .
I personally would have thought there could have been more assessments , and more advice to governments . "
The WHO has now launched its own review of its handling of the pandemic , a review the organisation claims is independent .
" The World Health Organization has done wonderful work over the years in eliminating diseases , " insisted British MP Paul Flynn .
" It 's a body we all greatly respect , and we need it . "
" The great danger now is that the trust in the organisation has been undermined , and that will help no - one . "

A GRENADA man with two severed human heads in a bucket walked into a precinct station and presented his haul to horrified police .
The 32 - year - old , whose name was n't released , was detained when he entered the Grenville station late yesterday ( local time ) .
He has yet to be charged , said police spokesman Troy Garvey .
Investigators released few details about the grisly slayings in St Andrew parish , but said the man is a suspect .
Mr Garvey did not say if there were other suspects or a motive for the killings .
Police later found two hacked - up , headless bodies in a rural field , including the owner of a local tavern .
Prime Minister Tillman Thomas , who is also national security minister , called the beheadings an " indescribable act " that underscores the need for a " structured approach to anger management " .
" This is a tragedy not just for the people of St Andrew but for all of Grenada , " Mr Thomas said today .
The beheadings have shocked islanders in the Caribbean country of 91,000 who are accustomed to crime reports of robbery and theft .

GOMA , CONGO — The United Nations issued a direct , public appeal to Canada Tuesday , asking for the country 's help with the international peacekeeping operation in the troubled Democratic Republic of the Congo .
The challenge to Canada to step up was echoed repeatedly by residents in Goma on a day when Governor - General Michaëlle Jean arrived amid tight security as violence rose in regions of the country .
A possible UN pullout at this critical stage has soldiers , civilians , and men and women of Goma fearing a wholesale withdrawal will leave people at the mercy of vicious armed groups hiding in the jungle .
Christian Manahl , the UN deputy administrator overseeing operations in the eastern Congo , was blunt with Canadian reporters after meeting Jean at the UN compound here on the shores of Lake Kivu .
He outlined progress on the ground , but quickly added there was an important role for Canada .
“ Definitely logistics , mobility , and intelligence are the key issues where we felt more would be needed , ” Manahl said .
He also said the UN mission in Congo needs more money to boost its peace - building efforts .
He said another $ 5 million to add to the $ 4 million available .
Some of that support may well be on the way .
It is widely expected here Canadian Gen. Andrew Leslie will get the nod from Ottawa and members of the Security Council to take over command of the UN mission in Congo , and will bring with him up to 100 top - level officers to support the mission .
The question swirling around political circles in Canada is whether the Stephen Harper government will back Leslie with Canadian troops , effectively redeploying soldiers from Afghanistan where Parliament has set a mid-2011 deadline to begin a pullout .
Jean pointed Manahl to Canadian reporters .
“ I think that Canadians need to understand what 's happening here , how it 's progressing , what the challenges are . ”
Goma is at the crux of the battle to stabilize this nation , where armed conflicts fuelled by tribal and ethnic rivalries and competition for the country 's mineral wealth are estimated to have left more than 5 million dead in the aftermath of successive wars .
A heavy UN presence is visible throughout the city : at the airport , at public plazas where light - armoured vehicles are posted ; and in the streets where pickup trucks filled with blue helmeted soldiers on patrol .
Manahl and others say Goma is more secure than last year .
There are more joint military operations with UN and Congo troops to flush out rebels across the region ; disarmament efforts are drawing foot soldiers out of the jungle and weakening the militias ; and people once again walk Goma 's streets , even at night .
The big dangers lurk over a vast territory outside Goma .
Helicopters are needed to move troops more quickly because roads are little more than rutted dirt paths through the bush that leave civilians vulnerable to attack , and batter even the hardiest of UN vehicles .
“ Mobility and intelligence ; in these two areas , certainly , a contribution would be most welcome , ” Manahl said .
“ As we reduce troops , we have to be more mobile . ”
A wholesale withdrawal is not on yet on the table .
But the UN — faced with demands by Congo 's president to start packing up the mission — will draw down 2,000 of 20,500 troops , likely by June 30 , the country 's 50th anniversary of independence .
The wrench in any withdrawal is the active presence of violent armed militias .
The jungles of the Kivu provinces are home to the brutal FDLR , a Rwandan rebel group which counts many of those involved in the Rwandan genocide in its ranks .
Manahl said Canada should help in dismantling the exiled leadership of the group .
At least one of its members is known to be seeking asylum in Canada , he said .
“ We know where they are and we know who they are , ” said Manahl , adding their arrests are key to dismantling the militia .
Last year , Germany was the first country to arrest two leaders of the FDLR on its territory for war crimes committed in the Congo .
Manahl is , however , cool to integrating any more armed groups into the patchwork army that is the Congolese national armed forces , or FARDC .
Instead , a big effort needs to be made to repatriate them to Rwanda or integrate them as civilians .
“ Congo needs a better army , not a bigger army . ”
As long as the FDLR remains active , large swaths of this region remain “ no - go zones , ” local journalists say .
If the UN troops leave , “ all the country would be a no - go zone , ” said Jules Ngala Wamona , a Goma - based reporter for Radio Okapi , a UN - sponsored network .

A bemused blue - helmeted peacekeeper from Malawi on guard outside Jean 's working lunch raised an eyebrow when told Canada has 12 soldiers posted to Congo , working to train the Congolese national army and strengthen the military justice system .
“ There should be more , they should come here , ” he said .
Malawi has deployed 160 to secure the UN compound in Goma .
UN , Congolese and Canadian RCMP bodyguards kept close to the governor - general as she arrived at the Goma airport , boxing her in as she moved past a group of singing and dancing women – survivors of rape of different ethnic origins - who waved and smiled at her .
Honoriné Kabuo was among them .
There were no helicopters to come to her aid nine years ago in the early days of the UN mission .
Still , Canada played a small part in rescuing the 35 - year - old , and giving her the means to live .
A clothes vendor , Kabuo , her family and a group of others were attacked in 2001 by uniformed rebels as they walked through the bush towards Goma .
Some in Kabuo 's group escaped , to return three days later to find her barely alive .
“ They killed my husband and my son , ” she said through translators who interpreted her tribal language into Swahili , then to French .
The knife - wielding soldiers slashed Kabuo 's neck , shoved fingers into her vagina , where they yelled she had hidden money .
“ Then they raped me .
Four of them . ”
Her tormenters stabbed her in the belly , her uterus protruded , and she fell unconscious , bleeding .
When finally found and brought to Heal Africa , a hospital that treats victims of sexual violence for their physical and psychological wounds , Kabuo learned she had been impregnated by her rapists and infected with HIV .
She gave birth to a daughter , now 8 , also HIV - positive .
“ At first it was hard to love her , ” she admits
Counselling – under a program supported by aid from Canada which also teaches craft skills - taught her that “ the child is not a sin , the rapist committed the sin . ”
“ Ushindi ! ” Kabuo grins when asked her daughter 's name .
“ It means victoire — victory .
Sentimental , ” she says .
But her smile broadens , “ I got out of the bush to come here to get help .
I won .
I 'm still alive . ”
Watching Jean come to Goma , Kabuo was ecstatic .
“ We did n't know Canada , ” says Kabuo .
“ Now we 've seen each other eye to eye . ”
Jean , she says , puts a face to Canada 's name , and means more help will come .

Gary Coleman has died at 42 , RadarOnline.com is first to report .
Coleman had been hospitalized in Provo , Utah since Wednesday , May 26 , after suffering what his family called “ a serious medical problem . ”
As RadarOnline.com previously reported , Coleman had slipped into a coma and was on life support after suffering an intracranial hemorrhage .
He was pulled of life support Friday morning and later passed away .
His wife Shannon Price and her father were at the hospital Friday .
The Illinois native ’s death marks the end of a long , sad road for the diminutive Diff ’rent Strokes star , who struggled professionally and financially as his fame and fortune diminished since the show went off the air in 1986 .
Coleman ’s growth was hampered at a young age by a congenital kidney disease caused by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , as he never grew beyond 4 feet , 8 inches tall .
Twice having undergone kidney transplants in 1973 and 1984 , Coleman required daily dialysis in his everyday life .
Coleman got his break in acting when caught the eye of TV icon Norman Lear , which eventually paved the way for him to star in Diff ’rent Strokes as Arnold Jackson , a wisecracking runt adopted with his brother Willis ( Todd Bridges ) by a rich New York businessman ( Conrad Bain ) .
Coleman ’s considerable charisma — buoyed by his catchphrase “ What ’cu Talkin Bout Willis ” — made the show a ratings winner in its ’ first three years , as the young actor was earning as much as $ 70,000 an episode at its ’ peak .
EXCLUSIVE : Mystery Fan Revealed : Utah Businessman Posted Bail For Gary Coleman
Coleman would wind up suing his parents in 1989 over missing money from his trust fund , and was awarded more than $ 1 million in 1993 , but the money would not last , as he would wind up declaring bankruptcy six years later .
Coleman said in an appearance on Geraldo Rivera in 1993 that he had twice tried to overdose on sleeping pills .
Gary Coleman Hospitalized
Coleman got some publicity in later years when he threw his name in the hat of the circus that was California ’s 2003 recall election , receiving more votes than other show biz candidates such as porn star Mary Carey and Gallagher , en route to an eighth overall finish to eventual winner Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Coleman ’s death marks another sad chapter for the Diff ’rent Strokes cast , as Bridges ’ career was stunted by frequent drug incidents , while Dana Plato , who played Kimberly Drummond on the show , committed suicide via pill overdose in 1999 .
On a related note , Plato ’s son , Tyler Lambert , fatally shot himself in May 2010 , nearly eleven years to the day of his mother ’s suicide .

The renowned primatologist and conservationist on the need for scientific empathy , the impact of economic development , and why children give her hope for the future .

Laura Sevier :
The list of endangered species around the world is growing .
There is often a sense of hopelessness and doom and gloom surrounding conservation .
In your latest book Hope for Animals and Their World you take a more hopeful approach by emphasising the positive .
Is this designed to inspire conservationists around the world not to give up in the face of so much adversity ?
Jane Goodall :
It 's to try and give hope to the young aspiring biologists so that they do n't get persuaded to do something different - because everybody 's telling them that what with climate change and everything we 're certainly heading for ecological collapse .
I do think we are reaching a point of no return - but we have n't got there yet .
And the point is , we can't predict the future .
For all we know , half the human population on the planet might die of some terrible new disease .
We just do n't know .
LS : The United Nations declared 2010 to be the International Year of Biodiversity .
What needs to happen on a wide scale for wildlife to be protected ?
Or is it a case of species by species as you show in the book ?
JG : Somehow we have to wake people up .
What I 'm concentrating on is youth .
My youth programme , Jane Goodall 's Roots & Shoots ( for young people of all ages from pre-school through college ) is about giving people hope .
I think it 's criminal not to give children hope because they are born with hope and we have to nurture that .
Also children are brilliant at changing the behaviour of their parents .
Of course it's also necessary to work with decision makers and legislators and teachers but it is working with children that gives me the greatest hope .
LS : What are the main obstacles conservationists face trying to save species from extinction ?
JG : Bureaucracy is one of them .
I have talked with many biologists who have a clear idea as to what should be done to save a species from extinction , but they have to go through trials and tests to get proof .
And while they do this , precious individual animals are dying and the overall situation getting grimmer .
Another major obstacle is the constant battle with economic development .
Yet another is the lack of understanding of the general public .
LS : How can we persuade people to care about ' creepy crawlies ' or species considered to be dangerous such as wolves and crocodiles ?
JG : Probably again through their children .
I do n't think there 's a recipe you can spread out to say ' this is what you can do to change people 's minds ' because people are so different .
Often it is really hard .
Overall , though , I 've found that the best way for me to change people 's attitude is by telling stories .
If you can find a story to illustrate how a tiny seemingly insignificant bug can contribute to the health of an eco-system , then that gets through to people .

With all the Steamy conversation about gaming on non-Windows desktop platforms going on , we thought you might care to peek at a little OpenGL performance comparison review .
As the chief cross-platform API , it 's the only way we 're going to be seeing the latest games running natively on Mac OS and Linux , but how will that experience compare to the market leader ?
As it turned out , Windows maintains superiority in this field , with frame rates that were habitually above those on the latest Ubuntu and well ahead of what you might get on Mac OS 10.6.3 .
It 's still early days -- after all , Steam 's non-DirectX cupboard is pretty bare right now -- but at this point in time , OpenGL gaming is a crown that Microsoft retains with relative ease .

It ’s far from the Joaquin Phoenix you ’re used to seeing onscreen : snorting cocaine , ordering call girls , having oral sex with a publicist , treating his assistants abusively and rapping badly .
And not , apparently , playing a role — or was he ?
Even after seeing the documentary “ I ’m Still Here : The Lost Year of Joaquin Phoenix ” in a private screening earlier this week , film buyers still are n’t sure of its genuineness .
Was the “ Walk the Line ” and “ Gladiator ” star , who said more than a year ago that he was quitting acting to become a musician , playing a sophisticated prank , or did he really ditch his Oscar - nominated career to become a disheveled rapper ?
Agents at William Morris Endeavor , the sellers of the Casey Affleck - directed film , have started showing the movie to potential distributors , and while some were apparently interested in bidding for “ I ’m Still Here ’s ” distribution rights , the shoppers left the screening perhaps even more mystified by Phoenix ’s behavior than when they walked in .
Several buyers said the film overflowed with Hollywood debauchery , including more male frontal nudity than you ’d find in some gay porn films and a stomach - turning sequence in which someone feuding with Phoenix defecates on the actor while he ’s asleep .
The documentary — or is it a mockumentary ? — also includes Phoenix ’s infamous appearance on “ The Late Show With David Letterman , ” in which the bearded and bloated actor barely spoke , leaving Letterman bewildered if not infuriated and people wondering about Phoenix ’s mental health .
The buyers , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said Phoenix comes off unsympathetically and shows very little talent for music in the movie , directed by his brother - in - law ( Affleck is married to Summer Phoenix ) .
Sales agent WME declined to comment .
In some scenes in the film , the 35 - year - old Phoenix is trying to get Sean “ Diddy ” Combs to produce Phoenix ’s rap album , but the hip - hop impresario is not terribly interested .
Another sequence shows Ben Stiller approaching Phoenix about starring in writer - director Noah Baumbach ’s “ Greenberg , ” but Phoenix is barely interested .
Two buyers who saw the movie were unsure if Phoenix had turned out an elaborate piece of performance art , where the joke was really on the audience .
While they were debating the film ’s commercial prospects , the buyers did agree on one thing :
They ’d never seen anything like it .
Was it all a prank ?
Or is Joaquin Phoenix serious ?

When ingested , from a purely organic food source or Body Biotics ™ Bio-Identical SBO Probiotics Consortia™ , they help to replenish your natural friendly flora and restore a healthy balance between “ friendly versus unfriendly ” gut bacteria .
This rebalancing triggers a host of other health benefits to support better digestion , improve nutritional absorption , enhance the immune system , and much , much more . [ 1 ) *
Best of all , BSBOPC ™ are a team of naturally - occurring friendly soil born organisms which are cultured , together with other beneficial Lactobacillus strains , in their native ancestral Prebiotics plant matter and are FREE of chemicals , toxins and GMOs .
This Bio-Identical SBO Probiotics Consortia™ “ Super - strain of 8 species ” are an “ exact or similar match ” to your gut ’s memory of these various bacteria from nature that were once common place in our daily diets of “ farm to table ” organic foods .
* Unlike some Probiotic forms which are isolated friendly species which have been removed from their natural environment , cultured individually , then grouped back into a packaged blend ; BSBOPC ™ are custom cultured to match and replace the friendly bacteria strains that have gone missing from our food source .
BSBOPC ™ allow your body to easily metabolize them so you receive the broad spectrum of dynamic health benefits nature intended .
*
What are the benefits of BSBOPC ™ ?
Bio-Identical SBO Probiotics Consortia™ offer 22 natural ways to bring your gut flora back into balance , boost the immune system , and trigger various natural metabolic activities to help alleviate symptoms of chronic discomfort .
( 2 ) * Why do I need BSBOPC ™ in my daily diet ?
Scientist report 80 % of immunity is housed in the intestines , our primary site for practically every disease .
Nutrition assimilation , hormone production , energy regulation , hunger , production of happiness chemicals , and much more , all are controlled and / or composed by this master regulator organ that researchers have recently started calling the ‘ second brain ’ .
These friendly soil born organisms were a gift from nature which acted as a natural buffer to safeguard and maintain a healthy intestinal microbiome balance .
When SBOs are ingested on a daily basis from a diet of purely organic foods , or a Bio-Identical SBO Probiotics Consortia™ , such as Body Biotics™ , these mighty microbes are helpful to our overall well - being , not only by providing numbers of friendly bacteria but more importantly , by providing a complex communication signaling network which confer a variety of health benefits to the human body .
This signaling is , by far , one of the most critical health benefits available only from a SBO Probiotics Consortia .
Without this signaling network , Probiotics are merely numbers of units , with limited health benefits compared to those intended by nature . ”
Around the end of the 19th century the introduction of pesticides , herbicides , and other chemicals into food processing quickly diminished the “ farm to table ” ingestion of raw fruits and vegetables which contained these life - sustaining organisms .
The trade - off of killing unwanted pests was that we also killed off the friendly soil born bacteria that benefited our digestive tract and our immune system , paving the way for today ’s auto - immune diseases and extensive gut related health issues .
Today , 99 % of the foods we buy at the grocery store simply DO NOT contain these friendly organisms .
To understand more about BSBOPC™ , we rely on the late Professor Lee Dexter who spent her entire life in the world of microbiology .
Holder of several patents derived from her knowledge of soil bacteria , Prof .
Dexter also identified and catalogued more than 600 species of SBOs with the USDA − far surpassing all other researchers , worldwide .
In her article titled : “ The Safety and Efficacy of Bacillus sp. as Probiotics , ” March , 2010 , she wrote : “ … A specialized area , called spore Probiotics , offers certain advantages when used in combination with other non-spore forming Probiotics , such as , Lactobacillus sp .
In nature , Bacillus sp. are usually found in conjunction with other Probiotics as part of stable symbiotic groups of bacteria called “ consortia . ”
Consortia are assemblages of microorganisms , in which each organism benefits from the metabolic activities of others −in the group .
Such naturally - occurring consortia are known to be quite stable during transfer from one culture to another , and to retain their functional integrity better than single ( isolated ) organisms or blended combinations of single ( isolated ) species .
During growth these naturally - occurring consortia produce their own matrix that surrounds the living cells , and they reach an ideal balance between each species … . ” [ 1 ) * Observing SBOs in nature as “ a group ” is key to understanding what is required to mimic nature in such a way as to create a Bio-Identical SBO Probiotics Consortia into a nutritional supplement .
In this published study by Heyman , et al. , 2002 and Husebye et al. , 2001 , they report : “ … Probiotic bacteria influence the metabolism and well - being of the gut and of the whole body through a variety of mechanisms , which scientists are finding to be more complex than originally thought … ”
“ … These bacteria communicate with the body and the immune system through the epithelial cells of the gut wall using a complicated system of messenger chemicals … ” [ 3 ) *
Professor Dexter summarizes that : “ … Probiotic organisms are thought to have four basic mechanisms of action … ” [ 3 ) * ‘ … They prevent the build - up of waste materials and toxic compounds in the colon by either blocking their formation or by breaking toxins and waste materials down into harmless molecules that can be easily eliminated … ” [ 2,3 ) *
in the colon by either blocking their formation or by breaking toxins and waste materials down into harmless molecules that can be easily eliminated … ” [ 2,3 ) * “ … They inhibit the growth of organisms that are harmful to humans by either secreting antimicrobial substances , or by blocking the ability of the harmful organisms to adhere to or puncture the gut wall … ” [ 2,3 ) *
by either secreting antimicrobial substances , or by blocking the ability of the harmful organisms to adhere to or puncture the gut wall … ” [ 2,3 ) * “ … Through fermentation , they secrete helpful compounds that nourish other cells ( such as those in the colon or liver ) , alter the colonic environment , or serve as signals to communicate with the immune system . )
These compounds may include vitamins , antioxidants , enzymes , bioactive peptides , organic acids , and polysaccharides … ” [ 2,3 ) *
( such as those in the colon or liver ) , alter the colonic environment , or serve as signals to communicate with the immune system . )
These compounds may include vitamins , antioxidants , enzymes , bioactive peptides , organic acids , and polysaccharides … ” [ 2,3 ) * “ … They exhibit strong antioxidant activities , which include the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species , chelate metal ions such as iron and copper , inhibit the formation of the enzymes that create reactive oxygen species , and reduce oxidants … ” [ 2,3 ) * What are SBOs ( Soil Born Organisms ) ?
SBOs ( Soil Born Organisms ) are microorganisms that originate in the soil , where they prevent bacterial and fungal overgrowth , provide nutrient uptake and help produce mineral rich soils which are critically important to growing healthy organic foods .
SBOs also crowd out unfriendly organisms that lead to plant disease .
An important biological advantage of SBOs is their ability to survive cold , heat and drought .
In nature , SBOs can lay dormant for long periods of time regardless of how harsh the environmental conditions .
And , when the miracle of nature once again produces the right conditions ; they spring to life , reconstitute , multiply , and thrive .
Think of a dried up pond after an extended drought .
It appears the algae has all died and disappeared , but in truth , it is simply dormant awaiting the rains to return when once more the pond will be teaming with living algae and other vegetation .
Harnessing this “ miracle of nature ” is the secret behind the wide range of unique health benefits offered by Body Biotics ™ Bio-Identical SBO Probiotics Consortia™ encapsulated in its ancestral Prebiotics plant matter .
Benefits , such as , their ability to : Prevent harmful bacteria and fungi from colonizing the gut ( 2,3 ) *
Help overcome bloating and gas ( 2,3 ) *
Balance colonic pH and set the stage for restoring immune health ( 2,3 ) *
Increase resistance to harmful bacteria and fungi ( 2,3 ) *
Increase intestinal absorption of nutrients ( 2,3 ) *
Supply the building blocks to activate our own natural digestive enzyme production ( 2,3 ) *
Enhance gut metabolism and promote normal bowel function ( 2,3 ) *
Trigger our own national production of antibodies to boost the immune system ( 2,3 ) *
Bond with heavy metals to flush them from our system , and ( 2,3 ) *
Provide an intricate communication and signaling network to remind the body to perform certain jobs it may have become sluggish in performing or forgotten how to do ( 2,3 ) *
This biological miracle which allows Body Biotics ™ to be so uniquely different and effective , has also made it difficult over these years to explain to our consumers why we do not list the number of Colony Forming Units ( CFU ) on our product .
These next few paragraphs should help to clarify this .
What are Colony Forming Units ( CFU ) ?
The concept of Colony Forming Units ( CFU ) being worthy of importance was first introduced in 2002 , when the US FDA and World Health Organization recommended that “ the minimum viable numbers of each Probiotic strain at the end of their shelf - life ” be reported on labeling … ” [ 2 ] “ … but most companies that give a number report the viable cell count at date of manufacture , a number probably much higher than existing at the moment of consumption …. ” [ 4 ]
“ … CFU numbers in and of themselves have little to nothing to do with the potency or efficacy of a Probiotic ... ” [ 1 ) *
CFU generally refers to a mass of individual cells of the same organism , growing together .
CFU is used as a measure of the number of microorganisms present in or on the surface of a sample after they are incubated at some suitable temperature for a number of days .
The colonies that form are then counted to enumerate the available CFU numbers at that moment in time .
However , according to one top ranking North American laboratory , “… THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION to this standard form of testing … ” “ … CFU is NOT a proper measure for individual cells or spores as a colony may be formed from a single or a mass of cells or spores ... ” [ 5 ]
This last statement is critical to understanding the dynamic nature of Body Biotics™ .
If we were to enumerate the CFU numbers on our label , you would be more than impressed .
However , since we know that the term CFU has “ little to nothing ” to do with the actual efficacy of a Probiotic , we chose not to use this term .
Instead , we hope to offer our consumers a broader , deeper understanding of the biological nature and wide range of health benefits available to them from a “ natural ” SBO Probiotics Consortia™ .
The same kind of SBOs which originated in the soil and once protected us through our daily consumption of organic “ farm to table ” foods .
BSBOPC ™ are dormant , alive and thriving in their own natural Prebiotics ancestral food source .
They DO NOT have a finite number .
When activated with water or juice , these “ alive and thriving ” organisms , trained in nature to withstand the harshest of environments , awaken and begin immediately to multiply .
*
Therefore , listing a CFU amount on the Body Biotics™ label would be inaccurate and misleading .
Each individual will experience a multiplication of the number of organisms in one capsule of Body Biotics ™ based on several important factors : Current condition of the gut : a pH balanced friendly gut welcomes this new addition , whereas , a hostile unfriendly gut immediately fights back against the friendly invaders .
A war literally begins in an effort to crowd out the unfriendly bacteria and recreate a health balance between the two .
( This battle may cause some mild discomfort until the new addition of friendly bacteria take on more and more territory along the GI tract ) * Dietary habits : unfriendly bacteria feed on sugars , starches , and carbohydrates .
Cutting back or eliminating these altogether , while eating more green leafy vegetables , helps speed up the rebalancing of the gut .
* Type and amount of water consumed daily : drinking 60 - 80 ounces a day of purified ( non-chlorinated / non - fluorinated ) water is critical to rebalancing the gut .
As the unfriendly bacteria die - off and putrefaction is lifted from the gut wall , you must have enough water to remove these from your system .
Kind of like flushing the toilet , waste must be removed to keep from repopulating the unfriendly environment .
* Alcohol and tobacco consumption :
Not that you ca n’t have either , just remember , they will limit the multiplication number of each capsule .
So cleaning up the gut and recreating balance may take longer to get the results you are striving to achieve .
They still work great , just not as fast .
* SBOs were intended to be ingested every day of our lives from our organic food source .
If you are not eating a diet that is predominantly organic , you are missing a vital link necessary for you to maintain a strong immune system and keep your “ friendly versus unfriendly ” gut bacteria in check , as well as , a vast range of many other critical health benefits .
In Summary : BODY BIOTICS ™ Bio-Identical SBO Probiotics Consortia™ is one of the few known Probiotics that mimic nature so closely as to provide the full benefits of a true Probiotic .
Cultured and encapsulated in its own ancestral Prebiotics food source of humic and fulvic acids , which are billions of years old , extracted from deep within the earth to provide a pristine , GMO free , toxin free , chemical free , nutrient rich host medium .
They are naturally dehydrated ( not freeze - dried ) , rendered dormant as in nature , and waiting to be ingested with an aqueous solution so they can , once again , thrive .
Once thriving , they provide the same bio-identical health benefits we used to enjoy before the introduction of harsh chemicals into our farming world in the mid-1950s .
BODY BIOTICS ™ has been marketed under several names during the past 37 years .
You may have known us as : Earth Flora™ , Natur Earth™ , Natur Zyme , or Nature ’s Biotics™ .

A man in Boulder — yes , my home town — is trying to meditate the oil leak away .
His idea ?
" The basic concept is to try and get as many people to visualize that the valve is actually functioning and is working and closing . "
This is part of the Intention Experiment , what is basically telekinesis :
Lynne McTaggart , who started the Intention Experiment , has organized more than a half dozen mind - over - matter experiments — most recently to try to improve the water quality in Lake Biwa , Japan — that involve people focusing their thoughts on something in the physical world to make change .
She claims to have scientific evidence that it works .
Scientific evidence ?
Really ?
I wonder if she ’s interested in making a quick million bucks .
Look , we ’ve seen this before .
People have prayed for rain , and tried to pray the stock market into obedience .
These efforts fail , always .
Or at best they might coincidentally align with some event , but it ’s never clear in advance just what event they were aiming at ( making it easy for them to claim success after the fact ) .
I know that people who believe in this sort of thing have their heart in the right place .
I ’m frustrated by horrific events like the oil leak too , and I wish I could do something tangible .
But trying to pray it away wo n’t work .
One believer said this :
" I completely understand that most people would have a healthy skepticism about these things , " said Jahnavi Stenflo , also of Boulder , in an e-mail .
" To all those skeptics , I would simply ask them to participate in the exercise if they would like to try .
…
Ultimately , there is nothing to lose in trying to visualize the valve shutting off .
It either will help or it will not . "
These " What ’s the Harm ? " arguments are extremely misleading .
Of course there is something to lose .
This kind of thing has been tested over and again , and shown to be a waste of time .
The time spent by the participants is one obvious thing lost .
But more than that , what we lose when we do things like this is our ability to separate fantasy from reality .
And we do know quite a bit about human behavior : people who will try to meditate the oil leak away will almost certainly not conclude meditation does n’t work when it fails .
Instead they ’ll find excuses why it did n’t work , and try it again next time something happens .
The more we wish for something to be true , the more we must hold it up to scrutiny lest we fool ourselves .
I am not saying things like this should n’t be tested .
The point is , they already have been .
Repeatedly .
And they never work .
If this oil leak is to be stopped , it ’ll have to be done using engineering , using science , using actual physical work .
And at the moment there ’s not much you or I or anyone outside of the engineers at BP can do to help .
However , I ’ll add that thinking about the problem is important .
When the root causes of the leak are found — and I do n’t mean the physical problems , but what failures allowed the situation to arise in the first place , both in the company and in the political environment — we need to make sure that it does n’t happen again .
That means keeping up with the news , being aware of the situation , and contacting politicians so that they hear our voices about it .
That is where thinking makes a difference .
As the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continues to spread , Louisiana 's $ 2.5 - billion commercial fishing industry , which provides much of the country 's domestic shrimp and oysters , is bracing for a virtual shutdown that could trigger shortages and price hikes for consumers nationwide .
As an armada of fishing vessels are dodging the oil - covered waters , seafood distributors , restaurants and grocery stores across the nation are on edge as well .
In Southern California , supermarket chains such as Albertsons and Ralphs said they were closely monitoring the situation and were concerned about how serious the problem might become .
A spokeswoman for Whole Foods Market said it was prepared to find alternatives — just in case .

DETROIT -- Detroit Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch told 97.1
The Ticket 's Morning Show on Thursday that he asked general manager Ken Holland to become team president to make way for vice president Steve Yzerman to become the club 's GM , but Holland declined .
" Stevie Y wants to become a GM ; we 'd love to have him as a GM , '' Ilitch said .
" I keep telling Kenny , ' Hey , I want to move you up to president . '
He goes , ' I do n't want to be a president , I want to be a GM . '
So he 's going to stay there as GM . ''
Holland made it clear he is happy at his current post , which he has held since 1997 .
" I'm the general manager , I do n't have any interest in becoming president , '' Holland said .
" I 'm a general manager , that 's what I was hired to do . ''
Holland has one year remaining on his contract .
Club senior vice president Jimmy Devellano told Booth Newspapers last week that Holland and assistant GM Jim Nill will be signed to extensions after the playoffs .
Ilitch told the radio station that he's had " a lot of people call me and want to interview ( Yzerman ) .
He 's pretty much in demand right now . ''
Yzerman reportedly is
.
He interviewed last summer for the Minnesota Wild GM post that went to Chuck Fletcher .

Census takers targeted 113 times this month
By Ed O'Keefe
Updated 8:18 a.m. ET
More than 113 census takers have been the victims of assaults or attacks this month , the U.S. Census Bureau said late Wednesday .
In response to inquiries by Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - N.Y. ) , Census Director Robert Groves said the bureau 's temporary workers knocking on doors to collect information have faced 29 threats involving a gun , four robberies and three instances of being held against their will or carjacked .
Seven workers died in car accidents and one was killed while off duty .
The Census Bureau hired about 635,000 people to follow up with people who did not return questionnaires by the end of April .
The process is more than half completed , and is scheduled to continue into July .
Bureau officials said the overall pattern and types of incidents are similar to the 2000 census , but cautioned this year 's figures are already much higher than ten years ago and include a mix of news accounts and formal reports to the bureau 's safety office .
The incidents include a census worker carjacked by a 14 - year old and a California incident that resulted in the death of a woman .
Aides said Maloney requested the information to determine whether news reports were accurately reflecting a trend or merely focusing on a few incidents .
“ These acts of violence against census enumerators are tragic , especially when you consider these temporary workers were only trying to do their job making sure their neighbors are accurately and fairly counted in the Decennial Census , " Maloney said .
Twenty - one census workers died on the job between 1998 and 2009 , according to agency figures .
The attacks come as the agency announced stricter hiring rules on Wednesday after a registered sex offender using an alias got a job as a census taker .

Thanks Ron for giving me permission to put this up on undeadly .
When your goal is to create USB Flash Stick install media , the typical terse response of , " Just do a normal installation , " can be real frustrating without further explanation .
Part of the frustration is being told to make other install media ( floppy / CD ) to make the desired install media ( usb flash ) .
The trouble is , you 're essentially looking to create a problem where none exists , and worse , a detailed explanation like the one below might scare people away rather than show them how simple the suggested way of doing it is .
When you combine this with the normal standing against blind " How - To " recipes , we 'll be spending time going into the torrid details without gaining much of anything .
Let 's start with the suggested way to create a bootable USB flash stick as stated in FAQ .14 .
Do a normal installation of OpenBSD to your flash stick .
Copy the install set files to the device .
Copy bsd.rd to the root partition .
The result is you can both run the operating system from the stick and install the operating system from the stick .
To do an installation , at the " boot > " prompt type in " bsd.rd " and then do the installation normally .
As suggested in FAQ.14 , you can copy over the install set files for both i386 and amd64 so you 'll be able to install either from the same device .
There is endless debate regarding " wear leveling " issues on flash based storage devices .
If you get the wild idea to avoid the " wear leveling " by doing something weird , you will probably do it wrong , and the result will be an unreliable system .
Explaining why the above is the suggested best practice is where things start to get complicated .
The short answer is , a default installation process of OpenBSD contains a whole lot of know - how applied in an attempt to get things right .
More importantly , if it's not right , you want to find out about problems quickly , and having a full installation of OpenBSD gives you the best chance of figuring out if your hardware is reliable .
Even a very lengthy long answer would be incomplete , so if you want to understand all the details , you are better off reading the source .
Below will only cover some of the most basic aspsect of flash storage devices , and provide a less reliable answer to the qeustion of how to make bootable install media with them .
USB flash sticks are the modern equivalent of unreliable floppy diskettes .
Though flash devices often work , they are not as reliable as other storage devices like hard disks .
Similar can be said for Compact Flash , {mini , micro , pico , nano , femto , whatever}SD , supposedly SmartMedia , and all the rest of the related flash based storage devices , even including some of the Solid State Disks ( SSD ) currently available .
Part of the reliability problem is caused by the high - volume , low - cost , and poor - quality manufacturing of the devices and their components .
They are designed to be inexpensive and compatible with existing systems , but to achieve these goals , significant trade - offs were made .
Some would even say the trade - offs resulted in very poor design decisions .
The most obvious of these trade - offs is the fact flash devices are treated as " disks " by both the system and the software , when internally , they are very different from disks .
Another issue with flash storage devices is inconsistency .
Since flash storage devices are put together in countless different ways , and use countless different kludges to appear as " disks " to the system , having both the system and software treat them as disks is a risky proposition .
It does n't always work , and if you test enough devices , you 'll find some combinations of systems , software and devices which simply refuse to work .
When you 're talking about hardware so cheap that people give it away as advertisements at trade shows ( like 4 + GB flash sticks ) , the probability of it being good enough to work reliably is so close to zero it 's negligible .
Many of the flash sticks you own only seem to work correctly when you run fdisk ( 8 ) ( MBR partition table partitions ) , disklabel ( 8 ) ( filesystem partitions ) , newfs ( 8 ) , mount ( 8 ) , copy , move , delete and whatever , but often they fail miserably if you run fsck ( 8 ) on them or do any other serious file integrity checks ( e.g. cksum ( 1 ) ) .
Sadly , this is very common , and you have to be more than a bit strict to catch this kind of shoddy hardware .
The problems with flash storage devices are magnified by the way various systems boot also being horribly inconsistent within a single architecture .
Of course , this is magnified yet again due to the differences across multiple architectures .
Here 's a classic example .
If you take one of the floppy diskette installation images like " floppy 47.fs " and mindlessly dd( 1 ) the floppy image onto a USB flash stick , there are at least a few systems which actually can still boot from the resulting monstrosity .
The resulting USB flash stick has no fdisk partition table ( MBR ) , but since some rare systems are built to use USB - based floppy diskette drives ( e.g. some brands of laptops ) , they mistake the USB flash stick as being a floppy and continue to boot from it .
In this very messy situation , all possible " best methods " are bad , and suggesting anything is unwise .
The FAQ makes the suggestion it does only because it 's your best chance at getting things working in a reliable fashion .
If you insist on shooting yourself in the foot through manual attempts to make bootable flash sticks , below is the target practice yours truly did on his own feet .
First you want to read fdisk ( 8 ) and FAQ .14 , the set up your fdisk partition table and MBR
# fdisk - iy sd0
Writing MBR at offset 0 .
Next , you want to read disklabel ( 8 ) and read FAQ.14 again .
You 'll want to delete all the existing disklabel partitions and create a new " a " partition accepting the defaults so it covers the whole disk .
By default , the first " track " is skipped ( offset : [ 63 ] ) , even though tacks do n't actually exist on flash based storage .
# disklabel - E sd0 Label editor ( enter '? ' for help at any prompt ) > p m OpenBSD area : 63-4160835 ; size : 2031.6M ; free : 0.0 M # size offset fstype [ fsize bsize cpg ] c : 2035.0M 0 unused i : 2031.6M 63 MSDOS > d * > a a offset : [ 63 ] size : [ 4160772 ] FS type : [ 4.2BSD ] > p m OpenBSD area : 63-4160835 ; size : 2031.6M ; free : 0.0 M # size offset fstype [ fsize bsize cpg ] a : 2031.6M 63 4.2BSD 2048 16384 1 c : 2035.0M 0 unused > q
Write new label ? : [ y ] y
Next we toss a file system ( ffs ) on the new partition .
# newfs / dev/rsd0a / dev/rsd0a : 2031.6MB in 4160772 sectors of 512 bytes 11 cylinder groups of 202.47MB , 12958 blocks , 25984 inodes each super - block backups ( for fsck - b # ) at : 32 , 414688 , 829344 , 1244000 , 1658656 , 2073312 , 2487968 , 2902624 , 3317280 , 3731936 , 4146592 ,
And finally we do a quick test with fsck ( 8 ) to make sure things are working .
# fsck - fp / dev/rsd0a / dev/rsd0a : BAD SUPER BLOCK : VALUES IN SUPER BLOCK DISAGREE WITH THOSE IN LAST ALTERNATE / dev/rsd0a : UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY ; RUN fsck_ffs MANUALLY .
Lovely .
It seems we have a piece of junk , so unplug it and throw it away .
" But But But But But I do n't want to throw it away !!!! "
Seriously , you are far better off throwing it away and spending your time on more important things like making reliable hardware work for you .
" But But But But But ca n't fsck fix it ??? ? "
The only fair answer is , " maybe , " but this seldom works with flash devices , and even if it does seem to work at first , it may silently fail again immediately afterwards .
" But But But But But are you sure ??? ? "
Nothing is ever certain with flash storage devices , so if you insist on further target practice on your feet , you can try the following .
One of the tricks you can try is erasing the flash device entirely , but you need to realize the " erased state " for flash is when it is filled with all 1's .
People regularly make the mistake of filling flash based storage devices with all zeros ( as is typically done with real disks ) without every realizing what they are doing .
# tr ' \000 ' ' \ 377 ' < /dev/zero | dd bs =16384 of=/dev/rsd0c dd : / dev/sd0c : end of device 130241+0 records in 130240+0 records out 2133852160 bytes transferred in 714.616 secs ( 2986009 bytes/sec )
The above does n't consider what might be done to the input data of all 1's by the disk controller of the system , the usb controller of the system , or the super double secret flash controller on the device itself .
None the less , it 's as close as you 'll get to overwriting the whole device with 1's to put all the flash in the erase state .
From here , repeat the previous steps through doing your fsck test , but if it fails again , this time , just throw it away .
Assuming you were a bit more lucky than me and your device passed fsck , now it 's time to make the flash stick device bootable .
# fsck - fp / dev/rsd0a / dev/rsd0a : 1 files , 1 used , 967555 free ( 19 frags , 120942 blocks , 0.0 % fragmentation ) # mount / dev/sd0a / mnt # cp /usr/mdec/ boot / mnt # cp bsd.rd /mnt/bsd # /usr/mdec/installboot -v /mnt/boot /usr/mdec/biosboot sd0 boot : /mnt/boot proto : /usr/mdec/biosboot device : / dev/rsd0c / mnt / boot is 3 blocks x 16384 bytes fs block shift 2 ; part offset 63 ; inode block 24 , offset 936 using MBR partition 3 : type 0xA6 offset 63 # umount / mnt # fsck - fp / dev/rsd0a / dev/rsd0a : 3 files , 3047 used , 964509 free ( 13 frags , 120562 blocks , 0.0 % fragmentation )
One of the important things to note in the above is the use of installboot ( 8 ) to make the device bootable is only correct for some architectures .
Other architectures need to use disklabel ( 8 ) to properly install the first ( and if needed second ) stage bootstrap code .
Additionally , the second stage bootstrap loader , boot ( 8 ) , /usr / mdec / boot file in the example above can be arch specific .
Although I 'm yet to see the i386 boot ( 8 ) fail on amd64 , mixing and matching other archs will most likely make a real mess .
The minimal install set for i386 ( from a snapshot or release ) would be :
# l files / total 500060 drwxr-xr-x 2 root wheel 512 Mar 31 03:04:36 2010 ./ drwxr-xr-x 3 root wheel 512 Mar 30 15:48:38 2010 ../ -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 2162 Mar 30 15:48:52 2010 SHA256 -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 50551104 Mar 30 15:50:08 2010 base47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 7592844 Mar 30 15:49:56 2010 bsd -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 7616392 Mar 30 15:49:54 2010 bsd.mp -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 6304746 Mar 30 15:49:51 2010 bsd.rd -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 92648166 Mar 30 15:49:43 2010 comp47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 514498 Mar 30 15:49:21 2010 etc47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 2618018 Mar 30 15:49:19 2010 game47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 9463948 Mar 30 15:49:17 2010 man47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 364819 Mar 30 15:49:16 2010 misc47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 15550317 Mar 30 15:49:12 2010 xbase47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 70053 Mar 30 15:49:10 2010 xetc47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 39684757 Mar 30 15:49:05 2010 xfont47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 19879062 Mar 30 15:48:53 2010 xserv47.tgz -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 2946170 Mar 30 15:50:14 2010 xshare47.tgz

Without getting dangerously creative with newfs , a supposed " 256 MByte " flash stick will only give you roughly 235 MByte of usable space , so you 'll need something larger to hold the minimum install set files .
You 'll want to put the install sets in the typical directory ( e.g. /4.7/i386 / ) to keep from overwriting the kernel in / as well as make your life easy when installing from the device ( e.g. the default location where the installer looks for the files ) .
# mount / dev/sd0a / mnt # mkdir -p /mnt / `uname - r` / `uname - m`/ # cp files /* /mnt/`uname -r`/`uname -m`/
At this point , you should test the integrity of the files you just wrote to the flash stick as well as run fsck one more time .
# cd /mnt/4.7/i386 # for i in * ; do grep -e " ( $ i ) " SHA256 >> ../ sha ; done ; # cksum -c ../ sha || echo " FAILED !!! "

Congratulations !
You now have a supposedly bootable install media on a USB flash stick which might actually work for an unknown period of time with some , but not all , systems supposedly capable of booting some unknown percentage of USB flash devices .
Did I put enough weasel - words in the above statement to make you nervous ?
The simple method suggested in the FAQ of doing a normal installation and copying over the needed install set is a lot easier , is more reilable , and gives you more functionality .
You will still occasionally hit problems where particular USB flash sticks and particular systems are incompatible , but luckily , the flash devices are now cheap enough where you can just try another one .

Washington ( CNN ) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates says he will urge President Obama to veto a coming $ 726 billion defense authorization bill if it contains funding for unwanted projects Gates has been trying to cut for years .
Gates has been vocal about financial reform at the Pentagon , trying to rein in some big - ticket contracts and telling Congress to stop spending money on C - 17 transport planes that are not needed and a $ 485 million alternate engine for the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter ( JSF ) .
The JSF engine program -- already delayed and over budget -- could end up costing taxpayers billions of dollars , according to Gates .
But with jobs at stake , Congress has ignored those requests for years and continued to appropriate funds for the C - 17 and a second F - 35 engine .
" The detailed conditions they [ Congress ] have imposed on the overall JSF program would make it essentially un-executable and impose unacceptable schedule and budget costs , " Gates said Thursday at a Pentagon briefing .
" As I have stated repeatedly , should the Congress insist on adding funding for a costly and unnecessary JSF extra engine or direct changes that seriously disrupt the JSF program , or impose additional C - 17 aircraft , I will strongly recommend that the president veto such legislation , " he said .
The Pentagon believes the proposal for the new engine , made by General Electric , would end up costing about $ 2.9 billion which includes re-working the engine already being tested because there is concern it does not meet the performance needs for the F - 35 .
Those costs would be picked up by taxpayer dollars , according to Pentagon estimates .
Additionally the contract for the new proposal by Congress would require cutting the purchase of the current engine by half to let the General Electric engine purchase catch up , according to Gates .
" Only in Washington does a proposal where everybody wins get considered a competition , where everybody is guaranteed a piece of the action at the end , " Gates said .
" Yes , we 're in favor of competition , but my idea of competition is winner takes all , and we do n't have that kind of a situation here , " he continued .
The House Armed Services Committee passed the bill Wednesday .
The bill must be approved by the entire House then matched by a Senate version and signed by Obama before becoming law .
Newcastle United 's manager , Chris Hughton , will have to rely on free transfers and loan deals to build for life in the Barclays Premier League as the club cannot afford to spend money on new players .
A statement issued on behalf of the club 's board outlined their financial status and the news was not good .
They recorded an operating loss of £ 37.7 m for the financial year 2008 - 09 and are estimating a shortfall of £ 32.5 m for 2009 - 10 , while their £ 20 m overdraft is already committed .
They have now drawn up a five - year plan which they believe will enable them to break even by the end of the 2015 - 16 financial year .
That will mean no new capital outlay on players this summer after promotion from the Championship , meaning Hughton will have to generate his own funds or rely on free transfers and loan deals .
The statement , which also confirmed that Hughton will remain as manager amid speculation over his future , said : " It is clear to the board that no organisation can be successful until the financial position is stabilised .
" The board have therefore structured a five - year plan in which the ultimate goal will be to ensure that the club is run at a ' break even ' manner by the year 2015 - 2016 .
The first team squad that won the Championship this year will form the basis of the team for next season in the Premier League .
There is no plan for new capital outlay on players . "
The news will come as a blow to Newcastle fans , who had hoped Mike Ashley would invest in new players this summer , although the message coming out of St James '
Park for some time has been that there would be little cash with which to play during the close season .
Promotion could be worth as much as £ 60 m to the club but , having spent a season in the Championship with a wage bill which still amounted to more than £ 40 m , they have nothing left in the coffers for summer spending .
Sky 1 moves
Lost finale to 5 am on Monday , as a simulcast with ABC on the US west coast
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Sky1 is to broadcast the finale of Lost at 5 am on Monday 24 May , as a simulcast with ABC 's broadcast on the US west coast .
The unprecedented scheduling move aims to prevent illegal internet downloads of the finale – and save UK fans of the show from having to spend five days dodging web spoilers .
Sky1 was planning to transmit the two - and - a - half hour finale to the US drama in its normal 9 pm slot next Friday , 28 May , before today deciding to join broadcasters in six other countries in simulcasting the show .
ABC will broadcast the double episode , called The End , on Sunday night from 9 pm on the east coast – 2 am in the UK .
Sky1 's broadcast will be simulcast at the same time as the US west coast transmission , which is 5 am in the UK .
The End will also simulcast on Sky1 HD at 5 am .
Sky1 is to repeat the finale on Tuesday , 25 May , at 9 pm and again next Friday in its normal slot .
Broadcasters in Italy , Spain , Portugal , Israel , Turkey and Canada will also simulcast the Lost finale .
Stuart Murphy , Sky1 's director of programmes , said : " We are proud of the fact that at Sky1 HD we have a long tradition of running all of our US shows as close as possible to their US transmission date .
With something as hotly anticipated as the Lost finale , it makes sense to show it at exactly the same time as millions across America will see it . "

By Paul Bedard , Washington Whispers
Times are tough , especially among those still looking for good jobs , but Sen .
John Kerry does n't think Washington 's to blame .
In fact the former Democratic presidential candidate , concerned with the anger voters are aiming at Washington , says that his party and President Obama are doing a ship - shape job .
[ See which industries contribute to Kerry 's campaign . ]
" We 've come back , " he says of the nation , Wall Street , and the economy .
" This is an amazing resurgence . "
Kerry talked about the voter anger during a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor called to give him time to pitch his expansive climate and energy bill .
He was asked if he 's ever seen such anger with Washington , in part inspired by the Tea Party movement named after the Boston Tea Party in his home state .
[ Uncover the secrets of Congress by searching for your member . ]
With many expecting him to say no , the 26 - year Washington veteran said yes , citing the turbulent 1960s and the Watergate era .
" Yes , I have seen it , " he said , but while those were focused on the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon 's power grab , he said " I think this is less focused . "
It was n't a slam at the Tea Party movement and those upset at Washington as much as a frustration he feels that Congress and the president are n't getting the credit he thinks they deserve for pulling the country out of a second depression .
[ See a slide show of the 10 keys to an Obama comeback . ]
" I think there 's a comprehension gap , " said Kerry .
His point :
While people may not be feeling the benefits of the bailouts and healthcare reform yet , Congress has been working with Obama to right the economic ship .
Still , he sounded sympathetic to those kicked around by the economy .
" There 's a sense of some things unraveling " to them , said Kerry .
But he said that the D.C. - directed attacks are hypocritical , since many of those attacking Washington spending presumably want to keep their Social Security and Medicare and want Washington to play a big role in the Gulf Oil cleanup .
" There 's a huge contradiction on a daily basis , " he said .
Maybe , he concluded , the Democrats should change their communications strategy " to better sell what we 've done . "
See which industries give the most to Congress .
Kelly Cutrone , the uber - boss / mentor / reality show star ( The Hills , The City , and Kell on Earth ) can now add " author " to her bio .
Her new book , If You Have to Cry , Go Outside , offers no - bullshit advice on how to live your very own glam life .
Kelly Cutrone has long been mentoring women on how to make it in one of the most competitive industries in the world .
She has kicked people out of fashion shows , forced some of reality television 's shiny stars to fire their friends , and built her own company - one of the most powerful PR firms in the fashion business - from the ground up .
Through it all , she has refused to be anything but herself .
Kelly writes in her trademark style , combining personal and professional stories to share her secrets for success without selling out .
Let 's face it : this is a different world than the one in which our mothers grew up , and Kelly has created a real girl 's guide to making it in today 's world .
Offering a wake - up call to women everywhere , she challenges us to stop the dogged pursuit of the " perfect life " and discover who we are and what we really want .
Then she shows us how to go out there and get it .
Much of our culture teaches us to muzzle our inner voice and follow the crowd ; Kelly enables us to stop pretending and start truly living .
With chapters on how to find your tribe ( those like - minded souls who make your heart sing ) , how sometimes a breakdown is really a breakthrough , and how there is no such thing as perfection , Kelly also shares practical advice , such as how to create a personal brand and how sometimes you have to fake it to make it .
Raw , hilarious , shocking , but always the honest truth , If You Have to Cry , Go Outside calls upon you to gather up your courage like an armful of clothes at a McQueen sample sale and follow your soul wherever it takes you .
Whether you 're just starting out in the world or looking to reinvent yourself , If You Have to Cry , Go Outside will be the spark you need to figure out what you have to say to the world - and how you 're going to say it .
Cutrone works in an industry that is superficial and fickle , but she 's the real deal .

( Very Loud Asian Accent ) AaaaaaaaaaYAAAAAA !
Instantly before you appears the Kitchen Ninja , fast kung fu moves executed precisely culminating in a beautiful bow of reverance to you – The One who Loves Coffee .
A moment of silence between us …..
Without a sound ,
You hear Ninjaji speaking , but his lips do n’t move , his voice is inside your head saying ,
“ Dearest One , if you are to consume coffee into your body , make it the finest coffee you can find .
Search out and locate brewers and roasters who are concerned with where their coffee beans come from and how well the farmers are treated .
The Vibrations in your beans are born from those farmers , on that land – careful not to consume exploitation , suffering and resentment .
By purchasing your beans direct from the roaster you can save up to 1 /2 on your coffee .
Ninjaji recommends , since eating food is a major part of your life , to take the time to aquire the proper simple business papers that allow you to purchase wholesale food .
Dearest
One , now that you have your beans I wish to impart to you the importance of the water you use in your coffee .
Tap water is full of toxic chemicals and drug residues .
Aside from the harmful substances unintentionally and intentionally put into your tap water , it tastes like the pool at the local YMCA .
Do not dishonor yourself , nor your beans by consuming such vileness .
Dearest
One , heat your purified water .
Dearest
One , use whole beans and grind them into a powder of your liking with a coffee grinder .
Whole beans retain their energy and freshness far more than pre-ground beans .
You will receive more of the benefit this way .
Dearest
One , add those beans to the grinder , then add several beans from the Cacao .
Again , use whole bean Cacao .
The Cacao bean is what chocolate is made from .
It is extremely bitter on it ’s own , yet full of minerals and a substance known as theobromine which acts like caffeine in many ways , yet is not .
Dearest
One , grind these two substances until they are indistinguishable .
Dearest
One , take from your cabinet your organic coconut oil .
Place a small scoop into your french press .
Ninjaji Pauses and looks at you for a long time …. an inquisitive stare , searching your heart and soul …
Ninjaji ’s mind whispers arise again ” You do have a french press do n’t you ? ”
Ninjaji , with great compassion explains further ,
“ Dearest One , Get a french press . ”
The special moment blends back into the lesson on Ninja Coffee –
Dearest
One , after your scoop of organic coconut oil , add a splash of organic grade B maple syrup before pouring your pure hot water into the french press .
Lovely Coffee Drinker , listen close – Organic Whole Bean Coffee , Organic Whole Bean Cacao , Organic Coconut Oil and Maple Syrup – this secret Ninja Way helps to alkalize the coffee , add ’s additional nutrients as well as a full body and flavor that will make ( Ninjaji seems to struggle to even mindspeak the words ) staa , st , staaaa starbucks or dunkin do … dooo …. dooonuts coffee seem like distant bad dream .
Regathering his composure after having to place his attention on those dark things , Ninjaji sips from his own hand made clay cup , the divine Ninja Coffee he has shared before you here .
You hear a “ siiiip ” and as the last sound of “ p ” reaches your ear
Ninjaji has disappeared from view ,
Yet , you feel as if he is in your chest , kissing your Heart , saying , ” Be good to You ”
A report insuggests that some top content merchants are balking at converting their existing Flash - authored video to a more iPad - friendly HTML5 format .
The report says that both Time Warner and NBC Universal have told Apple that they wo n't rework their extensive library of content to accommodate Apple , which has banned Flash on its devices , and prohibited cross- platform tools from authoring content that will appear on its App Store .
The reason , the paper suggested , was that the recoding would be too expensive .
CBS , Fox News , and CNN have supported Apple 's efforts to a limited extent , the paper noted .
To date , Apple has attempted to use its clout and mystique ( with words like " magical " to describe the iPad ) to entice developers and content providers to port their content over to the iPad .
If the report is true , Apple 's strategy is n't working - or , more likely , the content kings are wondering if the investment to port their own content to the iPad platform makes sense .
Meanwhile , Apple sits on over $ 10 billion in cash .
Will Apple be forced to step in and facilitate the conversion process ?
One scenario might involve Apple stepping in and buying a startup that specializes in Flash - to - HTML5 video conversion , then open - sourcing the tools .
Problem is that I do n't know of one , offhand .
Any suggestions , readers ?
EDIT : " catcher " suggests LiveCliq , a service that performs conversion in the cloud .

The Conservatives warned that it could lead to disaster .
And the Labour Party could potentially use it to cling to power for a little while longer .
On Friday , Britain faced a hung Parliament for the first time since the 1970s , a situation in which no party has an overall majority and so cannot pass legislation without support from another party .
It is unclear how this relatively unusual situation will play out here , but there are a number of possibilities .
First , the Conservatives , who won the most seats , could try to form a coalition with one or more smaller parties .
The leading contender for that role would be the Liberal Democrats , lagging a distant third , who would relish the chance to play kingmaker but have been coy about how they would go about it .
BP knew of problems hours before blast
The Deepwater Horizon drill rig burns in the Gulf of Mexico , April 21 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- BP knew of problems with an offshore well hours before it exploded last month , spilling millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , a House committee chairman said Wednesday .
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , said the oil company told the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight privately that the well failed a key pressure test just hours before it exploded on April 20 .
The test indicated pressure was building up in the well , which could indicate oil or gas was seeping in and could lead to an explosion , said Waxman .
" Yet it appears the companies did not suspend operations , and now 11 workers are dead and the Gulf faces an environmental catastrophe , " he said , asking why work was n't stopped on the well .
" This is one of the key things the investigation is going to have to look at , " said Lamar McKay , chairman and president of BP America .
Witnesses before the panel , which included executives from the three primary companies working on the well - BP , Transocean , and Halliburton - said the course of events and actions leading up to the explosion is still under investigation , and will come to light over time .
BP 's deepwater oil well , 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana , is now leaking some 200,000 gallons of crude a day following the explosion that claimed 11 lives .
Lawmakers also wanted to know why a valve sitting atop the well , known as a blowout preventer , or a BOP , failed to close and avert the disaster .
" It is far too early to draw conclusions about how the incident occurred , " said Jack Moore , president and CEO of Cameron International ( CAM , Fortune 500 ) , the company that built the device .
" Our BOPs have a very long history of reliable performance , including performance in some of the harshest operating conditions in the world . "
Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich. , said the blowout preventer may have failed for four reasons : Modifications to it may have reduced the number of shears that can close the well ; a hydraulic leak may have knocked it out of commission ; it may have hit a section of pipe that was too thick to cut ; and its battery power may have died .
The executives said the blowout preventer is not designed to handle all situations , especially when it becomes clogged with debris from an actual explosion .
" I would think that your blowout preventer should be designed to handle that , " said Rep. Joe Barton , R - Texas .
Lawmakers also criticized proposed efforts to seal the well by injecting rubber debris down the top , including old golf balls and bits of tires .
" The American people expect a response on par with the Apollo Project , not Project Runway , " said Rep. Ed Markey , D - Mass .
Senate hearings
On Tuesday , hearings in the Senate focused on similar themes : what caused the well to explode , and why the blowout preventer did not work .
Three executives from the three principal companies working on the well all blamed each other .
BP ( BP ) , which owns the well and subcontracted the other companies to work on it , said it was Transocean 's job to ensure that the blowout preventer was functioning .
Transocean was the owner of the drilling rig that sunk , the Deepwater Horizon , and also owned the blowout preventer .
Transocean ( RIG ) said the blowout preventer worked just fine in tests , and that it may have gotten jammed with concrete or other well fluids that were injected by a third contractor , causing the well to explode .
Either way , argued Transocean 's president , it was the faulty well , not the rig or the blowout preventer , that ultimately caused the leak .
Halliburton ( HAL , Fortune 500 ) was the third contractor ; it injected cement and other well fluids into the hole before the explosion .
But a Halliburton exec said it was only following the orders of BP , which wanted a heavier fluid , known as mud , removed from the well before the well was capped with a concrete plug .
Some senators , citing a Wall Street Journal report , said this process of removing the heavy fluid before the concrete plug is installed is unusual in deep water drilling , and suggested it may have caused the accident by allowing the highly pressurized oil and gas to escape .
But Halliburton 's executive said the process was not out of the ordinary .
The Minerals Management Service , the federal agency that regulates offshore drilling , has also come under fire in the wake of the spill .
On Tuesday , senators wanted to know why there were n't other back - up systems in place to stop a leak besides the blowout preventer , and questioned why the blowout preventer may not have been able to cut through thicker sections of pipe to pinch it shut and stop a leak .
Lawmakers also questioned the agency 's relationship with the oil industry , which some have described as cozy .
The Obama administration announced plans Tuesday to split the agency in two , thus removing an apparent conflict of interest between the drive to maximize oil production and efforts to ensure safety , which could slow drilling down .
Under federal law , BP , as the lead project operator , is responsible for all clean - up costs associated with the spill .
While the subcontractors are thought to have some legal indemnification from BP and the federal government , lawyers say they could still be open to lawsuits from fisherman and others affected by the spill .
Ultimately , experts have said the total cost of the spill could range from $ 2 billion to $ 14 billion or higher , depending on when the leaking well is closed and where the oil washes ashore .
It 's time for Australia to fix its woeful record when it comes to female representation on public company boards .
Here 's some suggestions of which men should clear out to give the ladies some room .
With the markets tanking again and pressure mounting for Australia to fix its woeful record when it comes to female representation on public company boards , there is no time like the present to purge some of the long serving or poorly performing blokes in the directors ’ club .
It remains a complete disgrace that only 8.3 % of ASX100 directors are female , when studies show that board diversity tends to produce better results .
The solution is for all public companies to aim for at least two female directors , not just the single token woman who can then feel uncomfortably isolated .
I ’ve only been raising the issue of gender diversity at AGMs for six months , coinciding with the unprecedented push we ’re currently seeing involving various women ’s networks , along with the Australian Institute of Company Directors and the Business Council of Australia .
David Jones and Seek were both given a rocket on the same day at AGMs last November and within weeks had added new female directors .
Whilst we can all talk in generalities about statistics and principles , real change also requires some name and shame tactics and direct action .
I flew to Adelaide on Wednesday for the OZ Minerals and Adelaide Brighton AGMs because these two companies have never had a female director .
It was great to see the back of 76 - year - old Adelaide Brighton chairman Malcolm Kinnaird who retired at the end of the meeting and responded to the board diversity question by noting there was a lot of “ social pressure ” to appoint females .
Thanks for signing up

Adelaide Brighton is now looking for up to three new directors and let ’s hope incoming chairman Chris Harris , who has served with this all - blokes board for 15 years , gets with the program .
Here are some suggested resignations that could potentially create vacancies to be filled by many of the talented and under - worked women on this list which tracks the top 75 female directors in Australia .
David Ryan : still yet to be held to account as the long - time audit committee chair of ABC Learning , he should immediately resign as Transurban chair and a Lend Lease director .
Brian Jamieson : having just taken the chair at Sigma Pharmaceutical he is now over - committed .
Given the fiasco of OZ Minerals , an all - blokes board , that would be the appropriate position to quit .
John Stocker : being Donald McGauchie ’s surviving chief backer at Telstra and the now departed chair of Sigma Pharmaceutical he should quit all boards , including the struggling Nufarm .
Peter Ritchie and Murray Wells : have served for far too long on the Seven board and did n’t exactly cover themselves in glory during the recent $ 2 billion Westrac related party deal .
Ritchie predicted Seven shares would surpass the record high of $ 14.68 in 2008 .
Today they are at $ 6.50 , suggesting it paid too much to fix Kerry Stokes ’ $ 1 billion private debt problem .
Ken Cowley : News Corp director since 1979 who turns 76 this year and should stand aside so the Sun King can appoint a second female to the board , joining the 30 year old opera singer Natalie Bancroft .
Trevor Gerber : dreadful record at Valad Property Group , lead independent director of Macquarie Airports who championed the outrageous $ 345 million divorce payment to Macquarie and also chaired one of the dud Babcock vehicles .
Should be off all public company boards yet Risk Metrics has apparently supported his re-election at next week ’s MAP AGM .
Barry Cusack : still hanging around the Toll board despite all the disasters of Oxiana and OZ Minerals .
Toll has no female directors , so this 68 - year should shuffle off promptly to create a vacancy .
Donald Morley : Hugh Morgan ’s long - time finance director at WMC is approaching 70 and has done a poor job as the over - paid chairman of post box company Alumina for the past eight years .
Alumina , Toll Holdings , OZ Minerals , Newcrest and Orica and the five Melbourne - based companies in the top 50 without any female representation on the board .
Mr. Secretary General ,
I have the pleasure to offer to Your Excellency my best wishes on the occasion of Nowruz and the beginning of the New Solar Year , 1389 .
I also wish to seize the moment to praise the efforts initiated by Your Excellency and members of the United Nations General Assembly for the international registration of Nowruz , a cultural event that glorifies humanitarian shared values and principles .
I hope this initiative will lay a solid foundation for the spread of Nowruz culture that stands for peace , amity , dynamism , constructive cooperation and sustainable security across the world .
As you are aware , terrorism has emerged today as the most formidable challenges besetting the world community , and many policy­ - makings and military actions have been launched on the pretext of fighting terrorism .
Excellency ,
You are certainly familiar with the name of Abdulmalik Riggi , a terrorist and gang leader who had used Afghanistan and Pakistan as safe havens over the past years to infiltrate into Iran ’s southeast borders for conducting armed robberies and terrorist acts .
More than 140 innocent Iranians including women , men and children were killed with the most horrendous methods , and more than 260 were wounded .
Although the international organizations that claim to be advocating human rights , have been silent all this time vis-a - vis these crimes , most deplorable is the measures undertaken by NATO intelligence and security forces in Afghanistan as well as the attitudes of some American and European media in trying to support these crimes and cleanse the blood - stained hands of this criminal and his mercenaries .
There is concrete evidence on the involvement of intelligence and security services of at least three countries supporting his terrorist operations .
Some western media that use a small mistake of a police officer - in countries that defy hegemony and imperialistic policies - to raise loud and deafening cries as pretending to be in deep grief for human rights abuse as part of efforts aimed at portraying the barbaric killing of defenseless people as a holy campaign , have either been silent towards all these crimes and brutalities , or have made interviews and featured numerous articles or reports to introduce this murderer as a freedom fighter or a democracy activist .
It is all the more regrettable that terrorism has turned into a tool to subdue nations , and those who allege to be combating terrorism now find themselves at the forefront of supporting ’ terrorism .
Excellency ,
I have attached to this letter a video featuring , a very small part of the crimes committed by this terrorist , and the way he enjoyed media supports .
It also contains part of the confessions he made on the backings provided by NATO members for his activities .
As the Secretary General of the United Nations you are expected to take the following measures based on your legal and humanitarian responsibilities , and inform the people of Iran and all nations of its results :
1- Blunt condemnation of crimes and restoration of the rights of the oppressed people of Iran as the main victim of terrorism .
2- Condemnation of the supports given by NATO members for terrorism in the region , official impeachment of all those who officially supported this criminal , and restoration of the rights of victims , and of the government and people of Iran .
3- The arrest by the Iranian Intelligence service of this terrorist who was widely supported by NATO members has made clear the right approach that must be taken to combat terrorism .
Following September 11 attacks , and on the pretext of fighting against a number of terrorist operatives , more than a million people in our region have been victimized and a few more millions been displaced , two members of the United Nations have been occupied by NATO and the American military forces , and a third country is susceptible to military aggressions .
The current method of combating terrorism , even if the claims of its proponents are accepted as true , has obviously failed .
" If terrorism nearly exists , is n’t it possible to apply a rational method that has been efficiently used by the Iranian intelligence and security apparatus in dealing with Abdulmalik Riggi .
We have emphasized time and again that settlement of problems in our region does not need wide­ - scale military expeditions or actions . "
Excellency , you are at least expected to appoint an independent fact - finding team which is trusted by the countries of the region , to launch a comprehensive investigation into the main culprits behind the September 11 attacks as principal excuse for attacking the Middle East , the intentions of NATO military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq , the methods used , and the outcome of their presence and engagement , with results to be presented to the General Assembly .
Mr. Secretary General ,
As you know , since the presence of American and NATO forces , not only a few million people were killed , wounded , and displaced , cultivation of illicit crop has also multiplied and the people of our region continue to live under the shadow of threat .
Who or what other organization has the responsibility to support the rights , security and independence of nations in the region .
If the United - Nations has no responsibility , it has to announce to the suffering nations that where or what other organization they should raise their complaint or grievances to .
If this is the case what is the philosophy behind the establishment of the United Nations ?
The expectation is that Your Excellency actively put this issue on your agenda and adopt necessary decisions to put an end to massacres , increasing narcotic production , and occupation .
May God the Almighty bless the entire world with peace and justice .
Tonight ’s episode of Lost , “ Across the Sea , ” will focus on the two mysterious bosses of the island , Jacob and the Man in Black .
In anticipation , Vulture spoke to the two mysterious bosses of Lost , show - runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse .
The pair answered some Vulture commenter questions , addressed the extra half - hour ABC announced would be added to the finale , explained why Jin did n’t leave Sun even though they have a child , and hinted that Lost may not quite be over after the finale .
Wait , what ?
Has it sunk in yet that you ’re done filming ?
Carlton Cuse : No .
Because while we have locked the cut editorially , we ’re still doing a lot of work .
Excuse us for being on our cell phones , but we ’re on route to the scoring stage where Michael Giacchino is going to be recording all of the music for the finale with a live orchestra .
We have a lot of work and visual effects to do .
I think it really will sink in on the 24th when we are literally done - done .
So there was no moment at the wrap party when someone had too much to drink and yelled out , “ Let ’s do a season seven ! ” followed by a round of cheers ?
Damon Lindelof : [ Laughs . ]
We have n’t gotten that drunk yet .
So it sounds like you ’re ready to move on .
Cuse : I think we ’ve been prepared for a long time for the ending of the show .
I think that we feel certain that it was the right decision .
We ’re prepared for it .
I think that there will certainly be a mourning period when it ’s all said and done .
It ’s funny :
There ’s this special feature for the DVDs in which some other show - runners discuss what it ’s like ending a show .
There ’s an interview with Stephen Cannell [ The A - Team , The Greatest American Hero , Wiseguy ] who said that he ’s produced something like 42 television series , for network television , and he never ended any of them on his own terms .
We ’re far more grateful for the fact we ’re able to do this on our own terms .
I think that ’s the emotion , at least at this moment , that outweighs the other ones .
Tonight ’s episode , “ Across the Sea , ” focuses on Jacob and the Man In Black .
When were these guys first conceived ?
Lindelof :
We had to start talking about the overall mythology of the island in greater detail in the cracks between the first and second seasons , before our characters went down into the hatch .
That conversation basically kicked out into the other major arc of the second season .
Which was :
Who are the Others ?
Who are these other people on the island , and who was their leader ?
And who was he receiving his instructions from ?
By the time the show got into its third season , we started to hear references to this character , Jacob .
And I think it ’s safe to say that those conversations started then .
Do you think some fans get disappointed when they find out that everything was n’t plotted out from the first episode ?
Cuse : I think the answer is , once we announced the end date , I think a lot of those concerns went away .
I ca n’t imagine that there are many authors that are able to , basically , conceive something entirely beforehand .
We feel strongly that the show would be worse if we were just marching forward .
The creative process is not like a situation where you get struck by a single lightning bolt .
You have ongoing discoveries and there ’s ongoing creative revelations .
Yes , it ’s really helpful to be marching toward a specific destination , but , along the way , you must allow yourself room for your ideas to blossom , take root , and grow .
I think that ’s how we approached the show :
We had a rough idea of certain things , a specific idea about other things .
Over six years , everything got a lot richer and fuller because we spent all that time thinking about the show and thinking about how to make the show better .
As opposed to someone like George Lucas who , today , claims he knew the entire arc of Star Wars when he was filming the first movie .
Even his old interviews prove that ’s not true .
Lindelof : Totally .
The other thing is , we never had the hubris or the audacity to try and plot out too far in advance , because we did n’t even know if the viewers were going to want another season of Lost .
Just to say in season three that we ’ll end the show after season six , then people decide they hated the show in season four , there would n’t have even have been a season five .
You have to focus on what ’s in front of you .
If J.K. Rowling was only thinking about the seventh Harry Potter book when she was writing the third one , she would n’t have been able to write the third one .
You kind of have to say , “ Hey , we have a cool idea for this character named Jacob and his nemesis , the Man in Black .
But let ’s not put that idea in front of the audience until we ’re really ready to start telling that chapter of the story .
We ’ll allude to it , because we have it in mind .
In the meantime , this chapter of the story is that the island is moving through time and that ’s what the characters are dealing with right now .
If you throw Jacob and the Man in Black into that story , people ’s heads are going to explode .
If we were on a plane that crashed , we would certainly remember that flight number .
In the flash sideways this season , Oceanic Flight 815 did n’t crash , but everyone seems to remember their flight number .
If we were approached and asked if we were on Delta flight 4367 two weeks ago , we would have no idea .
Do either of you make a point to remember your flight numbers ?
Cuse :
You know , the thing that ’s funny is that we fly to Hawaii , usually on the exact same schedule .
So , yes , we fly United 81 out and United 82 back .
What ’s actually more disconcerting is when people see us and recognize us and we ’re sitting on the plane .
It does not make people happy to see that they ’re flying on the plane with us .
And Damon and I , on our last trip to Hawaii , we had the worst flight we ’ve ever had over there .
It was bumpy and rocky and just horrible for two and a half hours .
We were like , “ This would make a great story if this plane goes down somewhere over the Pacific , but we do not want this to happen . ”
In last week ’s episode , why did n’t Sun tell Jin to leave her so he could raise their daughter ?
Lindelof :
That ’s a great question .
And our only answer for it is that Sun only had about 30 seconds to process the fact that she was going to die .
Sun and Jin never had a relationship together with that daughter .
Sun had a relationship with her , but Jin did not — she was just a picture on a phone to him .
In that moment , she did not tell Jin to leave her side .
Partially , in that moment , maybe there was a part of her that wanted him to stay with her .
Who knows ?
We ’re not really willing to say why characters do n’t say certain things in certain moments .
All we can say is :
She did not say that .
We did not want that scene to be about their daughter , we wanted it to be about them reuniting .
It was announced that the finale is going to be extended an extra half - hour , for a total of two and a half hours .
Did that come from you or the network ?
Cuse : Damon and I wrote the script and we were gently told by the network that they thought it was big .
And we were like , “ No , no , we ’ll be able to get this all in there . ”
But we really wrote the script the way we wanted the script to be .
Normally in television , you ’re trying to execute a clear decision within a very specific guideline — which is the running time of a one - hour episode .
We really just sort of decided , “ Let ’s not worry too much about that , let ’s just write the best version of the finale and we will figure out in post the time issue . ”
And when we finally saw a cut of the whole thing together , we were like , “ This thing will not be as good in a two - hour running time . ”
We went to the network and said , “ You know what ?
You guys are right , this thing is a little bit long and we think we can deliver you a much better version of it that ’s two - and - a - half - hours long . ”
And they were totally supportive .
They rearranged the schedule in order to give us a two - and - a - half - hour airing slot .
We feel really excited about it ; we think the finale is going to be so much better for that .
It will really feel like a feature film .
We have a few questions from Vulture readers .
The Cheese wants to know if there are any questions you hear a lot from fans that you wish they would stop asking ?
Lindelof :
Well , you know , they ’re entitled to ask any question they want .
But … it is hard to answer the 50th iteration of “ When did you know this ?
When did you figure this part out ? ”
The idea of having to explain our creative process as this sort of time - scale thing , so that people could look at it and say , “ Oh , ah - ha , this is what they knew when they were making the pilot .
This is what they did n’t know , ” sort of takes the magic out of it and the fun out of it for us in the creative process .
It makes us feel more like we ’re in a senate hearing as opposed to , “ Hey , we were doing our best to make the best show that we possibly could , ” in a very short period of time , at first , and this is it .
And no matter how many times we answer that question , it feels like there ’s just a cynicism that emerges in terms of , you know , I feel like you guys are trying to put one over on us .
Well , sorry then about that whole Jacob , Man in Black question from before …
Lindelof :
No , I mean , that ’s what people want to know .
Like_shootin_fish_in_a_barrel and Pennywise feel that the female characters are n’t as strong as they were in the first few seasons .
Cuse : Personally , I have n’t heard that .
I think that when all is said and done , at the end of the finale , we feel like we will kind of have serviced the characters to the best of our ability .
We approach the characters as characters .
We really do n’t think a lot about if this is a male character or if this is a female character .
We think about what the characters want .
We feel , particularly for Kate , the rest of her journey in this series is a really , really good one .
She ’s sort of the lead female character , so we would hope that criticism would be abated by the time the series is over .
Ntlzaglostie815 is having a Lost - themed 30th birthday party and wants to know if you two and the rest of the cast will come ?
Cuse : [ Laughs . ]
Where is it ?
You know , she did n’t say .
I guess you guys wo n’t be able to make it without knowing a location .
Lindelof :
It just depends on if pizza is going to be served .
Chiyork is wondering if there are any characters you regret killing ?
Cuse :
At the very beginning of the series , we had these two beach extras — we called them socks because they were kind of like sock puppets — and one was named Steve and one was named Scott .
And I think we regret the fact that one was called Steve and one was called Scott because we could never remember which one was which .
And we could never remember which one we killed and which one we had n’t killed .
We may not regret killing Scott or Steve — whichever one we did kill , I ca n’t even remember now myself — [ but ] we should have named one a non “ S ” name .
Annetay knows there will be some questions left unanswered .
Are there any questions left unanswered that you wish you would have answered ?
Lindelof :
We answered all the questions that we wanted to answer .
And our rule has always been :
We answer the questions that were important to answer for the characters on the show .
If Jack , Sawyer , Hurley , Locke , and Kate did n’t care about it …
It ’s not that we did n’t care about it , or that we do n’t acknowledge that the fans are curious about it , but we did n’t answer it .
That being said :
There might , possibly , be some questions that we , as storytellers , will answer in the body of the show that might not be appearing in the finale .
And that ’s all we ’re willing to say …
Are there episodes during the run of Lost that took you by surprise in the way fans reacted to it ?
Cuse : I think that we basically have been pretty much in sync with the fans reaction .
We will acknowledge that episodes like “ Stranger in a Strange Land ” are not good just as quickly as the fans will .
I think the one episode that was polarizing was “ Expose , ” the Nikki and Paulo episode .
Which we loved and , in that case , there were definitely fans — particularly ones who treated the show really reverentially — that could n’t stand it and they hated it .
So there was a little bit of a sense of division on that episode because we totally dug it and we loved it .
But it was definitely an episode where we sort of broke the fourth wall in the sense that we acknowledged that the audience hated Nikki and Paulo .
We sort of incorporated that as an element into the show — some people felt like that was too intrusive .
That ’s the episode I think that ’s probably the most polarizing .
What ’s each of your favorite finales in television history ?
Lindelof : Our Lost finale ?
Okay , one that has already aired …
Cuse : I ’m going to go first and jump on the Sopranos bandwagon .
Damon and I talk about it a lot .
While we think that it was a little bit polarizing , ultimately , The Sopranos was an existential show and it was the perfect existential ending .
We would n’t end our show that way , but we admire the fact that David Chase came up with a really bold choice that , to us , really felt like it was the right way to end that show .
And I admire the fact that it was risky .
Lindelof : I think Carlton definitely speaks for both of us on The Sopranos , and I probably speak for both of us when I say the M* A * S * H finale .
I remember the event of the M*A* S * H finale when I watched it with my parents and our neighbors came over from across the street .
And it was this incredibly emotional thing — my parents were crying .
Not just because of the things that happened in the episode itself were kind of sad , they were crying because the show was leaving .
That ’s a much different feeling than The Sopranos ending , which was not really going for emotion ; it was going for high art .
Whereas a Seinfeld ending is a much different thing than a Cheers ending , which is , they ’re going for emotion .
When Sam turns out the light , you ’re supposed to feel something .
We really both admired the moment the helicopter lifts off and you look down and you see “ good - bye ” — just being this iconic moment in television .
But , in a way , it was breaking the fourth wall and communicating to the audience , “ we ’re saying good - bye to you , too . ”
That was just a beautiful , beautiful piece of filmmaking .
Hopefully people will feel the same way on May 23 .
Lindelof : From your mouth to God ’s ears .
The POSIX standard for threads ( called pthreads ) is available on most Unix - like systems these days , and it's probably the most popular threads API for programs written in C .
In my opinion , pthreads is a fine example of a great C API .
A good API , in any language , is somewhat of an art .
Arguably , the more abstraction the language allows , the better the APIs that can be created for it .
According to this line of thought , C is a language in which designing a good API is particularly difficult , because it does n't provide a lot of abstraction tools .
However , as some APIs ( amongst them pthreads ) clearly demonstrate , designing a good C API is possible , if you follow a few rules .
I do n't claim to know all the rules , but here are a few pthreads got right .
Simplicity and orthogonality
The pthreads API is inherently simple .
Not in the sense that it makes multi- threaded ( MT ) programming a breeze ( I doubt this is possible ) , but in the sense that it provides everything that 's needed to write MT programs , and only that .
In other words , pthreads solves a single problem , and solves it well .
Simplicity and orthogonality lead to predictability .
There 's no duplication , no multiple ways of doing the same thing , which could create confusion .
After you spend some time with the API and you need to use some part you 've never used before , you just know where to look .
Consistent and logical naming Speaking of knowing where to look - the importance of naming conventions can not be overemphasized .
This is very important in programming in general , and in API design in particular .
pthreads is great in this respect .
Types are named pthread_ [ type ] _t ( examples : pthread_t , pthread_cond_t , etc. )
( examples : , , etc. ) Functions are called pthread_ [ type ] _[ action ] with a few exceptions that are pthread_[ action ] and pertain to the API in whole and not a specific type .
with a few exceptions that are and pertain to the API in whole and not a specific type .
Constants are named PTHREAD_ [ NAME ]
As an example consider barriers .
Suppose that you 've just learned about them and are wondering how to clean them up .
Having spent even a few hours with pthreads , you will without doubt immediately guess the correct function name ( pthread_barrier_destroy ) , because the naming is so consistent .
This is a simple example that saves perhaps a few seconds of looking up a function name , but it 's important nevertheless , as each such experience leaves you with more confidence in the API .
Opaque types
The types provided by pthreads are completely opaque .
A type such as pthread_mutex_t reveals nothing of its implementation , and you can't even look up its definition without digging deep in the sources of the library .
Such opaqueness is great for encapsulation - an important concept in API design .
Restrict what the user can do with your data and you wo n't get surprised by creative ( ab)uses .
APIs have to be restrictive - otherwise their abstractions will leak , which is dangerous .
A desired corollary of this design is consistent memory management : new pthread objects are initialized with pthread_ [ type ] _init functions and cleaned up with pthread_ [ type ] _destroy functions .
These functions take pointers to pthread types and do n't actually allocate and deallocate the object themselves - only their contents .
This is the right approach , because :
The API knows best how to allocate the contents of its objects - the user does n't even have to know what those contents are .
The user knows best how to allocate the objects themselves .
He may choose to place them in static storage , allocate them dynamically , or even on stack for some uses .
pthreads does n't care - all it needs is a pointer to a valid object , through which the object can be initialized , interacted with , or destroyed .
pthreads takes the opaqueness of its types very seriously .
Consider the thread ID .
When creating a new thread , pthread_create stores it in a pointer to an opaque type pthread_t that the user passes .
It 's also available to any thread by calling pthread_self .
The user is not allowed to make any assumptions about this type .
Therefore , pthreads provides the pthread_equal function to compare two such IDs .
Attributes
This aspect is a bit trickier than the others , and unfortunately I have n't seen it used in a lot of other APIs , which is a shame , IMHO .
Non-trivial APIs frequently have large parameter lists for some functions , especially those dealing with creation and initialization .
This is an unfortunate result of an unavoidable reality - complex APIs must be customizable .
One of the best examples is perhaps the notorious Win32 CreateWindow function .
11 arguments !
I bet that you can't remember their designation and order , unless you 're Charles Petzold .
Therefore , calls to CreateWindow are usually heavily commented to explain what is being passed and where .
This problem is especially acute with C , which has neither named arguments , nor default argument values .
To me , this is an example of an API designer being lazy on the expense of the user .
It 's probably the approach requiring the least amount of code for the API implementer - just shove all those arguments in a list , give them names , and voila - we have a function .
pthreads takes the opposite approach , favoring the user over the API implementer , by using opaque attribute objects .
An attribute object is exactly like any other pthreads object .
The user allocates it , and then calls pthread_attr_init to intialize it and pthread_attr_destroy to clean it up ( I 'm focusing on attributes of threads here , there are also attributes of condition objects , and so on ) .
A cursory count ( do n't catch me on this one , could be a couple more or a couple less ) of thread attributes is 9 .
But pthread_create takes only 4 arguments ( the thread object , an attribute object , the function to run in the thread and an argument to that function ) .
This feat is accomplished through the use of an attribute object , which is an aggregate of all the attributes a user would want to set for his new thread .
Fine , I hear someone say , so pass in a struct full of attributes into the function instead of many arguments .
pthreads takes a further step - the attributes object is also completely opaque .
You set attributes with pthread_attr_set [ name ] and can retrieve them with pthread_attr_get [ name ] . pthread_attr_init( &attr ) ; pthread_attr_setstacksize( &attr , 100000 ) ; pthread_attr_setdetachstate ( &attr , PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE ) ; pthread_attr_setguardsize ( &attr , 1000 ) ; pthread_create ( &my_thread , &attr , thread_func , args ) ;
Yes , it requires much more code from the API implementer .
Yes , it even requires a bit more code from the user .
However , complex parametrization of function calls with attributes is now completely self - explanatory .
The user can see exactly what attributes are being set prior to calling a function - no comments are required .
Code that is self - documenting in this manner is a worthy goal to strive for .
Useful defaults
Not everything pthreads does is to favor explicitness over code size .
For example , the default attributes used by pthread_create ( when NULL is passed as the attribute pointer ) are useful enough to be a perfectly valid default for most code .
Another example is exiting a thread .
When the function running the thread returns , pthread_exit is implicitly called and the return value serves as the thread 's exit status .
Defaults are useful only when they make sense .
It 's perfectly OK to make some assumptions about the most common needs of the user , as long as it's well documented .
As the saying goes , you should strive to make the easy things easy , and the difficult things possible .
Top Recipients of Public Pensions in New York
Roughly 3,700 retired public workers in New York are getting pensions of more than $ 100,000 a year .
The New York Times collected this public information from the state ’s two pension funds and four of the five city funds .
The pension plan for the city 's firefighters has yet to provide information , as required under public information laws .
Some pension funds said they could not provide figures like job title or final salary ; the N.Y.P.D. Pension Fund would not disclose names .
I ’m off writing a long way from the internet right now , but just learned I ’m being used – for , I ’m pretty sure , the first time – as a political football , with Questions Being Asked and everything .
So .
To bring everybody up to speed :
About a month ago I was asked if I ’d go and talk in Stillwater Library on a Sunday afternoon .
The request came in from Greater Talent Agency , who book my speaking engagements .
I was asked to give an hour - long talk , which would also be broadcast on Public Radio .
This would the first in a series of talks by local authors in libraries outside of the Twin Cities .
As anyone who ’s read the FAQ ( which was written in 2002 , thus the Clinton reference ) or has been reading this blog for a while knows , if you want to hire me to come and talk somewhere , and people do , I ’m expensive .
Not just a bit pricy .
Really expensive .
The main reason I got a speaking agency , ten years ago , was because too many requests for me to come and speak were coming in .
And the speaking requests were , and are , a distraction from what I ought to be doing , which is writing .
So rather than say no , we ’ve always priced me high .
Not Tony Blair high , or Sarah Palin high ( last time I read about them , they ’re about $ 400,000 and $ 150,000 respectively ) .
But I ’m at the top end of what it costs to bring an author who should be home writing and does not really want a second career as a public speaker to your event .
So if you want to pay me to come in and talk , it ’s expensive .
The vast majority of the events I do and of the talks , lectures or readings I give are done for free , often as charity fundraisers .
( For example : the night before the Stillwater event I spent the day in Chicago , speaking to 1600 people who had paid up to $ 250 a ticket , as a benefit for the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund .
http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/04/18/neil-gaiman-at-c2e2/ is a description of the event . )
So .
I was asked if I ’d come and talk at Stillwater , and be paid $ 40,000 .
I said , “ That ’s an awful lot of money for a little library . ”
“ It ’s not from the library .
It ’s from the Legacy Fund , a Minnesota tax allocation that allows the library to pay market rates to bring authors to suburban libraries who otherwise would n’t be able to bring them in .
They have to use the money now as it wo n’t roll over to next year and expires next month . ”
“ Ah . ”
Well , that seemed fairly simple .
They ’d already booked a number of other authors .
They had the money sitting there and were happy to pay me my rack rate .
Either they gave the money to me or it went away – it could n’t be used for anything else .
And , most importantly , the dates worked .
Another week and I would have had to say no , as I would have been away writing .
But I got in from Chicago that morning .
I said yes .
I figure money like that , sort of out - of - the - blue windfall money , is best used for Good Deeds , so I let a couple of small and needy charities ( one doing social work , the other library / book based ) know that I would be passing the money on to them , after agents had taken their commission , and did not think twice about it .
( I do n’t like talking about how much money I make , because I spent enough years as a starving journalist to know what it ’s like not to have money , and to envy or resent those who do .
But if you ’re wondering how I can afford to blithely wave goodbye to a fee like that : I make my money writing .
I sell a lot of books , in dozens of countries around the world , every year .
I write and occasionally co-produce movies , and I sell the film rights to my books and stories .
The Graveyard Book spent over a year on the New York Times Bestseller List .
Instructions came out this week , and went straight in at # 4 .
There were months last year when I had four different books on the New York Times Bestseller Lists at the same time .
Like I said , I ’m a writer , and I get paid for my writing . )
The day was fun , the auditorium , which held about 500 people was full , and it felt a lot more intimate than the Big City events I ’d done for 1600 and 1500 people the previous nights .
I gave an hour ’s talk .
I did an hour ’s Q&A with the people there .
I stuck around for two hours after that , saying hullo to everyone , posing for photos , generally trying to meet everyone who was there , and then , when everyone was done and had gone , I went home .
The Legacy Fund , from which the money to pay me came , is used for Minnesota ’s Parks , Museums , Arts , and comes from a sales tax allocation .
It is a Big Political Deal .
Which meant Paying An Author Lots of Money From That Fund was going to become a Big Political Deal .
I saw a mention of it on the School Library Journal blog , and responded to there :
Obviously I do a lot of speaking for free .
The night before I 'd done a pro bono 3 hour reading / Q&A as a benefit for the CBLDF in Chicago , in front of 1600 people , who had paid up to $ 250 a ticket to attend .
Four days before I 'd done " An Evening With Neil Gaiman " internet talk with the Jessamine Public Library for nothing , because they asked me to , and because it was National Library Week ( although they sent me a wonderful Kentucky nibbles gift basket as a thank you ) .
In fact most of the talks and appearances I do are for free .
But if you want to hire me to come in and talk , it 's expensive .
My speaking fees are high .
I keep them that way intentionally .
Here 's what it says on my website 's Frequently asked questions :
" Q. How can I get Neil Gaiman to make an appearance at my school / convention / event ?
A. Contact Lisa Bransdorf at the Greater Talent Network .
Tell her you want Neil to appear somewhere .
Have her tell you how much it costs .
Have her say it again in case you misheard it the first time .
Tell her you could get Bill Clinton for that money .
Have her tell you that you could n't even get ten minutes of Bill Clinton for that money but it 's true , he 's not cheap .
On the other hand , I 'm really busy , and I ought to be writing , so pricing appearances somewhere between ridiculously high and obscenely high helps to discourage most of the people who want me to come and talk to them .
Which I could make a full time profession , if I did n't say ' no ' a lot . "
For this event , nobody asked my representatives if I would do it for less than a normal speaking fee .
( I do sometimes .
Normally only for libraries . )
I was assured before I agreed to sign on that this money was not coming from the library system , but from the 200 million sales tax Legacy Fund .
It was a wonderful afternoon .
And yesterday Minnesota Public Radio broadcast the entire one hour talk ( although not the Q&A ) .
And , although I 'm not sure that it 's anyone 's business , when I get money like this , I put it back out again .
In this case , 25 % of what I get goes to a social / abuse charity , and the other 75 % goes to an author / literature / library related charity program .
http://www.libraryjournal.com/blog/1010000101/post/1620054162.html
And I figured that was that .
But since then the story has embiggened .
It made it onto the front page of the city section of the Minneapolis Star Tribune .
( Nobody from the Star Tribune tried to contact me or my assistant or agent for any quotes on this , which I find a bit depressing , given that they have my email and phone number from dozens of previous interviews . )
( Apparently the Star Tribune is against the Legacy Fund , and feels the money should go to fund a $ 790 million dollar stadium instead , per http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2010/05/neil_gaimans_sp.php and http://www.minnpost.com/artsarena/2010/05/07/18007/in_defense_of_libraries_both_home_and_public)
So , to answer all the sorts of comments I ’m seeing on these articles in one place :
How can you justify asking for $ 45,000 to come and speak ?
The scary thing is that if you are ( to pick a couple of real - life examples from the last few years ) an advertising congress or the R&D department of a multinational car company , I charge a lot more than that to come and speak .
And people pay it very happily .
When you came and talked at our library you charged a lot less than that .
Yeah , I do that .
Greater Talent Agency knows that I ’ll often lower prices for libraries .
In this case , no - one asked if I ’d do it for less .
Why was n’t this money being used to fund a little library somewhere ?
Or pay a librarian ?
Or buy books for people ?
Or Do Good ?
Are n’t you ripping off libraries by accepting it ?
The money came from a specific fund that was allocated to this purpose .
As Boing Boing explains http://www.boingboing.net/2010/05/10/neil-gaimans-awesome.html:
“ The money comes from a grant for programs like this .
It can't be used to buy books or pay salaries .
The money was only allocated in October , 2009 and had to be spent by June , 2010 or it would be taken back .
This was a big - ticket , inaugural event to generate interest in the program . ”
Yes , but this is public money .
It definitely is .
The idea was to get authors in to talk , and to pay them for it .
And to get people talking about books , authors and libraries .
It seems to be working .
Me ?
I think these things should be organised in a way that permits unspent Legacy money for libraries from one year to roll over into the following years .
But you only brought in 500 people !
Sure .
If we ’d done the event on a Friday night in Minneapolis I ’m sure I would have been talking to a few thousand people ( I did the last time I did one there ) .
But the whole point of an event like this is to get authors out to the suburbs , not to bring more events to the Cities .
About 500 people in an auditorium that held about 500 people on the first sunny Sunday afternoon of summer was pretty good by Stillwater standards .
( More and they would n’t have had anywhere to sit . )
As it was the talk was broadcast by , and is still up on MPR and has been listened to by many thousands of people all over the state and all over the world .
( It 's up here at MPR , where there 's also some interesting comments : http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/news_cut/archive/2010/05/second_takes_on_gaimans_fee.shtml
You ’re not even a local author .
You live 230 miles away from Stillwater in Green Lake Wisconsin !
It says so in the blog that broke the story .
I ’ve never been to Green Lake .
Actually I live about half an hour away from Stillwater .
Apparently people start lying when they want to use you as a political football .
$ 45,000 ?
For a Sci Fi Author ?
I ’ve never heard of you .
That ’s okay .
I ’ve never heard of you either .

And seeing you are here anyway , the review of Instructions from Publishers Weekly , which makes me happy because it says such good things about Charles Vess 's art , and it ends " All Ages " :
Instructions
Neil Gaiman , illus . by Charles Vess , Harper , $ 14.99 ( 32 p ) ISBN 978-0-06-196030-7
" Touch the wooden gate in the wall you never saw before , " invites Gaiman 's poem , first published in A Wolf at the Door ( 2000 ) , reborn as a lavishly illustrated small - format picture book .
A bipedal , bushy - tailed cat , wearing attire befitting Robin Hood , enters a fairy tale landscape filled with subtle and obvious allusions to familiar characters and stories .
A cottage door leads him into a hallway of dramatic arches where a cat with an injured paw becomes his companion ( " if any creature tells you that it hungers , feed it .
If it tells you that it is dirty , clean it " ) .
The wanderers press on , encountering a castle containing three sequestered princesses ( " Do not trust the youngest .
Walk on " ) , a ghostly ferryman , and other creatures .
Recalling his work on Gaiman 's Blueberry Girl , Vess 's compositions are distinguished by elegant , winding lines -- gnarled vines , plumes of smoke , dragon tails -- and intimate frames that evoke moments of gentle wisdom .
Young readers should relish the chimerical vision while older Gaiman fans should grasp the underlying suggestion that the compass used to navigate fairy tales can also guide us in the real world .
All ages .
( May )
Labels : Instructions , Legacy Fund , stillwater , why it can be dangerous to talk to authors
In early May , a ruptured water pipe caused a breach in Boston ’s water supply that forced 2 million residents to boil water for several days .
That inconvenience should serve as a “ striking reminder ” of the daily reality for more than one billion people across the world who do n’t have access to clean water , President Susan Hockfield told about 280 members of the MIT community at a workshop on Friday .
“ We have an obligation — a responsibility — to act , ” Hockfield said at the workshop , titled “ Rethinking Water : A Critical Resource . ”
The event was intended to provide a glimpse of the range of work currently being done at MIT to address the scarcity of fresh water worldwide , and how MIT must help to address that crisis by designing better water systems and policies to be adopted across different geographic and cultural contexts .
With more than 50 faculty members from each of MIT ’s five schools working on issues related to water , the Institute already has a “ running start ” on water - related research and education , Hockfield said .
The workshop came just as MIT ’s Environmental Research Council ( ERC ) issued a report outlining six research areas where MIT faculty and students can build on existing strength in multiple disciplines to advance solutions to environmental challenges of global significance .
One of those areas is water , a resource described in the report as “ arguably more vital than oil , but routinely squandered .
” Although MIT faculty and students are already working on a range of water - related issues , such as studying the exchange between the oceans and the atmosphere , developing cost - effective desalinization technologies and creating and implementing innovative water policy mechanisms , much work remains .
Hockfield urged workshop participants to use the ERC report as a critical framework to guide continued collaboration across the Institute on research and teaching related to the environment .
The morning portion of the workshop was geared toward discussing what MIT is currently doing to address water issues .
Faculty members from each of the five schools presented examples of research projects related to water — everything from how the resource is affected by patterns of evaporation and precipitation to how it travels through soil to how it is considered to be a human health hazard in countries like Bangladesh because it carries toxins like arsenic ..
During the afternoon session , the workshop featured several panel discussions that focused on MIT ’s long - term goals for tacking water issues , such as scaling water solutions .
“ This is only a start , ” said James Wescoat , the Aga Khan Professor of Architecture in MIT ’s Department of Architecture , of the workshop , which he helped organize and hoped would be used as a platform to guide future events about water issues at MIT .
This fall , the ERC is expected to complete a detailed implementation plan about building a strong environmental initiative at MIT .
Speaking at a United Nations water conference in Alexandria , Egypt , NASA scientist Essam Heggy told the assembly that NASA should use its ground - penetrating satellite radar to find water in the mostly desert covered Middle East and east Africa .
According to Heggy , the radar can find water buried over half a mile beneath the surface , providing a guide for the construction of wells and artificial oasis .
In particular , Eggy noted that the Darfur region of southern Sudan , where resource scarcity has contributed to genocide and vicious insurgency , covers an area once rife with lakes , and thus may very well contain vast undiscovered , underground reservoirs .

Sunlight illuminated the lingering oil slick off the Mississippi Delta on May 24 , 2010 .
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite captured this image the same day .
Oil smoothes the ocean surface , making the Sun ’s reflection brighter in some places , and reducing the scattering of sunlight in other places .
As a result , the oil slick is brighter than the surrounding water in some places ( image center ) and darker than the surrounding water in others ( image lower right ) .
The tip of the Mississippi Delta is surrounded by muddy water that appears light tan .
Bright white ribbons of oil streak across this sediment - laden water .
Tendrils of oil extend to the north and east of the main body of the slick .
A small , dark plume along the edge of the slick , not far from the original location of the Deepwater Horizon rig , indicates a possible controlled burn of oil on the ocean surface .
To the west of the bird ’s - foot part of the delta , dark patches in the water may also be oil , but detecting a manmade oil slick in coastal areas can be even more complicated than detecting it in the open ocean .
When oil slicks are visible in satellite images , it is because they have changed how the water reflects light , either by making the Sun ’s reflection brighter or by dampening the scattering of sunlight , which makes the oily area darker .
In coastal areas , however , similar changes in reflectivity can occur from differences in salinity ( fresh versus salt water ) and from naturally produced oils from plants .

If you were like me , you were an Android user who found his / her apps through a multitude of different ways .
Whether it was scanning QR codes from this very blog , looking through AppBrain or stumbling upon developers ’ sites , you got your apps , you installed them and you enjoyed .
And thank heavens Google changed it .
This week , Google took the chance to introduce us to version 2.2 of its operating system , which brings a richer , healthier marketplace with it .
When it comes out for the Droid , we ’ll be able to wirelessly sync apps , provide detailed crash reports and ratings to developers and a utilize a robust web API that will let Google Chrome push web content from our big screens to our mobile ones .
However , going into Google I/O , the Android marketplace had seen better days .
Though it had just been updated ( again ) by the boys in Mountain View , the online website was still very much lacking .
Users still could n’t view apps outside of “ top free ” , “ top paid ” and “ featured ” categories , could n’t sync your phone with a list of apps and the community aspects ( such as developer feedback ) were non-existent .
I ’ll mention community in the loosest sense of the word .
It ’s ironic that Android users complain about the operating system ’s fragmentation while the ecosystem of users shares the same problem .
At the moment , on a non-Froyo phone , one can find apps on a number of different sites ( AppBrain , ATrackDog , AppAware , DoubleTwist , etc ) : each one has its own independent ranking and rating system .
Let ’s put forth a hypothetical situation : say you ’re a developer that ’s still ironing out the bugs on his / her application .
Users are downloading it through multiple sites and scoring / commenting it appropriately .
Does n’t it seem a bit inefficient to have to keep tabs on multiple sets of comments and statistics ?
Does a four - and - a - half star rating on one site and a two on another mean your app is crap ?
Would n’t it just be easier to take comments and bug reports on your own ( most often Google Code ) developer ’s page ?
Oh wait – not every user is going to know how to do that .
They ’re going to download it , comment “ does n’t work ” , give it a 1 star rating and uninstall it .
Very helpful .
A desktop client ( or consolidated marketplace , like Google has given us ) would give developers an opportunity to interact with their userbase on a more direct basis while providing support in the form of updates or patches .
Thankfully , Froyo will bring both the ability to automatically update individual apps , or all of them at once with an Update All button .
And update we shall , considering we now have full access to the store via a web browser .
While it ’s nice to check out apps from your phone screen , something about it is a little constricting .
You ca n’t view descriptions at a glance , which makes browsing ( without necessarily downloading ) applications a bit of a chore .
With the new revision of the marketplace , you can look at reviews and sync apps with your phone via a Chrome extension .
The extension will push apps ( along with browser pages ) to your phone , allowing you to download , USB cable free .
This is especially handy when you might be stuck somewhere without access to that almighty cable .
( Interestingly enough to note , one could technically make the closest thing to an Android client using Chrome ’s “ Create Application Shortcuts ” feature .
Making the Marketplace a stand - alone window ( complete with extensions ) would allow anyone to find it easily on the desktop without having to sift through bookmarks . )
This is extremely important because it makes Android , in the words of the competition , just work .
It simplifies Android features that have the potential to be tricky for people who do n’t have the patience to figure out their own problems .
Many still see Android as largely a “ nerd ” phone – those of you who take the time to modify your phones to your liking appreciate the freedom .
The same users competent enough to root / mod their phones surely know how to grab photos off their phone with relative ease , even if your computer does n’t recognize the device it the first couple times you plug it in .
However , asking my parents ( both in their 40’s ) to attempt to do this might yield different results .
Even my more technologically - competent sister would have trouble finding her way around Motorola ’s web interface on my Milestone ; where I might tinker for a couple hours ( or Google my problem ) , they might simply just return their phone to the store .
This is not something Android needs if it wishes to grow past a niche market .
It needs to just work .
Froyo ’s consolidated marketplace is a step in the right direction for Google .
While it is n’t a fully featured , syncing client ( a la iTunes ) , it does the next best thing : it gives us the unity we need to move forward and the user - friendliness that will keep Android ’s momentum strong , especially with iPhone 4.0 on the horizon .
Attribute to The Libertarian Enterprise
The smirky caller asked , " You really believe Barack Obama is a socialist ? "
He went on to assert that the President is pro-business , a capitalist .
The show 's hostamazingly , one of talk radio's Big Three stuttered and stammered inarticulately , never really answering the caller 's question , until he was finally rescued by the next commercial break .
The fact is , even if he'd known exactly what socialism is , and how to spot it in the people all around you , he would n't have dared to say so , because Republicans , conservatives , have a dirty little secret .
Just like Barack Obama , they are socialists , too .
I do n't know whether anybody tries , these days , to teach school kids about such things .
I was in grade school at the beginning of the Cold War , and I was the son of an officer in Strategic Air Command .
Herbert Philbrick ( look him up ) was very big back then , as was a little book called What We Must Know About Communism , by Harry A. Overstreet and Bonaro Wilkins Overstreet .
You can still find it at Amazon.com .
Despite several years spent reading extensively about communism , for school and on my own , and studying the lives and works of self - described socialists like H.G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw , I remained as ignorant as that radio talk show host , and for a very good reason : not one of the " experts " I was reading had any clearer an idea what socialism is than I had .
Most of them still do n't , to this very day .
Once you get past all the mystical gobbledegook of the Hegelian Dialectic inserted as a smokescreen , to elevate common thievery , rape , and murder to a level of nobility what you saw then , what you still see even now , is a boring and inaccurate economic definition , of socialism , all about who gets to own and control " the means of production " .
Economics is , at best , a secondary or tertiary concern to folks who think about such matters .
It is necessarily a product , in the proper order of things , of a whole lot of thinking that has to come before it .
You must begin with metaphysics which tries to answer the question , " What is the nature of reality ? " or better yet , you can start with epistemology , which asks us , " How do I know what I know ? "
Between epistemology and economics , there 's ethics , which asks the question , " What is the good ? " or , more pertinently , " What should I do ? "
The order in which you approach this is critical .
If you try to base your ethics on your economics , you 'll end up organizing Death Panels .
It is the ethical definition of socialism that 's critical here and dangerous to conservatives .
Socialists believe that the needs and wants of society are more important than the rights of the individual .
( Individualists will argue that there is no such thing as " society " in an ethical sense , since it consists of nothing more than individuals . )
" Society " can also be defined as " the group " or " the collective " , manifesting itself in various different ways , as your community , your race , your school , your fraternity , your military unit or the military in general , your corporation , your union , your party , your government , your nation , your family , your lodge , or your church , each claiming to be , in some sense , larger than the individual and for that reason more important .
To socialists , who are inclined to perceive other people as bees or ants , eternally and unquestioningly loyal to hive or hill , size matters .
And yet when you examine all of these august entities closely , and observe that they are comprised of nothing more than the individuals who make them up , such a point of view becomes absurd and pathetic .
A word about family .
Of all the groups that sometimes claim to own your life , family is the hardest to defend your individual sovereignty from .
For the most part , we love our families .
Although there are occasional exceptions , not everyone experienced a terrible childhood or suffered nightmarish parents , the way it 's often portrayed on television .
Our first job in life is to grow up , achieve autonomy , make our own decisions without regard to whether our parents may approve or not .
If we have the right parents , they 'll want us to do exactly that .
At the other end , as parents , we owe it to our kids to help them along the same path to independence , even if it 's sometimes difficult or painful .
As a husband and father , what I do with my life remains my choice .
While I would willingly give my life to protect my wife and daughter , this does n't mean that they own me or that they have more rights as a group than I do .
It simply reflects their inexpressibly high value to me .
Among billions of husbands and fathers , I am obviously far from alone in this outlook .
And in the natural world , where the operating system is evolution by natural selection , it makes good sense .
Individual family members share with one another freely , without regard to the ability of any one of them to pull his own weight .
( For a surprisingly long period after she was born , my daughter was unable to deliver newspapers . )
That 's just the way it is , and the way it has to be .
I believe it was Ludwig von Mises who pointed out that socialism is a misguided attempt to apply what happens in the family to society at large , an attempt that usually ends in privation and violence .
But I have digressed .
Go back and look over that list of things that you 're expected to give your loyalty to and even sacrifice your life for .
Over the centuries , they 've learned to make it all sound wonderful and noble .
However when you begin to see these institutions as nothing more than bunches of individuals , each with no more rights in the natural world than you have ( and no extra , or bonus rights miraculously obtained by claiming to be something other than what they are , nothing more than a bunch of individuals ) , they start to look like tribes of cannibals or vampires , eagerly anticipating the tasty sacrifice of another deluded victim .
And when you suddenly notice that , of all these institutions community , race , school , fraternity , military , corporation , union , party , government , nation , family , lodge , church more than half are treasured by conservatives , their dirty little secret is exposed by the hot , bright light of the truth : your rights , provided they exist at all , come in a distant second to the needs and wants of these aggregations .
Conservatives Republicans are socialists .
True , they may desire to hold you down atop the stone altar and cut your still - beating heart out with an obsidian knife for a set of entirely different reasonsnational security , Judaeo - Christian traditions , " common " decency than the liberals or " progressives " or Democrats do , but to you , the important part is cutting your heart out with an obsidian knife , not whatever excuse they may offer for doing it .
This is why , no matter which political party happens to be in power , ordinary people whose thinking and hard work maintain this civilization each and every day never seem to get an even break with regard to their individual liberty or holding onto the fruits of their labor .
It 's why the late philosopher Robert LeFevre referred to Democrats and Republicans as " Socialist Party A " and " Socialist Party B " .
Never forget that it was a Republican , Abraham Lincoln , who freed not a single , solitary slave , but merely nationalized slavery in the form of income taxation and conscription , who presided over the violent deaths of 620,000 Americans to preserve a political abstract , to retain his political and military power , to enrich his mercantilist friends , and to suppress the basic human right of an entire region of the country to associateor disassociate with whomever they wished .
Never forget that it was a Republican , Richard Nixon , who imposed wage / price controls on what had been a relatively free economy , kept an enemies list , and quit when his minions were caught in a criminal act .
Never forget that it was a Republican , George W. Bush , who created the massively unconstitutional Department of Homeland Security , the no-fly lists , pushed through and signed the Constitution - shredding USA Patriot Act , plunged the country into two unnecessary wars , and created trillion - dollar deficits surpassed only by those of Barack H. Obama .
When we are forced to obtain and carry national identification , it will be Republicans who did it , in the name of eliminating illegal immigration .
Vote for the socialist of your choice .
As with any other socialist culture , " some animals are more equal than others " in Sovietized America .
Its elected nomenklatura in the House and Senate are paid between $ 165,200 and $ 212,100 every year , can look forward to pensions considerably larger than most of their constituents ' salaries , and enjoy endless additional privileges and benefits .
Socialists , every one of them .
Let 's talk about fascism .
When it became obvious as early as the 1920s that socialism does n't work the instant it 's adopted , the economy heads for the toilet , people begin starving , and leaders , self - convinced that their failures are caused by stiff - necked , selfish bastards who refuse to become New Soviet Man , start putting people up against a wall and shooting them a modified system was devised under which , instead of owning the means of production , government allows the productive class to believe they own them , while it controls them through regulations and siphons off the profits as taxes .
Other common names for fascism are " crony capitalism " , " state capitalism " , " corporate socialism " and " mercantilism " .
Sometimes members of the mercantile class become partners with the state and , in certain circumstances , even end up controlling it .
The whole thing looks like a different system than ordinary socialism until you apply the ethical definition .
What 's more important in a fascist society , the needs and wants of the group , or the rights of the individual ?
As Mr. Spock once famously observed ( in the original James Blish novel Spock Must Die ) , " a difference that makes no difference is no difference . "
Or was it the other way around ?
Fascism , then , is a variety of socialism , nothing more , nothing less .
The genuine opposite of fascism is a completely voluntary society .
Completely .
Voluntary .
That means no coercion of any kind is tolerable .
No censorship .
No zoning .
No conscription .
No taxation .
Government deserves no more money than it can raise with bake sales .
Anything else involves setting the value of the individual 's rights at something less than the needs or wants of the group .
Or as Robert LeFevre put it , " To any extent that you have a ' public sector ' , to that extent , you have socialism . "

The Air Force has announced that an experimental spaceship that looks and acts like a miniature , unmanned space shuttle – riding the back of a rocket into space then returning to Earth to land in California – will launch for the first time this month .
How long the mission will last , what it hopes to accomplish , and what , exactly , the X - 37B Orbital Test Vehicle is designed to do are all mysteries .
At a time when more countries – and particularly China – are exploring the military uses of space , the vehicle is the subject of speculation in the space community , with some wondering why the Pentagon rescued a program that NASA put on the chopping block due to a lack of funding in 2006 .
IN PICTURES :
The X - 37 space plane
But the program is also drawing attention for what it might accomplish .
With space enthusiasts and entrepreneurs constantly looking for ways to drive down the enormous costs of getting people or payloads into orbit , perhaps research by the deep - pocketed Defense Department can start to find solutions .
If it is successful , the program would “ be a good demonstrator for a commercial reusable orbital stage , so I 'm hoping that something practical comes out of this program , ” writes David Riseborough of the blog Earth Space Continuum .
X - 37 : What is it ?
For its part , the Air Force has sought to quell conjecture that the X - 37 might be some sort of orbiting Predator drone , dropping weapons from space .
It says it needs the sort of craft NASA was developing : a way to bring science experiments and small payloads back to Earth safely without having to send humans into space to do it .
“ What it offers that we have seldom had is the ability to bring back payloads and experiments to examine how well the experiments performed on - orbit , " Gary Payton , the undersecretary of the Air Force for space programs , told Space.com .
This being the military , however , there are questions about whether that is the whole story .
With the Air Force divulging few details about the craft or its mission , even defense experts are unsure about the program .
Is this a protoype of what will become a fleet of Air Force spaceships or is it an end in itself ?
" From my perspective it 's a little puzzling as to whether this is the beginning of a program or the end of one , " Peter Wilson , an analyst at the RAND Corp. , a defense consultancy in Washington , told the Associated Press .
NASA taking note
The X - 37 is roughly one - fourth the size of the space shuttle and though it will return to Earth , it is not completely reusable , like the shuttle is .
All the elements of the shuttle are recovered and reused .
The X - 37 will take off from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop an expendable Atlas V rocket .
The date for the X - 37 to make its automated landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base on the California coast was not announced .
It can stay on orbit for three - quarters of a year .
Air Force press materials suggested the mission is intended to put the vehicle through its paces but did not offer specifics .
NASA will be watching to see what the Air Force has learned .
" We stay connected with the Air Force on the thermal protection system , [ and ] on the guidance , navigation and autonomous re-entry and landing , " Daniel Dumbacher , the former X - 37 project manager at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , told Space.com .
" We stay in touch with them for data - sharing purposes , but that 's the extent of it . "

Beyond saying that he was in critical condition , hospital spokeswoman Janet Frank said she could not discuss Coleman 's treatment .
Coleman 's manager was also trying to process the situation .
" We 're just getting bits and pieces right now , so there 's really nothing to report , " he told E !
News .
" If there 's anything to announce , we 'll let you know . "
While the circumstances surrounding his hospitalization remain unclear , Coleman 's brother - in - law told TMZ that the 42 - year - old actor sustained a head injury during a fall .
This is Coleman 's third hospitalization this year , after suffering seizures in January and February .
After his January trip to the emergency room , Coleman told E !
News that he was n't overly concerned about his health .
" My doctor seems pretty content , so I 'm pretty happy with that .
As long as he 's content , I 'm content , " Coleman said .
" I got 40 years in me yet .
I ai n't going nowhere .
A lot of these heiresses and a lot of these multibillionaire people , you know , they 're dying here lately .
I do n't understand that .
I do n't know why that 's happening .
But it 's certainly not happening on my side of the street . "

Flash has been a contentious point for the ongoing battle between Apple and Adobe .
The latest volley : Adobe is releasing Flash Player 10.1 for mobile phones and desktops today .
And it is piggy - backing on Google ’s fast growing Android operating system to hit back at Apple .
Google ’s latest mobile operating system , Android 2.2 , aka FroYo , will support Adobe ’s Flash Player 10.1 , a new version that claims to be optimized for mobile viewing .
That will make Android the first mobile operating system to support the full Flash player , instead of the stripped - down Flash Lite player that is currently found on most smartphones with Flash support .
Among PC users , Flash is popular :
It is on more than 98 percent of all browsers , and the platform claims more than 3 million developers worldwide .
Nearly 70 percent of web - based games are built using Flash , says Adobe .
But when Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 , it stunned users by shunning Flash , instead creating its own walled garden of applications including games for its customers to play with .
That ’s led many to announce , somewhat prematurely , the death of Flash .
We tested different websites with the Flash 10.1 Player on a Nexus One running Android 2.2 , and here ’s our first take : With Flash on your phone , no website is really out of bounds .
Flash does not appear to be a battery hog , nor does it chew away at your phone ’s resources .
But it ’s not a flawless experience either .
Flash content — especially video — can take up to a minute to load , which is more frustrating on a phone than it is on a desktop .
And it sucks bandwidth .
Our corporate Wi-Fi connection just did n’t seem good enough , and most Flash - heavy sites took a while to load .
Still it is a step forward and with fine - tuning , the beta version of the Flash Player should get better .
Read on to see how Flash did on Android 2.2 OS .
Flash is fun — when it works .
Accessing many restaurant websites , movie trailers or most fashion sites on the iPhone is impossible .
It ’s is n’t a big inconvenience , but the small , blue , Lego - like icon that appears in place of Flash content has come to signify the part of the online world that ’s cut off to an iPhone user .
With Flash Player 10.1 on Android 2.2 , one of the first things I did was check out Swadley ’s , a barbecue restaurant in Oaklahoma City that a friend mentioned a few days ago .
Swadley ’s website , built using Flash , has the outline of a cowboy on a horse galloping through the front page .
It ’s cheesy on a desktop , but on an iPhone it ’s just a black hole .
My new Nexus
One browser had no such problems .
The Swadley ’s site loads exactly as it does on the desktop , and was fast enough to signal the promise of the technology .
From there , I hopped on to the Sony Pictures web site to check out the trailer for Karate Kid , a re-make starring Will Smith ’s son Jaden Smith .
I could watch the trailers , pinch - to - enlarge it and check out some of the trivia on the site .
But Flash stumbled here , forcing me to reload the site about three times when the trailer did n’t pop up on the screen the way it was supposed to .
The Warner Bros. site optimized for Flash Player 10.1 did better , with movie trailers playing flawlessly on the phone .
That ’s not to say everything is perfect with Flash Player 10.1 .
Fashion websites have been big supporters of Flash , using it to showcase videos of their latest collections and runway presentations .
Chanel ’s site has a video that shows its Cruise 2010 collection .
Five seconds into the video , it failed to play and the spinning circle took over the site , forcing me to close it down .
For Hulu enthusiasts , there ’s bad news .
Flash Player 10.1 does n’t mean you can revisit Lost episodes on the phone .
Hulu does n’t own the distribution rights for its content on mobile devices and so wo n’t stream to any mobile device , says Adobe .
Flash - based games sites , including Club Penguin , were accessible to the FroYo phone , in stark contrast to the iPhone ( and previous versions of Android ) .
But that ’s where the fun ended .
Loading the content is a frustratingly long process , and the Club Penguin site seemed to challenge the processing power of the phone , so my penguin on the phone could n’t do much .
Flash Player 10.1 supports gestures , such as dragging your finger to scroll the screen or double - tapping on the video , and that works pretty smoothly .
Optimized battery life
Apple ’s biggest beef with Adobe Flash is that the technology hogs battery life and is a drain on system resources .
Adobe says it has made tweaks that will shut down the Flash Player 10.1 when the system runs out of memory .
As I surfed a number of Flash - heavy websites , played movie trailers and little video clips on and off for about two hours .
the battery level on my phone was down to about 61 percent from a fully charged battery .
Adobe says Flash Player 10.1 along with FroYo will be available starting June , though handset makers and carriers might take longer to push it to consumers .
Ultimately , Flash will be available on the BlackBerry , Windows Mobile , Symbian and webOS platforms — basically everything except the iPhone , says Adobe — though the company did n’t give specific availability for other platforms .
But three years after Apple declared a war against mobile Flash , you have to wonder if Adobe ’s efforts are too late .
The online video landscape has changed significantly .
Many major websites are switching to to HTML5 , and video players such as Brightcove are serving up HTML5 videos for devices not compliant with Flash .
Separately , Apple has worked with companies such as YouTube to produce iPhone versions of their sites .
And even galloping - cowboy animations can be rendered using HTML5 , eventually .
As a user , whether your phone supports Flash or not is increasingly becoming irrelevant .
Getting Flash Player 10.1 mobile out is just the first step for Adobe .
It will be greater challenge for the firm to show why mobile - phone users should really care about it .

A team of scientists led by potential antichrist Craig Venter reports that they 've successfully created a living cell out of lab synthesized DNA .
Start stocking up on your torches and pitchforks , folks .
It 's alive !

Craig Venter has been fiddling with creating artificial life for quite some time .
The founder of Celera Genomics , The Institute for Genomic Research and the J. Craig Venter Institute , he 's been working since 1995 to create synthetic biological organisms for environmental change .
In layman 's terms , he wants to create life .
Not just any life , but the sort that we humans can control to our own ends .
If that 's not the plot to a 70's B - grade horror film , I do n't know what is .
Advertisement
The main difference between a science horror movie and Venter is that his research is not only real , but now it 's generated real success .
What do you tell a man like Venter years from now , when the world is in ashes and he wonders aloud what he 's done ?
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
You tell him that he and his team succeeded in building a synthetic genome out of the chemical components of DNA - A , T , C and G - transferring them into a cell in order to control how it develops and multiplies .
You see , DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid , is what contains the instructions that tell our cells how to function .
It 's what makes eyeball cells eyeball cells , liver cells liver cells , and giant , slobbering , flesh - hungry abomination cells ... well , you get the point .
Advertisement
Over the past 15 years , Venter and his team struggled with and overcame obstacles placed in their way .
Using bacteria cells to assemble the DNA helped them get around the issue of chemical synthesis techniques breaking down once the DNA letters introduced got into the thousands .
Working with simple bacterial , he perfected the process of transferring large chunks of DNA between cells without breaking them .
And now Venter and his team have successfully created a copy of the bacteria Mycoplasma mycoides in a lab , from scratch .

Because we needed more bacteria .
We can never get enough .

Mmmm .
Members of the science community are quick to point out that this is n't really artificial life .
Says Jim Collins , a synthetic biologist at Boston University , " Its genome is a stitched together copy of the DNA of an organism that exists in nature . "

And that 's somehow better ?
Hmmm , where have we seen stitched together organisms before ?
Oh yeah !

Gregory Kaebnick , a scholar at bioethics think tank the Hasting Center , plays the voice of reason in this little science drama , bringing up two valid concerns .
First , what happens when it escapes and runs amok ?
Answer :
We all die horribly , cursing Venter 's name .

Second , does this work cross the line where humans start playing God ?
Answer :
We all die horribly , cursing Venter 's name .
" Up until now , organisms have come into being on their own as it were , they 've evolved on their own . "
But Kaebnick says Venter 's work says that may not longer be the case .
" And for some that 's a troubling development .
Advertisement
And Venter 's response ?
" We decided that writing new biological software and creating new species , we could create new species to what we want them to do , not what they evolved to do . "

SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING !
Right now Venter plans to use his hungry children new species to help develop new fuels and medicines at his company Synthetic Genomics .

Future plans could involve staring out of the window of his penthouse office at the remains of the planet , a single tear rolling down his cheek .
Scientists Reach Milestone On Way To Artificial Life [ NPR ]
For graduates who want to leave a mark but not a carbon footprint , Harper College is offering biodegradable caps and gowns .
All 358 graduates will be wearing the " green " garments at Sunday 's commencement .
Among them will be Gladys Ljelu , who could n't be happier to make a green statement with her blue cap and gown .
" This shows we think about a better environment for future generations , not just future jobs and pay , " said Ljelu , 20 , of Palatine .
The fabric , found to decompose in soil in one year , is made from fiber found in natural wood , officials said .
Zippers are made of recycled plastic .
Other schools in the suburbs that will be using the gowns include Moraine Valley Community College in Palos Hills , Oakton Community College in Des Plaines , and Lake Forest College .
Previously , Harper rented gowns , but some students and faculty had concerns about chemicals used in the dry- cleaning process .
" The biodegradable gowns are more environmentally - friendly because we are not putting dry- cleaning chemicals into our water , so it 's much more green , " said Carl Dittburner , Harper professor and a member of the school committee that pitched the idea .
Other colleges , including the University of Chicago and Judson College in Elgin , are using gowns made fashioned from recycled bottles .
Although the ecologically responsible garments are available to high schools , most in the north and northwest suburbs , including Glenbrook High School District 225 , Highland Park - based District 113 , Palatine - based District 211 and Arlington Heights - based District 214 , are sticking with the traditional look this year .
District 60 in Waukegan is taking a different approach .
The school is collecting gently used graduation wear from recent graduates to offset the cost for low - income students .
Although the idea came to the school 's psychologist Pauline Williams after one student expressed concerns about graduation fees , the continuing program could eventually aid 61 percent of the schools ' student body considered low - income .
" This is good for those challenged by current economic conditions , " said Williams .
" And from a psychological standpoint , walking the stage does wonders for one 's self - esteem . "
More than 20 gowns have been donated to Waukegan High , saving some the $ 30 gown fee .
The price tag on the Harper eco-friendly gowns , considered indistinguishable from traditional attire , comes in at $ 36.50 , just $ 3 over 2009 costs .
Introduced last year , the biodegradable graduation gowns Harper is using were developed by Jostens , a Minneapolis - based firm specializing in graduation products .
The gowns were " designed based on feedback from students and educators and fills the primary need we heard that people would like to know that the fabric would decompose if discarded , " said Jostens ' Rich Stoebe .
Harper grad Gregory Ruffing , of Schaumburg , admits he is not a major environmental crusader but appreciates the earth - friendliness of the gowns .
The 19 - year - old is also pleased he wo n't have to return it after the ceremony .
" I 'll have time to take photos in the cap and gown with the respect they bring , " he said .
" I 'm the first person in my family to get a degree , so it 's a big step and it will be nice to keep the gown as a memory . "
Ljelu says her thoughts on graduation day will not be focused on the environment but rather on the new world she 's about to tackle .
" I 'll throw my cap , biodegradable or not , high in recognition of my accomplishments , " she said .
Dear Mr. Johnston ,
Thank you for your response attempting to assist me in my Nikon purchase .
However , I find your recommendation preposterous and extremely strange coming from a so - called expert .
First of all , the D700 at $ 2,450 is far beyond my budget , which I told you is $ 400 , and way too much overkill for a photographer just setting out , and your suggestion that I purchase 35 mm ƒ / 2 and 85 mm ƒ/1.8 lenses is strange .
Those lenses do n't even zoom ?
All of my friends use zoom lenses and that is all my local store carries .
I am somewhat mystified by your note .
Sincerely ,
George
-
Dear George ,
Yes , you are absolutely right , and I apologize .
Like many aficionados I am excessively affected by my own preferences and habits , and it leads me to give buying advice that is indeed idiosyncratic .
The suggestion that you jump in from the get - go with an investment of $ 3,195 is indeed preposterous ( good word ) .
I would like to make amends by suggesting an objectively more characteristic 25 - step course of action for you .
My experience in this field has demonstrated many times that this sequence is broadly very typical , and I think you will find that these new recommendations far more objectively trace the course of most serious photographers ' investments in their gear .
I apologize again — in what follows , I have used some current model names and numbers as representative of product types , even though what I 'm describing is usually a 3 – 5 year process and actual model numbers and prices will naturally change over that interval .
And I say the process as outlined contains 25 steps ; but you might well find there will be more .
Step 1 . Purchase a " digicam " or digital point - and - shoot , chiefly because that 's what most human beings do first when it occurs to them that they want a camera .
This will be preceded by approximately four months of troublesome and increasingly frustrating product research and shopping , during which time you will be learning how to shop but not how photograph .
Also during that time , you will be limited to taking pictures with your iPhone .
It gradually dawns on you that no one can give you perfectly satisfactory advice about buying a point - and - shoot , for the simple reason that there are roughly 13,796 of them on the market ( note : estimate only ) with dozens dropping off the cliff into discontinuation and dozens more being introduced all the time , making the search for " the best one " a shifting target even if you could tell them apart .
Eventually , lose patience and buy what the local local store counterman recommends , even though in the backmost reaches of your almost - subconscious you suspect that his high level of confidence might be motivated by the fact that he gets a spiff for selling that model because it has a higher profit margin than most of the others , and his boss is pushing him to push it .
With tax , it only comes in $ 30 over your absolute top budget number of $ 400 .
Belatedly , you will remember to check B&H Photo , which will be selling the same model , only with an extra card , for $ 236 .
Step 2 .
Be perfectly happy with your new purchase ... for about 2 1/ 2 months .
After that , slowly discover its infuriating shutter lag , the alarming slowness of its lens at full telephoto , its wretched high - ISO performance , and its general frailty and operational quirkiness .
Nevertheless , use said digicam for another 1.8 years as you doggedly and determinedly " get your money 's worth out of it , " even though you pretty much hate it the whole time .
Still , it 's always with you , you do a lot of snapping , photography 's fun .
Step 3 .
After the digicam fails utterly on an expensive vacation — just when you most needed it to work — buy a Canon G10 premium fixed - lens camera . ( $ 420 . )
Step 4 .
Three weeks later , G11 comes out .
Buy that ( $ 470 ) , sell G10 at $ 150 loss .
Step 5 . Realize that G10 actually has more megapixels than the G11 ; sell G11 ( $ 120 loss ) , buy another G10 .
Step 6 . Read about small vs. large sensors on the internet , realize you are not really very happy with the premium point - and - shoot category anyway , because it 's still mostly a point - and - shoot and you 've just kind of had it with point - and - shoots .
Sell second G10 for a $ 175 loss this time and graduate to an $ 800 entry - level DSLR , purchased with a " kit zoom . "
Again , that little voice that is almost buried in your subconscious mentions to you fleetingly that the kit zoom is where the company is saving money on the package price , despite the fact that the lens is what determines the essential look of the pictures .
The pictures look much better than the pictures from your now - dead p/s , though , and you 're sure — almost — that they look better than the pictures from the G10 / 11 , most of the time — so how bad could it be ?
Step 7 .
Some months later , following the happy congruence of a number of occurrences , namely , 1 ) an unexpected cash windfall , 2 ) your wife 's uncle 's ridicule of your " cheap " camera at a family gathering , 3 ) your own rather acute embarrassment at having to bring your camera to a rare paying job , during which you were pretty sure you saw your client looking askance at it ; 4 ) dozens more hours spent shopping , and 5 ) your reading of some 340,000 words on the internet ( approximately 1/12th of which were at all useful ) — purchase a D90 .
Sell the entry - level DSLR for 2/5 ths of what you paid for it , but keep the lens for the D90 .
( By the way , you still have your digicam .
It does n't work , ca n't be fixed economically , and is worth next to nothing on Ebay anyway , but for some strange reason — or , rather , just over 400 strange reasons — you cannot actually bring yourself to physically toss it in the wastebasket .
It sits in the closet now .
Note : the closet of which I speak is a seldom - mentioned but deeply significant vector very near the beating heart of photographic equipment shopping .
Step 8 .
Almost immediately after buying the D90 , begin dreaming of a D300s .
Step 9 .
Kit lens from entry - level DSLR seems a little forlorn on the D90 , and you 're wondering if it's " getting the most out of the sensor . "
Succumb to " metaphysical doubt " and insecurity , and purchase a magnificent do - everything , fast , premium normal zoom lens .
$ 630 .
Step 10 .
Because the camera is so awkward to carry with your new zoom — which you love , by the way — you inadvertently drop it .
Just once .
It survives , but the LCD is cracked , and you 're not quite 100 % certain , but you think some of the electronic menu settings have gone a bit wonky .
These imperfections eat at you , just a tiny bit , every time you use the camera .
Step 11 .
Purchase camera insurance .
Step 12 .
Due a perception that no serious photographer has just one serious lens , purchase a second lens to " cover all the focal lengths " and " complement " your main lens — another magnificent do - everything , fast , premium zoom lens , but telephoto .
$ 520 .
Step 13 .
Add a macro ; your zoom does n't seem to do close - ups very well .
Also $ 520 .
Step 14 .
Spend several dozen hours proving to yourself by reading and rereading lens tests until you 're bleary - eyed that your macro lens is as close to technically perfect as it is possible for a lens to be .
It 's super sharp !
Right out to the corners !
The tiny voice that wo n't shut up mentions to you that your macro pictures still kind of suck , and that there are approximately a Graham 's number of macro pictures on the internet already , almost all of which look ... well , more or less the same .
Step 15 .
Because you 're not quite satisfied , in a way you can't quite put your finger on , with the output of the tele zoom — it just does n't quite seem to satisfy you like the images from your main zoom does — you 're not quite sure what it is — you again dive into an extended bout of internet research and shopping , and resurface from a long immersion only with the purchase a truly magnificent , professional 80 – 200 mm , constant - aperture zoom .
$ 1080 .
You give the old tele zoom to your wife 's uncle 's teenage son , who immediately begins doing fantastic work with it after having suddenly come to the stunning realization that you exist .
Step 16 .
Troublingly , you find yourself increasingly leaving the camera bag at home , as it now weighs approximately the same , and is roughly the same size , as a concrete block .
Step 17 .
Wife buys you D300s for birthday !
Yay !
Best birthday present ever !
It 's love , pure love — for the wife , not the camera .
Sort of for the camera .
$ 1530 .
You would sell the D90 , but since it 's broken ....
You do mean to get it fixed .
It goes in the closet .
Step 18 .
F** king blo*dy tiny voice begins just the faintest , most distant murmur about full frame .
Step 19 .
Decide you are not a macro type of photographer .
In weak , trifling attempt to lighten bag , macro lens joins old entry - level kit zoom and broken point - and - shoot in closet .
Hey , you can always go get it if you need it .
Step 20 .
Now that you have your beautiful constant aperture pro tele zoom , your old " prosumer " mid-level normal zoom does n't seem to quite match any more .
So you buy a 17 – 55 mm ƒ/2.8 AF - S lens .
Which is truly awesome .
You totally love it .
$ 1,385 .
Old zoom goes on Ebay , fetches $ 230 after shipping and fees .
Step 21 .
You consider yourself completely set where equipment is concerned .
Completely set .
For all time .
You will never need anything more , ever .
Yet , for some reason , a nagging sense of ennui sets in where your photography hobby is concerned .
You realize , in a moment of exquisite clarity which also elicits just a faint touch of existential panic , that you miss shopping .
You find yourself diving into shopping for things you know you 're not going to buy .
Desultorily , you check prices , read reviews .
You find yourself getting uncharacteristically snarky on forums you frequent .
Then , wandering about in this strange wilderness where shopping is no longer called for , you read some idiot on the internet who maunders on an on about how fun it is to use just one small prime lens .
Completely on impulse , then , you snag a copy of the recently introduced 35 mm ƒ/1.8 . ( $ 200 . )
Amazingly , it is kind of nice — it makes the big D300 surprisingly handy , almost nimble .
Cue metaphors of bare feet , let - down hair , Julie Andrews in various meadows with her angelic sky - facing pie-hole exuding glorious plainsong .
You feel ... free .
Sure , it 's not that exciting as a lens , and it's a little too long if you 're being honest with yourself , but there 's no big bag to carry around .
It 's easy to grab on the way out the door .
To your surprise , your enjoyment ramps up again , much more than just noticeably .
Step 22 .
Shut up , tiny voice , shut up , shut up , shut up .
Step 23 .
Your activity as a photographer re-ignited , you suddenly get religion : you are going to buy the best , the very best , to put the demons to rest .
With a grim set to your mouth and a feeling of unstoppable determination , you purchase that D700 .
You had n't even really been considering it ; you were n't really that serious when you did all that research and read all those reviews .
Elation vies with guilt as you write the check .
$ 2,450 .
Little voice grumbles that your initial budget for this whole enterprise was $ 400 , but you tell it to shut up : the D700 now seems almost cheap to you compared to the D3s and D3x .
Wife is a tad cross and hurt : it 's only been a year and four months since the D300 birthday present .
Guiltily , you explain carefully that the D300 is a great backup and how you still really need it , really , how it 's still the best present ever , etc .
Of course , there 's a slight drawback to this : having told her you still need the D300s as a backup , you can't immediately turn around and sell it to offset the cost of the D700 like you really ought to .
Not right away , anyway .
And of course you need a lens for it , so you keep that beautiful normal zoom .
As a bright , shining symbol of your financial responsibility , you sell the macro lens on Ebay .
It brings $ 380 , of which $ 35 is shipping costs and Ebay fees .
She goes , " It 's your hobby .
I just want you to have what you want . "
Then she adds , " Honey , " giving you a look as if perhaps an incubus has invaded your body and taken over your soul .
Step 24 .
Slight problem with D700 : only one of your lenses — the big 80 – 200 mm , which , apart from the macro and the disused kit lens , is the one lens you own that you use the least — now works on your camera .
The rest are all APS -C lenses .
However , your spending has been out of control , you do have that slightly sick feeling of one who has indulged in something overmuch , your wife now looks somber and concerned whenever the subject of your hobby comes up , you 've put black electrician 's tape over the " D700 " on your new camera in hopes that your wife 's uncle wo n't notice the switch and tease you about it , and you 're ever so slightly worried about ... well , not your sanity , exactly — it 's not that bad — let 's just say , your previous reputation for level - headed practicality .
So , in a continuation of the " one lens " notion combined with a certain feeling of penitence , you go on Ebay and purchase a very modest used 35 mm ƒ/2 AF - Nikkor .
$ 250 .
Step 25 .
Although you 're mostly happy with the 35 mm , you do one simple head - and - shoulders portrait with the 80 – 200 mm zoom and find it to be ... well , preposterous ( sorry ! ) .
So you add a simple 85 mm ƒ/1.8 . $ 425 .
You mean to get a full - frame replacement for your beloved normal zoom for APS - C — someday ; you 're toying with the idea of another macro , but one that works on full - frame ; a wide zoom might be nice ; you occasionally wonder about this or that other lens ... but , really , when it gets right down to it , the lenses at either end of a postulated hypothetical 35 – 85 mm zoom do well enough for you most of the time .
And they 're fast .
And portable .
And cheap .
Besides , your files , while not perfect or automatically imbued with any special magic , are now about as good as it's reasonably possible for files to be , and you 've learned by this time — finally — that photography is a matter of learning to shoot , having the camera with you , learning to handle it as if it were second nature , gradually increasing the sophistication of your taste by looking at great work that appeals to you , learning to edit , and discovering your own visual passions , rather than being a matter of equipment .
Total elapsed time : 3 –5 years .
Over most of that time , you have n't been terribly happy with what you were shooting with .
( Remember that 1.8 - year stint with the point - and - shoot . )
End-point : D700 and two basic lenses .
Plus , that tele zoom that 's too heavy to carry around ( as well as a bunch of other things ) in that closet .
Total major equipment expenditures : $ 9,770 .
Of course , you mean to sell the D300s and the AF - S normal zoom — someday — but in point of fact you will probably just basically forget they exist and end up procrastinating until such time in the distant future when the camera , at least , is not worth all that much any more .
In the meantime , it 's your ... backup .
Honey .
An investment of $ 3,195 would have meant you 'd have been all set for 3 – 5 years , perfectly free to concentrate on taking pictures .
The expenditure would have amounted to between $ 1,065 and $ 639 per year for a very rewarding and renewable hobby .
It would have represented a savings of approximately 400 hours of shopping time , $ 6,575 in cash , and much needless agonizing over trivialities .
Anyway , George , I apologize again for recommending a D700 and two basic lenses even though you 're just starting out .
No doubt you will want to learn your own lessons , and make your own progress through a succession of gear , just as most photographers do .
In my own defense , I can only say that it does n't really matter anyway , since no one who asks me for purchasing advice ever actually follows that advice anyway !
( Really . )
But as you can probably deduce from the above , my initial recommendation to you possibly is n't quite as flat - out mad as it might on the surface appear .
But ...$ 400 ?
Please .
No one gets away with that .
Cordially ,
Mike

Featured Comment by Cameron : " It does n't have to be that way , though .
In six years of taking digital photographs , I 've owned three point - n- shoots and two digital SLRs .
The point - n- shoots were only replaced because they broke , not because I lusted after something better .
I upgraded from a Nikon D50 to a D90 after three years ; and then only because I got a chance to buy one second - hand for a price I could n't refuse .
As for the lenses , flashes , tripods , brief film phase and most recently a big Epson photo printer : guilty as charged !
But the thing that I want most at the moment is not more gear , but more time to take photographs with what I already own . "

The theme this time is defense .
And this time , along with the About the Corps “ opportunity book , ” it is a choice between folding speakers , a T - shirt , or a wristband instead of dog tags , a duffle bag , or a skullcap .
The Marine Corps recruiting literature that came in the mail to my son this time , thanks once again to the No Child Left Behind Act , contained no poster to show Marine Corps pride and no note from the Sergeant Major at the Marine Corps Recruiting Command , just a simple fold - out brochure .
I wrote about the packet with the poster and the note in “ The Few , the Proud , the High School Students . ”
On the cover of the brochure is a picture of a child with the caption : “ THE ONES YOU DEFEND . ”
When you open to the first page you see four Marines with rifles walking through a forest — no doubt in some foreign backwater that most Americans would have a hard time finding on a map — with the caption : “ THE ONES WHO DEFEND YOU . ”
Page 2 contains two short paragraphs :
You choose to become a Marine to defend the people at home and the American way of life .
As you earn this coveted title , you build an unbreakable bond with the men and women who earn it alongside of you .
You learn that by protecting each other , you serve all of your families , friends and neighbors at home .
You join a proud tradition of warriors who have defended our country this way for 234 years .
To find out how you can become part of the Corps , return the enclosed card .
We ’ll send you more information and your choice of Marine Corps folding speakers , T - shirt or wristband .
Or learn more today : Call us a 1 - 800 - MARINES and give code “ BOND ” or visit MARINES .

The back page has pictures of the folding speakers , T - shirt , and wristband under a large headline that reads : “ DEFEND THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT . ”
Attached to the brochure ( not enclosed ) are two reply cards — one for the high school student that reads : “ WILL YOU DEFEND THE ONES YOU LOVE ? ” and one for a friend that reads : “ KNOW A FRIEND WHO WILL DEFEND YOU ? ”
New to these reply cards is a question at the bottom : “ How likely is it that you will be serving in the military in the next four years ? ”
The choices are definitely , probably , probably not , and definitely not .

The theme of defense shows up on all four pages of the recruiting brochure plus the two reply cards .
But how much of what the U.S. military does is actually related to defense ?
What do the following practices of the military have to do with the defense of the United States ?
Providing disaster relief in foreign countries
Dispensing humanitarian aid in foreign countries
Supplying peacekeepers in foreign countries
Enforcing UN resolutions in foreign countries
Nation building in foreign countries
Spreading goodwill in foreign countries
Launching preemptive strikes in foreign countries
Fighting wars in foreign countries
Establishing democracy in foreign countries
Changing regimes in foreign countries
Assassinating people in foreign countries
Stationing troops in foreign countries
Maintaining bases in foreign countries
Containing communism in foreign countries
Training armies in foreign countries
Opening markets in foreign countries
Enforcing no-fly zones in foreign countries
Rebuilding infrastructure in foreign countries
Reviving public services in foreign countries
Promoting good governance in foreign countries
Invading foreign countries
Occupying foreign countries
Unleashing civil unrest in foreign countries
All the while , of course , perpetuating the myth that the military is defending our freedoms .
Rethinking the Good War Laurence M. Vance Best Price : null Buy New $ 5.95 ( as of 12:45 EST - Details )
The Department of Defense could n’t even defend its own headquarters on September 11th .
It was too busy occupying , defending , and building golf courses in other countries .
Most of the defense services that are actually provided today by the U.S. military are done in other countries .
Although World War II ended in 1945 , the United States still has tens of thousands of soldiers stationed in Germany , Italy , and Japan .
I recently documented that the U.S. military has over 700 foreign military bases with troops stationed in 148 countries and 11 territories in every corner of the globe .
The U.S. military should be limited to defending the United States , securing U.S. borders , guarding U.S. shores , patrolling U.S. coasts , and enforcing no - fly zones over U.S. skies instead of defending , securing , guarding , patrolling , and enforcing in other countries .
The U.S. military should be engaged exclusively in defending the United States , not defending other countries , and certainly not attacking , invading , or occupying them .
Using the military for any other purpose than the actual defense of the United States perverts the purpose of the military .
The Marines may be looking for a few good high school students , but my son is not available .
Is yours ?
Do you want your son to be a bomber pilot for Obama ?
Aside from the military ’s lack of actually providing defense services , I have given other reasons for people not to join the military here , here , here , here , and here .
By the way , my son will not be sending in the reply card this time either — or getting the folding speakers , T - shirt , or wristband .

The IRS puts out an interesting tax document each year , looking at the returns of the nation ’s 400 highest income tax paying people .
The most recent year of complete data is 2007 , when 143 million individuals filed tax returns .
Some of the data is quite astonishing :
• The top 400 U.S. individual taxpayers got 1.59 % of the nation ’s household income in 2007 — 3X the p % they got in the 1990s .
•
The top 400 paid 2.05 % of all individual income taxes in 2007 .
•
Only 220 of the top 400 were in the top marginal tax bracket .
•
Average tax rate of the 400 = 16.6 % — the lowest since the IRS began tracking the 400 in 1992 .
• Minimum annual income to make the top 400 = $ 138.8 million .
• Top 400 reported $ 137.9 billion in income ; they paid $ 22.9 billion in federal income taxes .
• 81.3 % of income was from capital gains , dividends or interest .
Salaries and wages ?
Just 6.5 % . •
The top 400 list changes from year to year : 1992 -2007 , it contained 3,472 different taxpayers ( out of a maximum 6400 ) .
Happy tax day to you to !

A Look at the Tax Returns of the Top 400 Taxpayers

In a move that took just about everybody by surprise , German President Horst Koehler stepped down on Monday , citing comments he made about Afghanistan , which he said had been misconstrued .
A visibly emotional Koehler , with his wife at his side , resigned in a televised press conference , saying : " I am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect . "
" It was an honor for me to serve Germany as president , " he said .
" I thank the many people in Germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work .
I ask for you to understand my decision . "
His wife Eva Luise was by his side during the announcement
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said he " deeply regretted " Mr. Koehler 's decision and had tried to change his mind , but the president " decided otherwise . "
Bavaria 's State Premier , Horst Seehofer , said Mr. Koehler " had won the sympathies of the German people and was widely respected abroad . "
The president 's resignation caught Germany 's political parties completely off guard .
Chancellor Angela Merkel was reportedly only informed of the decision shortly before the public announcement .
After she was informed of his decision , Merkel cancelled a planned afternoon visit to the training camp of the German national soccer team , which is currently training in northern Italy for the World Cup next month .
At a press conference in Berlin some two hours later , the chancellor said she was stunned and surprised by Mr. Koehler 's decision and had " unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind . "
She also said " the people of Germany would be very sad about the resignation . "
Koehler said , besides Merkel and Westerwelle , he had also informed the president of the Federal Constitutional Court , Andreas Vosskuhle , and Jens Boehrnsen , the president of the upper house of parliament , the Bundesrat .
The resignation comes at an extremely inopportune time for the chancellor , whose center - right coalition recently lost an important state election in North Rhine - Westphalia and suffered another resignation of a key ally , Hesse State Premier Roland Koch , just last week .
Koehler recently visited ISAF troops
Announcing his decision , Mr. Koehler refused to defend himself against accusations that he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons , saying that to do so was unworthy of the high office he held .
In the past few days , Koehler had been under fire for saying that a country like Germany , which was heavily reliant on foreign trade must know that military interventions could be necessary to uphold German interests .
Koehler said his comments were " misunderstood " and that his remarks were not meant to refer to the mission in Afghanistan , where Germany has 4,500 troops in a NATO - led force fighting a Taliban - led insurgency .
Polls show that a majority of Germans are opposed to the mission in Afghanistan .
But the government has not yet fixed a date for withdrawal from the unpopular mission .
A former managing director of the International Monetary Fund , Koehler was elected to the post of president in 2004 and re-elected in 2009 .
According to the German constitution , Boehrnsen will temporarily take over the president 's duties .
A new president will need to be sworn in by June 30 .

When Tiger Woods finally emerged from his trip through the wilderness of marital infidelity , he vowed to make some life changes .
One of them was to reconnect to Buddhism , the religion of his youth .
It 's fair to say Buddhism could make him a better person .
But here 's a scary notion for the rest of the PGA Tour :
There 's a reasonable chance it could make him a better golfer , too .
A ...
In his new home , a hotel halfway between Chester and Wrexham , Gareth Thomas walks up and down the same corridor every day .
On his way to and from breakfast and dinner , Thomas is reminded constantly that he now lives in a hotel which specialises in hosting elaborate weddings .
The walls leading from the foyer to the restaurant are covered in soft - focus photographs of beaming brides and grinning grooms , their smiles as big as their hairstyles .
It 's almost as if , in their wedded bliss , the framed couples are watching Thomas trying to adjust to his strange new life as a divorced , gay rugby player who has just switched from union to league .
Thomas , a former captain of Wales and the Lions who made 103 Test appearances , has become the only high - profile openly gay man in British sport – while playing rugby league for the aptly - named Crusaders .
" My first experience of moving here six weeks ago was funny , " the 35 - year - old says .
" After all the years of thinking , whenever people looked at me , ' Can they guess I 'm gay ? ' , it was different when I got here .
Everybody knows I 'm gay now .
Everybody . "
Thomas laughs throatily , rubbing the tattoos on his heavily muscled upper arms as if reassuring himself that those changed perceptions , since he came out publicly last December , have been mostly positive .
He has made life even more challenging by , at the same time , attempting to master the intricacies of a different code of rugby with a recently formed Super League club .
But his sexuality , at least for now , overshadows everything .
" Tell me about it , " he chuckles .
" I love the Crusader lads to bits .
They 're brilliant .
But for two weeks me being gay was n't mentioned .
That means it 's lurking there .
Our captain , Ryan O'Hara , is a real good bloke , an Aussie , and we get on great .
But we were all standing around the physio room and Ryan said : ' Did anyone hear about Ricky Martin [ the singer who came out in March ] ? '
One of the other guys jumped in and said : ' Ah , we 've got rugby this afternoon . '
It was his way of changing the subject but the whole room went quiet .
I got up and walked out because it felt uncomfy . "
Thomas shakes his head , looking briefly pained .
" Then , " he says , brightening , " three days later , we all went out for a beer and Ryan sat me down and said : ' Mate , how are you being gay – and all the boys knowing ? '
I just shouted : ' Halle - fucking - lujah ! '
" The boys looked over and I shouted out to them as well .
' Boys , ' I said , ' I so respect the way you 've handled this .
But it 's OK – you can talk about it . '
It was such a respect thing they showed me but it 's much better now .
Since then many of them have sat me down , one to one , and said : ' Mate , we 've got so much time for what you 've done .
It 's so brave , so powerful . '
" But I love them taking the piss .
We 've got another Australian on the wing , Nick Youngquest , and he 's a gay icon .
He 's been on the cover of Attitude but he 's comfortable in his [ straight ] sexuality .
It still gives the boys a laugh because they say to me : ' Oooo , he 's not so happy now you 're taking over . '
Me and Nick are good mates and we 'll walk in the room together and someone will shout : ' Here come the girls ! ' "
Thomas laughs again , until he is asked to explain his contrasting feelings when , against Castleford in his second match , he was abused by opposition fans .
" I have to break it up into pieces to understand .
I hate the word ' pioneer ' but there 's no escaping the fact I 'm the first .
So for me to get abuse is , in a weird way , a good thing .
" Afterwards the Rugby League Commission fined Castleford .
We went to Bradford the week after and I was told the stewards had been briefed that if there was any abuse aimed at me then they had to eject those fans because they did n't want to be fined .
The next [ gay ] person that follows me will be glad I 've opened the door because they 're not going to get the same abuse . "
There is still a vulnerability to Thomas which he might not have dared reveal when he was regarded as a hard man of Welsh rugby .
He looks up ruefully when asked why he chooses to live in a hotel .
" I 'm un - self - sufficient , " he says .
" I can't look after myself .
I really can't .
So here is good for me .
I have my meals made .
I have my bed made .
The girls on reception are lovely .
And I like the interaction with people .
I do n't like being on my own .
" I 'm always buying the girls chocolate and flowers – just to be nice .
And then I chat with them to see how their day has gone .
They like it because , otherwise , they 're bored as shit .
And then I 'll banter with the boys in the restaurant .
It means I do n't feel lonely . "
What about those moments when , alone , he walks down the corridor of wedding photos ?
Is it not , sometimes , unbearable ?
" I had that feeling yesterday .
That was the feeling that kicked me in the guts . "
It takes a moment to realise he is not mocking the cheesy photographs .
He is , instead , mourning his wife .
" Jemma 's in Spain now , and I 'm here .
I know that has to be the right place for both of us .
But not a day goes by when I do n't think about her , when I do n't miss her .
It was n't right , what I was doing to her , but that does n't change the fact I really loved her .
" Yesterday I could n't stop thinking where would I be now , with Jemma , if things had been different .
You come to a crossroads and you take one road because it 's right for you .
But that does n't stop you wondering where the other road might have led .
A lot of people can't understand what me and Jemma had .
They think , ' You 're gay so how can you love this woman at the same time ? '
But I would n't change it for the world .
Jemma said the same .
So when people tell me I was wrong to marry her I want to say , ' You do n't know how I felt .
You do n't know how much I loved her .
You do n't know how much it broke me up to see her heart breaking . '"
His voice is ragged , but Thomas keeps talking .
" So many of our friends split up for pathetic reasons .
But Jemma and I had to separate because of something huge .
We had something that would have gone on forever otherwise .
But I had to let her go .
I was crying yesterday because I felt all the emotions from when I was having to tell Jemma about me being gay .
It brought back the memories of so many bad times but , also , so many good times . "
That poignant backdrop has been accentuated by the matching response of Jemma – who has said she is more proud of her ex-husband now than she has ever been .
It is a reaction apparently shared by her family .
" They 've been brilliant , " Thomas says .
" I got a message from Jemma 's dad .
He said , ' I 've heard about your move into rugby league , mate , and I 'm just calling to wish you all the best . '
Amazing . "
Thomas 's own parents have been even more supportive , despite his surprising admission : " I do n't think I 've ever told them I 'm gay .
When me and Jemma split they kind of put two and two together .
At the time I could n't really say the word ' gay ' because I was n't ready .
Now I know they know and so we have n't had the big dramatic conversation .
" When I announced it publicly I asked them if they wanted to read the article first but dad said , no , it was OK .
I went to see them the night it came out and I thought they'd be tired .
But mum insisted on opening some champagne .
She said it was a celebration of the rest of my life and so there I sat , drinking champagne with them , thinking how daft I 'd been to worry for so many years about them finding out . "
His fears were understandable .
" My old man works in the postal service , my mum in a hospital and my brother in a factory .
They 're my family and when I play rugby I 'm representing them .
But coming out was different .
More than anyone , I feared for my father .
I used to be a postman myself and so I know that working environment .
It 's a macho world and I was worried about him going into work and hearing bad things about me .
But I think he 's 10 times prouder of me now than six months ago . "
Thomas looks up , eyes gleaming , when I ask if his mother is a Crusaders fan ?
" She 's a big Alfie fan , mate , " he says , alluding to his nickname .
" She 's the same as any mum .
Mind you , they 've just signed up to Sky so they can watch me . "
This Sunday they will be able to watch their beloved Alfie playing for the Crusaders in the Challenge Cup against the Catalans Dragons on the BBC .
" If we win it , " he enthuses , " we 'll be in the quarters and two matches away from Wembley . "
Thomas , who had his best game for Crusaders last Saturday , during a 19 - 0 demolition of Bradford , is clearly improving and adapting to the sheer physicality of league .
" I recently made 17 carries in one game .
I felt it the next morning because , as a wing in union , you make 17 carries in a season .
But I love it . "
He might still be a raw league novice , after only six weeks in the game , but time is closing in fast on Thomas 's tumultuous sporting career .
" It 's scary , and I 'll miss the dressing room most of all .
If you could bottle that special feeling you sometimes get in a dressing room just before a match , you 'd be a billionaire .
But I 'm working on this company we 've set up called Distinct Management – it will help sportsmen and creative people by looking after their business and practical needs while they focus on their careers .
I 'm excited about that . "
It 's raining again outside , and Thomas scrunches up his face when asked if he is feeling better than he had done the previous day .
" Mate , the richest man in the world has his down days .
The most famous man in the world has his down days .
It 's life .
But , for me , the rainy moments are isolated moments .
I 'm always at least half - full .
And the rest of the time I 'm smiling – all the way up to the brim . "
VHS Generation loss
Have you ever wondered how many times a VHS tape can be copied before the quality gets so bad , you ca n’t even tell what it is anymore ?
I actually tried this experiment back in 2002 when I had a little too much extra time on my hands .
Using two VHS tapes , I copied the footage back and forth until it deteriorated beyond being watchable .

Then one day she left me .
That 's when I grew into a deep depression .
However that depression did not stop me from continuing to have sex with fruit .
I was completely satisfied , even in my depressed state .
If you cut the correct size hole into anything , it could be magical .
When I ejaculated I of course would throw it away .
But there was one time or two the sex was so amazing I kept it around for another go - round .
Then came the day when I got over the evil women who had broke my heart .
I started to hate everything about her .
Which brought me to a point where my I started to doubt weather or not I should continue to enjoy having sex with fruit since she introduced me to it .
Around that time I was very confused on what I should do next I happened to see the evil wench .
I happened to be on a different side of town and needed to run to the store for some fruit rollups ( ironic I know ) for my neice 's lunch the next day .
I strolled into the grocery store like nothing .
I was just about to make a comment inside my head how ghetto the store was when I saw her .
I had heard rumors that she had moved on and was seeing someone .
But this time she was solo .
I pretended I did not see her but it was too late .
She spotted me .
DAMN !
I knew I should have gone to another checkout lane .
I said hello and he had a forced short conversation .
I could not help but notice THE FUCKING FRUIT SHE WAS BUYING !
You fucking cunt , like I am not supposed to know what those bananas , apples , oranges were for ?
I was pissed .
I decided no more sex with fruit .
That was the final straw .
Fuck that bitch and her kinky sexual outlets .
That lasted all but a few days but then I began to get horney .
NO !
I could n't do it .
I toss all the fruit out my window .
I WAS DONE !
I had never paid for sex and was n;t exactly sure how to go about doing that without getting caught so that was out of the question .
I need stimulation !
I needed something !
Then as a spontanious desperate act I slammed my penis into the peanut butter .
The soft sticky goo made me melt inside .
What was this utopia of sexual pleasure that I had discovered ?
I did not know what was more pleasing .
The sex with the peanut butter jar or having the dog lick it off afterwards .
So to my ex .... fuck you .
I am over you and over sex with fruit .
I have moved on myself .
To a new avenue of pleasure .
And it does n't involve anything you ever taught me .
ABC News / Washington
Post have released a poll today showing the various demographics that remain steadfast in their belief Pres. Barack Obama was not born in the United States .
The biggest surprise ?
A third of these “ birthers ” seem totally fine with the idea that the President was n’t born in America .
First , let ’s figure out how many of these birthers there are .
According to the poll , 20 % of Americans believe Obama was born abroad ( check out the results in chart form ) .
Of those 20 % , 10 % say it ’s just a “ suspicion only . ”
Phrased another way ( “ Where was Barack Obama born , as far as you know ? ” ) , 68 % said the U.S. , while 14 % said another country and 19 % said they did n’t know .
Ok , that ’s a lot of birthers .
But guess what – some of the birthers really like Obama , despite him being from another country !
Washington Post ‘s Dave Weigel highlights the birthers - favor - Obama stat :
The more interesting part of the poll is that 31 percent of people who think Obama was born in another country approve of his job performance , and 34 percent give him a favorable rating .
That validates a theory of mine — that many so - called birthers do n’t actually hold Obama ’s ( to them ) foreign - ness against him , or think it ’s a way to oust him from the presidency .
They have little information , they know he ’s half African , and they jump to conclusions .
This sort of birther non-nonchalance is echoes by another stat from the poll – 15 % are Democrats , 12 % call themselves “ liberal ” and 11 % identified themselves as Obama VOTERS IN 2008 .
A non-U.S. citizen in the White House ?
That ’s change some Americans can believe in .

Mountain Gorilla Facts Infographics
Mountain Gorillas Prefer Forests on Mountains Most mountain gorillas can be found in West and Central Africa .
Although their name implies that they simply live on mountains , mountain gorillas actually prefer forested mountains .
Most of these animals can be found living on green volcanic slopes , which is their preferred habitat .
Apart from the Virungas Mountains , mountain gorillas can also be found in Uganda ’s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park .
Mountain Gorillas Eat Roots and Bark Mountain gorillas are herbivores , which means they consume a vegetarian diet .
Mountain gorillas live in forests , which is where they find their food .
Mountain gorilla troops feed on a variety of plant matter including roots , tree bark , pulp , plants , fruit , leaves , shoots and wild celery .
Baby mountain gorillas rely on their mothers ’ milk for sustenance .
They are only fully weaned at approximately three and a half years old , when they will start eating the adult diet .
Mountain gorillas do n’t need water because they get sufficient moisture from the plants that they eat .

Mountain Gorillas Have a Distinctive Appearance
At first glance , all gorillas might appear to look the same .
However , it is possible to tell the different species apart .
Mountain gorillas tend to be a bit bigger than other species of gorillas .
They also tend to have longer hair and shorter arms than other gorillas .
This thicker fur acts as insulation , keeping them warm when the weather on the mountain gets cold .
Male mountain gorillas have an additional crest of fur on their heads which is not evident in the females .
Mountain Gorilla Troops
Have a Complex Hierarchy
Many of the most fascinating mountain gorilla facts relate to the structure of their troops .
Mountain gorillas live in troops of up to 30 gorillas .
The head of each troop is a dominant older adult male .
The alpha male is usually at least 12 years old .
This male leader is often called a silverback because of the patch of silvery gray fur on his back .
Apart from this male , a troop will also consist of young males , some female gorillas , and their young .
Mountain Gorillas Are Active Creatures
The male leader of each troop will organize the activities for that group of gorillas .
Although mountain gorillas can climb trees , they are usually found on the ground .
Their activities include eating , nesting in leaves , and moving around their home range .
Mountain Gorillas Are Only Aggressive if Challenged Mountain gorillas are usually calm and do n’t display aggressive behavior .
However , this all changes if a mountain gorilla , especially the alpha male , is disturbed or challenged .
The fact that these animals have immense physical power is one of the mountain gorilla facts that indicate you should treat them with caution .
If threatened , the male leader will roar , bark or hoot very loudly .
He will also stand upright , pound his chest , throw things , and even make aggressive charges .
A female mountain gorilla will fight to the death to protect her offspring .
Baby Mountain Gorillas
Are Vulnerable Although adult mountain gorillas possess incredible physical strength , the same cannot be said of the youngsters .
Like humans , female gorillas have a nine - month pregnancy and tend to give birth to one baby .
From the age of 10 , female gorillas can produce offspring .
Newborn mountain gorillas are tiny : they only weigh approximately four pounds ( two kilograms ) .
These babies are only able to cling to their mother ’s fur .
From the age of four months , they will ride on their mothers ’ backs and will continue to travel like this for the next two or three years .
A female gorilla will usually produce two to six offspring in her lifetime .
Young Mountain Gorillas Resemble Human Children
One of the more surprising mountain gorilla facts is that young mountain gorillas are said to resemble human children .
Researchers and other human observers regularly note the similarities in behavior between human children and mountain gorillas when they are three to six years old .
These young mountain gorillas like to spend their days playing together , as do children .
They are often seen climbing trees , swinging from branch to branch , and chasing each other .
The forest is their playground !

Mountain Gorillas Build New Nests Daily
One of the lesser known mountain gorilla facts is that the gorillas will build a new nest every day .
This is because mountain gorillas are nomadic : they constantly move around their home range .
Every evening the troop will be in a different place , and the gorillas have to construct new nests for the night .
Mountain gorillas make their nests from readily available materials such as grasses and bent branches .
Mountain Gorillas Fall Victim to Human Political Violence Around half the mountain gorilla population lives in Central Africa .
They live in the forests of the Virunga Mountains .
The green volcanic slopes that the mountain gorillas prefer are found in Uganda , Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
One of the most disheartening mountain gorilla facts is that these countries have experienced extensive political violence , which has negatively affected the mountain gorilla population .
Mountain Gorillas are Very Intelligent Researchers have discovered many intriguing mountain gorilla facts .
One of these facts is that gorillas are known to display significant intelligence .
This is particularly noticeable in gorillas that have been kept in captivity .
Some of the gorillas have even learned to communicate with people using simple human sign language !
Mountain Gorillas Are Endangered
With a worldwide population of around just 880 , mountain gorillas are endangered .
They constantly face threats relating to habitat loss , civil war and poaching .
Baby gorillas are also illegally traded as research subjects , pets , and animals for private zoos .
Fortunately , there are several conservation efforts that are aimed at trying to protect mountain gorillas .
Recent research shows that their numbers are steady , and might even be on the increase .

The New York Times ’ Isabel Kershner reports more than 10 dead and then offers the following grotesque commentary : " The criticism [ of Israel over the attack ] offered a propaganda coup to Israel ’s foes , particularly the Hamas group that holds sway in Gaza . "
A coup is a blow .
Is it possible for the Times to report who has suffered a blow here ?
Is the Times capable of supplying disturbing information from Israel without seeking to couch it in criticism of others ?

Star Wars : The Empire Strikes back is one of the best science fiction films ever made .
It 's also 30 years old today , so we give you official permission to feel old .
While every movie in the original trilogy is endlessly quoted and referenced in pop culture , Empire Strikes Back is the film that comes the closest to being a great movie .
The film is jet black in tone .
Luke lost the only person he knew that connected him to his father , and to the legacy of the Jedi Knights , when Obi-Wan was struck down by Vader in A New Hope ( or as older Ars staffers still refer to it , Star Wars ) .
Han Solo is biding his time with the rebels before leaving to return to his life of being a professional smuggler and scoundrel ; the bounty on his head is becoming too much to bear .
The rebels may have destroyed the Death Star , but they 're still undersupplied and on the run , holed up on a frozen hell of a planet .
Darth Vader is scouring space to find them , and he seems oddly preoccupied with a young pilot named Luke Skywalker .
It only goes downhill from there .
Lucas backed off , to the credit of the film
Empire Strikes Back may have had the least input from George Lucas , and the all - too - human characters and dialog is proof that this was a good move .
The film was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan , based on story notes from Lucas .
Star Wars is above everything else a grand adventure , and Kasdan would go on to write another legendary pulpy adventure when he penned Raiders of the Lost Ark .
Watch the opening scenes with Han Solo at Echo Base as Harrison Ford chews the scenery with glee .
" Then I 'll see you in hell ! " he calls to another soldier after being told that it 's suicide to go after a lost Luke Skywalker .
Kasdan knew how to write for Ford 's charms , and Han Solo steals the scenes he 's in .
Mark Hamill suffered a car accident before filming began , which lead to the Wampa attack and healing process in the film to explain his scarred face .
Skywalker seems lost in the movie , nearly dying on Hoth and fighting his impetuous nature during his training with Yoda .
Near the end , he is soundly beaten by Darth Vader in their first confrontation , losing both his hand and a piece of his soul when he finds out why Vader has been hunting him with such single - mindedness .

It 's impossible to watch Empire without noticing the striking visual direction of Irvin Kershner , who went on to direct ...
Robocop 2 ? Echo
Base looked like an actual military base , and the AT - AT assault on the installation as the rebels bravely try to buy their friends time to escape by counter - attacking with outgunned Snowspeeders was amazing .
Who can forget the first glimpse we 're given of the four - legged mechanical beasts through the binoculars of a rebel soldier ?
Luke Skywalker was first and foremost a pilot before he was a Jedi , and this gave us another chance to catch a glimpse of the leader he could become .
Yoda proved latex was more powerful than a computer
It 's not worth dragging the new trilogy out to beat it up again , but pay attention to Yoda in this film and contrast him with the soulless creation of the later films .
Brought to life in both physical performance and voice by Frank Oz , Yoda in Empire Strikes Back was emotional , sly , and as the movie progressed , we began to see the hidden wisdom .
This was also the first real explanation we were given of the Force , and Yoda was an eloquent teacher , speaking of a religion he had spent his life studying .
Luke tries to convince Yoda to teach him the Jedi arts , but Yoda quickly shames him .
" A Jedi must have the deepest commitment , the most serious mind .
This one a long time have I watched , " Yoda says .
" All his life has he looked away ... to the future , to the horizon .
Never his mind on where he was .
What he was doing .
Adventure .
Heh. Excitement .
Heh .
A Jedi craves not these things .
You are reckless . "
Everyone focuses on the " do or do not " line from Luke 's training sequences , but the ensuing speech is much better .
Yoda is trying to convince Skywalker that he is able to lift his ship out of the swamp where it rests .
Luke , of course , thinks the task is impossible .
This is why Yoda tells him :
Size matters not .
Look at me .
Judge me by my size , do you ?
And well you should not .
For my ally is the Force , and a powerful ally it is .
Life creates it , makes it grow .
Its energy surrounds us and binds us .
Luminous beings are we , not this crude matter .
You must feel the Force around you ; here , between you , me , the tree , the rock , everywhere , yes .
Even between the land and the ship .
These are n't hollow words , as Yoda proceeds to lift Luke 's sunken X - Wing from the swamp using the Force .
While Lucas later thought Yoda needed to fight to seem like a powerful character , this feels better : Yoda proves his strength by calmly doing what seems to be the impossible .
Luke is energized by the act , but Yoda seems defeated .
" I do n't believe it ! "
Skywalker says breathlessly .
" That is why you fail , " is the reply .
This is good writing , and compelling characters .
In the prequel trilogy , we learn that the Force is just parasites in our blood .
In Empire it 's something magical , something that lives inside all of us .
We are told that we can do amazing things by mastering our feelings and believing in something greater than ourselves .
We are , as Yoda puts it , luminous beings , not just flesh and blood .
Is it any surprise this movie remains so amazing to children and adults alike ?
He 's got a cape , a Lobot , and he can talk to the ladies
Lando Calrissian .
Even the name has a certain flair to it .
He runs Cloud City , trying to make something approaching an honest living while staying under the Empire 's radar .
It does n't work , as we all know , and the scene where the door opens to reveal Darth Vader sitting down to dinner like he 's simply waiting for some friends is more shocking for the civility of the setting .
Lando is n't a bad guy .
Like the best characters in film , he has his own motivations , and is trapped inside an impossible situation .
Lose everything , or give up an old friend who happens to be flying around the galaxy in your old ship ?
( Is there any quote from the new trilogy that 's as good as Han Solo 's parting shot to Leia ?
" I love you ! " she tells
Han as he 's lowered into the carbonite chamber to become Jabba 's favorite decoration .
" I know , " is his reply , as he waits for his fate . )
Calrissian later comes around , but things are bleak .
Luke is told the truth about his father after leaving Yoda 's training too early , although that timeframe has always been slightly confusing if you stop to think about it .
The second film in the original trilogy puts all the characters in the worst situations possible , and it ends without resolving much .
Han Solo is gone , but there is a rescue mission being planned .
Luke is left to deal with the fact that everything he thought he knew has been a clever falsehood meant to guard him from his past .
Then we get credits .
Even standing alone , before we 're introduced to Ewoks and a giant space slug that 's also a gangster , this is an amazing film .
How best to watch it now ?
There is no Blu-ray version of the original trilogy , and the only DVDs available have been covered in CGI , color - corrected , and smoothed endlessly so that none of the original film grain can be seen .
They 're flashy , overly bright , hollow versions of the film we remember .
While we 'll likely never get an official release that 's worth a damn — read the amazing story of the original copy of the film from the incomparable Secret History of Star Wars site to learn why — there is a bootleg version of the Laserdisc edition that continues to look amazing , sound great , and Han continues to shoot first .
Edit :
In 2006 there was a DVD release of the original trilogy that was unaltered , and this is another good place to start .
While the transfer is non-anamorphic widescreen and the sound is only presented in 2.0 stereo , it is certainly worth a damn .
Thanks to the comments for pointing this out .
In conclusion
Empire Strikes Back is a science fiction movie with a soul and a beating heart .
The characters are put in peril , they say interesting things to each other , and they learn about themselves and the world around them .
Why is this such a great movie when the rest of the series is so flawed ?
It 's endlessly arguable , but it does n't take away from the fact that it's a film that stands the test of time , and remains a grand adventure .
Happy 30th birthday , Empire .

A pro-Palestinian activist is evacuated to a hospital in Jerusalem .
At least 10 pro-Palestinian activists were killed after Israeli commandos stormed a convoy of ships carrying supplies for the Gaza Strip on May 31 .
Greta Berlin , co-founder of the Free Gaza Movement , an organizer of the convoy , spoke with RFE / RL's Azerbaijani Service correspondent Anna Zamejc about the deadly event .
We were attacked by Israeli militaries .
We were flotilla , six civilian ships and about 4:30 this morning Israeli " commandos , " if that 's what you want to call them , rappelled down off a helicopter and landed at least on the deck of the Turkish [ ship ] , not sure about the other one , looked around and started to shoot at us .
They have killed 10 people that we know of -- that 's the number I 'm going to stick with right now until I get further confirmation .
Then they commandeered the ships and forced them to go in the Ashdod port .
They were several members of parliament on board , including MPs from Sweden , Norway , and Germany .
We were 70 miles off the coast of Israel , they attacked us .
That is a crime ; they committed a crime on international waters .
I suppose , if you consider the paper and wheelchairs and crutches weapons , then the Israelis might have a point .
Look , everyone on those ships was inspected before we left .
The only weapons that were on board belonged to the Israelis .
They might have planted them -- after all they stormed us and they killed us .
All you have to do is to look at the statistics what actually happened .
We have at least 10 people dead , they were civilians !
They stormed our boats !
We have manifest on every one of those boats that say what is on those boats .
And it was 4:30 in the morning when everybody is sleeping .
I will venture to say that Israel is lying about this , because the weapons that I saw coming on board this morning belonged to Israel .
If there were weapons , they planted those weapons .
I do n't know yet , we have heard nothing .
We have heard nothing from the ships , they 've jammed all our communication , they took all our cell phones away , we have not been able to communicate with anybody since 3:30 this morning , Cyprus time .
Yes , it 's what I 've heard but we have n't confirmed it .
Nobody has any firm information about people who were killed and wounded .
Since August 2009 the Free Gaza Movement has gone nine times to Gaza .
The first five we entered Gaza , we took members of parliament on our yard and nothing was done to us .
There were many , many threats .
Israel has threatened us all along , the last thing they want is for the people of Gaza to be free and to be able to rebuild their society .
We went in five times , the last three were brutally stopped and we only had one boat .
So the Free Gaza Movement along with four other partners said : " We would not go back to Gaza again unless we have a flotilla .
We need to take something substantive , not just sort of a token that says : 'we support your desire to be free . '
We want to take back a substantive amount of supplies and take them into Gaza . "
And that 's what we get .
Israel is terrified that if we open up a sea route to Gaza , Gaza eventually will be free and will have its own might to do its own trade .
Gaza is the only territory in the world that has no access to its sea .
Every other territory that borders water or an ocean has the right to its territory except for Gaza .
We were trying to say to the world : a million and half people who live in Gaza are in outdoor prison and Israel has no right to do it .
That 's another reason Israel is terrified .
Because the small amount of supplies we brought in on the yard was very small , they were just tokens .
We 're coming in with 10,000 tons of supplies Israel refuses to allow into Gaza .
Israel only allows 81 items into Gaza .
They wo n't allow any rebuilding supplies , they do n't allow paper , they do n't allow crayons for the children , they do n't allow jam , they do n't allow chocolate .
We did n't bring anything in on those ships except items that were already forbidden by Israel and were forbidden for the people of Gaza could not rebuild their infrastructure .
We had cement , water - purification systems , prefab homes , 20 tons of paper -- Israel does n't allow the people of Gaza to print their own books .
So there was n't any way that Israel was going to take this easily because we have said to the world that Israel occupied Gaza and they are treating people as so they have the right to commit a slow - motion genocide on them and it has n't gotten in and we will still continue to try to do that , then we will be successful opening a sea lane from Gaza to the rest of the world .
I can only speak for the Free Gaza Movement , we are one of five partners .
Every single one of our passengers has been vetted .
They had to have two recommendations before they get on board and we know exactly who was on board .
But frankly , as far as I 'm concerned , the only terrorist we saw this morning was Israel .
I 'm the wrong person to ask , you need to ask the Turks .
Because the people Israel is accusing of being terrorists , were on the Turkish ship .
We are responsible only for our own passengers .
No , I do n't acknowledge any of that .
The terrorists that came on board that boat last night were Israelis .
They came armed to the teeth , they killed at least 10 of us , none of them were killed .
For all I know , there was one wounded in some kind of a scuffle .
But they do this all the time , they kill a hundred Palestinians to every one Israeli .
Now they 're killing 10 peaceful activists who were showing up in blue jeans .
That is no excuse .
If they thought there were any terrorists on board , they could have boarded the boat the way they did last summer , arrested the passengers , taken them off to jails .
They did not need to have this kind of force .
I do think that Israel is becoming ostracized among the world community the way South Africa was .
Between the Lebanon war , Operation Cast Lead last year , and now attacking civilians on board what I call " ships of mercy , " I think it 's probably high time for the governments of the world to tell Israel , " You ca n't do this anymore .
"
We 're doing this because the governments have refused to hold Israel accountable for its war crimes .
So when governments do n't do that , then civil society has an obligation do that .
This is why the Free Gaza Movement has been , in fact for the last two years to begin with , is to tell the world that Israel has no right to practice collective punishment on a people that are occupied .
And Israel in fact is occupying them because they do n't get anything that does n't go through Israel first .
So this is a real challenge for Israel , because we are challenging their status quo of being able to hold 1.5 million people in prison .
Canadian aid agencies that offer health care to women in the developing world have no problem describing the condoms they distribute and education they provide as part of a family - planning program .
But ask if abortion services are included in their health - care repertoire , they clam up .
It 's a matter of do n't ask , do n't tell .
“ There 's a lot that 's unspoken , ” says a program manager with years of experience in several development organizations .
“ We have an extremely sympathetic officer who knows the realities in the field .
It 's not a subject I 've raised .
You dare not talk about it . ”
The manager , who asked to speak without attribution , said a chill surrounds maternal health programs since the Conservative government declared in April that no foreign aid money will fund abortions .
“ It 's scary to articulate .
Someone could overhear you and write down that you support a woman 's right to choose and then funding could be cut to our partner agency , ” the program manager said .
“ This issue goes way beyond CIDA funding so we 're trying to be very careful . ”
Even though Prime Minister Stephen Harper says he has no wish to reopen the abortion debate in Canada , there are signs his government is on the road to an increasingly conservative social agenda .
The International Planned Parenthood Federation has n't heard whether its $ 18 million grant from Canada will be renewed — though the group applied nearly a year ago .
Funding for Toronto's gay pride festival has been revoked .
On Thursday , 15,000 pro-lifers rallied in Ottawa .
In interviews with workers for four aid organizations that receive about $ 6 million from the Canadian International Development Agency to provide maternal or reproductive health care , all said they did not provide abortion services in countries where it is illegal or allowed only in restricted circumstances .
“ What we see in countries where abortion is forbidden , women keep having abortions — they put themselves in danger , ” says Dr. Marc Paquette , a Montrealer who has been working in Haiti for Médecins du Monde Canada for the last 10 months .
“ We have reproductive health services , but we do n't have abortion in our programs .
We would never go against the law here . ”
If a woman who has attempted to abort comes for help , she is referred to a gynecologist .
In countries where access to abortion is permitted for a wide array of reasons , the procedure is generally safe .
In South Africa , infection from abortion decreased by 52 per cent after the law was liberalized in 1996 .
It is estimated 70,000 women die each year in botched abortions — most in sub-Saharan Africa .
“ Somewhere in the world a woman dies every eight minutes because of an unsafe abortion , ” the British medical journal , The Lancet , commented in 2009 on data from the Guttmacher Institute , which does reproductive - health research .
More than 95 per cent of abortions in Africa and Latin America are performed under unsafe conditions .
Methods include drinking turpentine , bleach or tea made from livestock manure , and inserting sticks , knitting needles , or chicken bones into the uterus .
Another aid program manager who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity , said , “ If Canada wants to help women , they should probably not try to prevent abortion .
...
The reality of women in the field is that they will abort any way they can . ”
Harper has said that maternal and child health will be a focus of the G20 summit in Toronto next month , but has yet to announce his plan .
Some in the international aid business say the controversial issue of abortion funding threatens to overshadow all others relating to women 's health and security .
“ Poverty , violence against women , access to health education , access to financial services , ” Laurie Cook , CEO of World Relief Canada , which has an infant and maternal health program in Sudan , cites as issues that risk being overlooked .
“ We have the G20 here and so many issues for women and if abortion hijacks this , regardless of what side you 're on , it 's tragic . ”

For Canadian aid groups , there 's fear the social conservative agenda may spread beyond abortion .
“ We are flying below the radar , ” said one aid worker .
“ Family planning and condoms have n't come under fire — but nobody in the ( aid ) sector feels very safe .
It 's not difficult for us , yet , but the problem is the uncertainty . ”

These are by far some of the best marijuana documentaries to date .
All of them are eye - opening and most of them make a serious case for the legalization of marijuana and / or medical marijuana .
Except for Reefer Madness , I threw that in for a different reason .
Sit back , spark a fat one up , and get ready to have your mind blown .
Watch the streaming videos after the break !
I personally like “ The Union ” , it was quite interesting .

A man charged with the murders of three Bradford women has referred to himself as the " crossbow cannibal " in court .
Stephen Griffiths , 40 , is accused of murdering prostitutes Suzanne Blamires , Shelley Armitage , and Susan Rushworth .
Mature student Mr Griffiths , of Thornton Road , Bradford , was remanded in custody by magistrates and later by a judge at the city 's crown court .
Recent events have been described in some of the tabloid press as the " crossbow cannibal killings " .
When asked to confirm his name by magistrates , Mr Griffiths told the court he was " the crossbow cannibal " .
Relatives in court
Asked for his address , he replied : " Erm ... here I guess . "
Relatives of some of the victims were in court for the magistrates ' court hearing .
Some wiped away tears at the start of the proceedings .
After appearing before magistrates , Mr Griffiths was then taken to Bradford Crown Court .
During this appearance , which lasted only 10 minutes , Mr Griffiths - flanked by security officers - spoke only to confirm his name .
He will next appear at the crown court via video link on 7 June .
Image caption Stephen Griffiths was arrested in Bradford on Monday Stephen Griffiths was arrested in Bradford on Monday City searched for missing women
He is accused of murdering Ms Blamires , 36 , between 20 May and 25 May ; murdering Ms Rushworth , 43 , between 22 June , 2009 , and 25 May this year , and murdering Ms Armitage , 31 , between 25 April and 25 May this year .
Police said body parts found in the River Aire on Tuesday were from Ms Blamires , who had lived in Barkston Walk , Allerton , and was last seen on 21 May .
Ms Armitage , also from Allerton , has been missing since 26 April and Ms Rushworth , from the Manningham area of the city , disappeared on 22 June last year .
Mr Griffiths is reported to be a psychology graduate undertaking postgraduate research in criminology at Bradford University .
He was arrested on Monday at his third - floor flat , which is on the edge of the city 's red light district and a short distance from Bradford city centre .
U.S. should prepare for a cyber attack that will ruin the country in just 15 MINUTES , expert warns
Former head of counterterrorism security has warned of an impending cyber attack
The U.S. should prepare for a cyber attack that could cause destruction on the scale of 9/11 in less than 15 minutes , a leading anti-terrorism expert has warned .
Richard Clarke , a former adviser to both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush , suggests that the lack of security in place against such an attack could lead to an ' electronic Pearl Harbor ' .
Writing in his new book Cyber War : The Next National Security Threat , penned with Robert Knake , Mr Clarke says : ' The biggest secret about cyber war may be that at the very same time the U.S. prepares for offensive cyber war , it is continuing policies that make it impossible to defend effectively from cyber attack . '
In the book , Mr Clarke suggests that a cyber attack would first target the Pentagon 's computer network , before affecting the rest of the country 's electrical grids .
He writes : ' It could blow up pipelines .
It could damage electrical power grids .
It could confuse financial records , so that we would not know who owned what .'
Mr Clarke says the cyber war could be started by an enemy country of the U.S. or a lone hacker .
He insists that while the U.S. government has introduced measures to protect the country 's computer networks , they will not be enough to prevent the attack .
Mr Clarke , who warned of the dangers of terrorist group Al - Qaeda during his time as the former head of counterterrorism security , also said the cyber attack could have similar consequences to 9/11 .
However , U.S. President Barack Obama 's administration appears to disagree with Mr Clarke 's prediction .
Howard Schmidt , Obama 's recently appointed cyber expert , said in an interview with Wired.com in March : ' There is no cyber war .
I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept .
' As for getting into the power grid .
I can't see that that 's realistic . '

Advertisement A Congolese man is trying to get a controversial Tintin book banned in the cartoon star 's home country of Belgium .
The ginger sleuth 's " little ( black ) helper " in Tintin in the Congo is seen as " stupid and without qualities " , Bienvenu Mbutu is quoted as saying .
" It makes people think that blacks have not evolved , " said Mr Mbutu , who lives in Belgium .
A court is to rule on whether the book can be sold in Belgium and , if so , whether it should carry a warning .
Although it was scheduled for Wednesday , the verdict has been delayed and is now expected on 5 May .
Second adventure
The book has already attracted much criticism for its crude racial stereotypes .
Three years ago , the UK's Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be banned , saying it contained imagery and words of hideous racial prejudice .
A black woman is featured in the book bowing before Tintin and exclaiming : " White man very great .
White mister is big juju man ! "
A scene with Tintin giving a geography lesson to Africans has been changed Written in the late 1920s , it was the second Tintin adventure created by Herge , who later said it was a youthful sin which reflected the prejudices of the time .
A scene in Tintin in the Congo in which the eponymous hero gave a geography lesson to Africans about Belgium was later changed to a maths class .
Now UK editions are generally found alongside more adult books and are sold with a band of paper around the outside , warning the content is offensive .
While Mr Mbutu has asked for the book to be banned , he has said he would be satisfied if it was sold with a warning like the one used in Britain , says the BBC's Dominic Hughes in Brussels .

On a windy Monday night , Pete ’s Candy Store — a bar in Williamsburg with a railcar - shaped performance space in the back — is crammed to capacity with the thin and the bearded .
Almost no one is drinking .
The mood is pregame , expectant and nervous .
We ’re at one of the oddest New York City powwows in recent memory : a panel designed to quell a metastasizing dispute between bicyclists and Hasidic Jews .
Except no Hasids are present .
For a moment , it looks like the bicyclists will have to debate themselves .
At immediate issue is the Bedford Avenue bike lane .
It ’s the longest in Brooklyn and runs through every imaginable ethnic enclave — including the South Williamsburg redoubt of the Satmars , the ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jewish sect .
In December , after many complaints from the Satmars about “ scantily clad ” female riders , the city sandblasted off a small stretch of the lane ; some enterprising bikers painted it back in protest ; the city then painted over the unauthorized paint job .
Now two activists are up on criminal - mischief charges , the lane is gone , and the two groups are glowering at each other with even less empathy than usual .
Worse yet , each group finds itself standing in for a larger one in a larger fight : the Satmars for all Orthodox Jews and the bikers for all young secular Williamsburgers , i.e. hipsters .
Finally , the opponents are at the door .
The Hasids are a group of three led by 59 - year - old Isaac Abraham , an erstwhile candidate for the City Council and a self - appointed spokesman for the Satmars .
The trio is bearded , too , of course , but differently so :
These are authority beards .
Heritage beards .
Abraham finds his seat on the cramped stage and requests a glass of water , cracking , “ Make sure it ’s not spiked . ”
He ’s attuned to the absurdity of the premise : Three Hasids and 120 cyclists walk into a bar .
The pro-bike side is represented by three women : Caroline Samponaro of Transportation Alternatives , an advocacy group ; Lyla Durden , a biker ; and Heather Loop , an activist whose big idea after the lane erasure was to stage a topless bike ride through the neighborhood .
It got snowed out .
The debate begins , such as it is .
Abraham opens with an admission of bias : A bike knocked down his wife once .
“ Who was this guy ? ” he asks half - rhetorically .
“ And who do I sue ? ” Samponaro ’s first sentence somehow packs in a nod to her birthday ( “ Whoo ! ” ) , Haiti , and Hurricane Katrina .
Loop introduces herself as the author of the topless - ride initiative , “ which God stopped with a blizzard , ” she adds .
“ Damn him ! ”
Awkward giggles ricochet around the room .
Abraham ’s face turns to stone .
This is not going to be an easy evening .
The Satmar settlement was meant to be a place apart .
The Satmars came to the neighborhood from Hungary and Romania after World War II , led by revered rabbi Joel Teitelbaum .
The idea was to faithfully reproduce pious shtetl culture — in the sooty five - story brownstones , next to the clatter of the elevated train .
The experiment succeeded beyond anyone ’s expectation .
The enclave is now home to the largest Hasidic sect in the world .
For years , the invisible border between South and North Williamsburg used to be , aptly enough , Division Avenue , which separated the Hasidim from the Hispanics .
These days , the division runs along Broadway .
The north side of the street brims with hipster retail , almost all of which painstakingly conjures an old - world feel ; Marlow & Daughters is a retro butcher shop , Diner recontextualizes yet another railroad car , an antiques shop called Luddite sells Victorian coatracks for $ 350 .
On the south side of the street , just a few hundred feet down , the Old World is unironically alive .
Bencraft Hatters sits next to a cobbler shop , next to Hatzloche Baby Furniture , next to Morson , another hat shop .
The hipster incursion began in the late nineties and was first written off as a fluke — some strangely dressed types poking around the abandoned warehouses and factories .
The initial reaction , says Isaac Abraham , who has lived in the neighborhood for 58 years after emigrating from Austria ( “ Schwarzenegger country ! ” ) , was indifference .
“ Maybe the red carpet was n’t out for them , but they came in masses and there was no objection from the community .
Everybody went on with their daily lives . ”
But after a while , says one Hasidic real - estate developer , “ People started talking to the rabbis — ‘ Hey , something ’s happening , all these young white people are moving in . ’ ” When the Satmars realized that the Artisten — the Yiddish name they used for the bewildering newcomers — were there to stay , something like panic set in .
Rabbis exhorted landlords not to rent to the Artisten , builders not to build for them .
One flyer asked God to “ please remove from upon us the plague of the artists , so that we shall not drown in evil waters , and so that they shall not come to our residence to ruin it . ’’ Rabbi Zalman Leib Fulop announced that the Artisten were “ a bitter decree from Heaven , ” a biblical trial .
The distrust reached its apogee in 2004 , after developer Martin Wydra bought the Gretsch Building — a former musical - instrument factory on the south side of Broadway — and turned it into the neighborhood ’s first condo complex targeted to well - heeled hipsters .
Pashkevil ( pamphlets ) demonizing the development blanketed the neighborhood .
Wydra did all he could to tamp down the animosity :
He scotched the plan to add balconies , tinted windows to protect the Satmars ’ modest sensibilities from a glimpse of flesh , and canceled an indoor swimming pool lest a tenant walk outside in a swimsuit .
Unappeased , the Hasids staged protests at Wydra ’s own house in Flatbush .
The developer was a religious Jew but not a Satmar , so he could n’t be shunned .
Instead , the community turned its anger to the local man who had sold the building to Wydra , who promptly found himself ostracized .
After the Gretsch affair , things quieted down for a time .
The Artisten spread eastward into Bushwick and northward to Greenpoint , making them seem less like an immediate threat .
Tempers would occasionally flare at things like a risqué billboard over the BQE .
But the new and old Williamsburg had found , it seemed , a way to peacefully coexist .
Then , in 2007 , came the bike lane , part of a citywide push to make streets more cycling - friendly .
As bike lanes go , it was n’t as plush as the ones springing up in Manhattan these days ; it was n’t even as nice as the one on neighboring Kent Avenue .
But Bedford is Williamsburg ’s main thoroughfare , and the pathway immediately found a thriving clientele .
Morning to night , boys and girls whipped by Hasid minivans on their fixed - gears , hoods and hems flapping , thoughtful produce rattling in the baskets .
It ’s not that people did n’t bike down Bedford before , but the lane threw them into relief , marked them as a category .
The Satmars were incensed .
Hasids are prohibited from looking at improperly dressed members of the opposite sex , and some complained that the women cycling through their neighborhood were an affront .
“ It ’s a major issue , women passing through here in that dress code , ” Simon Weiser , a Hasidic member of Community Board 1 , told the Post .
“ Most Hasids have acclimated to living in New York , ” says Sholom Deen , a semi-lapsed Hasid who , since 2003 , has been publishing a blog called Hasidic Rebel .
But each fresh bit of modernism — the Gretsch Building , the bus ads for Sex and the City — tends to touch off an uproar , he says , and the bikes were something new altogether : “ It ’s a direct intrusion . ”
The city , having spent $ 11,000 on the bike lane , appeared to encourage that intrusion , and the cyclists themselves seemed , if not improper , impudent .
It felt like a seniority issue .
“ How long have you lived in the community that you now want to make the rules and totally ignore my opinion , when I ’ve lived here for 50 years ? ”
Abraham says .
“ You just got here .
You either offer to help and do as the Romans do , or … ” — and here Abraham goes into a spirited , if odd , impression of a spoiled young man — “ ‘ I live here now .
I lived here for ten years , and now I ’m going to make rules for the entire community ! ’ ”
“ It is the undercurrent of thwarted lust beneath the Satmars ’ pious exterior that ’s causing the tension with the ‘ Artisten , ’ ’’ says Baruch Herzfeld , owner of the Traif Bike Gesheft , a.k.a. Unclean Bike Business .
For a full year , the city seemed to ignore the hipster - Hasid war .
Then , on December 1 , 2009 , came a sudden announcement .
The Department of Transportation — under Janette Sadik - Khan , the bike - friendliest commissioner it ’s ever had — was going to rip up “ a small portion ” of the lane between Flushing and Division Avenues , fourteen blocks in all .
The deal to remove the lane is said to have been quietly brokered as far back as last April .
Just about everyone ’s assumption , including that of more than a few Hasids , is that Michael Bloomberg had needed the Satmars — who tend to vote enthusiastically and in a single block — in the upcoming election and that this was an easy bone to throw them .
On December 1 , a crew of municipal workers descended on Bedford , sandblasting the lane and its stenciled biker figures off the asphalt .
The next day , a group of three bike activists — Quinn Hechtropf , Katherine Piccochi , and a man we ’ll call Ben — had an idea .
That Friday night , around 3 a.m. , they hit the street with aerosol cans and handmade stencils .
According to Ben , more than a few Satmars saw them paint .
“ As they walked by , I made sure I said hello , explained to them that we ’re not vandalizing the street , and asked if they wanted to help , ” he says .
“ At first , they were a little standoffish , but a couple of guys had a sense of humor about it . ”
But by Saturday , fresh snow covered the group ’s efforts , and the painters , encouraged by the adventure ’s relative ease and cheered on by myriad bike blogs , decided to finish the job Sunday night .
Around 4 a.m. on Monday , Ben was kneeling near the corner of Bedford and Division , putting the finishing touches on a stencil of a bicyclist figure .
The can hissed and sputtered in his hand .
Hechtropf and Piccochi were working in the opposite direction , painting near Williamsburg Street East .
Suddenly ,
Ben ’s cell phone went off : “ The Hasidic police are here , ” yelled Hechtropf .
“ This is getting ugly . ”
Ben dropped the stencil and ran toward the action , along the freshly painted line , to see if he could intercede .
The scene he found on the corner of Williamsburg East was exactly what he ’d feared .
A tight circle of Hasids gathered around the crouching Hechtropf and Piccochi , pointing fingers and screaming that they were in big trouble .
At least two siren - topped minivans of the Shomrim Patrol — the Hasidic volunteer police — were parked nearby .
The Shomrim held the three until the NYPD showed up and took over .
“ We were touching up the bike lane , ” Ben told the police , not exactly lying if not telling the truth either .
“ It was in disrepair . ”
Unable to figure out the offense — freshening up a road marking is not graffiti — the officers let the painters go .
Hours later , on Monday morning , a boastful video went up on YouTube .
“ Repainting the Bike Lane on Bedford Avenue , ” scored to a triumphantly grinding guitar riff , has received more than 135,000 views to date .
By the end of the day , the police figured out they ’d been sort of had and gave Hechtropf and Piccochi 24 hours to turn themselves in ( Ben has n’t been identified by police ; hence the pseudonym ) .
Protests were staged , one after another .
A New Orleans–style “ funeral group ride ” down Bedford on December 13 .
The aborted underwear ride on December 19 , downgraded to angry toasts at the Wreck Room bar .
The bikers were now seemingly determined to shove their entitlement in the Satmars ’ faces , and the Satmars were more disgusted with the hipster circus than ever .
The two worlds had never seemed so far apart .
Gottlieb ’s , a kosher deli on Roebling , offers a pastrami egg roll , a tongue sandwich , and a bowl of chicken soup filled to the rim with twisty , delicious bird stomachs .
It also serves as one of the main marketplaces for Hasidic gossip in town .
Right now , on a slow Thursday afternoon , the talk of the deli is Rachel , an 18 - year - old Hasidic girl who “ went off ” — the local term for breaking with tradition .
“ She got a huge tattoo , ” reports Baruch Herzfeld to a gangly copper - haired cook in full beard and payess .
“ No way , ” says the cook , ecstatic .
“ No. Way . ”
“ Seriously .
She shows it if you ask , too .
Right here ” — Herzfeld points at his thigh .
“ So fucking hot . ”
The cook just grins .
“ What , you do n’t believe me ? ”
Herzfeld grabs his iPhone and opens Facebook , searching for photos of Rachel .
The Hasidic Facebook is its own phenomenon , a parallel universe where the prim girls you see on the street in turban hats and snub - nosed forties shoes post their bikini snapshots and glamorously lit studio pictures .
Herzfeld enthusiastically scrolls through his four - figure friend list , picking out the hotties for us to look at .
“ Esther .
Hot girl .
Her father is super - religious .
The interesting part is how many friends they have .
Look : 273 friends .
Most of them are Hasidic guys . ”
Baruch Herzfeld , 38 , is a classic macher and motormouth with a foot in both the Hasid and hipster worlds .
He is an Orthodox Jew with close ties to the Satmars who also calls the Satmar leaders “ Talibanowitz ” and says things like “ There is no community more homoerotic than the Hasidim , they ’re so fucking gay . ”
Within minutes of our acquaintance , he offers me a hookup with a lapsed - Hasid girl and invites me to the Dominican Republic to report on a business dispute of his currently making its way through the rabbinical court .
He is dressed in a denim jacket that looks slept in , and a flannel cap that he ca n’t stop turning backward , forward , and to the side .
His real bread and butter is some sort of telephone - card business , which finances his largely nonprofit bike shop with the awesome name Traif Bike Gesheft — Unclean Bike Business .
For South Williamsburg ’s Hasids , Traif Bike Gesheft functions as a semi- secret window onto the larger world and a clubhouse of mild transgressions .
Herzfeld rents bikes to Hasids at no cost , just to get them to venture beyond the neighborhood .
( Among Satmars , bicycles are not specifically disallowed but are considered taboo nonetheless . )
Inside the shop , otherwise righteous men let down their guard .
Tongues loosen .
“ The men , they do n’t know how to have a conversation with a woman , ” Herzfeld explains , talking a mile a minute .
“ Whenever they come to the bike shop , the first thing they ask me to find them a prostitute .
I tell them , look , you ’re searching for answers .
You ’re not going to find them in the vagina of a woman you ’re paying $ 200 an hour .
If you want to meet somebody , you need to step outside of the community , you need to get a hobby .
Come over , and I ’ll teach you how to fix a bike .
So the bike shop is a kind of outreach program . ”
A friend of Herzfeld ’s also uses the shop to slip Hasids traif books like The Catcher in the Rye and The Great Gatsby .
It is the undercurrent of thwarted lust beneath the Satmars ’ pious exterior that ’s causing the tension with the Artisten , Herzfeld believes ( “ Orthodox is you do n’t want to look at a girl in a bathing suit .
Ultra-Orthodox is you want to close down a beach ” ) .
And it ’s also what will bring about the sect ’s downfall , he says .
Herzfeld is convinced there ’s a massive generational split within the Hasidic community , one that explains Bloomberg ’s dismal local showing in the last election ( despite the alleged bike - lane - removal sop , the mayor ’s formerly near - total Hasidic support dropped precipitously this time around , netting him only about half of the neighborhood ’s votes ) .
It ’s not that the younger Hasids do n’t trust Bloomberg ; they do n’t trust the community elders he courted and are loath to take their dictation .
The messy succession battle between Joel Teitelbaum ’s grandnephews , brother rabbis Aaron and Zalman Teitelbaum , left many Satmars disgusted with both .
And myriad maddening little things — like the elders ’ tizzy every time a biker bares a knee — contribute to this frustration , Herzfeld says .
The bike - lane scandal has made Herzfeld a kind of unlikely spokesman for both communities .
He represents , in fact , a burgeoning hybrid constituency — Hasidic hipsters .
They are the ones you see banging their heads at the Reverend ( Reverend ! )
Vince Anderson ’s gospel - rock shows at Union Pool .
They are the breed that gave us Curly Oxide ( a Hasidic punk musician whose life may become a Sacha Baron Cohen movie ) , the Hasidic rapper Matisyahu , and writer Paula ( actually Penina ) Roth .
In Herzfeld ’s view , there ’s less contradiction here than one may think .
“ Once a Hasid shaves his curls , he ’s a hipster , ” he says with a shrug , finishing his chicken soup and rising to greet yet another customer , a young Satmar in full regalia augmented by a giant Jacob the Jeweler–style wristwatch .
“ That ’s it . ”
If there is one reason the Hasid - hipster standoff runs deeper than the usual street - level urban tension , it is that both sides have a lot more to lose from parting .
One needs living space , and the other needs to lease it .
One likes exposed brick and inexpensive lofts , and the other has inherited a vast swath of factories unusable for their original purpose .
According to one informal estimate , as many as one - third of the rental buildings in the Artisten - friendly North Williamsburg are owned by Hasids from South Williamsburg ( the average two - bedroom rental in the Hasidic part of the neighborhood runs about $ 1,800 .
The exact same apartment across Broadway goes for $ 2,600 ) .
The Hasids and hipsters are shackled to each other in a co-dependent real - estate loop .
The Satmars ’ original leader , Joel Teitelbaum , had brought with him from Hungary the idea of parnossa — “ making livelihood . ”
One of his most famous sayings reads “ If you ’re walking with your kittel [ a white garment ] before Yom Kippur on your way to the shul , and someone offers you a kosher business deal , drop your kittel and go do it . ”
Supporting the community , in other words , comes first .
“ How long have you lived in the community that you now want to make the rules and totally ignore my opinion , when I ’ve lived here for 50 years ? ”
Satmar spokesman Isaac Abraham says .
“ You just got here . ”
Teitelbaum ’s way has worked : The Satmars are a remarkably wealthy enclave .
“ But it ’s pure entrepreneurship , ” notes the same developer .
“ If you ’re a Satmar , you ’re either a businessman or blue collar .
There are very few accountants , no lawyers , no doctors .
Parnossa ! ”
From their very first days in New York , the Satmars put down roots in Williamsburg by successfully lobbying for zoning changes — by turning an industrial area residential .
This strategy paid off especially well when the real - estate prices started going wild in the late nineties .
“ We did what everyone was doing , ” says Mayer Schwartz , who started a mini-empire by renovating his in - laws ’ knitting factory on Bedford and North 5th .
“ Knitting was over .
This is how most Hasids got into this , through manufacturing .
And once they turned their family factory into condos , they got this know - how — ‘ Hey , let ’s buy the building next door . ’
Before you know it , you ’re on this crazy real - estate roller coaster . ”
If hipster Williamsburg has a social architect , it is Schwartz .
His first project , in 1999 , became the mini-mall that redefined Bedford Avenue .
The retail collection he developed was both a parody of the American mall and a startling improvement on it .
It housed an artisanal - cheese shop , a wine store , a bookseller with Guy Debord window displays , a Tibetan tchotchke store , a vinyl - heavy indie - record emporium , a Mac - friendly computer shop , and , of course , a coffeehouse .
Many of these businesses later grew to take up their own storefronts on what became the hipster side of Bedford .
Schwartz followed it up with Opera House Lofts , another ambitious development targeted squarely at the Artisten .
His latest and largest project — Castle Braid , a 144 - unit complex so named after the factory in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn — is borderline hipster pandering .
The game room has foosball and air hockey .
On my arrival , the PA system in the lobby was softly playing Beck ’s “ Nobody ’s Fault But My Own . ”
The building holds its own film festival ( the first prize is six rent - free months ) and a tenant - compiled library with Erotica and Gay - and - Lesbian sections .
“ It is totally kosher , ” explains Schwartz , a devout Hasid .
“ I ’ve been joking that I do this to make sure the Artisten stay on the other side ! ”
By these standards , Zazza , Williamsburg ’s newest luxury rental high - rise , which began renting apartments this February , is traif ten times over .
It sits not on the border of the Hasidic territory , like Gretsch , but smack dab in the middle of it , between South 8th and South 9th Streets .
Five years ago , in its place was a fully functional knish factory , Gabila ’s , in business since 1921 and famous for “ The Original Coney Island Square Knish . ”
The developer , Michael Zazza , says he bought it in 2005 at a fantastically low $ 85 per square foot .
“ I ’m Italian and Syrian , and I went down into an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood and knocked down a knish factory , ” Zazza says .
“ As you can imagine , they were overwhelmed with joy ! ”
The Hasids hung signs and staged protests ; in a collaboration with Hispanic activists , they recruited the help of Queens councilman Tony Avella and pushed to landmark the factory .
Zazza knew how to make amends .
His high - rise would be facing a synagogue , and he had bought a piece of land directly abutting it ; if he built on it , he would rob the existing building of many of its windows .
So he sold that lot to the synagogue .
At market rate , of course .
“ I helped them preserve the character of the shul , ” he says .
“ It was my peace offering . ”
He also shaded the bathroom windows on the side of the high - rise that would face the shul .
He hired “ indigenous people , ” as he unironically calls Hasids , for kitchen cabinetry and plumbing fixtures .
He gave locals first crack at renting , a completely pointless gesture because Zazza ’s apartments do n’t have the baths required by Hasidic tradition .
The resulting glassy tower epitomizes the weird armistice between the Satmars and the arrivistes .
It has all the hipster amenities , from a fire pit to bike storage to a “ resident gardening area . ”
But the grounds it occupies are protected by a fence — highly unusual for New York — and only accessible via an intercom - equipped metal gate .
It looks like a fortress within an already fortified neighborhood : an enclave , like Andorra or Lesotho .
“ The fence is not that tall , ” Zazza insists when I ask him about it .
“ I mean , it does n’t look like Rikers Island or anything . ”
The Saturday the building ’s 66 units went on the market , remembers one young female apartment hunter , “ was kind of a madhouse . ”
Corcoran brokers were shuffling frowzled hipster couples and postgrad roommate groups through the property , jabbering about the perks and the fixtures .
All around this axis of crazed activity , the neighborhood was dead deserted , with shutters drawn and streets empty : Shabbos .
Checking out the view from a handsome tenth - floor corner unit , the hunter looked down and saw fifteen or twenty Hasidic men gathered on the other side of the fence , immobile , looking up .
When she got downstairs , they were still there , forming a kind of silent gauntlet for the folks flitting in and out .
The message was unspoken but clear .
Zazza ’s online gallery of alluring “ neighborhood ” photos — boutique , wineshop , brunch — features a shot of a comely female dressed in sunglasses and red shorts on a sun-dappled summer morning .
She is pedaling along on her fixed - gear .
Back at the panel meeting at Pete ’s Candy Store , the Satmars - versus - cyclists debate rages on .
The discussion is devolving into chaos .
Isaac Abraham offers odd , ad hoc claims that bicycles are dangerous in general , none of which has anything to do with the topic at hand , but each of which manages to infuriate the bike activists a little more .
Heather gets stuck in a super - sarcastic spiral ( “ Well , maybe , if some people did their job , ” etc ) .
Only a naïf would have expected a resolution of any sort tonight .
But the common blindness to facts and reason is beginning to look like , well , a plague .
After about an hour of this , I step outside , where the two Hasids from Abraham ’s entourage are exchanging bemused quips .
Near them , a bicycle is chained to a tree with a large NO BIKES sign .
Two gunless NYPD officers , both Hispanic , hang around in yellow windbreakers that say COMMUNITY AFFAIRS .
“ Are you here in case a fight breaks out ? ” I ask .
“ Yeah , just in case , ” answers one with a wide grin .
“ No problems so far ? ”
“ These people are not going to do anything .
But damn , they can talk . ”
A spate of recent news reports alleging cover-ups of child sex abuse by priests was “ prompted ” by Satan , says a prominent Italian exorcist .
Father Gabriele Amorth , the Vatican ’s chief exorcist , told Italian media this week that a New York Times report alleging that Pope Benedict XVI ignored reports of sex abuse at a Wisconsin school for the deaf was the work of the Devil .
ADVERTISEMENT
That story asserted that the Pope , then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , ignored repeated warnings from bishops that a Wisconsin priest , Father Laurence Murphy , may have molested as many as 200 boys at a school for the deaf .
“ There is no doubt about it .
Because he is a marvelous Pope and worthy successor to John Paul II , it is clear that the Devil wants to ‘ grab hold ’ of him , ” Amorth said , as quoted at the Catholic News Agency .
Father Amorth added that in instances of sexual abuse committed by some members of the clergy , the devil Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ usesÃ¢â‚
¬
Â priests in order to cast blame upon the entire Church : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The devil wants the death of the Church because she is the mother of all the saints .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â 
The exorcist went on to note that Satan tempts holy men , “ and so we should not be surprised if priests too Ã¢â ‚ ¬ Â¦ fall into temptation .
They also live in the world and can fall like men of the world . ”
Amorth made similar assertions several weeks ago , before the allegations about Father Murphy became public .
At that time , the Pope was being criticized by some over allegations that , as Archbishop of Munich , he tried to hush up allegations of sexual abuse by priests in his diocese .
In an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica , Amorth said the German sex abuse scandal , along with several other scandals and a Christmas Eve attack on the pontiff by a mentally unstable woman , “ were proof that the Anti-Christ was waging a war against the Holy See , ” the Daily Telegraph reported .

Amorth also asserted that the Pope is a fervent believer in the practice of exorcism .
“ His Holiness believes wholeheartedly in the practice of exorcism .
He has encouraged and praised our work , ” Amorth said .
In 2006 , Amorth asserted that Hitler and Stalin were both possessed by the Devil .
Amorth also condemned the Harry Potter novels for creating a “ false distinction ” between good and bad magic ; all magic “ leads to the Devil , ” Amorth stated .

Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy say strategy to preserve eurozone stability to be in place when markets open on Monday
EU leaders have agreed a financial defence plan in an attempt to protect the eurozone countries from speculative attacks in the wake of the Greek debt crisis .
The German chancellor , Angela Merkel , and the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , said today that an " intervention unit " designed to preserve financial stability in the 16 eurozone countries would be in place by Monday when the markets reopen .
The creation of the unit , which will have up to € 70bn at its disposal to shield the euro against further market speculation , comes after the shared currency 's value fell amid fears that member countries such as Spain and Portugal could suffer similar debt problems to Greece .
Today 's announcement follows an agreement yesterday by the eurozone leaders for a € 110bn ( £ 95 bn ) EU - International Monetary Fund rescue package for Greece to prevent its debt crisis from spreading .
Announcing the stability plan Sarkozy said : " The euro is an essential element of Europe .
We can not leave it to speculators .
We will not let others undo what generations have created . "
Merkel said the mechanism would send a " very clear signal " to market speculators to back off .
The German chancellor had earlier spoken to the US president , Barack Obama , who called for a " strong policy response " involving the wider international community .
The finance ministers of all 27 EU member states will hold another emergency meeting tomorrow to draw up further detail of the anti-speculation plan , which will also include the European Central Bank .
The summit in Brussels , originally called to sign off the Greek bailout plan , turned into one of crisis management amid market turmoil .
It comes as Spain and Portugal begin to suffer similar financial problems to Greece , with borrowing costs increasing and talk of speculative attacks .
Despite reassurances from EU leaders that the Greek debt crisis is a unique combination of bad management , overspending and statistical cheating , markets have continued to sell off the euro , leading it to fall to its lowest value against the dollar in more than a year .
Several leaders , including Sarkozy and Merkel , want a fundamental revamp of the rules for managing the euro .
" We must sharpen the edge " of the rules to keep wayward governments in line and consider revising the 1992 treaty that laid the groundwork for the shared currency , Reuters reported Merkel as saying .
The European commission president , José Manuel Barroso , said : " We will defend the euro whatever it takes .
We have several instruments at our disposal and we will use them . "
Jean - Claude Juncker , who heads the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers , said : " We are talking about a global attack against the euro , and the eurozone must react as one . "
In U.S. politics , it ’s quite often that old adages are proven true .
Today , there ’s a twist : “ if you ca n’t beat ’em , join ’ em ” no longer cuts it .
Instead , the Republican Governors Association figures if you ca n’t beat ’em , do n’t join ’em , but do hire an ad firm to pretend you have …
That ’s apparently true even if it means embracing what was once criticized by other conservatives as “ pro-terrorist , neo - Marxist propaganda . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
For this batch of Republican governors who peg themselves as “ the key to a GOP Comeback ” , it ’s not really a big deal to co-opt themes from metaphorical anti-Bush film “ V for Vendetta , ” though chances are they completely miss the irony .
A futuristic tale about a British terrorist who wages bloody vengeance against a fascist dictatorship , “ V for Vendetta ” follows the downfall of a merciless regime that seized control following rampant escalation of war in Iraq and a deadly viral outbreak .
Needless to say , Republicans enraptured by President Bush ’s terror war were n’t so happy about the film when it came out .
Right - wing conspiracy site WorldNetDaily called the film , “ a vile , pro-terrorist piece of neo-Marxist , left - wing propaganda filled with radical sexual politics and nasty attacks on religion and Christianity . ”
And now , the Republican Governors Association wants voters to “ remember , remember the 5th of November . ”
They ’ve even launched a Web site — remembernovember.com — to that very effect .
Such a move would have been unheard of at the film ’s release in 2006 , when filmmakers the Wachowski brothers were widely criticized by Republicans and right - wing pundits for promoting a terrorist as its protagonist .
To anti-Bush Americans , the film ’s narrative — of a tyrannical government that attacked its own people then sanctioned torture and indefinite detention , a television network that spews nothing but administration propaganda , a political pundit with a striking parallel to Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly and the flawed - yet - sympathetic man who brings the system down with the help of a beautiful young girl — seemingly combined to make the motion picture a cause cÃ ƒÂ©lÃ ƒ Â¨bre of dissenters .

“ The whole movie , in fact , is a thinly veiled attack on the War on Terror now being waged by Prime Minister Tony Blair in Great Britain and President George W. Bush in the United States , ” WND ’s Ted Baehr wrote .
“ The movie ’s story was actually updated from a graphic novel that attacked the conservative administration of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , one of the greatest political leaders of the 20th century . ”
The picture and its factual basis in the Guy Fawkes story eventually became a rallying cry for supporters of Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , who turned in an astonishing $ 4.07 million for the presidential candidate on Nov. 5 , 2007 .
However , as with the tea parties , also created by Paul ’s supporters , old - guard Republicans and neoconservatives came to see Paul ’s campaign model as both a threat and an opportunity , then seized upon it .
While usurping Paul ’s fundraising model and using it to support insurance firms during the health reform debate is certainly brazen , Republican governors attempting to co-opt “ V for Vendetta ” and Paul supporters ’ use of Guy Fawkes is a new low .

The group also produced a very slickly edited piece of video activism that seems to pin responsibility of America ’s financial woes on Obama , then attempts to use the president ’s campaign theme of “ change ” against him .
“ The politics and substance aside , this strikes me as a remarkable bit of political messaging , not just for its cinematic quality , ” Time ‘s Michael Scherer commented .
“ The RGA , under the control of Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , is clearly stepping out of the stodgy , safe territory it normally inhabits .
It is aiming to tap into the vast well of anti-government fury now coursing through the nation .
Who would have guessed that Barbour would embrace the symbolic value of the same would - be mass murderer as the Wachowski brothers ? ”

Since President Obama took office , Republicans have attempted to color his presidency with the devastating economic effects of the Bush administration .
It is n’t working .
Though two - thirds of GOP voters blame Obama for the poor economy according to Rasmussen , Gallup ’s numbers show that the vast majority of Americans clearly recall the so - called “ Great Recession ” began in earnest under President Bush .
“ Theoretically , Obama accumulates more responsibility for the nation ’s economy every day he ’s in office , ” Gallup noted .
“ That could bear down increasingly hard on his approval rating if unemployment continues to hold at or near 10 % and consumer attitudes remain negative .
However , the big upside is that should the economy rebound on his watch — and recent Gallup tracking has someÃ‚Â signs of a “ nascent ” recovery — Obama is poised to receive much of the credit . ”
Perhaps that too is something the Republican governors — who are waging a record 37 campaigns in 2010 — could benefit from remembering .

The master of a cargo ship which sank off Somalia following a cyclone has praised the crew of a Devon - based frigate for saving his men's lives .
Capt Hassan Madar 's vessel , MV Dubai Moon , sent out a distress signal which was picked up by HMS Chatham 175 miles ( 282 km ) away on Thursday .
The Royal Navy vessel , which is conducting Nato anti-piracy operations in the area , raced to help .
Capt Madar said he and his crew owed their lives to the Royal Navy and Nato .
The Ethiopian master of MV Dubai Moon added : " Normally we operate close to the coast but we had to go far out to sea to avoid pirates - that meant we could not find shelter from the storm .
Reef fears
" If we had not been rescued by the Royal Navy and Nato we would have died with my ship .
" They were the only people to respond to our distress call ; we owe them our lives . "
The cargo vessel , which was transporting vehicles , had begun to list badly after getting caught in a tropical storm which later developed into a cyclone .
Capt Madar said he and his crew owed their lives to the Royal Navy and Nato
It was struggling to make headway in extremely rough seas and high winds and was drifting towards an island - raising concerns that it could run aground on a reef .
HMS Chatham 's commanding officer , Commander Simon Huntington , maintained contact throughout the night to try to work out the best way to save the merchant ship .
When weather conditions improved on Friday , the crew of HMS Chatham were able to launch their Lynx helicopter to winch the 23 crewmen off the stricken vessel , which later sank .
Commander Huntington said that when HMS Chatham received the distress signal the ship was caught in quite a fierce storm .
' Challenging conditions '
" Clearly there was a question of lives being in danger and so there was no hesitation in my mind of what we needed to do , " he said .
" As we got closer to the eye of the storm and we approached the position of the Dubai Moon it became quite intense - winds of up to 70 mph ( 113 km / h ) and quite towering seas .
" It was not just the wind and the sea state , the visibility was incredibly poor too as we were experiencing torrential rain that you would expect with the monsoon conditions we were in . "
HMS Chatham 's crew have been involved in numerous rescues
He added that the rescue operation to winch the crew onto HMS Chatham took three hours and that the cargo ship 's deck , which was rolling up to 40 degrees , was covered in oil from the cargo of cars which had shifted during the cyclone .
" This rescue was conducted in the most challenging sea conditions imaginable ... the tropical cyclone tested the ship and everyone on board , " he said .
HMS Chatham , which is based in Devonport , Plymouth , has been involved in a number of rescue operations while carrying out operations in the Gulf .
In February crew airlifted a Filipino sailor with suspected appendicitis to hospital after he fell ill on an oil tanker in the Middle East .
A week before it had dispatched Royal Marines to help 21 Yemeni fishermen spotted adrift in the middle of a shipping zone after their vessel had run out of fuel .

TONY JONES , PRESENTER : Well the Senate has agreed to hold inquiries in the laws regarding the tax exempt status of religions and charities .
Independent Senator Nick Xenophon has proposed a test which asks groups to demonstrate whether their activities are of public benefit or cause harm before being granted tax exempt status .
The inquiry was sparked by allegations of serious abuses within the Church of Scientology .
And we obviously have a problem with that piece , but Senator Nick Xenophon , in any case , says the Senate inquiry will not focus on a single group .
He says any religious or charitable organisations found to have harmed individuals should lose their tax exempt status .
A large law - enforcement force tracked the Times Square car bomb suspect through the afternoon and evening Monday -- he was arrested at 11:30 p.m. at John F. Kennedy International Airport .
Cellphone led to Times Square arrest
The number from a disposable cellphone led FBI agents to the suspect arrested Monday night for allegedly driving a car bomb into Times Square on Saturday evening , according to a senior official .
“ They were able to basically get one phone number and by running it through a number of databases , figure out who they thought the guy was , ” the official said .

A huge law - enforcement force tracked the suspect through the afternoon and evening .
He was arrested at 11:30 p.m. at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City .
The vehicle identification number had been removed from the bomb - laden 1993 Nissan Pathfinder left in Times Square .
But investigators were able to lift it from a second location on the vehicle , and used that to track down a Connecticut man who said he had sold the Pathfinder for cash about three weeks ago .
The man had offered the vehicle on Craigslist , and FBI agents were able to recover the number from a disposable cellphone that had been used by the buyer .
The suspect did n't still have the phone .
But using a lot of technology and access to database , agents located the suspect .
Appearing in person in the Justice Department briefing room at 1:30 a.m. , Attorney General Eric Holder said the suspect , a Pakistan - born American named Faisal Shahzad , 30 , was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport while attempting to board a flight for Dubai .
A law - enforcement announcement said : “ The defendant will appear in Manhattan federal court ( 500 Pearl Street , 5th Floor , New York , N.Y. ) on May 4 , 2010 , at a currently undetermined time to be presented on formal charges .
No further details are available at this time . ”
President Barack Obama was briefed six times on Monday and was notified of the arrest at 12:05 a.m. , all by John Brennan , Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism , the White House said .
Around 2:30 p.m. Monday , Holder had been pulled out of a meeting to take a call from David S. Kris , Assistant Attorney General for National Security .
Kris said the FBI thought it had identified the suspect , and knew his rough location .
“ There was a huge fog - of - war element , where you think you have him , but you 're not sure , ” the official said .
“ Everyone 's telephoning headquarters . ”
The attorney general ordered up substantial resources to track and capture the suspect .
Holder stayed at Justice until 9:30 p.m. , then went home , had dinner and put his kids to bed .
At 11:30 p.m. , Holder was called about the arrest .
He was rushed back to DOJ , complete with flashing lights .
He did n't go to his office but straight to the National Security Division 's 7th - floor SCIF ( Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility ) for real - time updates .
Officials worked until 1:10 to nail everything down .
Assured it was the guy , DOJ issued a news advisory .
Holder walked in front of the camera at 1:30 a.m .
Dr. Zamboni reported in November 2017 results of a controlled clinical trial in MS
The BRAVE DREAMS Study included 115 people with relapsing - remitting MS .
All of the participants stayed on their disease - modifying MS therapy .
Two - thirds of the participants were randomly assigned to undergo an angioplasty procedure to open the extracranial vein ( venous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty , or PTA ) , while one - third were assigned to undergo a sham procedure for comparison .
After one year , there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of clinical or MRI - detected disease outcomes .
In their report , Dr. Zamboni and his co-authors conclude that “ Venous PTA has proven to be a safe but largely ineffective technique ; the treatment cannot be recommended in patients with MS . ”
The report was published online in JAMA Neurology and can be read by anyone .
A controlled clinical trial in Canada was completed in 2017 and results were published September 2018 .
A Canadian CCSVI clinical trial of the venoplasty procedure in people with MS has been completed , and detailed results were published September 28 , 2018 online on in the journal Neurology .
The paper can be read by anyone .
In March 8 , 2017 , preliminary results were presented at the Society for Interventional Radiology meeting in Washington , DC .
The results from this clinical trial provide evidence suggesting that treating CCSVI did not improve symptoms or the course of MS .
Sir Oliver Lodge FRS : The Mode of Future Existence ( 1933 Lecture ) Linking survival after death with sub atomic physics is censored in Great Britain .
Introduction by Michael Roll .
This article by Sir Oliver Lodge was published in The Queen 's Hospital Annual in 1933 ( Birmingham ) .
It is because this great scientist wrote articles and published books along these lines that he has been vilified by obscurants who have taken control of scientific teaching throughout the world .
Sir Oliver Lodge was the first person to send a radio message , one year before Marconi !
His great contribution to science has been deliberately played down solely because the powerful materialists are terrified that millions may find out he was correct in saying that we all survive death .
The same treatment has been meted out to Sir William Crookes who actually proved by repeatable experiments under laboratory conditions that the subject of survival after death is a branch of physics - natural philosophy .
Crookes was a President of the Royal Society , inventor of the Cathode - ray tube .
Look up x-rays in the encyclopaedia , Crookes was the pioneer of subatomic physics - proving that reality exists beyond our five physical senses .
Censorship and character assassination are the only weapons that those with a great deal to lose from the truth have in their armoury .
The attack on Sir William Crookes has been so vicious that he now carries the emotive labels of liar , cheat , crank , fraud , gullible idiot , Spiritualist , and they have also tagged on that he was a heterosexual sex maniac , just in case the other labels are not enough .
This Sir Oliver Lodge article will be censored by every large circulation paper and magazine in the world .
People will only begin to find out just how badly they are being deceived by their leaders and teachers if this pamphlet is passed from hand to hand .
' There is not a crime , there is not a dodge , there is not a trick , there is not a swindle , there is not a vice which does not live by secrecy .
Get these things out in the open , describe them , attack them , ridicule them in the press , and sooner or later public opinion will sweep them away .
Joseph Pulitzer The Mode of Future Existence 1933 Lecture by Sir Oliver Lodge FRS
When we consider the question of Survival from the physical point of view we are up against the ancient problem of the connection between mind and body .
The body is certainly made of matter , but matter is inert , it never does anything , it is completely controlled by the forces acting upon it , which forces exist in the empty space surrounding the atoms .
Left to itself , matter merely continues in whatever state it was last made to accept .
If it was spinning , it continues to spin with constant angular momentum .
It has no power of changing its state or of stopping .
If it was in a state of locomotion , that motion also continues unaltered .
This is called the law of inertia , and to it all material atoms are absolutely obedient , whether they form part of an engine or of a clockwork mechanism or of an animated body .
There is no exception .
All matter is inert .
If any change is observed in atomic or material behaviour , it is a sign of some activity , some energy apart from matter , demonstrating its existence by acting upon matter , and causing some acceleration or retardation proportionate to the force exerted .
This is called the second law of motion .
Furthermore , every kind of energy known to us exists in the empty space between the atoms and exerts equal force upon the boundary atoms at either end of that space , so that every action is accompanied by an equal opposite reaction .
This is called the third law of motion , or it might be called the law of energy .
Energy only makes itself manifest by its effect on material bodies , but its main existence is in space .
We have no sense organ for perceiving energy itself , our senses tell us of nothing but matter .
We can see the results of energy as expended upon matter , but we have no direct apprehension of the energy .
We are not acquainted with anything in the Universe save by its effect upon matter , and that is the origin of our tendency to philosophic materialism ; we are liable to doubt whether things not apparent to the senses can have a real existence , though there is no justification for such a doubt .
The physical Universe does not consist of matter alone .
If it did , it would be absolutely inert , no change would ever occur .
Experience shows us constant change , constant activity , and , when analysed , the source of this activity is always found in the field or space between the atoms .
That is where the energy exists , that is where it is stored ; and we can gradually realise that it is through interaction between the void and the material particles that every change or activity is accomplished .
A field of force always exists in what we call vacuum or Ether , what the Ancients called ' void ' ; never does it exist in matter .
Yet force is only made manifest by matter .
It is only by observing the behaviour of material bodies that we can become aware of the existence of a field of force or of a seat of energy .
Energy is constant in amount , but it takes various forms .
The form with which we are best acquainted is the form of motion , and that is the only form ever associated with matter .
All the other forms are hidden and make no impression upon us , save when they encounter material particles and thus display their existence .
No one , for instance , could experience a magnetic field without a bit of iron to test it with .
No one has any knowledge of the broadcast waves which now surround us unless he has a suitable detecting apparatus in the form of a wireless set and a telephone .
And , strange to say , we can only appreciate light when it impinges upon some piece of matter and thence is deflected into the eyes .
When we see a lighthouse or searchlight beam tracking its way across space , it is not the beam that we observe , but the dust particles which are illuminated by it .
We can only see material objects : we have no sense for radiation itself , nor for an electric current , only for its activity in affecting various kinds of matter .
These are only instances of a quite general law .
We cannot understand the activity of the material Universe without taking energy into account , and this energy exists in the space between the particles .
Matter is discontinuous , consisting of isolated particles , they are connected only through space .
But inasmuch as this space is impregnated with energy , it must be something more than mere emptiness .
It makes no impression on our senses , and yet it is full of energy , and is the reservoir of all activity ; hence we have agreed to call it the Ether .
A magnetic field exists wholly in the Ether , iron filings are only used to demonstrate it and map it out .
An electric , a gravitational , field is in the same predicament .
Cohesion , too , and indeed every action between material particles , is an affair of the Ether .
In no other way can one piece of matter act on another .
Every kind of physical action is really transmitted across space - that is , through the Ether - just as really , though not so obviously , as electric and magnetic attraction , gravitation , and light .
Atoms and their constituents are never in contact .
Ether forces or Ether strains have to be appealed to , when we try really to understand the most ordinary activities in daily life .
Even a simple push is exerted through an infinitesimal layer of Ether .
Every variety of potential energy exists in the Ether : matter has no energy except kinetic ; and recently an ethereal explanation of even that kind of energy shows signs of emerging from the theory of relativity .
Animated matter differs in no respect from every other kind of matter , except that it is subject to animation .
So when we say that life only exists in a material organism , we ought to say that life only manifests itself in association with such an organism , and that when it is dissociated from matter we know nothing of its existence .
We have no right to say that it is extinct .
All that we know is that it is no longer manifest it has gone out of our ken .
But the same may be said of every form of energy in itself , it has no power of becoming known to us but by its effect on material bodies .
A body under the action of life can do many things , can initiate spontaneous movements , can build up an organism , can operate on the physical Universe , and leave structures behind it of interest and beauty , but it is not the material body that does these things ; they are due to the life or animation of the body .
If , then , we can adduce any evidence that life or mental activity exists in space , and only sporadically makes itself evident by some material activity , the state of our present knowledge of physics renders our acceptance of the fact entirely harmonious .
We have to do no violence to our physical conceptions if we admit the fact of survival .
Life and mind never were functions of the material body , they only displayed themselves by means of the material organism .
The organism was not essential to their existence , but only to their display - that is , to our apprehension of them .
If they ever find means of operating in a novel or unusual manner on a physical organism , then they may still manifest their continued existence ; and that is exactly what they do .
Why should we decline to receive the evidence ?
Telepathy shows that mind can act on mind without the use of any bodily organs , hence certain people may have a faculty of apprehending a spiritual world direct ; and this may account for genius and inspiration .
This has been well argued by F.W.H. Myers , and I shall not labour it now .
If you have evidence of the existence of a spiritual world , a world of help and guidance and sympathy , then you can hold to it in spite of every denial of the materialists , who can only base their denial on the absence of any sensory stimulus to their material organism .
Such a world may exist all round us , and yet can only be spiritually discerned .
The faculty of discernment does exist in some people , and their positive evidence overweighs a wilderness of negation from people whose perceptions are limited to the bodily senses .
One of the most elementary forms of discernment is ( rather absurdly ) called Psychometry .
An object put into their hands may convey more information than the senses can give : a psychometrist can tell something of its history , something of its association , something of its possessor .
By special faculty they can tell far more than could be arrived at by chemical tests .
They can tell , for instance , that a bit of stone has formed part of a pyramid , or that a ring has taken part in a scene of slaughter , or that a piece of writing or drawing has been done by a certain person normally quite unknown to them , and can even tell what the circumstances of that person were at the time , and what they were doing .
The existence of a spiritual world throughout the depths of space is becoming to me a great and fundamental , even a physical , reality .
The manifestation of that world in connection with material organisms on one or other of the planets is a comparatively trifling and temporary episode , of great importance doubtless in the history of evolutionary development , but our real existence is not dependent on a material organism .
Our spiritual and real home is in the Ether of space .
Chemists and biochemists are liable to limit themselves unduly to the purely material aspect of things .
A chemist 's business is to deal with matter in its various forms ; that is his job , and he need not be expected to go beyond it .
A physicist takes into account the Ether as well , though he may , for a time , prefer to call it space .
He is not limited to material particles , but studies the fields of force which connect them and make them active .
The psychologist goes further still , and studies the action of the mind .
I would I could say that the biologist is a student of life , but at present the tendency is for him only to study animated organisms and their behaviour , limiting his attention to what is manifested by the material processes brought about by life , and not thinking that life has any existence apart from its instrument of manifestation .
We shall never understand the Universe by attending to matter alone and ignoring everything which makes it active and interesting .
We cannot even understand the bending of a steel spring or the fall of a raised weight without implicitly taking the Ether into account .
We are continually making experiments on the Ether and realising the consequences of its abundant qualities .
If we make the assumption that it is a physical vehicle of life and mind too , we are only extending our generalisation in the same direction .
A supplementary and semi-physical treatment of Survival is now becoming possible ; a treatment which is well calculated to replace the old materialistic view that man had only a material body , and that when that body died and decayed , the animation , the personality , and the individual , necessarily ceased to exist .
It is also well calculated to replace the popular idealistic notion that any spirit which survives the death of the material body must survive in an entirely disembodied condition , and be out of relationship with the physical Universe .
Many people suppose that it then belongs to another order of existence , or , as some would say , of non-existence ; that it is likely to be free from any relationship even with Space and Time , and must have departed entirely out of our ken ; so that communication or intercourse with it is no longer possible , until perhaps at some future day when the material body shall have been somehow resuscitated and restored to its old function , in glorified form , so that the spirit can resume its active control .
That this superstitious idea has been prevalent is testified to by popular modes of expression , such as : ' On the Resurrection morning , all their dead the graves restore .
Father , mother , sister , brother meet once more . '
This depressing notion of future existence - if it can be called existence in the interim - is not a scientific or psychological view at all ; but it has been the religious , or at least the ecclesiastical , view through medieval times ; hymns and liturgies are saturated with it , and it continues to this day the chief representation of what , by strictly orthodox people , is meant by Survival .
A modern theory which seeks to provide the emancipated spirit with any kind of organism related to the physical world might thus be ranked as a return to a modified form of materialism .
For though , when properly understood , the view I advocate ought to emancipate us from materialistic bugbears , and although it wholly condemns the idea that flesh and blood or any particles of terrestrial matter are revivified and inherit Eternal Life , yet popular ignorance of what is meant by the Ether , and of the certain fact that the Ether is a part of the physical Universe and has definite properties which can be experimented on and ascertained , may well suggest all manner of difficulties in understanding the hypothesis I am trying to expound .
Wherefore it will probably be considered unsatisfactory , both by the scientific materialist and by the theologian ; possibly also by some spiritualists .
The necessity for some kind of organ or instrument or habitation for an emancipated spirit has been intuitively felt by many inspired writers .
The most ancient classical idea was that of a condition rather melancholy - unhouseled , wistful , shadowy and sad - but this notion was improved upon even in later classical times .
And towards the end , ' Not unclothed , but clothed upon , ' ' God giveth it a body , ' are modes of expression very familiar to modern ears .
The existence of a spiritual body is an idea , in one form or another , at least as old as St. Paul .
It has been upheld by some of the Greek Fathers of the Church ; it has been vaguely in the mind of many modern investigators ; sundry obscure and super - normal facts seem to lend it strong support .
And recently an etheric version of such a body has been approved - and if not inculcated , at any rate , regarded as a step in the right direction - by some of the more thoughtful and philosophically minded communicators ' on the other side ' .
What they know by experience is that , though discarnate , they are certainly not disembodied ; they feel no more disembodied than we do .
They tell us that they still have substantial instruments of manifestation which serve for intercourse among each other , and that it is through this permanent instrument that they are able , occasionally and under certain conditions , to operate indirectly , through our organisms , on the matter of this planet .
They operate with more difficulty than in the old days , partly because they have to make use of other people 's mechanism ; but still , subject to many restrictions , they exert influence in a somewhat similar way , and thereby are able occasionally to know what we are doing ; and they claim sometimes to succeed in helping and stimulating us , not only mentally but physically .
Now , although the departed may not understand fully and completely of what their present body is composed , or how they operate on it so as to produce the results they desire and aim at , they are still only in the same predicament as they were when here , and as we are now .
For we do not know how we control our bodies of matter , nor what the nature of the connection between mind and matter is .
We know that we have muscles and nerves and brain centres .
We can dissect and describe this part of the mechanism .
But how a physiological instrument - how any kind of mechanism - can think and feel and plan and will and remember and hope and love , we certainly cannot explain .
And probably we shall never be able to explain how such a thing can happen ; for the thing to be explained does not happen , it is only imagined to happen through a misapprehension .
The truth is that it is we ourselves who really do all the psychical things ; we employ our bodies only as instruments for recording and transmitting our thoughts and for exercising muscular action on matter .
The body itself neither thinks nor wills nor sees nor feels .
It is an instrument , a channel , a medium .
Although full explanations about our method of controlling of a body are not yet forthcoming - either on this side or on that - yet those ' on the other side ' are quite willing to accept the suggestion that their bodies , which to them feel so substantial , and all the surroundings in which they exist , are related to the thing which we here call the Ether , very much in the same way as they used to be related to the familiar thing known as Matter .
That Ether is a very substantial entity , far denser than any form of matter , has been gradually becoming clear to physicists .
At first , we only said that it must be denser than lead or gold or platinum , but now we find that it must be out of all proportion denser .
I have made an estimate of its density , in the light of electromagnetic theory , and it comes out inevitably huge .
Every cubic millimetre contains as much substance as what , if it were matter , we should call a thousand tons .
As the Ether is not matter in the ordinary sense of the term , our ordinary units of measurement are inappropriate ; but on the analogy of matter , the Ether is of the order a million million times as dense as water .
All its properties are of supernormal magnitude .
Its rate of vibration which enables us to see any ordinary object is five hundred million million per second : a number so great that to try to conceive such a number of vibrations per second simply dizzies us .
The number of seconds which have passed since ancient geological periods of twenty million years ago is about this number .
Yet we familiarly make use of these vibrations .
Our wonderful organ , the eye , is constructed so as to cope with them , in the easiest possible manner .
And most people are ignorant - as ignorant as are the animals - of the strange ethereal environment amid which we all live , and of which the vibrations convey to us so much information , and awaken so keenly our sense of beauty .
Until instructed , we can hardly help thinking of matter as dense , and of Ether as tenuous , but that is a poetic illusion associated with the term ' ethereal ' .
It is an illusion based on the testimony of our senses , which , as so often happens , have to be corrected by deeper insight into the real nature of things .
Matter appeals to us so strongly , not because it is anything but a gossamer - like or milky - way existence in the vast continuity of Ether , but because our obvious bodies are made of matter , and because our animal sense organs are specially adapted to existence in association with matter , and give us information about nothing else .
Even light , which we know is an Ether vibration , tells us nothing about itself without study ; what it tells us familiarly is - not about light , but - about the material objects which have emitted or scattered or differentially absorbed it .
We get this information by lifelong , indeed age - long , inherited and instinctive experience .
We interpret the luminous indications without difficulty , and we forget the strangely complex nature of the processes which underlie all our channels of information ; we only find their true nature out when phenomena are fundamentally analysed and seriously cross-questioned .
When we have pursued this line of investigation for many years , we find that the important thing in the physical Universe is Ether , and that matter is trivial in comparison .
Yet we can freely admit that matter takes such splendid and beautiful forms that it is worthy of the continued study of generations of scientific men ; and we need not wonder that they become so enthusiastic over its properties that they are able to imagine it the sole reality in existence .
That , however , is a mistake ; it constitutes a mechanism actuated and wielded by mental and spiritual power , which is dominant and supreme .
Notes
The Ether referred to in this article has now been discovered by our Bath - based scientist Ronald Pearson .
His paper ' Quantum Gravitation and the Structured Ether ' has been published by the Russian Academy of Sciences following the Sir lsaac Newton Conference that was held in 1993 .
Pearson 's discovery was also published in 1997 by the Center for Frontier Sciences in the USA in an article called Consciousness as a Sub - Quantum Phenomenon .
Every qualified scientist who does the same as Sir Oliver Lodge , connects survival after death with subatomic physics , is immediately censored in Great Britain !
The work of Michael Faraday , the great scientist on the back of our 20 pound notes , connecting survival after death with subatomic physics , has also been censored : " Nothing is too wonderful to be true , if it be consistent with the laws of nature . "
The public do not know that the French Nobel Laureate for medical science , Professor Charles Richet , carried out the same repeatable experiments under laboratory conditions , proving survival after death , as Sir William Crookes FRS ;
Richet made this statement : " There is ample proof that experimental materialisations should take definite rank as a scientific fact . "
The Scottish pioneer of television , John Logie Baird , tells in his memoirs how one of his colleagues carried out an experiment where he took the fingerprints of a recently deceased person who materialised .
These prints were identical to the ones on the dead physical body .
This proof would have been good enough to hang somebody in Britain only a few years ago .
We have put the word out on the Internet for a fully developed materialisation medium to come forward and let our scientific team go in with John Logie Baird 's infrared camera to film deceased people being physically reunited with their loved ones who are still on earth .
To avoid the inevitable accusations of fraud from professional bigots , the filming will be carried out under auspices of a current Nobel Laureate for Physics .
Those with a great deal to lose from the truth had to wait for Sir William Crookes to die before they had the courage to accuse him of fraud .
The British people are only allowed access to information that is harmless to orthodox , scientific teaching that says the mind and the brain are the same ; that death is the end of everything .
Qualified scientists who are adamant that we all survive death are never allowed on British television to balance the arguments of experts ( psychologists ) like Dr Susan Blackmore and Dr Richard Wiseman .
Throwing out Christian Huygen 's theory of the Ether ( the " spirit " world ) , and replacing it with Einstein 's Relativity , set scientific advancement back 100 years .
Only one expert opinion is reaching the public in what is meant to be a free country .
The people have not been told that the one million dollars offered by the magician James Randi is a trick .
Randi says he will pay the money to anybody who can prove that so - called paranormal phenomena exist .
He will never have to part with the money because he is the sole judge and jury .
Randi does not recognise the experiments and conclusions of independent scientists .
His legal contract consists of twelve conditions that make sure his money is protected .
Why are we not told this on television ?
The astrophysicist , Sam Nicholls MSc , stood up during the filming of Randi's TV series on the paranormal and challenged him to give a balance .
Randi panicked and ordered all the cameras to be switched off .
Randi only takes on soft targets who have never read subatomic physics .
The only reason the experimental proof of survival - carried out by international teams of scientists of the century - did not cause a revolution is because the experiments lacked a mathematical theory .
The Nobel Laureate for Physics , Professor Richard Feynman says : " If your theories and mathematics do not match the experiment , then they are wrong . '
This situation is summed up very well by Sir Oliver Lodge : " We have to be guided by the facts ; and if the facts seem incredible as they do we have first of all to assure ourselves that they are facts , and then conclude that there is a department of knowledge to which we have as yet not got the key . "
" Any possible utilisation of the ether , however , by discarnate intelligence must be left as a problem for the future . "
Well the future is here at the beginning of the 21st century and we now have Sir Oliver Lodge 's missing key .
I list all the books in my thesis ' The Scientific Proof of Survival After Death ' .
These are the books that the establishment forces are praying with all their might never to come to the attention of ordinary , decent people with nothing to lose from the truth .
Please help to tell millions about these wonderful , discoveries in physics that belong to every man , woman and child on earth .

IBM does not seem to care ...
What Roger Bowler is complaining about is that IBM will not license its z / OS software on TurboHercules ...
Something very similar happened to Fundamental Software , which had in the past licensed IBM 's patents ...
So this is news ?

" You know what I think the real problem is here ?
OSI has a list of licenses
that no one should have on any approved list , in my view , including some from
Microsoft , and I do n't think they plan to fix that any time soon . "
Keep in mind that IBM did n't say just ANY OSI approved license .
They said :
" All licenses certified by opensource.org and listed on their website as of
01/11/2005 are Open Source Software licenses for the purpose of this
pledge . "
So when did this " Q " license appear on the " approved " list
on the website ?
Was it AFTER 1/11/2005 ?
Likely .
In any case , you 're right - they reserved the right to defend themselves .

So ... all they wanted was to be able to use hardware of their choice with software they paid for ?
Forgive me , but I do n't believe that should be an allowable restriction .
Let me ask you this : what 's the difference between that an Microsoft 's platform restriction clause in their pseudo - FOSS licenses ?
Or are we going to say that Microsoft 's licenses are genuine FOSS now ?
And the whole " shades of Psystar " thing ... sorry .
I do n't buy the alleged conspiracy thing .
All you 've proven is that several different people hate EULAs .
Yes , I know you 've been hunted by Darl ( in an almost literal sense with the investigators he hired ) , but it distorted your perspective more than you seem to realize .
The GPL is not a EULA .
Attacking EULAs for their onerous restrictions is NOT an attack on the GPL .
I personally hate EULAs and love the GPL .
This is NOT some anti-GPL attitude .
I think you underestimate how many people genuinely hate and disrespect EULAs , while loving the GPL for creating freedom .
And yet you see conspiracy everywhere ... but never any proof .
Seriously , you had no trouble finding all the dirt on SCO , but you have n't found any financial ties , any personal ties , or any indication that these people do n't really feel this way .
I feel that it 's irresponsible to allege some kind of conspiracy unless you have better evidence than this .
You know how it felt to be unjustly accused of being in cahoots with IBM based on a lot of conjecture and a little circumstantial evidence , right ?
We know you 're not .
I 'm not saying you are .
But if someone wanted to make that case , the mere fact that a talented paralegal just happened to pop up out of nowhere to support IBM ( and FOSS 's ) side of the case is a LOT better circumstantial evidence of " conspiracy " than anything and everything you 've been able to put together on this alleged Psystar conspiracy .
And we know that that was wrong .
So what can you give us that 's more convincing evidence of some kind of legal attack on the GPL by Psystar & co.?
So far , all I 've got is evidence that a bunch of people who hate EULAs .
I 'm one of them ( though I 've never been in any IP lawsuits whatsoever ) .

Roger Bowler claims that IBM threatened TH before TH filed it 's complaint .
What I figure happened is this .
AIUI z/OS is licensed only to run on IBM hardware .
The license allows for an installation to be run on another machine for disaster - recovery purposes , but I do n't think " other machine " extends as far as " non -IBM hardware " .
Hercules was being used for development and testing purposes , and IBM had no problem looking the other way about just that .
But TurboHercules started talking to IBM customers about using TH 's software to run z/OS in a disaster - recovery role .
That goes beyond just development and testing , you 're now talking about running z/ OS in a primary role on non-IBM hardware when the main machine suffers an outage .
That 's not just a violation of the license , that 's a violation that impact 's IBM 's sales .
They 're not going to look the other way about that .
So IBM went to TH and said " Look , if you do n't stop this we 're going to have to come after you for inducing our customers to violate their license agreements . " .
Which is IMO reasonable , it 's IBM 's software , they get to choose their license terms and nobody else gets the right to interfere .
TH responded by filing their anti-trust complaint .
And right there 's where I put the line between reasonable and unreasonable .
If TH really thought IBM was in the wrong , they 'd 've filed their complaint when they started their business and not waited until IBM acted .
IMO all the anti-trust complaint is is an attempt to continue basing a business on getting IBM customers to violate their license agreements , knowing that IBM wo n't want to start cutting their own customers off and hoping that the complaint will make IBM back off of going after TH for tortious interference .
I 'd note that Roger even admits that TH 's goal is to make IBM change their license terms to allow running z/ OS on non-IBM hardware .
That 's IMO all well and good , but the way to go about it is to make your case to IBM and , if you feel it neccesary , the EU anti-trust officials , not by going to IBM 's customers and going " Hey , we can save you a few bucks if you 'll just break your contract with IBM . " .

Looking at the text of the patent pledge itself , from the PDF PJ linked , I see : IBM reserves the right to terminate this patent pledge and commitment only with regard to any party who files a lawsuit asserting patents or other intellectual property rights against Open Source Software .
Emphasis mine .
Note first that it specifies filing a lawsuit as a necessary step for losing the pledge protection .
I do n't think that complaining to the EU commission counts , though I could be wrong about that .
But in any case , IBM has n't said that TH has lost the pledge protection yet .
Still , this could prove interesting if this goes much further .
The more interesting point , though , is that it does n't say anything about IBM " defend[ing ] [ them ] selves " .
It defends " Open Source Software " , not IBM !
The EU complaint was about IBM proprietary software , not OSS , So if IBM did assert the two patents in question in this case , rather than merely listing them , I think they might well be violating their pledge .
I certainly hope it wo n't get that far .

IBM identifies the legally binding pledge as : The pledge will benefit any Open Source Software .
Open Source Software is any computer software program whose source code is published and available for inspection and use by anyone , and is made available under a license agreement that permits recipients to copy , modify and distribute the programs source code without payment of fees or royalties .
All licenses certified by opensource.org and listed on their website as of 01/11/2005 are Open Source Software licenses for the purpose of this pledge ..
Subject to the exception provided below , and with the intent that developers , users and distributors of Open Source Software rely on our promise , IBM hereby commits not to assert any of the 500 U.S. patents listed above , as well as all counterparts of these patents issued in other countries against the development , use or distribution of Open Source Software .
In order to foster innovation and avoid the possibility that a party will take advantage of this pledge and then assert patents or other intellectual property rights of its own against Open Source Software , thereby limiting the freedom of IBM or any other Open Source Software developer to create innovative software programs , or the freedom of others to distribute and use Open Source Software , the commitment not to assert any of these 500 U.S. patents and all counterparts of these patents issued in other countries is irrevocable except that IBM reserves the right to terminate this patent pledge and commitment only with regard to any party who files a lawsuit asserting patents or other intellectual property rights against Open Source Software .
This is pretty clear as far legally binding statements are concerned .
Although the not - legally - binding speech said that IBM would reserve the right to defend itself , the legally - binding pledge says " IBM hereby commits not to assert any of the 500 U.S. patents listed above ... against the development , use or distribution of Open Source Software .
... [ T ]he commitment not to assert any of these 500 U.S. patents ... is irrevocable except that IBM reserves the right to terminate this patent pledge and commitment only with regard to any party who files a lawsuit asserting patents or other intellectual property rights against Open Source Software . "
IBM seems to be complaining about the TurboHercules ' " use or distribution " of a project that qualifies for this pledge .
The fact that the project is not Linux is irrelevant .
The fact that the company is not the project sponsor is irrelevant .
The fact that the license is not the GPL is irrelevant .
The fact that TurboHercules goaded the EU into investigating IBM regarding antitrust statutes is irrelevant .
Unless you can see some way TurboHercules potentially violates the patents in question outside of the use or distribution of the qualifying software , TurboHercules should be covered by the pledge .
Until TurboHercules brings a patent " or other intellectual property rights " lawsuit against IBM .
Or would you say that the fact that I do n't contribute to the Linux kernel personally means that IBM can sue me with these patents for selling Linux CDs ?
I cannot see how the pledge can apply to anyone if it does not apply to TurboHercules .
Of course , IBM can assert the other 100+ patents .
But then that goes to the heart of the question of whether IBM is a trustworthy open source partner .
You can only trust them to not squish your open source project as long as you do n't make any waves that they do n't like .
You know what I think the real problem is here ?
OSI has a list of licenses that no one should have on any approved list , in my view , including some from Microsoft , and I do n't think they plan to fix that any time soon .
I have no idea how this is related in any way to the issue it hand .
If I did n't know any better , I would call it a red herring .

Please be more careful to separate the company TurboHercules , from the open
source software project Hercules .
While Rodger may have started the development
of Hercules quite a while back , he 's not been a ( major ? ) contributor for quite
some time .
The people who _are_ the core developers are most definitely not
" anti-IBM " but they were n't looking to monetize their efforts .
Rodger
is , which has brought things to the current state .
While you can argue that the Hercules developers have been knowingly violating
IBM 's patents for a long time , both parties involved ( excluding TurboHercules
which is fairly new to the scene ) were generally of the mind to just live and
let live .
Finally , do n't use the choice of license as any indication that the Hercules
project is some sort of ally with Microsoft .
They 're not .
They just want to
hack on their code in peace .

I 'm posting anon. for reasons that should be clear .
The hercules mainframe emulator has been very widely deployed in a development
and test role at many software houses with full knowledge of the management .
It is a very complete emulator , providing a full virtual mainframe on almost
any PC .
It 's usually , but not always , used in addition to a licensed box , and
in most cases is simply to provide more flexibility without having to pay for
a full mainframe for each developer .
Most of these companies have used a
developer license on a mix of small IBM ( e.g. P390 ) and Flex / ES systems , the
latter having been a reasonably priced option until that was discontinued .
Now the most realistic option for a small mainframe development company is to
buy time directly from IBM on a remote system , although I do n't know how easy
it would be to test with other vendors software on those machines .
This development use is not really going to make any difference to the IBM
profit margins though , as their real money comes from the large organisations
that use high spec hardware for their corporate systems .
The large
corporates do have hercules in use for training purposes , and in some cases
have tested their DR systems using an isolated hercules environment .
So IBM have left this as a grey area , until they have been challenged .
This
leaves me with mixed feelings .
I can see that there is a monopoly in this
specialist area , the IBM mainframes and operating systems , but there is also
no reason not to migrate to either another commercial OS , Linux or any other
system .
Large corporates can afford to migrate , and small companies and
individuals do n't normally have a reason to use a mainframe .
I do n't really understand why IBM have n't given developers the option of using
hercules since their split with the flex / es people , but it may be a legal
issue .
I know ( from IBM people ) that the hercules emulator has been ignored
by IBM for several years , and I assume they would have continued to ignore it
until forced to respond .
The hercules ( yahoo ) groups make it clear where
hercules is considered legal , but it 's obvious from the messages posted that
much of the usage is for recent versions of the operating systems .
So from my point of view , I would prefer that IBM would release their
operating systems to be freely available , but if they do n't want to then I
will find something else , or I 'll work with the developer access that they
offer .
It is IBM 's choice , their OS and if they want to ut off potential
customers , that 's up to them .
As far as I can see , there would be no reason not to offer a complete set of
z / series API calls within another OS ( similar to WINE ) , which could allow
mainframe programs to run without the IBM operating system , and that would
be a far more useful idea , so I suspect it 's already been done .
I am anti software patents , and I like to use free ( as in speech ) software ,
but here there are more issues than a simple free vs closed system ( is Mr
Bowler planning to pass some of his profits to those who have tested ,
documented , enhanced and fixed the code ? ) .
I can't condemn or support IBM in
this case .
And finally - IBM please provide the source code ( GPL ? ) , and at least a no
charge single user developer license , of Z/VM and Z / OS that can be used on
any platform .
Cheers

It 's that fishy smell again .
Here 's a few random memes for those who have n't studied the history of
computing ...
Back in the 1960s and 1970s , IBM were the undisputed leaders of mainframe
computing .
To be truthful , some of their technology was poorly designed and
badly executed , but it undeniably crunched the numbers .
However , because they
were the only game in the mainframe town , the US Government took interest from
an anti-trust perspective and as a result IBM were forcibly re-structured .
The internal APIs that underpin what was then OS / 360 were published by IBM in
compliance with court orders .
As a result , companies like Computer Associates
were able to provide software components - not merely companies producing
products like ADABAS / Natural , but actual Operating System sub-systems , such as
CA 's ACF / 2 plug - in security manager ( that still competes today with IBM's RACF ) .
At the same time , [ as noted in linked sites ] , competitors including Amdahl ,
Hitachi and Fujitsu stepped into the mainframe hardware space .
The mainframe
ecosystem entered a period of rapid change and fierce competition .
But make no
mistake , IBM really did n't get their own way .
For a while , systems like
Hitachi's 827 Skyline was the most powerful and fastest commercial mainframe in
the world .
IBM actually * pulled out * of the top end of the market because they
could n't compete .
But markets - and companies - changed .
IBM went through a rough patch and then
struck gold when Lou Gerstner , Jr , took the helm .
Meanwhile , just as IBM were
back on the ascendant , so Hitachi , Amdahl and Fujitsu scaled back their
mainframe programs .
If you remember , Microsoft and Sun Microsystems and others
were chanting " the mainframe is dead " .
The competing companies got
cold feet , decided to vector away from the platform and eventually fell by the
wayside .
IBM - because of their large and loyal customer base , stuck with it .
Fast forward to the 21st century and 2010 and the mainframe is fully resurgent .
So once again we have a situation in which someone who can ' force ' their way
into the market may make a killing .
So that 's a little subjective background ...
Now a few points to consider .
Firstly , with all due respect to those who posit this case is a mirror of
Apple 's recent adventures , it is n't .
Apple Inc provide personal microcomputers
and workstations for individual users - a market for which Microsoft has a
monopoly and which Linux has a growing share .
By comparison , today in the
mainframe market , IBM is pretty much the only game in town .
OK , I probably need
to concede that Bull HN Information Systems do offer the NovaScale family of
systems ( powered by Itanium technology , no less ) which run their GCOS - 8
Operation System . ( GCOS - General Comprehensive Operating System ) .
GCOS - 8 is
spiritually closer to zOS ( OS /390 ) than anything else from Bull .
But let 's be
honest , Bull are a tiny player in comparison with IBM .
So the first important point to consider is that we can't make comparisons
between this IBM case and the Apple story from last year .
The MO may be similar
( it is ) but the context is wildly different .
The second important point to make is there in the history books .
IBM has
previously licensed z/OS to several other mainframe providers ( Amdahl , Fujitsu
and Hitachi ) .
So at this point we do n't know the specifics , but there will be
reasons that IBM are cautious about TurboHercules .
The third point of interest for me ( and I 'll concede up front that this may well
be purely coincidental ) is that this company are based in France and are
leveraging the EU Commission to direct fire at IBM .
Hmm ...
What other large and
well - known computer company ran foul of the EU Commission in recently history ?
Learning experience maybe ?
The fourth point of interest for me is that TurboHercules are a privately held
company .
Now , in and of itself there is nothing unusual about that .
But as we've
seen in the SCO saga , ' piercing the corporate veil ' gets 10 times harder when
the veil belongs to a private company .
No Executive Directors , no shareholders ,
no SEC filings , no way of knowing what 's going on , where the funding comes from ,
or the like .
Let 's be careful here though .
The absence of transparency does not
automatically imply any form of wrong - doing .
The fifth point of interest is well articulated by Eric Raymond .
He points out
that IBM are asserting patent infringement on two of the 500 patents that made
up their Linux - friendly pledge , and he points out that maybe it would have been
sensible for IBM to think through their strategy a bit before going public with
their actions .
I 'm inclined to agree there .
So ... lots of " curiouser and curiouser " going on here .
Any tech - savvy
industry player is going to be familiar with the Apple vs Psystar case and this
IBM / TurboHercules story is pretty much a dead ringer .
The question is - did the TH case come about because the TH guys watched Psystar
and thought to themselves , " Hey , that might work for us - let 's do a
mainframe clone ! " , or did it come about because someone else thought ,
" Golly , we nearly had success in ' sending a jab ' Apple 's way .
Now maybe we
should try and ' send a jab ' to IBM instead ? "
I hope IBM reconsider their tactics with respect to TurboHercules .
I also think
that TurboHercules , if they are a genuine company and not out to be " Agents
Provocateurs " need to stop with the rhetoric and sit down with IBM to work
this one out .
" Divide and conquer " is as valid in the IT industry as it was for
Ghenkis Khan , and when it boils down to it , both IBM and TH want us to believe
that they are FOSS - friendly .
Well guys , if that 's true , learn to play nice , huh ?

The patents in question do n't matter .
Remember how IBM had so much stuff on SCO they dropped the patents because it
was a distraction ?
That will happen here , in the small , if it becomes too much of a distraction .
" Oops , you 're right , technically we agreed not use these 4 patents against
you .
But let 's talk about these OTHER 300 patents here ... "

I 'm not really interested in this case ( yet ) so I have n't done any research
other than read news highlights and this article .
Here 's my question , why can't people buy software that runs on IBM 's mainframe
OS and then run it on Hercules ?
Is it the fact that IBM wo n't sell it unless
you own an IBM mainframe ?
Is IBM the only company making software for the IBM
mainframe ?
From the previous articles , it was made clear that Apple 's EULA is prevents
people from running Apple OS on non-Apple hardware legally .
What about WINE ?
Are there restrictions in the EULAs that comes with most / some
Windows software that prevents them from running on non-Windows environments ?
If there was a WINE like interface to allow Apple software ( not the OS ) to run
on Linux would that be allowed ?
I would think so unless prevented by an EULA .
From my little bit of understanding , I think the IBM issue is a bit different
from Apple 's issue since Hercules is replacing the OS not just a way to install
the IBM OS onto a generic computer .
It seems like it is more like WINE running
Windows applications under Linux .
Perhaps the EULAs on mainframes are better
written .

If TurboHercules wants to sue someone so bad it might be best for them to not
use the GPL ( sorta like PJ made reference to ) as that would bar them from
distributing GPL libraries .
Yes the OSI REALLY needs to cull the list of approved licenses .
As usual PJ has shed some light on the issue as before I read this I thought
their partnering with Microsoft was just their being platform and OS agnostic .
If it were not for the choice of license and their suing first I might still
think that .
This issue does not go as far as Pystar if you ask me anymore than
Linux infringes Apple . [ Reply to This | # ]

In October last year , the US Department of Justice began an investigation of IBM 's mainframe market tactics , after the company was accused of using its dominant market position to unfairly squeeze out any upstart competition .
The investigation was initiated at the prompting of Washington DC - based lobby group , the Computer & Communication Industry Association .
-- IBM faces mainframe biz European antitrust probe - Kelly Fiveash , The Register , 2010 - 03 - 23 How much did Microsoft pay CCIA this time ?
I do n't assume IBM is spotless , but the involvement of CCIA makes me very suspicious of exactly who is on the attack , here .
Lately it seems like any business in Microsoft 's way is coming up for antitrust complaints .
I could n't help but reflect -- and I confess it was my first reaction -- that it's so odd that all Microsoft 's competitors end up dealing with unexpected allegations , sometimes from small companies , against them in court or before regulatory bodies that just happen to threaten their viability in the marketplace .

How can I tell it is hypocrisy ?
Substitute M$ for IBM in that story , and
suddenly turbohercules would be the poor downtrodden victims .
I mean , you are actually talking about a patent defense as if it were right and
just -
Since when do software patents get such good press around here ?

I found the post by the mainframe developer very interesting , but not
surprising .
While running z / OS using an emulator on x86 hardware may work very well for
development , I 'd be pretty skeptical of the ability to match mainframe hardware
under really heavy loads .
If it would , then IBM would n't enjoy the mainframe
Linux market they have .
If IBM 's licensed code is running on mainframe hardware whether from IBM or
another manufacturer , a bug is clearly a problem in the mainframe software
stack .
Running on an emulator ?
Who knows ?
It can be very expensive to figure
out .
Especially if the problem only happens once in a while under heavy load
and your contract has non-performance penalties .

The complaint against IBM was filed with the EU Commission by TurboHercules .
At that exact moment , did they not take themselves out from under the patent pledge 's safety umbrella ?
No , they did not .
According to the pledge : " ... except that IBM reserves the right to terminate this patent pledge and commitment only with regard to any party who files a lawsuit asserting patents or other intellectual property rights against Open Source Software " .
TurboHercules is not asserting patent rights or other intellectual property rights against Open Source Software .
They 've not filed a lawsuit , either . . [ Reply to This | # ]

The Register had a story on this back in the fall of 2009 when TurboHercules started on this business strategy .
Mainframe emulator goes commercial - Hercules , son of z / OS .
The Register commented then that the situation looked likely to end up in court .
They also mentioned the ties to Microsoft .
TurboHercules is co-headquartered in Paris , France , where Bowler moved after he left the United Kingdom , and in Seattle , Washington , in close proximity to the one big software company that has in the past taken a shining to anything that gave Big Blue some grief , particularly with mainframes .
( Yes , we mean Microsoft ) .
The article makes it clear that TurboHercules is pursuing the " disaster recovery " angle because they think that it's a loophole in IBM 's software license .
The problem that IBM would have with allowing this is that a lot of customers would be tempted to not bother replacing their broken mainframes and just continue to run their legacy applications indefinitely on the Hercules emulator .
That would undercut a big part of IBM 's business .
There is very little doubt in anyone 's mind that at least some of the Hercules emulators out there are running real and modern mainframe stacks , and they can do so because even with the heavy midrange penalty , an x64 server can deliver the performance of a midrange mainframe .
We 're talking something on the order of dozens to hundreds of MIPS , and to IBM , that 's something on the order of hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars over a many - year span for hardware , software , and services .
It is also clear that TurboHercules customer 's are looking to their services in order to avoid buying IBM mainframes .
The first customer to put TurboHercules through the paces is an unnamed state government that had a $ 200,000 budget to implement disaster recovery for an aging System / 390 mainframe .
The state cannot afford to upgrade to a modern z 10 box , much less get two of them for disaster recovery .
It just wants to keep the System / 390 running , which is long since paid for , pay its monthly software licensing and maintenance fees to Big Blue , and have an emergency box on which to load up its applications in the event that the System / 390 fails .
There seems to be lots of parallels with the Pystar case .

According to something about this on Slashdot a few days ago ...
IBM 's suit against TurboHercules listed something like 143 patents , only 2 of
which are even covered by the patent pledge .
This is a total non-story , other than the
" trouble-possibly - stirred-up- by - Microsoft ? " angle .

As someone who works with mainframes for a living , I 've been following and using Hercules for quite a few years .
I started back when it was Roger Bowler 's hobby .
Over the years , it picked up a very talented and enthusiastic group of developers who have turned it into an amazing piece of work .
Back when IBM was still sponsoring commercial emulation efforts as a cheap alternative to expensive mainframes , Hercules rapidly outpaced those products , if not in speed ( it 's portable ) , but in capability .
When IBM eventually abandoned the emulation market , Hercules was the only thing left .
Hercules embodies the spirit of Open Source .
Very little of the development is done by Roger , or his successor , Jay Maynard .
There are at least a dozen other contributors who have added major parts of the code .
I , myself , contributed a couple of minor fixes .
The article above contains some MAJOR inaccuracies about Hercules and it's origins and developers .
1 ) Hercules - the - project is NOT , to my knowledge , funded by Microsoft or anyone else .
Jay runs the project web site from his home over his personal DSL line .
I can't speak for the " Turbo Hercules " company , but I doubt that is either .
I believe that this is simply an attempt by Roger and Jay to try to kill two birds with one stone :
Make a few bucks off something they 've both put a lot of their lives into , and also force IBM to provide a licensing option for their mainframe operating systems that would also benefit the " hobbyist " users .
Up to now , we have been limited to running Linux or ancient versions of IBM 's mainframe OS's .
2 ) Hercules was developed originally under Linux .
The Windows version was developed as a side project by a couple of participants who simply wanted to run it under that OS .
If I remember correctly , at least one of them was unemployed at the time .
Nothing sinister there , just the community working the way it should .
3 ) Hercules kill off the mainframe ?
Hardly !
I 'm surprised IBM even had the nerve to try that argument !
The problem the mainframe has under IBM 's current philosophy is that nobody except large companies can afford to develop for it .
With licensing on Hercules , IBM could benefit by an increased interest in the architecture .
Unfortunately , they do n't see it that way .
IBM believes they can address this by selling time on virtual systems .
It is n't working though .
Psychologically , it is n't a satisfactory solution for the small developers , so they go elsewhere , to other platforms where the barriers to entry are lower , and they can do their development work on laptops and whatnot .
Would it make sense for Microsoft to support a product that would enhance IBM 's platform offering ?
Especially one that runs VERY well on Linux ?
4 ) Roger and Jay are not opposed to Open Source , but they both have issues with the GPL .
Personally , I do n't share their opinions , but there 's no arguing with them , their minds are made up .
The problem seems to revolve around the idea that if you use one piece of GPL'd code in your product , somehow , magically , the whole thing becomes GPL'd .
This is patently absurd , but they brook no argument about it .
They picked the license they did because they believe strongly that the GPL is " Viral " and they do not want to risk losing control of their baby .
Since it IS their product , they are welcome to use any license they wish .
That point has been made on Groklaw dozens of times , and should be respected .
When I first read of " Turbo Hercules " , I was skeptical .
I thought Roger and Jay were taking a terrible chance , and it seems my fears were borne out .
Despite the predictions of a few self - proclaimed pundits on the project mailing lists , IBM does n't seem to be interested in killing off the project totally , but they do not want to sanction it as a platform for their mainframe offerings .
Not only would that take profits from their hardware business ( think Apple ) , but it would also open them up to a whole world of support problems as people demand they address problems that are actually the fault of the emulator .
Customers pay big bucks for z / OS and z / VM , and they expect a certain level of service .
IBM can provide that if they control the whole package , but they learned in the past that when third parties are involved , things get much more complicated .
That 's my $ .02 , I will most likely not respond to trolls or questions regarding Roger and Jay 's philosophies and beliefs .
I just wanted to set the records a bit straight about where all this came from , and what it 's really all about .

The Timeline ( as reported in the press ) : IBM licenses its mainframe operating system z / OS with an EULA .
I have n't seen that EULA , but it almost certainly prevents the customer from running z/ OS on hardware other than IBM mainframes .
In 2005 IBM pledged not to assert its intellectual property portfolio against FOSS , except in self - defense .
TurboHercules ( TH ) developed an emulator that allows IBM 's z /OS to run on plain vanilla x86 hardware .
In other words , actually using the TH product would probably violate the IBM EULA .
TH acknowledged as much in that they asked IBM for permission changes ( i.e. to the EULA ) , and were rebuffed .
TH went ahead and made their emulator available anyway .
IBM then warned TH 's product violates IBM 's intellectual property ( a different issue from the EULA ) , but apparently did n't file suit or a formal complaint against TH .
TH filed a complaint against IBM with the EU's Director General for Competition on March 23 , 2010 .
IBM invoked the self - defence clause , opening the way to a suit against TH .
The Issues : IBM's z/OS EULA : Does it or does it not permit z/ OS to run on the machines TH 's emulator is targetting ?
If not , then the issues in the case do have similarities to Apple vs Psystar .
Is IBM 's invoking the self - defense clause of its pledge a legitimate use of that clause ?
IBM 's patent portfolio : Does TH 's product itself violate IBM's IP ? [ Reply to This | # ]

IMVHO , IBM could and should sidestep the FLOSS issue by simply saying " OK
you 're right , you 're infringing on these two but the pledge applies so we won't
sue over them .
Now we have a busload of attorneys who would like to talk with
you about the 100 other patents you 're infringing that are * not* covered " .
I think the majority of the community understands when mistakes are made so long
as they get corrected quickly .
Even if a case could be made that the pledge
does not apply ( and I 'm not convinced one way or the other ) , setting those two
aside for the sake of PR might not be a bad idea .
Kind of like nuclear arms treaties .
Sure , we 'll give up 100 warheads each .
We 'll just have to make do with the other 8,000 .
No practical difference but
they get to pat each other on the back for a while .

1 . If software patents are evil , how do we abide IBM using them ?
2 . I do n't recall that the US anti trust law suit that the US dropped forced IBM
to reorganize .
Although certainly IBM was positioning itself for the prospect of
being broken apart .
3 . I worked for IBM during those anti trust days .
IBM acknowledged being a
monopoly , which is not illegal .
It did impose restrictions on their / our
behavior .
One of which was bundling .
There is room for argument that there is a
monopoly bundling issue here .
Getting the EU involved may have been
appropriate .
4. Emulating hardware to run z / OS sounds risky to me .
IBM puts in a lot of
hardware in their machines to catch hardware failures , that omitted , could lead
to undetectable erroneous emulation .
5 . I can't say I understood the Psystar issues I 'm still stuck on the Wine and
Microsoft analogies .
Which really do n't apply .
6 . If I can buy OSX at the store in the retail consumer market , I can see a
legal argument for using it on my favorite non-Apple box .
The EULA may just be
overreaching consumer protection laws .

Something else to consider here - if IBM does nothing - they are silently
approving this - having to support issues that may come up on non-certified
hardware ( since this is an emulator ) .
For testing - non critical , or even
educational purposes - Maybe - and that is a real stretch .. but if I was IBM - I
would n't want this out there either simply from the support end of it .

Several posters have written regarding IBM 's EULA covering z / OS and z / VM .
There
appears to be an implicit assumption is that IBM mainframe software is
" purchased " in a manner similar to a retail purchase of Windows 7 or
OSX , and therefore has a EULA .
Unless something has changed in the last 15
years ( which I find unlikely ) , IBM does not " sell " their software .
IBM 's mainframe software is licensed , not sold .
You do n't go to Staples ,
OfficeMax , or Best Buy and purchase a copy .
You sign a contract with IBM .
The
contract allow you to run the licensed software on one or more specific systems
( usually by serial number ) .
If you want to move that license to a different
system , you have to notify IBM .
If the new system is in a different hardware
class , you may have to pay for the privilege .
If it 's an limited term license ,
you have to pay to renew it .
If you want support , fixes , updates , or new
versions , you typically have to purchase a maintenance or support contract .
The
license may , or may not , require that you have a support contract in place to
run the software .
There is no need for a EULA like we have with most
" purchased " software .
There may be some parallels with the Psystar situation , but maybe not as many as
some might suppose .
For example , there can be no " right of first
sale " argument because no one ever purchases a " copy " of z /OS or
z / VM , only a license .

TurboHercules is co-headquartered in Paris , France , where Bowler moved after he left the United Kingdom , and in Seattle , Washington , in close proximity to the one big software company that has in the past taken a shining to anything that gave Big Blue some grief , particularly with mainframes .
( Yes , we mean Microsoft ) .
Can anyone tell me when he live in Seattle ?
On his personal home page he shows off the cars he has owned and used from 1972 thru at least 2003 .
So if he lived in Seattle , it was after 2003 because from 1972 to 2003 he appears not to have lived outside of the UK .
His personal home page has been at its current location in France since at least January 2 , 2008 according to the Internet Archive .
That leaves just those years between 2004 and 2007 that are unaccounted for .
But then this post seems to confirm France in 2007 , as well as 2006 , and 2005 .
So now that just leaves 2004 that is in question .
Well here is a reference date stamped in 2004 that would lead me to also believe that he was living in France .
So unless anyone can find some more concrete evidence that this particular Roger Bowler ever lived in Seattle , please by all means post it here with more proof than a Register article that may have their facts a bit confused .

IBM 's pledge not to " assert " some 500 software patents it holds against " Open Source Software " is linked above but not directly quoted .
For convenience let 's cite two passages .
First is one concerning the legal enforceability of IBM 's pledge :
It is our intent that this pledge be legally binding and enforceable by any open source software developer , distributor , or user who uses one or more of the 500 listed U.S. patents and / or the counterparts of these patents issued in other countries .
Next is the meat of the pledge , including the only reservation IBM gives about revoking or terminating the pledged rights : IBM hereby commits not to assert any of the 500 U.S. patents listed below , as well as all counterparts of these patents issued in other countries , against the development , use or distribution of Open Source Software .
In order to foster innovation and avoid the possibility that a party will take advantage of this pledge and then assert patents or other intellectual property rights of its own against Open Source Software , thereby limiting the freedom of IBM or any other Open Source Software developer to create innovative software programs , the commitment not to assert any of these 500 U.S. patents and all counterparts of these patents issued in other countries is irrevocable except that IBM reserves the right to terminate this patent pledge and commitment only with regard to any party who files a lawsuit asserting patents or other intellectual property rights against Open Source Software .
My argument for the wrongness of IBM 's assertion of software patents against TurboHercules is simple and no doubt familiar to any regular Groklaw reader from the past year .
Software patents are illegitimate monopolies .
That direct thesis is support by two additional concerns .
IBM continues to hold a monopoly share ( 90 % ) of the mainframe hardware market , and the assertion of its patents against TurboHercules is manifestly IBM 's tactic to maintain that monopoly .
Furthermore IBM is violating its OSS pledge with respect to two patents , U.S. 5613086 and U.S. 5220669 .
The inclusion of these in both the pledge and IBM 's letter to TurboHercules is not disputed .
IBM has issued statements recognizing the overlap and trying to simultaneously stand behind both the pledge and the letter .
One approach rationalizes that the letter is merely providing the patent references at TurboHercules 's request .
In the other approach IBM suggests that TurboHercules and their emulator may not be covered by the pledge :
In 2005 , when IBM announced open access to 500 patents that we own , we said the pledge is applicable to qualified open - source individuals or companies .
We have serious questions about whether TurboHercules qualifies .
TurboHercules is a member of organizations founded and funded by IBM competitors such as Microsoft to attack the mainframe .
We have doubts about TurboHercules ' motivations .
PJ takes this argument a bit further , and frankly I 'm more concerned with her opinions than with IBM 's PR efforts .
So let me address some of PJ 's points in roughly descending order of how I perceive their strength .
0 . IBM is free to sue ...
Of course .
In America , if you have the money , you can sue anybody for anything .
IBM has the funds , so technically I agree with PJ about this .
However it seems to me unlikely that software patents will be a critical element of any lawsuit IBM files against TurboHercules , and certainly not the two patents for which IBM gave s " legally enforceable " pledge not to assert against open source software developers .
Even discounting the rough third of the potentially infringed " patents " IBM listed in their letter that have not yet issued , if IBM wants to go the patent route , they have several dozen software patents to choose from without blatantly reneging on their 2005 OSS pledge .
1 . TurboHercules is n't covered by the pledge
This would be a really strong point , but IBM 's musings about TurboHercules 's motivations and being " a member of organizations founded and funded by IBM competitors such as Microsoft to attack the mainframe " do n't find much traction in their actual wording of the OSS pledge .
PJ tackles the coverage more directly , questioning whether the QPL really counts : " OSI has a list of licenses that no one should have on any approved list , in my view ... "
Yet the QPL has been around in the formed approved by OSI since 1999 , so it 's not " some devilishly clever way to take advantage of that list " as PJ puts it .
What specifically is wrong with the QPL ?
PJ quotes the FSF , maintainers of the GPL , to the effect that what 's wrong with the QPL is not being compatible with the GPL .
With all due respect to the GPL and credit to the FSF for maintaining it , this really does n't disqualify QPL or dozens of alternatives from the open source definition .
2 . TurboHercules forfeited coverage by attacking IBM
Although not a point IBM has articulated , at least so far , this is the one PJ leads with .
Who , she asks , is suing whom ?
" It 's not IBM , folks .
The complaint against IBM was filed with the EU Commission by TurboHercules .
At that exact moment , did they not take themselves out from under the patent pledge 's safety umbrella ? "
Not that I see .
The OSS pledge says it " is irrevocable except that IBM reserves the right to terminate this patent pledge and commitment only with regard to any party who files a lawsuit asserting patents or other intellectual property rights against Open Source Software . "
TurboHercules formally accused IBM of abusing their monopoly power in the mainframe hardware market , but that EU process is not a lawsuit , and it has not asserted IP rights " against Open Source Software . "
Technically neither party has filed a lawsuit asserting patent rights , but since IBM 's pledge was not " to assert " the 500 patents against an OSS developer , subject to the one revocation condition , they stand to " win the battle but lose the war " if they continue .
3 . It 's like Apple vs. Psystar Analogies can be very poor arguments .
Any real strength depends on a close analysis of functional similarity .
Apple vs. Psystar was not based on software patents .
TurboHercules is not selling hardware nor reselling IBM 's operating system .
If IBM wants to make their case similar to Apple 's , they would do well to start with the title of Apple 's initial complaint against Psystar : Complaint for Copyright Infringement , Induced Copyright Infringement , Breach of Contract , Trademark Infringement , Trade Dress Infringement and Unfair Competition .
See anything there about patents ?
The Courts , which did n't buy Psystar 's arguments that Apple has a monopoly -- on Apple computers , will not have to set any precedents to find IBM has a monopolistic marketshare in the mainframe hardware market .

Back in the 1960s , IBM was by far the dominant computer company .
It had competitors ( notably Burroughs , Univac , NCR , CDC , and Honeywell - collectively known as the BUNCH from their initials ) , but it looked as though they would all go out of business eventually , one by one .
IBM had a monopoly .
It used illegal means to try extend its monopoly on computers to the peripherals ( tape drives , disks , printers ) attached to them .
There was a big antitrust lawsuit and IBM was forced to allow non-IBM peripherals to connect to IBM mainframes .
A few companies also entered the business of making " clones " of IBM mainframes to run IBM operating systems .
Basically , the result of the antitrust settlement was that IBM had to " unbundle " its offerings .
It was not allowed to insist that you could connect only IBM peripherals to an IBM mainframe , or only run IBM operating systems on an IBM mainframe .
This opened up the market for makers of " IBM - compatible " mainframes , for example Amdahl and Fujitsu ( there were others ) .
These companies made computers that were compatible with the IBM 370 hardware , and customers could license IBM software to run on them .
IBM had to let them do that because it was part of the anti-trust settlement .
IANAL , and also I have not studied the TurboHercules affair in detail , but I think that if that settlement had still been in force , it would have allowed TurboHercules to do what it is doing .
IBM 's smart lawyers got the terms of the settlement cancelled , in about 2000 IIRC .
This left IBM free to pursue its anti-competitive practices which had been illegal .
Groklaw attracted a lot of readers like me because in the SCO case , the distinction between Right and Wrong was very clear .
SCO was morally and legally in the wrong .
No unbiased person could have had any doubt that SCO 's management were scoundrels .
It did n't matter whether you were on the side of the morally right , or on the side of the law , or even whether you thought they were the same thing .
SCO was wrong , SCO was abusing the legal system , SCO was bad , wherever you were coming from and however you sliced it .
Groklaw 's more recent crusades , first against Psystar and now against TurboHercules , leave me cold .
PJ says the law is against both of them .
She has a track record of successfully predicting several legal outcomes , and I believe her .
However , I have a lot less respect for the law than PJ has .
We need a legal system , but it is too often used by the wealthy and powerful to crush the little guy .
And legal right does not always equate to moral right .
I expect IBM will use the legal system to crush TurboHercules as effectively as Apple used the legal system to cruch Psystar .
Neither Apple nor IBM needs our help .
And frankly , I do n't think either of them deserves it .
I like openness .
I like ' unbundling ' as the IBM antitrust settlement of the 1960s implemented it .
I think a company should be able to copyright its software , and maybe it should be able to patent its hardware ; but it should n't be allowed to insist that its hardware may not be connected to somebody else 's hardware , and it should n't be allowed to insist that its software may only be run on its hardware or that its hardware may only be used to run its software .
The law in the United States nowadays is increasingly what big corporations want it to be .
There 's not much we can do about that , and there 's not much we can do when another megacorporation crushes another little guy whose ideas threaten the megacorp 's profits .
But we do n't have to cheer them on .

It is possible that the two patents were included in the list erroneously and
that IBM will with draw those two .
That still leaves 170 + patents not covered by
the pledge .
As for the argument that patents are bad and we should n't support companies that
use them , I think we live in the real world where patents exist and are used .
If
the " good guys " ca n't use them then that ties one hand behind their
back . [ Reply to This | # ]

I 'm the project manager for Hercules , the open source emulator .
There 's a lot here that needs correcting .
As a general note , any patent complaint against TurboHercules SAS must necessarily be a complaint against the open source Hercules emulator .
TurboHercules SAS sells services and support for the open source emulator , and does not have code of its own .
They use the open source emulator unaltered .
Thus , IBM 's patent threats against TurboHercules SAS are threats against open source .
Do we really want to encourage that from anyone ?
The patent pledge 's safety umbrella only allows IBM to back out in the case of someone that sues open source software , not IBM itself , and only on patent or intellectual property grounds .
TurboHercules SAS 's complaint alleges illegal tying of IBM 's mainframe software and hardware .
This is not an intellectual property complaint , but an antitrust complaint .
Thus , I believe that IBM 's threat against Hercules is a violation of its patent pledge .
The pledge clearly applies to Hercules .
Hercules adopted the QPL license for the code with release 1.70 , on 3 December 2000 , as shown in the What 's New page .
The change was originally made in order to qualify for the Cygwin exception to the GPL ; at the time , Hercules needed Cygwin to run on Windows .
Whether or not PJ or the FSF agree with the Open Source Initiative that the QPL meets the Open Source Definition , and therefore qualifies as an Open Source license , is immaterial ; that decision is the OSI board 's to make , and it did so , including the QPL in the original list of Open Source licenses .
That it 's not GPL - compatible is not part of the Open Source Definition , nor should it be ; no matter what Richard Stallman would have us believe , the GPL is not the be-all and end - all of Open Source licensing .
Not only that , but the FSF even says that the QPL is a free software license .
Why is n't that enough ?
PJ asks ,
And if you are spooked by the GPL , for the very reason Microsoft says it is , in what sense are you a Linux person or a FOSS person ?
The GPL is the dominant license of the FOSS community .
It 's the license on Linux .
I 've opposed the GPL for more than two decades .
My fundamental objection to it is that it is an attempt by one programmer to tell another what he may do with his own work .
I use GPLd software every day , but I will not work on it for this reason .
That does n't make me any less of a Linux or Open Source person ; if it did , the Open Source Initiative would have only approved the GPL , instead of the range of licenses it has .
I 'm not a Free Software person for similar reasons ; I view the FSF as committing the classic " making love for virginity " error in its destruction of freedom in the name of supporting it .
IBM 's statement questioning TurboHercules SAS 's motives is nothing more than an attempt to back out of its patent pledge in cases where it does n't like someone .
The plain language of the pledge leaves IBM no wiggle room , and yet IBM is trying to wiggle out of it anyway .
Roger Bowler moved to Paris in the year 2000 as well , long before any of us thought about trying to commercialize Hercules as TurboHercules SAS is doing .
He moved there because that 's where his job was .
There were no nefarious reasons for his doing so .
The conspiracy theories swirling here are laughable .
If Microsoft were funding this effort , I would n't be running the Hercules website out of my basement on an Alphaserver 4000 ( which is running Gentoo Linux , BTW ; I 've been a happy Linux user and supporter ever since version 0.11 ) and driving a crappy old 1989 Ford Bronco II I bought for $ 125 .
I 'm flat broke , and none of Microsoft 's billions of dollars are flowing to me .
Similarly , I refuse to hold myself responsible for what Maureen O'Gara , Florian Mueller , or others that the folks here believe are evil incarnate think .
Larry Niven said that " Ideas are not responsible for those who hold them ; there is no idea so good you wo n't find a fool , or a poltroon , who agrees with it . "
Arguing that Hercules deserves to be hit with the patent hammer because of those who support it are nothing more than the classic fallacy of ad hominem , and I 'd expect better from the folks on this site .
The difference between this case and the Psystar case is that , unlike Apple , IBM holds an absolute , 100 % monopoly in a marketplace : that of legacy mainframe computing .
They have determinedly driven other suppliers out of the market .
Unlike Apple , an IBM mainframe customer cannot easily migrate away from the mainframe .
There literature is full of stories , and the landscape littered with corpses , of companies trying and failing to do so .
A legacy mainframe shop must either deal with IBM , or else spend immense sums and large amounts of time trying to completely reinvent its computing infrastructure .
That 's the classic definition of a monopoly .
IBM gets the benefit of the doubt from the Open Source world because of its history of supporting Open Source projects and funding the FSF ( to the tune of about 4 million bucks a year ) .
I 've got no problem with that , and think they do deserve quite a lot of appreciation for it .
However , the old saying goes , " One awcrap wipes out a thousand attaboys . "
A true friend of the open source community would n't be waving the patent hammer at a member of it .
The facts as they stand now show that IBM is a friend of open source only so long as it does n't have to compete with it .

now am i to understand it then shoudl IBM violate the gpl in any fashiona nd get
sued they would sue YOU back and use patents they hold pledged not to sue linux
with ?
thats the very trojan horse that gplv3 is suppoosed to protect you form and IBM
could be looking if that were the case at some real bad times
if all i did was make the software and you hold patents what if you lose gpl
ability and get sued by well everyone n the community
YEA think about that scene

The choice of the QPL can be understood if you look at what the original " Hercules Public License " wanted .
HPL ( original license ) 18 .
You may submit modifications to the maintainer for inclusion in the software .
By submitting a modification you grant both the developer and the maintainer a perpetual royalty - free right to include the modification in future versions of the software and the right to distribute such modified versions to anyone under the terms of this agreement and any under other agreement at the discretion of the developer without payment of any fee to you .
... QPL ( current license ) 3 b .
When modifications to the Software are released under this license , a non-exclusive royalty - free right is granted to the initial developer of the Software to distribute your modification in future versions of the Software provided such versions remain available under these terms in addition to any other license (s ) of the initial developer .
The original license allowed the originators ( and no one else ) of Hercules to dual license the software , including contributions by others .
The QPL appears to allow the same ( at least that is how it appears to me ) .
This differs from the GPL in that it puts the project initiators in a more privileged position than any later contributors .
That is , the originators can accept outside contributions while still dual licensing the code , but no one else can .
Since the original authors included this clause in their original custom license , it seems to be an important point for them .
It is quite possible that someone had the idea fairly early in the project that it could be commercialised using the dual licensing model .

I do n't understand your " fundamental objection " since the GPL is a license that lets you use some other programmer 's work provided only that you grant the same license to any work you produce that includes the other programmer 's work .
As far as I can see , that is telling you that , " If you want to distribute my work with your own work , you have to grant the same rights I 've granted to you to those other programmers . "
How do you arrive at your " fundamental objection " which , as you stated it , is that the GPL restricts what you can do with your own code , when ( in my opinion , at least ) all the GPL does is constrain you if you distribute some other programmer 's code with your own code .

There 's been a lot of speculation here that the antitrust action by
TurboHercules is somehow a stealth Microsoft ploy aimed at injuring IBM , and we
therefore should take IBM 's side in this .
I say Microsoft 's participation , if any , is irrelevant .
In fact , if Microsoft
is funding the punishment of a patent aggressor , I 'm actually prepared to cheer
them on .
This once .
The antitrust angle is a distraction .
Microsoft is a distraction .

Of course it is legal for IBM to point to it 's patents .
I do n't think it is the smartest thing they have done this
week marketing - wise .
It would be smarter to sell mini-licenses to run their OS and apps on the
emulator , then show how Big Iron does a much better job in production
situations .
They might actually get some new customers to their Big Iron that way .
But I do n't wear a blue suit so they are unlikely to ask for my advice .

I just realized from the wording in IBM 's letter your product emulates significant portions of IBM 's proprietary instruction set architecture and IBM has many patents that would , therefore , be infringed .
For illustration , I enclose with this letter a non-exhaustive list of IBM U.S. patents that protect innovative elements of IBM 's mainframe architecture and that IBM believes will be infringed by an emulator covering those elements
It is n't necessarily the case that all the patents that IBM is referring to are what one would call software patents .
It sounds like it could include patents on elements of a machine architecture .
It does bring up the interesting question as to what it means for pure software to infringe on a hardware patent , but I see that as a much more tractable issue than the thorny one of patents on software .
If someone gets a patent on a process for producing some new chemical and someone writes a control program for a flexible chemical processing machine that allows it to use that process to make that chemical , does the program infringe ?
Or does selling it induce the buyer to infringe ?
I do n't have any legal knowledge and do n't even know if those questions make sense given patent law , but I do wonder if the laws would apply that way to such software .
So , aside from the question as to whether IBM is actually threatening to use patents against a FOSS project ( with all due deference to Jay Maynard 's feeling threatened by the letter , I just do n't read the citing of patents as anything more than supporting reasons for IBM 's refusal to change their license ) , for those who do read the letter as a threat , does it make a difference that the patents involved may not even all be software patents ?

" Does IBM 's correspondence constitute a position contrary to it 's pledge
not to prosecute infringement , by FOSS developers , of any of it's 500
patents . "
IMO is the wrong question .
Let me see how this question works ...
" Is this publicity campaign designed
to fracture the open source community into oppositely polarized camps :
On the
one hand , those that support IBM , and their efforts to ' defend themselves ' and
their technology .
On the other , those that feel Big Blue should roll over and
let a relatively small ' upstart ' ( My own term ... ) profit immensely from it's
heavy investment , while at the same time taking business away , with even the
possibility of completely replacing the mainframe with a cloud architecture that
runs Linux and emulates big iron well enough that migration could be a matter of
throwing one switch , then the next ?
To me it 's just funny , that for almost 10 years , IIRC , this emulator 's been in
the works , and only now , the whole shebang blows up , with one side defending
it 's self , trying to smooth ruffled feathers in the Open Source community .
And
the other side , making every effort to besmirch a company 's name , and even
attacking it legally .
Wierd .
IMO , They spent their billions upon billions of dollars building hardware and
software and growing their business .
Compete with them on the merits of ' Your
products v.s. theirs ' rather than force the issue of competing in a ' Their
products v.s their products ' world
Just my opinion .

Certainly in legal terms it is n't .
But you have to have a particularly naive Boy Scout view of IBM to take it as anything but .
Roger Bowler is a very brave ( or very foolhardy ) man , and my guess is that his company and probably he personally will be squished like a bug by IBM unless he folds quickly and quietly .
Read the doc in the current Neon suit ( PDF ) , and look at what IBM did to Jim Stracka , the guy who had the nerve to develop software to make IBM customers purchased AS / 400 machines run at their actual rated speed .
They convinced the FBI to arrest him on a criminal charge of extortion , which was soon dropped , but must have had a sobering effect on him .
( Neon is n't making this up , by the way , it 's all over the net from way before the Neon case . )
In the TurboHercules case , IBM does n't really have the easy option of buying them out as they did with PSI and Stracka ( no settlement details available , of course , we 're all friends now , moving forward , etc. ) , and will probably do with Neon , because as Maynard says , TH does n't have an independent software product , they are just offering support of the open source Hercules .
You know , the Red Hat business model that we all admire .
So my guess is that IBM will make an example of this little upstart just to make it clear to any others who have n't been paying attention what they face if they threaten IBM profits .
All the while supporting and defending open source , of course .

TurboHercules SAS is a distributor of the open - source Hercules emulator .
Hercules performs equally well under either Linux of Windows , in repeated testing .
Personally , I would have used Linux as a base , but I 'm not the one calling those shots or even influencing them .
Just because the TurboHercules SAS turnkey system is n't entirely open - source does n't mean they 're not an open source company .
They 're not simon - pure on open source doctrine , but the core of their product is the open source Hercules emulator .
That 's enough to qualify them as a distributor of open source software , and thus covered by the patent pledge .

After reading the quote in the article 's Update 7 .
it becomes really clear that
IBM 's response is something equivalent to this :
You express astonishment that we have IP rights when we have let Hercules alone
for 10 years .
Here is a list of patents that we could use against anyone who
tries to copy our architecture .
We have n't used them against Hercules for 10
years by our choice .
We do n't need to , we have our license .
We want to keep
things just the way they have been and we are n't changing our license .
That is not a threat .
That is telling them that the license and the patents are
enough to protect IBM 's interests against potential competitors , and that IBM
intends to keep the status quo , which the past 10 years has shown to include not
suing over Hercules ' infringement of any patents .

This is nonsense .
IBM provided a list of 106 patents that it believes they
infringe .
OK , congratulations TurboHurcules , you can knock 2 off the list due
to the patent pledge .
You still infringe 104 other IBM patents .
TurboHurcules are just doing PR , to try to get people on their side .
As for " oh IBM is threatening us with patents " ... well duh .
If you
get into a legal argument with IBM , they will pull out a pile of patents you
infringe .
( E.g. they found 6 that SCO infringe ) .
That 's just how legal warfare
works .
If you pull the tiger 's tail without a plan to deal with his teeth ,
that 's your problem .
And IBM have a lot of patents , so you probably infringe
something .
You can also see the big company approach to patents here - sure some may not be
very good quality , but IBM have over a hundred relevant patents and they only
need one to stick .

http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/
Sheepshaver is a PowerPC hardware emulator .
It has gained recent
popularity because it allows emulation of the Classic MacOS on
modern intel chipped machines .
To do so you need a copy of
the Classic MacOS , and a ROM image from a suitable older Macintosh .
You may legally " own " a copy of the older OS , but are you legally
entitled to run it on hardware which is plainly incapable ?
Also possession of a ROM image almost certainly violates some license .
Apple is not chasing Sheepshaver users for the same reason it is
not chasing Hackintoshers .
It 's a hobby activity , if people want all
that trouble for an experience less than the real thing , that 's their problem .
Sheepshaver might also be useful for running other ppc OS ( think IBM )
IBM has not worried about the Hercules project in the past because :
it 's open source , IBM supports open source ( and hobbyists ) ;
it 's being used out back , in workshops and test areas ;
nobody is making money off of it .
Until TurboHercules asked " Please Sir , can we help each other with
this ? "
Maybe TH did n't phrase the question right , but IBM 's response was
the reflex of big business to an unknown startup , similar in tone
to Apple 's response to Psystar , " Go away jerk , our lawyers are bigger
than yours . "

Here we have IBM saying that hardware patents may be applicable to software that
emulates the patents .
Under current law , I can't say that they 're wrong ( but
IANAL ) .
Now suppose that the Supreme Court decides Bilski in a way that throws out
software patents .
And suppose that there are hardware patents that could be
implemented in software .
Does that mean that those patents are also invalid ?
Or does it mean that they are only valid on hardware ?

Not of a lawsuit , but
enough that I would think they should be able to claim reasonable apprehension

If we 're talking about true Free software , why is the Turbo Hurcules company
supplying a system specifically optimized for the uncrippled version of
Microsoft 's toy operating system software - MS WindowsNT 6.1 ( aka MS Windows
" Server 2008 Enterprise Edition " ) ?
If they want reliability then they'd be using Linux or Solaris or AIX .
But , even better , why would you want to emulate a mainframe merely so that you
could run GPL 'd linux guests ?
Why not simply use the GPL'd Zen and host all the
linux guests using GPL 'd software ?
Personally , I 'm inclined to the view that if there was such a disaster that
would pull down an entire mainframe to such an extent that true " disaster
recovery " would be required ( rather than merely failover to a standby
system ) then surely that disaster would be massive and the business would be
unlikely to benefit from the use of a small emulation of a massive mainframe .
So , I see many issues with Turbo - Hercules ' " product " .

Here 's why IBM may view TurboHercules as not covered by its patent pledge .
Hercules is an open source product , but TurboHercules is a business on top of that product , but not exclusively that product .
...
So the base operating system is Windows .
So , you tell me .
Is TurboHercules an " Open Source company " ?
Excuse me , PJ , but I think you should think about this .
I do not know what the patent pledge exactly covered , but if it would n't allow to build a business " on top of " a covered product , then what would it be worth ?
To Red Hat , and Novell , who obviously build a business " on top of " Linux , obviously nothing .
There are more examples : MySQL exists as a commercial product with an open source core , same for Zimbra , and lots of other solutions .
Why should n't these be protected by IBM 's patent promises ?
Or to rephrase the question , what would the promises be worth to the companies actively developing these open source core products ?
And what 's so ugly with developing an open source product running on Windows ?
I agree , that some reactions with regard to IBM 's actions are perhaps exaggerated , but I also miss a clear statement by IBM , which states that the patent promises are applicable to OpenHercules ( AFAIK , its license would qualify ) .

it strikes me as almost identical .
IBM may not hold all the copyrights or patents ,
there may be deep legal reasons .
to me it seems akin to the OS / 2 situation .
OS / 2 has n't been supported by IBM in far longer than this .
but IBM can't simply open it up , even if they wanted to .
you can't just " Steal " software because it has n't been supported for
years .

P.S. Others above have already pointed out that there is nothing in IBM 's pledge
which says that the pledge is revoked when IBM is attacked ; also noting that the

premature , to claim that IBM has violated it 's pledge .

I wonder how this is supposed to work .
There 's a little more to disaster
recovery than being able to run an operating system and applications .
There 's
the small matter of data , and that is n't going to be accessible to , or loadable
on , one of these HP - based systems in any useful timeframe .
I think suggesting use of Turbohercules for disaster recovery is something they
know perfectly well is impractical , which raises the question of why suggest it
at all ?
My guess is that it is to confuse the ill - informed .
Implicit in the use of a system for disaster recovery is the idea is that it
is n't actually depriving anyone of licensing fees - these are often waived or
minimal on standby systems , until they are actually put into service .
So , anyone
reading that Turbohercules should be used for disaster recovery might well
think , well , what 's all the fuss about , it is n't as if it is taking a
significant revenue stream from IBM ?
Of course , Microsoft will get the full
whack for their W2K8 Enterprise software , which does n't come cheap - that
software is n't on standby , its sole purpose here is to run Turbohercules .
It deflects from the real issue : that this is an attempt to subvert a legitimate
license for z /OS , and the chief beneficiary of this is n't Turbohercules , it is
Microsoft and HP . [ Reply to This | # ]

I have designed and built a system that uses off the shelf hardware , and runs a
mainframe system .
I , however , have not created the emulation software piece .
The
system i designed and built was for the Unisys mainframe OS .
They had created a
version of software that emulated their high level interface ( Mapper ) .
I
designed pieces to communicate with that and built programs to pretend to be the
mainframe core .
We then , designed specific hardware to run this .
It runs on
Windows .
I 've never seen any of the underlying code of the Unisys core system .
I merely
treated it as a black box .
Now writing an emulator for the high level interface ,
would have been a huge task .
We did n't have the manpower for something like
that .
Our solution was faster than the mainframe by in some cases several orders
of magnitude .
One critical task for a client that took 2.5 days to run , would
complete on our system in 3 hours .
I can't speak to what Hercules has written , but what my team and I wrote should
not have been considered infringing any patents .
This is why software patents
are such a bad idea .
To think that my software could infringe a patent when all
I did was design a connectivity program from a black box is ludicrous .
I had a
problem to solve and followed GAPP ( generally accepted programming practices ) to
achieve that .
There was no flash of brilliance .
Although , there were some rather
bright individuals on my team .
It was not anything that skillful , experienced , intelligent coders could not
have done .
It 's no different than say someone building a sophisticated , perhaps
novel , machine out of blackboxes and someone else coming along and building
replacement parts for some or all of the machine .
Obviously , that is n't a totally accurate analogy , because there really are n't
any truly novel programming bits .
Now a new and novel programming language , that
* might * actually be a patentable thing , but not the software .
I could see the
patentability of a completely unthought of and efficient language being so
unique that it would give any user of the language a huge leap over current
coding .
I have n't seen it yet ( alhtough PHP and Ruby do come to mind ) .
Software
however is a completely different ballgame .
Also , the fact that our solution ran considerably faster goes to prove that our
code was better than the original code .
Or at least leaner .
The customer wound
up saving millions in hardware and licensing fees .
Unisys loved our system so much they had us present it at one of their shows .
Hercules , though , seems somewhat less than honest about all this .
We worked with
Unisys in our product development .
We were a client and a competitor .
I no
longer work for that company .

" TurboHercules SAS 's request was for IBM to allow its customers to use the
Hercules platform as well as a real IBM mainframe computer system . "
Why would TH think that IBM would agree to this ?
This seems to make no business sense for IBM .
Or was it to create a record of refusal , for later use against IBM ... and also
create a record stating that TH didnt know of any potentially infringing
patents ?
If so TH couldnt have expected any other response , surly ?
That is , they asked
IBM to state which patents infringed .

The first article I happened to read about this was the eweek article here .
Seems the article uses both Mueller and Miguel de Icaza as the open source advocates on the issue .
At that point , the old spidey sense started tingling and there must naturally be more to this .
Of course , 2 - 3 days later ... there is .

Emulators are layers on top of a base .
Layers transmogrify the behaviour of the
base , to something else .
In this case , Microsoft is apparently a base and
TurboHercules is a layer .
Funnily enough the dirt from the base does shine
through and there is little new behavior .
Normally the layer should protect the
base behavior .
Yet , from what I can tell , TurboHercules is a very poorly
executed excuse for a layer .
The layer lawyers better lay off , before the lay
community lay them off .
Basically , history may repeat itself , once again .

Well , even if you have doubts about what IBM is doing here , at least IBM is
willing to specify its patents .
Unlike Microsoft .

The letter with the list of patents was dated March 11 , but was not actually received by TurboHercules SAS until March 25 , according to the entry for that letter on the web page listing them .

IBM have my confidence .
IBM have my Business .
IBM and I do a lot of FOSS .
FOSS is my employers business , hence mine .
They , like IBM , do very well out of supplying , supporting and other - wise , all
things FOSS .
FOSS , as in the GPL version .
Yes , they ( My Employer ) charge money for it .
Lots of it .
Yes , they pay my wages with it .
Yes , the customers I deal with are happy to deal with my Employer , as well as
me .
Yes , we will supply IBM hardware to an IBM shop .
Yes , we will supply IBM hardware to a new customer that has any doubt about
brand .
Yes , we will supply Intel / Tyan / AMD / Sun based hardware to any customer that
wants something else , or else , insists on it .
FOSS , Rules !
For a fee , mate !
So , am I rather suspicious if any one wants to attack my bread and butter .
Yes , mate !
So , am I rather suspicious if any one attacks FOSS , in whatever form ?
Yes , mate !

One thing is for sure , TH has been reading SCO / McBrides playbook .
Just like
McBride running around the country making unfounded accusations and at the
minimum twisting the truth , TH could not have picked up a better playbook .

Yet prior to this statement by PJ , Jmaynard had already stated on here , and PJ
had responded to , that although the later is dated the 11th , he did n;t receive
it until the day AFTER he filed the complaint with the EU commission .
So , now I am confused ...
What I see he is PJ apparently disregarding statements posted in good faith by
the prime source .
I had always thought the policy on here was to accept statements made in good
faith , unless there was good reason to beleive then to be false , no one has
offered any evidence that the statement made by jmaynard is false , so I have to
assume that PJ has chnaged her policy , or is delberatly showing bias towards IBM
for some unspecified reason .
To me , it looks like a clear case of a large corporation trying to squish and
open source project that threatens their revenue .
What i cant understand is why
PJ has suddenly taken the " Patents are gooood , opensource is bad "
stance ...
most confusing .

And TurboHercules the new SCO ?
MicroSoft funds FUD at Foss 's expense .
Just think you can NOW have a blue screen of death on IBM mainframe programs
courtesy of Microsoft .
Do you wish to restart your Mainframe computer emulator as the OS has died from

Dear Microsoft ,
you have a 100 % monopoly on Windows branded operating systems .
My company has
developed an open source x86 emulator for another platform and we demand that
you license Windows ( TM ) to run on our emulator .
Failure to do so will result in
a monopoly abuse claim to the European Union .
We expect you to provide enterprise levels of support for our customers ( 24x7 ,
with on - site support from trained engineers when required ) , and to test your
software on our emulator .
You will have to fix any problems that are found in
your software that are caused by timing differences , physical hardware
differences , etc. when running on our emulator .
If you find any bugs in our
emulator we will of course fix them , but you 'll have to tell us what they are
first .
If we violated any patents whilst creating our emulator we expect them to
be ignored .
We look forward to hearing from you soon .
P.S. We are aware that other operating systems are available for the x86
platform ( i.e. Linux ) , but we do n't care .
We want to host Windows applications
through our emulator .

We 're getting buried under comments here , but there 's one thing that has changed which I really dislike and the only time I mentioned it was deep in a huge thread .
Update : The Register 's Timothy Prickett Morgan picked up on the story behind this story last fall : TurboHercules is co-headquartered in Paris , France , where Bowler moved after he left the United Kingdom , and in Seattle , Washington , in close proximity to the one big software company that has in the past taken a shining to anything that gave Big Blue some grief , particularly with mainframes .
( Yes , we mean Microsoft ) .
Why are we citing THAT as proof ?
The Register is more sensational a publication than most and you 're republishing it as an accusation .
I 'm going to have to quote your own words on that specific argument .
I 'm quoting you from a ZDNet article here :
Th ey have also been telling journalists that I live near IBM headquarters .
That 's it .
That is IBM's " sponsorship " .
Wink , wink .
Get it ?
You knew that was a weak claim then , why did you trumpet it in its own update now , about someone else ?
Besides , people can conspire over the internet , you know , without being physical neighbors .
No PIPE fairy or other such mystery funding has appeared , either , right ?
What did you say to rebut the absurd charges that you were part of a pro-IBM conspiracy again ?
In the same ZDNet article you wrote : They [ IBM ] have n't given me any financial support of any kind .
Not a dime .
Not a promise .
Not a grant .
Not a PIPE deal .
Not an envelope of money under the table from a cousin .
Not a Thinkpad .
Nothing .
We have the same case here , do we not ?
Can you prove otherwise ?
Please tell me that them selling computers that run Windows ( and being BSD heathens ) is n't the link , or I 'll quote even more of that article about how IBM gave iBiblio some servers once .
There 's no proof that anyone is in this alleged conspiracy , PJ , except for Microsoft and SCO and co. , where we have links upon links showing dirty deals .
I find this illustrative because you were then defending yourself from the same type of charges ( membership in a conspiracy ) that you now level against TH ( the " shades of Psystar " accusation ) .
I do not , nor have I ever believed that you are part of some IBM conspiracy , PJ , and I have defended you against those who claim otherwise .
But I 'm not going to assume that anyone is Microsoft - backed ( not even Psystar ) unless someone can meet the same level of proof we required last time .
I just hope that people do n't think that holding you to your own words makes me a bad person .

Whether or not the emulator guys received the letter detailing the patents
before or after the press release is almost immaterial .
And whether the letters sent by IBM are * actual * threats or not is certainly a
matter of perspective .
If I spent 10 years of my life coding on something , and
big MegaCorp sent me a letter ( whether somehow invited by me or not ) that
explained that they thought my decade 's worth of activities infringed hundreds
of their patents , I would probably perceive that as a threat , or at least a
warning .
What noun would you use ?
But back to the issue of identifying property :
If somebody told me I might be
infringing 200 of their patents , and I looked through the first few , and found
no relevance and no possible infringement , it would be my personal position that
they had n't specified any IP I was infringing , and that their whole purpose in
giving the list was to bury me in paperwork .
I 'm sorry , but " here 's a haystack .
There 's a needle in it somewhere that
you 're using that 's ours " sounds an awful like SCO 's behavior to me .
The community 's response to the SCO accusations of infringement included
statements to the effect that Linux is developed in the open ; all the code ,
including the history of the code , is available for your perusal .
That response is also valid here .
After all , this is an instruction set
emulator , which , in the grand scheme of things , can't be all that big .
It 's
been developed in the open for 10 years , the code is certainly available for
IBM 's perusal , and if they really think there is some sort of patent
infringement , they are perfectly capable of rooting through the emulator code
and match a few functions up to a few patents .
Just like the FOSS community , IBM is not a monolithic entity .
There are a lot
of groups , a lot of individuals , and a lot of ( sometimes conflicting ) goals .
As
ESR points out ( http://esr.ibiblio.org/) somebody higher up at IBM is going to
have to make a decision about where IBM as a company stands on the issue of open
source .
Maybe it 's not black and white .
Maybe it 's more nuanced than that .
Whatever their final decision , it would be appreciated if they could spell it
out in detail as best they can ; otherwise they are the ones who risk being
lumped in with the guys from Redmond as an entity that uses fear to try to
control behavior that they cannot otherwise directly influence .

Update 9 : And now that we have all the letters , please notice that the company 's press release conflicts with the record of what happened .
Here 's what TurboHercules told the world :
Not only did IBM deny our request , but it now suddenly claims , after ten years , that the Hercules open - source emulator violates IBM intellectual property that it has refused to identify .
Look at the date of that press release .
They filed with the EU Commission on the date of the press release , March 23 .
Now look at the date of the list of patents that TH specifically asked for and IBM sent them .
March 11 .
So is it true that IBM refused to identify the intellectual property that it believes would be violated ?
Mr Bowler 's quote in the press release never claimed that IBM refused to identify their intellectual property .
This fact would be readily obvious if the preceding sentence of the press release had n't been omitted from the update and the claim provided in its context :
" We originally wrote to IBM requesting that it license its mainframe operating system to customers , on reasonable and fair terms , for use with Hercules in certain circumstances .
Not only did IBM deny our request , ... " [ Reply to This | # ]

First Look : H.264 and VP8 Compared
[ In response to reader questions and comments , this article was updated at 6:20 a.m. on Monday , May 24 .
See author 's comments at the end of the article . —
Ed ]
VP8 is now free , but if the quality is substandard , who cares ?
Well , it turns out that the quality is n't substandard , so that 's not an issue , but neither is it twice the quality of H.264 at half the bandwidth .
See for yourself , below .
To set the table , Sorenson Media was kind enough to encode these comparison files for me to both H.264 and VP8 using their Squish encoding tool .
They encoded a standard SD encoding test file that I 've been using for years .
I 'll do more testing once I have access to a VP8 encoder , but wanted to share these quick and dirty results .
Here are the specs ; VP8 on the left , H.264 on the right :
You can download and play the files themselves , though you 'll need to download a browser from http://www.webmproject.org/users/ to play the webm file .
Click here to download the H.264 file , and here for the VP8 file .
What about frame comparisons ?
Here you go ; you can click on each to see a larger version that reveals more detail .
Low motion videos like talking heads are easy to compress , so you 'll see no real difference .
In another low motion video with a terrible background for encoding ( finely detailed wallpaper ) , the VP8 video retains much more detail than H.264 .
Interesting result .
Moving to a higher motion video , VP8 holds up fairly well in this martial arts video .
In higher motion videos , though , H.264 seems superior .
In this pita video , blocks are visible in the pita where the H.264 video is smooth .
The pin-striped shirt in the right background is also sharper in the H.264 video , as is the striped shirt on the left .
In this very high motion skateboard video , H.264 also looks clearer , particularly in the highlighted areas in the fence , where the VP8 video looks slightly artifacted .
In the final comparison , I 'd give a slight edge to VP8 , which was clearer and showed fewer artifacts .
What 's this add up to ?
I 'd say H.264 still offers better quality , but the difference would n't be noticeable in most applications .
Update
We 've received some comments about the comparisons , and I wanted to address them en masse .
In my haste to post the article , I did n't use the exact same frames in the comparison images .
Though the frames I used accurately showed comparative quality , we 've updated the images to include the same frames — a better presentation with the same conclusion .
In defense of this quick and dirty analysis , we did include links to the encoded source files with the original article , so anyone wishing to dig a bit deeper could certainly have done so and still can ( H.264 here ; VP8 here ) .
Still , we should have updated to the identical frames sooner .
Some readers have questioned why we used the baseline H.264 profile and the MainConcept codec instead of x264 for our H.264 encoding .
As stated in the article , the VP8 and H.264 files were encoded by Sorenson Media using its Squish tool , since Sorenson had been apparently been working with Google for some time to get the tool up and running , and could produce the VP8 and H.264 encoded files soon after Google made the WebM announcement .
Lots of websites use Squish , and even more use Squeeze ; I was comfortable that their encoding of both formats would be representative of true quality .
We used non-configurable Squish presets in the interest of time , so could n't change the profile from baseline to main , and obviously could n't substitute x264 for the MainConcept codec that Sorenson deploys .
In my tests , MainConcept has been a consistent leader in H.264 quality , and is certainly a very solid choice for any commercial encoding tool .
We have an x264 evaluation on the editorial calendar — I know it 's quite good , and I look forward to seeing how it stacks up with others in terms of quality and downstream compatibility .
I did n't ask Sorenson how long it took to encode the files , but Google 's FAQ does indicate that encoding can be quite slow at the highest quality configurations , though they 're working to optimize that .
As I said in the article , " I 'll do more testing once I have access to a VP8 encoder , but wanted to share these quick and dirty results . "
So , hang on for a few weeks , and I 'll try to get the next comparison right the first time .
Some other questions :
>> hmmm , do you think VP8 is trying to determine who the primary subject is , and then focusing on providing that region more detail ?
or it 's redistributing the bits in a different way ?
maybe if you took a look at each frame , and see how much data is being given to each frame
I 'm not aware of a tool that provides this information - if you know of one , please let me know .
>> I think it 's a bit misleading to point out background flaws in h264 when the overall quality is higher .
The overall quality of that frame did not appear higher .
I look at standard frames each time I compared encoding tools or codecs , I was simply passing along my observation .
Not sure how that can be misleading .
>> only 24 - bit PNG files are acceptable for frame comparisons
I 've never seen a case where high quality JPEGs were not visually indistinguishable from PNGs , and they slow web page load times immensely , especially for mobile viewers .
I 'm open to reconsider this approach , though ; if you want to take PNG frame grabs from the files , compare them to the JPEGs , and show that there 's a difference , I 'll post the PNGS .
>>
The VP8 video is put in a WebM ( which is just MKV ) container and the H.264 video is put in a mp4 container .
Not a big deal , but in a video codec comparison , it only makes sense to keep everything else constant .
MKV is able to handle both formats , so why the difference ?
This is pretty much irrelevant , and you could equally make the case that it 's more accurate to display the H.264 file the way most viewers would actually watch them , which is to say , as H.264 .
>>
Why is the audio even included ?
Furthermore , why is the audio encoded differently ?
The fact that the two files had similar filesizes means nothing when you attach different audio streams .
Audio is included because I like to check synchronization at the end , and folks seem to prefer watching video with audio .
You 've no doubt noted that I made no audio related conclusions .
Both audio streams are 64 Kbps as reported by MediaInfo , so should't impact the data rate of the video file , or overall file size .
This is also what Sorenson reported ; if you have other information about the respective file size , please let me know .
The fact that one file is mono and the other stereo is irrelevant , particularly given the lack of audio - related conclusions and the fact ( as far as I can tell ) that the audio configuration had the same bit rate .
>> Finally , take a look at http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377
Very useful analysis , though I 'm glad I focused on a more streaming - oriented configuration .
While I was n't aware of it when I wrote this article , Dan Rayburn let me know about it later that day and I blogged about it ( and quoted it extensively ) here later that day .
Sorry for any confusion , I 'll try to do better next time .

Summertime is around the corner , and many of the city 's vegetarians are gearing up for their rooftop BBQs with their soy burgers and tofu dogs , resting peacefully with the fact that no animals had to die so they could eat .
But were other humans harmed in awful factory conditions that exposed them to deadly chemicals ?
Probably .
A new study shows that a number of popular soy products contain trace amounts of hexane , which listed as a " hazardous air pollutant " by the EPA and is known to cause nervous system failure and skin disorders in humans .
It 's unclear how much hexane you need to eat before getting side effects , but do you feel lucky , veggie ?
The 37 - page report [ PDF ] says that though the use of hexane is prohibited in " organic " food processing , it 's widely used in the " natural " soy industry , and even by some companies that use the wording " made with organic ingredients . "
Mother Jones reports that since many fake meat producers aim to have as little fat as possible in their products , they will soak soybeans in a hexane bath to separate the oil from the protein .
One researcher said , " If a non-organic product contains a soy protein isolate , soy protein concentrate , or texturized vegetable protein , you can be pretty sure it was made using soy beans that were made with hexane . "
So what brands out there contain the hazardous chemical ?
Sadly , most of the good ones .
Here 's a little list :
Amy 's Kitchen
Boca Burger , conventional
Franklin Farms
Garden Burger
It ’s All Good Lightlife
Morningstar Farms
President ’s Choice
Taste Above
Trader Joe's
Yves Veggie Cuisine
Below , the safe brands :
Hexane - free brands :
Boca Burgers
" Made with organic soy "
Helen 's Kitchen
Morningstar " Made with organic "
Superburgers by Turtle Island
Tofurky
Wildwood
The verdict is out on Whole Foods brands and Silk soymilk , as they did not participate in the project , but the Village Voice has the whole toxic list here .
The worst part may be that many popular baby formulas also contain hexane !
The report states , " Nearly every major ingredient in conventional soy - based infant formula is hexane extracted . "

- The Editor
Last August , in the midst of interviewing Rush Limbaugh , I had what I thought was a constructive idea .
The public is politically polarized .
Limbaugh is the most influential , and often the most abrasive , voice on the right .
So I suggested that Limbaugh strike a blow for civility by playing a round of golf with President Obama .
“ When the president of the United States invites you , you go , ” Limbaugh growled .
But he was highly dubious that any such invitation would be forthcoming .
“ Obama ’s base would never let him get away with it , ” he predicted .
I was n’t so sure .
I had served on Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin ’s staff in 1977 when Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made his amazingly improbable trip to Jerusalem .
Sure , an Obama - Limbaugh golf date is a long shot .
Rush mocks and criticizes the president and his agenda five days a week , three hours a day , often in highly charged language .
On the other side , Obama has denounced Limbaugh as an extremist and publicly called on Republicans to ignore him .
At the 2009 White House Correspondents Dinner , the president sat on the dais , laughing , as comedian Wanda Sykes joked that she ’d like to see Limbaugh die from kidney failure .
So there is no love lost .
But Obama is well known for his belief in the power of reaching out to foes .
If he can extend a hand to America - haters like President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran , why not a rapprochement with El Rushbo of Palm Beach ?
The following day I tried to broach the idea to presidential advisor David Axelrod , whom I know slightly from his newspaper days in Chicago .
He did n’t get back to me .
It seemed safe to say that the president was n’t teeing up .
Almost a year has passed , and the political debate has grown even more angry and contentious .
Rahm Emanuel , Robert Gibbs and other high - ranking White House spokesmen have repeatedly charged — with more than a little justice — that Limbaugh is the de facto head of the conservative opposition .
That , however , is a reason to talk to him .
As this administration has argued in other contexts , peace is made with one ’s enemies , not friends .
And where better than a golf course ?
Eighteen holes ( on a course emptied especially for the president ) would take about four hours .
That ’s long enough for these two men — who seem alien , even exotic to each other — to get better acquainted .
In the course of an afternoon , Limbaugh would , I predict , recognize that Barack Hussein Obama is not a foreign radical who hates America for its historical sins ; and Obama would see that Limbaugh is a Reagan conservative , not the reincarnation of the racist radio preacher of the 1930s , Father Charles Coughlin .
The ground rules would be simple .
Choosing the course would be a presidential prerogative .
I suggest Obama allow Limbaugh to bring the refreshments and cigars .
Neither man is an especially good golfer , but they are both highly competitive , and for the sake of amity it probably would be best to allow unlimited mulligans and dispense with a scorecard ( do n’t worry ; they ’d both keep score in their heads anyway ) .
The Obama - Limbaugh golf summit would be announced to the public but kept private and off the record .
Mutual friends ( yes , they have a couple ) would join them as part of an icebreaking foursome and then peel off along the way to give them a chance to talk alone .
What would they talk about ?
Another simple rule :
No politics .
Obama and Limbaugh are never going to change each other ’s minds on the big issues of the day ( although they are closer on a few matters than you might imagine ; both are hawks on Afghanistan , both support gay civil unions ) .
Instead of arguing , they could use the time to discuss what they have in common .
They are avid sports fans , for example .
They each vacation in Hawaii .
They have great cars and huge airplanes to compare and contrast .
They might even get around to discussing their fathers , exceptional men who loomed large for their sons and whose difficult legacies followed their boys into maturity .
Obama is said to be a great listener , and I can attest from personal experience that Rush is too .
They wo n’t run out of conversation .
This scenario ends with no joint communique , just a photo of the two of them together .
It would n’t announce the start of a beautiful friendship or even a ceasefire .
But it could signify to millions of overwrought citizens that Obama and Limbaugh , for all their disputes and differences , can still see each other as fellow Americans capable of sharing a beer and a laugh on a sunny day .
And in times like this , that ’s a message worth sending .
Zev Chafets is the author of a newly released book , “ Rush Limbaugh : An Army of One . ”

Brunch , the signature meal of a relaxed day , combines the best of breakfast and lunch .
In some American homes there are breakfast sausages and quite a few other preserved meat items at brunch .
For me , growing up in a strictly kosher home , these foods never became favorites for the first meal of a leisurely day .
I love brunch on the dairy side , with the emphasis on egg dishes , kugels and blintzes .
To balance the brunch menu and add fresh flavors and colors , I include vegetables , and not just as salads or as the usual steamed and boiled veggies .
Instead , I like them baked with other savory ingredients in casseroles .
I got a lot of appetizing ideas for brunch dishes from the members of the Merage Jewish Community Center of Orange County , California , who put together their favorite recipes in theand gave me a copy after I gave a talk on healthy Jewish cooking at the center .
Their book includes all sorts of creative dishes of vegetables baked with eggs and often with cheese .
Some are labeled pies or quiches but they do n’t have crusts ; some are frittatas that include bread cubes or bread crumbs , although classic frittatas do not .
One is simply named zucchini appetizer .
You could easily categorize all these dishes as kugels , casseroles or pashtidot .
I call them veggie bakes .
They are a great way to make vegetables delicious .
The technique is simple – I call it the kugel principle :
Mix the main element , in this case vegetables , with eggs and flavorings .
In many cases , you also need a “ starchy ” ingredient such as bread crumbs or flour to hold the mixture together and make it more substantial , thus facilitating neat slicing .
Best of all for the busy cook , these dishes are practically effortless .
There ’s no layering of ingredients lasagna style , and a minimum of precooking .
Many are simply a matter of mixing the ingredients and baking them .
For example , in Sharon Weidberg ’s zucchini pie , thinly sliced zucchini are mixed with a batter of beaten eggs , biscuit mix ( a blend of flour , baking powder and shortening ) and oil .
The flavorings are Parmesan cheese , chopped onion , parsley , salt , pepper and marjoram .
My zucchini kugel ( see the recipe below ) has bread crumbs rather than biscuit mix , and no cheese , but the technique is essentially the same .
For her spinach brunch pie , Betty Gorelick combines frozen chopped spinach with biscuit mix , eggs , cottage cheese , sour cream , melted butter and grated Parmesan cheese .
Elana Samson ’s corn quiche is made of canned corn mixed with a batter of eggs beaten with flour , evaporated milk , sugar and salt and enriched with butter .
Jane Brenner ’s mushroom frittata calls for sauteing mushrooms with zucchini , peppers , onion and garlic , and blending them into a batter of eggs , cream , cheddar cheese and bread cubes and baking it in a rectangular pan .
You can adapt this method to any vegetable you like .
Saute tender vegetables or grate them and add them raw or , to save time , use canned or frozen ones .
Make your veggie bake as creamy or cheesy as you wish , or keep it parve , with no cheese at all , and increase the savory seasonings .
You can even omit the eggs to make dishes like the speedy corn casserole below ; simply serve such dishes with a spoon instead of cutting them in squares .

The New Casserole .
A quite disgustingly creative young man put two fingers down his throat and deliberately vomited over an off - duty cop and his children at a baseball game , following a confrontation .
This did not pan out so well .
Matthew Clemmens , 21 , was at the Phillies - Nationals game on Wednesday .
His companion was kicked out for unruly behaviour .
In the aftermath he attacked Michael Vangelo and his daughter , who were sat in front of him .
" It was the most vile , disgusting thing I 've ever seen , " Vangelo told the Associated Press .
" He has two fingers down his throat , he lunges forward and vomits on myself and my 11 - year - old . "
He was charged with assault , reckless endangerment , disorderly conduct and related offenses .
He 's being held on $ 36,000 bail .
And , as bystanders held him down while more cops arrived , someone punched him in the face for good measure .
The all - nude fight scene has been a staple of literature since Eve asked Adam to bite into the fruit of knowledge and Adam said , “ Make me . ”
And why not ?
We like nudity , AND we like fighting .
Back in the really old days , when the Youtube was called “ actual Roman gladiators ” , naked fighting was literally the “ bread ” in “ bread and circuses “ .
The circus part involved lions , but that ’s another story .
What matters is that a snarling knock - down , drag - out is better when the delicate goodies are in play , and never more so , then when super - powers are involved .
And so , to continue my scholarly series about the prurient world of comic book decadence ( following the highly educational “ LOIS LANE : BONDAGE QUEEN ” and “ Comic Book Easter Zombie Parade ” posts ) , and bring to you …
THE TOP TEN NAKED SUPER - HERO FIGHTS IN COMICS .
But before the festival of naughty bits , three quick ground rules :
RULE # 1 :
No Adult Comics .
No taking the piss out of WARRIOR NUN , DANGER GIRL , VAMPIRELLA , or
ANYTHING HOWARD CHAYKIN HAS WRITTEN as that ’s low hanging fruit , and I do n’t pick , grab , fondle or tug at so easy a target .
Sadly , it means no COWGIRLS AT WAR , but we ’re sticking to mainstream super - heroes — and do I mean STICKING !
RULE # 2 :
Only one nudie shot per customer .
WOLVERINE , for example , can pop it out of his pants as often as he pops them out of his knuckles … if we do n’t impose the limit , the whole list becomes about Logan ’s dangly - bits .
RULE # 3 :
The appearance of nudity is n’t good enough .
The character must have actual genitalia .
Sorry Howard the Duck and Silver Surfer .
And now , without further ado , or further use of the phrase “ dangly - bits ” …

AVENGERS ILLUMINATI #1
As a millionaire playa , Tony Stark was always willing to slip out of the Armani suit for the hunnies , and as a drunken gutter dweller , he was willing to step out of the Iron Man suit and give it to his pal Rhodey .
The suit , I mean .
Clearly
Tony is very willing to drop trou , and that ’s why he ’s so calm , cool and TEACHING SCHOOL in this nude - fight classic .
With nothing but his “ little Iron Man ” to help him , and a few well remembered “ training sessions ” with Steve Rogers , Tony Stark smoothly kicks butt while his own is dancing in the breeze .
IN TONY ’S FAVOR : Skrulls are not human , so it ’s like being naked in front of your cat .
The things I do naked in front of my cats would get me arrested if I was doing them in front of say , the neighbors , tied up in my shower –

The Watchmen . Issue 12
The Watchmen is the greatest super - hero comic book of all time so it has to be on all lists that include the words “ greatest ” and “ super - hero ” .
Lucky for us , the naked fight scene between Rorschach and Doc Manhattan in Issue 12 is a keeper !
And it follows memorable naked quantum physics scenes and naked menage a doppelganger scenes that changed my dating ambitions forever .
The socio-political implications of Alan Moore ’s narrative and the intricate mechanism of this novel have been discussed endlessly by greater critics than I , so I ’ll just leave you with two thoughts :
1 ) It ’s bad enough being killed by a friend , but killed by one waving his little blue weenie at you is insulting .
2 ) Rorschach said was naked without his mask on , so he ’s joining Doctor Manhattan ’s free spirit–dying with his nose and lips exposed .
# 8
HOVERBOY #91
Hoverboy vs. Doc Natural .
If ever there was a reason to avoid calling him “ The Bucket Headed Super - Hero ” this issue is it .
After being hit with “ fiber melting herbs ” by the hippie super - villain Doc Natural , Hoverboy is forced to fight crime in the nude .
He learns to avoid shame by reading the first part of Genesis over and over , and eventually smacking anyone in the face who looks at him “ down there ” .
# 7
TARZAN VS .
TUBLAT the GORILLA
If you ’re into the twin aesthetics of decorative baroque , and boy ’s pink bums , you ca n’t do better than Burne Hogarth ’s TARZAN graphic novel , published in 1972 by Watson - Guptill .
Freed of the comics code , Tarzan is naked for the first hundred pages … and just so you ’d know where Burne ’s bread was buttered , we are shown nothing but Greystokes curiously un-tanned buttocks for those hundred pages – the Jungle Lord ’s crown jewels were hidden in shadows , or behind vines or strategically placed gorillas the whole time .
But , oh those glistening backside orbs were in full display–page after page — bulbously leaping from tree to tree in a cascade of male glute flesh rarely seen outside a clergyman ’s rectory .
And when Tublat ( Tarzan ’s gorilla father ) starts messing with Kala ( Tarzan ’s gorilla mother ) , we ’re treated to the second bloodiest naked super - hero fight scene on the list .
EXTRA NAKED POINTS : Everyone in this scene is stripped to the gonzos , INCLUDING TARZAN ’S MOM !
I dare you to fight someone while your mom is watching nude .

LEGEND OF AQUAMAN SPECIAL
If you did n’t want to see an “ in the buff ” teen - Aquaman fighting a grown man in rubber pants , then why have you read this far ?
Seriously .
Some self examination is in order .
Okay , I get that Aquaman ’s origin story was kinda like “ Tarzan of the Fish ” , and if his dolphin pals were n’t ashamed of their blow holes , why should he be ?
But this scene goes that extra special mile for its entertainment dollar .
It involves , rubber pants , choking , punching , animal noises and a young lad tied starkers and spread in a chair .
That ’s at least three - fifty downtown , but the comic retailed for two dollars , quite a bang for your buck in 1989 .
You always wondered why Aquaman has such a devoted following – it ’s not just because he can breathe underwater .
# 5
MARVEL COMICS PRESENTS # 77
I was n’t kidding about how often Logan goes sans pants .
They even have a special term to alert the students at the X - Mansion when Wolverine is “ sunnin ’ the package ” :
It ’s called “ mid-afternoon ” .
But of all the nudie Wolverine fights , this is the yardstick against which all others are measured .
And if you ’re measuring with a yardstick , you ’re already impressing me .
The zenith of Logan ’s multi-issue
birthday suit wood romp comes when he fights the equally unclothed and competitively hirsute wolves in MCP : WEAPON X # 77 , and bathes in their mighty blood when it ’s all done .
The most badass moment in comics is suitably bare assed and has been referenced again and again .
# 4
Ultimates # 9
Millar and Hitch ’s Ultimates run was a leader in the naked fight scene genre , with an average of one naked fight per 3.7 issues .
The Cap / Naked Giant Man fight from # 9 is my favorite , simply because it involves a giant guy waggling the wand six stories above your head .
One of the most important aspects of a man to man fight is the ability to look your opponent in the eye and say belittling things to him .
But when you have to crane your neck just to glimpse your opponent ’s eyes behind his BUICK - SIZED REPRODUCTIVE SAUSAGE , it ’s a trifle intimidating !
And Cap hands
Hank the beat down that he had coming all the same .
THAT’S why you salute the man with the shield .
# 3
Batman # 357 .
This ca n’t be a co-incidence .
There ’s no way that the editor was unaware that the first two words in this naked fight scene are “ swish ” and “ Dick .. ? ” – WHICH WERE THE TITLES OF MY FIRST TWO HOMO - EROTIC HAIKU !!
Someone had to be spying on me .
And the second page of this memorable sequence begins with another unfortunately worded balloon that I ’m not going to type up , in case I enjoy it more than I should .
Just read it yourself … out loud if the elderly are present .
And it all ends with a spread eagle boy wonder , and naked Bruce looking down on him , again saying “ Dick … ? ” .
Do n’t take my word for it .
Follow Bruce ’s stare … .
Go check , I ’ll wait .
It was as though the editorial team at DC had decided to give into the fan mail they ’d been getting from “ that anti-Wertham ” crowd , and just let them have one issue to call their own .
I think the story had something to do with mind control , and Hugo Strange , and something like that .
Did anyone read the other eighteen pages in this issue when people were wearing clothes ?
My copy wo n’t open .
# 2
ULTIMATE HULK ANNUAL #1
This is special in so many ways .
First off , the Ultimate Hulk was a walking naked fight scene from the word go .
That was is raison d’etre , his meaning in life , his chewy center .
He does n’t care if he defeats the Leader , or The Abomination …he just wants to meet a special someone and settle down , and the nudity was his version of Hulk Sized Foreplay .
This ANNUAL is nothing more than a big , long , extended , full length , and blood engorged naked fight scene that ends in a punch to the cojones that was visible from space .
And the subject
matter of the fight ?
Some chick named Zarda gets hired by Captain America to make the Hulk wear pants .
She attacks his Hulklings until he agrees , and then they go to a motel and snuggle like very bad bunnies who are not married to each other , and might not even be considering a formal engagement .
No wonder comics are considered literature nowadays .
# 1
BATMAN CONFIDENTIAL #18
When the end comes , and the world is crumbling around me due to nuclear devastation or social upheaval , this is the comic I take with me to the escape shelter .
Full Respect to Fabian Nicieza and Kevin Maguire for making this objet d’art for us to enjoy .
The story has something to do with Catwoman stealing something , and running into an all - nude fetish club to escape Batgirl chasing her…and Batgirl follows her in and stuff happens .
Good god , I ’m heterosexual , how am I supposed to remember the plot ?
You ’ll notice how sparse this list has been for naked super - HEROINE fights … up until now .
Oh , sure , She - Hulk and Black Cat do sometimes get all jiggy with their bid ’ness , but they do n’t seem to be PUNCHING anyone when they do it .
And Danger Girl and Codename : Knockout do n’t count if that ’s ALL they do .
But THIS …?
This is naked fighting , folks , not naked prancing .
You want naked prancing , visit your congressman .
There are other naked fight scenes in comics .
I seem to remember Magneto fighting for his life in the shower .
And let ’s never forget Bruce Banner ’s narrow escape from Jim Shooter ’s Traveling Shower Rape Stereotype Duo from that Rampaging Hulk in the Eighties … Ah , those memories I ca n’t seem to purge .
If you ’ve got a naked fight scene you ’d like to see featured in this column , please drop us a line .
We ’re always willing to look at naked people smacking at each other , whether they ’re flying through the air or not .
That ’s it for today .
A long one , but a good one .
( That ’s what she said ! )
I ’ll see everyone back here tomorrow for some all new BUN TOONS !
A new installment of LAST ROUNDUP ON THE SINISTER SPACECRAFT OF FORBIDDEN LOVE , and MORE !

This video is worth watching , at least through the first 5:30 minutes or so .
( You need to see Hendry respond to Sachs ’ claim that the Greek issue has only been on the table for 10 weeks . )
Other observations :
(1) Look at how much more civil this is , compared to American counterparts .
(2) Listen to how much cooler their accents are .
(3) Are they saying that the banks that are in need of a bailout are paying dividends ?!
Wow you have to hand it to those bankers , that ’s impressive .
Amazon recently revealed plans to bring its Kindle e-book application to Google 's Android mobile platform .
I got a hands - on demo of the software prototype , which the book vendor brought to Google I/O .
Much like the desktop and iPhone versions , it has support for synchronizing with Amazon 's cloud .
Page number , notes , and other information will transparently match up across all supported devices .
Screen readability is good and offers a solid reading experience .
Users can select from several different font sizes and background colors .
Options include a sepia mode and a white - on - black mode for night reading .
The application user interface has a brightness adjustment slider , but it was n't yet functional in the prototype that I tested .
The application lacks a built - in bookstore , but it can automatically sync content that the user has purchased .
To add a book from the device itself , the user visits Amazon 's website , purchases a book , and then uses the reader application 's synchronization feature to pull it down onto the device .
When the user deletes a book from the device in order to free up storage space , it is still accessible from an " archive " menu which can be used to re-download the content .
Amazon 's application is not a general - purpose reader — it can only display books from Amazon 's own bookstore .
If you want to read other kinds of content , such as free e-books from Project Gutenberg , you will still need a separate third - party reader application like FBReader or Aldiko .
I often read e-books on my cell phone when I travel .
I recently managed to get through two William Gibson novels during the flights to and from the Ubuntu Developer Summit that took place earlier this month in Brussels .
Getting e-books on my phone today is often a bit of a chore .
The ability to buy books over the air and have them available and fully synced on all of my devices will be a welcome addition to the Android platform .
NEW YORK - This city ’s streets , including Wall Street , Twitter accounts and cell phone text message networks were abuzz with anti-Wall Street sentiment as tens of thousands of people participated in a demonstration , either on the ground or virtually , called by the AFL - CIO and its allies in the NAACP , National People ’s Action , MoveOn and dozens of other community and labor organizations .
Unlike the tea party demonstrations , this rally reflected New York City in its size and its diversity .
The crowd was white , African American , Latino , Asian , young and old , poor through middle - income , trade unionists , community organizers ; everyone , aside from big bankers , was represented .
“ America is about more than making just easy money , ” AFL - CIO president Richard Trumka told those gathered .
“ It ’s about more than just looking out for number one .
Our lives and our livelihoods are all bound together , and we ’re all paying the price for those who knew no limits to their greed . ”
“ The price of that greed , ” he continued , “ was eight and a half millions of jobs lost ” and millions more that were never created .
Trumka went on to voice the rally ’s three main demands : that Wall Street stop fighting reform , stop dangerous speculation , and for it to “ take responsibility and clean up the mess you made . ”
According to NAACP president Ben Jealous , the fight against corporate greed really began in earnest with the 2008 elections and goes hand - in - hand with the 2010 mid-term elections .
“ If they think that all those voters that we registered in 2008 , if they think that all those young organizers that we brought out in 2008 have somehow disappeared , have somehow given up , have forgotten that change is not what happens on election day , but what we make happen every day , ” Jealous said , “ they ’ve got something else coming . ”
Jealous added that it was time to “ come out of the bleachers , and into the streets . ”
By the labor federation ’s estimates , 15,000 people came out for the march on Wall Street under the slogan , “ Good Jobs Now ! Wall Street Must Pay ! ”
Another 16,000 “ virtual marchers ” made their voices clear as well , through Twitter and other social networking sites .
“ Finally , ” one tweet read , “ a populist non -tea party march replete with diversity . ”
Another highlighted the hypocrisy of the Tea Party movement ’s talk of fighting the big banks : “ 10,000 people march on Wall Street today to protest for Financial Reform and not a tea party member in site ! hmmmm ”
This , along with other demonstrations across the country , led by labor and its allies , is being considered a beginning point to in building a bigger , broader movement that will challenge Wall Street , protect the Democratic majority in the Congress , and counter the tea parties .
Organizers are using all methods to keep people informed of upcoming demonstrations , including cell phone text messaging .
Throughout the rally , organizers exhorted members of the crowd to text the word “ reform ” to 225568 .
Anyone who does will receive alerts from the AFL - CIO about upcoming demonstrations .
One demonstrator said that this was “ better than the tea party demonstrations . ”
He went to one - and only one - on April 15th , he said , because they purport to be against the “ huge banks that are running this country . ”
He wo n’t return though , because “ they were crazy people , racists , so busy hating Black people .
I only went because there was nothing else . ”
“ Now , ” he said , “ I ’m going to wait for [ the AFL - CIO and other organizers of the anti-Wall Street march ] to text me . ”

A federal class- action suit involving disabled Coloradans -- two war veterans with psychological disorders -- and their service animals was filed Tuesday against Aurora , the City and County of Denver and its head of Animal Control .
The two veterans , and another disabled woman from out of state , say Denver 's controversial pit - bull ban does n't make exceptions for service dogs and their owners and is therefore a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act .
The issue of service dogs has been in the news of late .
Yesterday , we told you about a Colorado Springs attorney who was ordered to pay $ 50,000 for purportedly violating the Americans with Disabilities
Act when he barred a disabled woman and her service dog from entering his office because he was worried the dog might soil his new carpet .
He refutes this assertion and claims to have settled for " economic reasons . "
But pit bulls add a new twist to the service - dog issue .
The suit 's plaintiffs , represented by Wheat Ridge - based Animal Law Center , are asking for exemptions in the controversial pit bull ban for disabled citizens and more than $ 75,000 in damages from the municipalities and the head of Denver Animal Control , Doug Kelly , who has taken heat over the years for his support of the ban .
The lead plaintiff on the suit , Allen Grider , is a 59 - year - old Vietnam veteran who says he needs his dog , seven - year - old " Precious , " to help him manage his severe post traumatic stress disorder .
But in November , Aurora Police seized Precious , who Griber says is n't even a pit bull , under the city 's ban and placed her in a shelter .
" I am a combat marine , so if you fuck with me too much , you 'll be looking down the barrel of a marine , " he says .
" When I come in and I have PTSD and I 'm mad about something , she wo n't leave me alone -- she 'll calm me down until she can climb in my lap and give me kisses . "
" I 'm more the pit bull than she is , " he claims .
" I tried to tell them that . "
Precious was kept at the shelter for ten days before being released to Grider 's friend , who lives in another city without a pit bull ban .
Calls to Aurora 's Animal Care division and Denver 's Animal Care and Control have not yet been returned .
We 'll update this blog if and when they provide comment .
Glenn Belcher , a Gulf War veteran who moved to Denver with his pit bull last year , and Valerie Piltz , a disabled woman staying with her sister in Denver , are also plaintiffs in the suit ; both of them actually own pit bulls as service animals .
Precious , who is actually a chocolate lab and boxer mix , was rescued from a shelter to help Grider cope with his condition per a recommendation from a doctor .
Her main duties include going ahead of him into rooms to let him know if there are groups of people or warning if someone is at the door of his Aurora home .
But Grider says when she was taken away he lost more than his prescribed service dog -- he lost his greatest companion .
" They really messed me up .
When she was n't here , I was n't able to sleep , I was n't able to do nothing .
I had a really hard time , " Grider says .
" And that 's just exactly what she is -- precious .
She never bit nobody , she 's never running wild , she 's not vicious .
You come in my house , and she 'll lick you to death before she 'll bite you . "
Grider is pleased that Precious is back home with him now , where tomorrow she 'll celebrate her seventh year in his home .
But he says the ordeal has left them both a little wounded .
" She 's not the same .
I gotta train her again .
They messed her up bad , " he says .

In a move aimed at reducing the silent danger from electric and hybrid cars , the European Commission is considering rules that will require these vehicles to emit an artificial noise to alert pedestrians to their presence .
The regulation does not specify what the noise should sound like , only the minimum volume .
As a result , some car manufacturers have been having a little fun with the type of sound their vehicles will emit .
Matthew Reed from Lotus Engineering indicated that their new Evora 414E Hybrid will use a “ futuristic sound a bit like Star Wars ” .
The European noise regulation is in response to growing evidence of the risk posed to pedestrians from battery powered cars .
A University of California at Riverside study recently found that a internal - combustion car could be heard at 28 feet away , but that a hybrid operating in silent battery mode could not be heard until it was only seven feet away .
Despite this danger , critics contend that the widespread adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles has steadily been removing a major source of noise pollution from the environment and that by artificially requiring these cars to make noise , those gains will be erased .
In the hopes of mitigating this concern , the noise making technologies being implemented by the car manufacturers focus the artificial sound only in the direction the car is moving .
In addition to Europe , similar plans are also currently being considered in the United States and Japan .
Here we are , five weeks in to Jamie Oliver 's American Food Revolution .
We 've seen flash mobs .
We 've seen the burial of a deep fryer .
We 've seen a grown man dressed like a gigantic pea .
What we have n't seen is any group or organization willing to step up and donate the $ 150,000 that will sustain Jamie 's cause after he leaves .
Desperate to keep his project in the spotlight .
Jamie met up with his new BFF , Radio Rod .
The conversation veered into naked cooking , as they so often do when Jamie 's around .
Jamie asked Rod if he ever cooked a meal naked ( ugh , pass the industrial - sized gallon of brain bleach , please ) .
Rod said no , which I 'm totally fine with .
I do n't think I could n't have stomached that story .
[ Warning : Spoilers ahead ! ]
Jamie , on the other hand , took the opportunity to talk about the one time he cooked in the buff : " I did it once for Valentine 's Day , " Jamie said .
" I cooked a lovely sea bass .
When I opened the oven , a shot of steam shot out and burned me in that place .
It really hurt .
It doubled in size .
I had to put frozen peas on it .
It was so romantic . "
Frozen peas ?
On Jamie 's manhood ?
On Valentine 's Day ?
Paging SNL writers !
This is the stuff skits are made of !
This week , Jamie 's focus was clearly on securing the funding necessary to keep his project afloat .
He set up a meeting with three stone - faced hospital reps , all of whom looked like they had n't cracked a smile since the Reagan administration .
The reps expressed concern about the stigma attached to being labeled the fattest town , and told Jamie that businesses might not want to set up shop in town if the show portrayed them poorly .
Valid concerns ?
Yes .
Not exactly what Jamie wanted to hear ?
Double yes .
When the three amigos finally stopped blabbering , Jamie took a deep breath and asked them for $ 150,000 .
They all but laughed in his face .
So yeah .
Let 's just say the meeting did n't go too well .
Next , Jamie pulled all the students out of class at Huntington High School and held an assembly in the gym to apologize for taking their fries away last week .
He then told them that the ENTIRE FOOD REVOLUTION WOULD FAIL if enough students did n't order his pasta from the menu during lunch .
Wow .
And they thought the SATs were a lot of pressure .
Cut to a scene of virtually the entire student body waiting in line for Jamie 's pasta .
You see that , parents ?
Guilt trips do work on kids after all !
With things in check at the high school , Jamie headed back to the elementary school , where he met up with his old pal Alice .
She was wearing a purple shirt and a scowl .
The shirt was new .
While walking around the cafeteria and interacting with the students , Jamie was horrified to see that the ( gasp ! ) flavored milk was back in the refrigerator and available for the students to consume .
In came Rhonda , everybody 's favorite Director of Food Services , to explain that kids are more likely to drink milk if it is flavored .
Well , no duh , Rhonda .
What 's your next revelation ?
That Ryan Seacrest frosts his tips ?
Next , Jamie ( who says the word " brother " more than one of the Duggar siblings ) visited U.S. Foods , the distributor that supplies the schools with their lunch foods .
Mark , the U.S. Foods rep , handed Jamie a heavy coat and led him into the freezer .
According to Mark , they keep the temperature there very cold to " preserve the natural quality of the foods . "
Really , Mark ?
I think the polydimethylsiloxane that 's probably in half of those foods is doing that quite nicely already .
The good news is U.S. Foods also had a large selection of fresh fruits and vegetables .
And also , with all that frozen food around , Jamie will have another place to turn the next time he gets a nasty steam burn on his little British man bits .
Jamie was having fun , but he still did n't have his funding secured .
So he did what any of us would have done : hijacked a food truck and drove it to his potential donor 's place of employment to try to bribe him with a bison burger .
Doug Shiels , the aforementioned donor , is the head of a local hospital — and according to the number of times Jamie said his name last night , is apparently the end - all be-all to Jamie 's project .
" We want to get behind you if we can , " Doug said , looking equal parts horrified and bewildered by the food truck parked outside his office window .
And that brought this week 's episode to an end !
Be sure to tune in to next week 's finale , when we learn if Jamie will secure the funding his Food Revolution so desperately needs to succeed .
And if that 's not enough for you , Jamie also gets pulled over by a cop !
Maybe he was speeding in that green clunker he 's been driving around in for the past month .
Or maybe he 's going to get a ticket for overusing the phrase " main man . "
Only time will tell .

The major problem is that Hab fans anointed him the saviour of the franchise way too early .
That ’s not the type of pressure any young player needs , let alone a goalie .
It ’s even worse to anoint him saviour of a franchise that has the game ’s most demanding fans .
Leaf fans are relentless , but not having won a Stanley Cup in 43 years has almost left us broken and defeated .
Since we ’ve experienced such a long time in between championships there is a sort of glum resignation to the entire situation .
Being beaten down by inept upper management from Harold Ballard to JFJ will do that .
Of course , this resignation is nowhere every pre-season when fans , including me , are delusional about the team ’s chances ( p.s. I 'm already delusional about next year 's chances ) .
The difference in Montreal is that there is such a long history of winning , so the team ’s 1993 championship seems like it happened in 1893 .
They are n’t accustomed to long stretches of failure .
Last season the shine started to wear off Carey Price once the Habs faltered down the stretch after starting the year 8 - 2 - 1 and looking like a potential Stanley Cup finalist .
People make fun of Leaf fans for their preemptive parade planning , but I ’m pretty sure Montreal fans were ready to start their playoff riot after last season ’s dominating October .
The season thankfully spiralled out of control for the Canadiens with rumours of rampant partying plaguing the team .
Price 's name popped up in rumours as one of the main culprits in the matter and his play on the ice reflected this .
Montreal fans voiced their displeasure .
The new Carey Price , shaken and doubting , is the creation of Canadiens fans .
By overreacting to his initial success ( calling him Jesus ) they set him up for failure considering their lack of patience for any sort of struggle .
Being a goalie is the hardest position to play , especially behind Roman Hamerlik , and especially in Montreal .
It is n’t overly surprising that Price struggled after his first season .
The dreaded sophomore slump happens to a lot of young players , Steve Mason being the most relatable example .
Last year was Montreal ’s “ centennial ” year ( technically it was n’t ) and they were winning the cup .
It was ordained and you could n’t tell a Montreal fan otherwise .
When Price struggled , along with the rest of the team , it was entirely his fault in the eyes of many Hab fans .
He ’s been on a very short leash ever since .
I ’m sure most Hab fans gave him the benefit of the doubt heading into this year .
After all , it was only one bad season after a tremendous one .
And it was n’t like he was the only player who played poorly .
But after being badly outplayed by Jaroslav Halak this season the scrutiny Price faces is even more intense .
The rare games he plays must go perfectly or else Montreal fans boo him .
Over his last five games of the regular season Price had one awful outing where he was pulled early , but in the other four games he averaged only 2 goals against and close to a .940 % .
This was n’t enough for the majority of Hab fans because the team only won once , despite Price ’s best efforts .
Price could n’t win over the fans even when he played well .
If he did n’t win the game then it was an abject failure and it was his fault .
Knowing you must be perfect is n't the vote of confidence a young player needs .
Montreal fans seemed receptive of Price as he replaced Halak for game 4 against the Capitals this playoffs , but he gave up 4 goals on 36 shots and has once again been banished to the bench in favour of Halak .
Not sure if anyone in Montreal really cares .
Price certainly cares .
And it ’s showing .
In Montreal ’s game 4 loss to the Capitals , Price took two stupid unsportsmanlike conduct penalties that reveal how frustrated the young netminder is feeling .
The first penalty was for shooting the puck at a crowd of Washington players celebrating a goal , while the second came for making contact with Nicklas Backstrom after an empty net goal .
This is the second time that Carey Price has let his frustration show in the playoffs .
It was only last year during the Canadiens eventual first round defeat that Price raised his hands in mock celebration after being jeered by the crowd for making a routine save .
This was the same type of gesture that Patrick Roy made as the Montreal faithful mock cheered him during a rout .
That would be Roy ’s last game as a member of the Montreal Canadiens .
Could game 4 against the Capitals be Carey Price ’s last game for the Canadiens ?
Carey Price seems to have lost everything that made him so successful in his rookie season .
These emotional outbursts show the pressure is getting to Price and he is incapable of handling it .
He ’s clearly a young player lacking in self - confidence at the moment .
Unfortunately , Montreal is n’t a place where a young player can work through their struggles .
Everything is relentlessly dissected and the constant pressure in Montreal is engulfing Price .
The party lifestyle of the city probably is n’t helping either , if you choose to believe those rumours .
I ’m not suggesting Carey Price ’s career is over .
His is still very young and actually improved his numbers this year from 2008 - 2009 ( 08-09 : 2.83 GAA , .905 % ; 09 - 10 : 2.77 GAA , .912 % ) .
It ’s foolish to think that a 22 - year - old drafted fifth overall is incapable of recovering his game , especially since he ’s already shown an ability to play at a very high level .
I think Carey Price can still develop into a star goalie , but I do n’t think it will be in Montreal .
He seems like a player in desperate need of a change .
The best situation for Price would be to play in a less intense market and either back - up or split time with a veteran goalie who can help mentor him .
The ideal team that fits this description is New Jersey .
Martin Brodeur will turn 38 next week and could benefit from a reduced regular season workload considering his post - lockout playoff performances .
Price could learn a lot from Brodeur and when Brodeur decides to retire the Devils would have a number one goalie ready to step in .
Brodeur has two seasons left on his current deal and this seems like a perfect time frame to groom Price as a number one goalie , rather than shoving him into the role as a rookie under the scrutiny of the most demanding fan base in hockey .
This is not a trade rumour , merely a thought .
The Canadiens will have a big decision to make this summer as both Price and Halak are restricted free agents .
It ’s clear they will re-sign Halak after his tremendous year .
I ’m sure they will re-sign Price as well , but whether or not they actually keep him is a different matter .
If Price is made available there will be plenty of suitors for the 22 - year - old former first round pick who could potentially be had at a reduced cost .
Carey Price is only two seasons removed from a stellar rookie campaign where he wrestled the starting job away from Cristobal Huet as a 20 - year - old .
Price went 24 - 12 - 3 with a 2.56 GAA and a .920 % , which prompted Hab fans to call their new netminder Jesus Price .
Price was so good that Bob Gainey traded Huet at the deadline to the Capitals .
It helped that Huet was becoming an unrestricted free agent and that the Canadiens had another potential number one goalie named Jaroslav Halak playing in the AHL .
But Price ’s play really pushed the issue .
Only two years ago Montreal fans were calling him Jesus and now he ’s booed with shocking regularity .
Price ’s fall from grace has been steep and swift .
NORTHAMPTON , United Kingdom — Michael Ellis , Conservative candidate for parliament , smiled for the invited press , turned , cut the pink ribbon on the Lucky 13 Tattoo studio and declared it open for business .
This has to be the first time in history that a Conservative candidate has had a photo op at a tattoo parlor .
It is unclear whether Ellis , a lawyer , made the appearance because he is a good bloke and was doing a favor for the parlor 's owner , who he once represented in court , or because he is in an absolute neck - and - neck race to win the seat and needs all the publicity he can get .
What is certain is that everything that needs to be understood about the British election can be found in the constituency of Northampton North .
Northampton , located 70 miles north of London , could be the most average place in England .
The unemployment rate here is average , the ethnic mix is average , people 's attitudes are average .
What makes this constituency special is it has voted for the winning party in every election since 1974 .
Its sitting member of parliament , Labour 's Sally Keeble , is , like her party , polling a distant third behind Ellis and his Liberal Democrat counterpart Andrew Simpson in the current campaign .
The hard truth for Ellis is that at this moment , less than a week before the polls open May 6 , he is scrambling for victory .
He and Simpson are neck and neck with the outcome impossible to predict .
It should n't be this way .
Chatting at the Frog and Fiddle pub around the corner from the Lucky 13 Tattoo Parlor , I asked Ellis to explain why his party is struggling .
Labour has been in office for 13 years , the party is divided into factions that squabble in public , it has been at the center of several corruption scandals and it has led Britain into the worst economic crisis since World War II .
The Conservatives should be comfortably ahead .
Why are n't they ?
Ellis answered with well - rehearsed boiler plate .
" There 's still work to be done , " he acknowledged .
" The messages we are getting on the doorstep are diverse . "
One charge against the Conservatives is that they are what they always have been , a party that favors the rich .
Ellis refuted that : " The Conservative party today is different , we have undergone a lot of modernization . "
But he acknowledged that the general disillusionment with Britain 's traditional two big parties has played a role in this campaign .
That disillusionment left the door open for the third party Liberal Democrats and their leader Nick Clegg to push it wide open with his performance in the party leader debates .
For decades the Liberal Democratic party has been the home to people who are in politics out of idealism rather than a desire to win power .
The party has n't been a real factor in a national election since the 1920s .
Now its candidates are trying to maintain a certain sang froid in the face of the dramatic change in their fortunes .
The Northampton North candidate for the Liberal Democrats , Simpson , calls the surge " icing on the cake . "
Sitting in his no-frills office , surrounded by volunteers stuffing envelopes , he claims his strong position is as much the result of years of steady campaigning at the grassroots level as the paradigm - shattering performances of Clegg in the debates .
In Northampton North , the Liberal Democrats have steadily worked for more than a quarter century to build their presence in local government .
Simpson himself was elected to the Northampton council in 2005 .
Where Ellis is bluff and confident , Simpson , a personal finance officer in a chain of do - it - yourself shops , is earnest and ingratiating .
On this morning the candidate is working the doorsteps of the Kingsthorpe Estate , a suburban development of neat and tidy brick homes built in the 1960s .
At this time of day most of those at home are retirees and shift workers .
It is a neighborhood kindly disposed toward the Liberal Democrats .
Eric Pigney , a mailman , has voted Liberal Democrat since he was first eligible to vote back in 1974 .
I ask him why , since they always lose ?
He laughs , " I do n't know really .
Did n't feel an affinity with the other two , at first .
" Now , however , he has clearer reasons .
" When I started voting , Labour was Labour .
It was practically communist but now the two big parties have drifted together .
They [ Labour ] are kind of small c conservative .
" Labour was all for the have - nots but look at them now , " he said .
" Big houses , big cars . "
As Simpson works his way around the streets he smiles as the senior citizens bend his ear about local problems and tries to politely explain his party 's " liberal " position on immigration to all and sundry .
The assumption in London was that this was an election about the economy but , as Gordon Brown discovered this week , to his detriment , immigration is the emotive issue outside the capital .
Over and over again , the subject came up as Simpson worked his way around Kingsthorpe 's streets .
Bill Hester complained about the number of Poles coming in to the area and undercutting local workers on wages .
Simpson tried gently to disagree by pointing out some numerical facts about Polish migrants in the area , but the facts were not enough to overcome the voter 's emotion about immigrants .
In shops and pubs all over the district the negative effect of immigration is what people wanted to talk about when asked about the election .
Although they wo n't get many votes , the hard - right British National Party ( BNP ) had a lot of sympathizers .
The next most popular topic was how little difference there was between the main parties .
Seated behind Michael Ellis at the Frog and Fiddle , truck driver Alan Froggat exemplified the voter both concerned about immigration and disenchanted with the major parties .
" You just lose faith in politics , " he said , before expressing sympathy for the BNP 's anti-immigrant , " Britain for the British " stance .
Who did he vote for last time ?
" The Lib Dems . "
Who will he vote for this time ?
" I do n't know ... probably the same . "
He nodded toward Ellis , " I wo n't be voting for them . "
After the Conservative candidate left the Lucky 13 , I asked Christopher Smith , the artist running the tattoo shop , whether he would be voting for Ellis .
He did n't look like the typical Conservative supporter , with a hint of the intricate , colorful tats that cover his body peeking out from the sleeve of a dress shirt he had worn especially to meet the candidate .
Smith admitted he was n't into politics and had never voted before .
Then he and the other three people who work at the Lucky 13 all pledged to vote Conservative on Thursday .
In a contest as tight as Northampton North , those votes may be critical .
Michael Ellis was n't wasting a half hour when he agreed to snip that ribbon .
May 30 , 2010 -- Capitalism and Climate --
Most of what you 've heard about Robert Malthus is wrong .
He did n't predict a population explosion , and he did n't think we should control our population .
His real goal was to convince people that society cannot be improved , that most people will always be poor .
" The Malthus Myth : Population , Poverty and Climate Change " was a talk presented by Ian Angus , editor of Climate and Capitalism and a contributing editor of Socialist Voice , at Socialism 2010 in Toronto , May 22 , 2010 .
Many thanks to Pance Stojkovski , who recorded this presentation and edited it for Socialist Project 's LeftStreamed .
When Dr. Alan Heeger and his colleagues began experimenting with newly - found semiconducting polymers in the 1970s , they just wanted to understand the basic physics of how electrons were set free in the materials .
But they ended up making a discovery that has helped advance a new generation of solar plastics and inks .
By oxidizing polyacetylene , a long - chain molecule which acts like a pigment , the researchers found the polymer to have extraordinarily high conductive properties .
“ We realized it in a classic ‘ ah ha moment , ’ ” says Heeger .
“ But then over and over again , we saw additional properties that we had not foreseen . ”
Eventually , Heeger and his colleagues , Alan MacDiarmind and Hideki Shirakawa , figured out that the material was not just a novelty .
It had the potential to change the way we manufacture electronic devices , transistors , diodes and solar cells .
These semiconducting polymers could be put in a solution and printed on a substrate – potentially creating a revolution in electronics that rivals what Gutenberg ’s printing press did for books 600 years earlier .
“ Printing is a low - cost , high speed manufacturing process … I doubt that there ’s a lower - cost manufacturing for any solar technology , ” says Heeger .
The science community agreed .
In 2000 , the three researchers received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work .
A year later Heeger co-founded Konarka , a Massachussets - based company working to commercialize organic solar PV technologies .
The company has since racked up tens of millions of dollars in financing and has built a GW - scale manufacturing facility that produces “ power plastic , ” a flexible material that can be integrated into bags , electronics , and building materials .
With all this promising sounding news , one might think that the revolution in printed organic PV is underway .
But that ’s definitely not the case .
A number of technical challenges and changing market conditions have made it difficult for third - generation solar companies to ramp up production and sell products .
“ Clearly the industry had a good story to tell , ” says technology journalist Peter Fairley .
“ But that story has since changed and I think things look very different today for these companies . ”
During the height of the silicon shortage between 2005 and 2007 , interest in emerging third - generation solar technologies was strong .
The high price of silicon made printable , non-silicon based solar products look very attractive .
Never mind that they were only 4 to 5 percent efficient and lasted for only a few years – roll - to - roll printing below a dollar per watt was an attractive selling point .
Then came Cadmium Telluride thin - film producer First Solar , which said it was manufacturing 11 - percent efficient products below a dollar per watt .
It quickly steamrolled its way to the top of global module producers .
The eventual easing of the silicon shortage and the global oversupply of PV caused a roughly 30 % drop in prices , making traditional PV technologies more attractive than they ’ve ever been .
This has taken some of the spotlight off the third - gen PV industry as well .
Konarka may have a GW - scale manufacturing facility , but they do n’t appear to be shipping anywhere close to that amount of product .
“ I do n’t believe that Konarka is producing a GW of material a year , ” says Fairley .
“ They have to find buyers and people who want a GW of their material .
And that ’s still the number one challenge . ”
With such low efficiencies and short product lifetimes , third - generation PV companies are trying to find a unique niche rather than taking traditional PV head - on .
Applications like portable chargers , solar clothing , solar umbrellas and roll - out awnings are the most obvious .
And after that , windows and building facades are a potentially promising area .
Companies are already installing small building integrated systems , but organic solar technologies need to get much more efficient in order to achieve real scale .
“ In the laboratory today , people are making these organic solar cells with peak power efficiencies in the range of 6 to 8 percent .
We should be able to get twice that – and that ’s our challenge , ” says Konarka ’s Heeger .
Success in the lab does not necessarily mean success in the market .
However , these technologies have moved fairly quickly from research to reality .
And if the progress continues , organic PV may someday be competitive with more traditional solar products – someday being the key word .
“ It seems premature to call the technology commercialized , ” says Fairley .
“ Many of the products that we ’ve heard about have failed to materialize . ”

The Human Microbiome Project ( HMP ) has published an analysis of 178 genomes from microbes that live in or on the human body .
The researchers discovered novel genes and proteins that serve functions in human health and disease , adding a new level of understanding to what is known about the complexity and diversity of these organisms .
The human microbiome consists of all the microorganisms that reside in or on the human body .
Outnumbering cells in the human body by 10 to 1 , some of the microorganisms cause illnesses , but many are necessary for good health .
Currently , researchers can grow only some of the bacteria , fungi and viruses in a laboratory setting .
However , new genomic techniques can identify minute amounts of microbial DNA in an individual and determine its identity by comparing the genetic signature to known sequences in the project 's data base .
The paper is published in the May 21 issue of the journal Science .
" This initial work lays the foundation for this ambitious project and is critical for understanding the role that the microbiome plays in human health and disease , " said National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins , M.D. , Ph.D .
" We are only at the very beginning of a fascinating voyage that will transform how we diagnose , treat and ultimately , prevent many health conditions . "
Launched in 2008 as part of the NIH Common Fund 's Roadmap for Medical Research , the HMP is a $ 157 million , five - year effort that will implement a series of increasingly complicated studies that reveal the interactive role of the microbiome in human health .
The 178 microbial genomes in this report launch the HMP reference collection that eventually will total approximately 900 microbial genomes of bacteria , viruses and fungi .
These data will then be used by HMP researchers to characterize the microbial communities found in samples taken from healthy human volunteers and , later , those with specific illnesses .
Samples are currently being collected for HMP from five areas of the body : the digestive tract , the mouth , the skin , the nose and the vagina .

" Although this is only the first step in making HMP medically useful , we already have learned surprising things about the diversity and complexity of the microorganisms that live in and on our body , " said Jane Peterson , Ph.D. , associate director of the NHGRI Division of Extramural Researcher and a leader of the HMP effort .
" The next stages of this coordinated study will begin to associate the presence or absence of specific micro-organisms with various states of health and illness . "
Researchers also conducted a preliminary survey to gain insights into the function of some of the newly identified genes and proteins unique to individual microbial strains .
For instance , researchers found previously unknown proteins produced by bacteria that live in the stomach that may cause gastric ulceration , a hole in the stomach lining .
In addition , they found a small number of newly identified novel proteins associated with how sugars and amino acids are metabolized .
Researchers also evaluated the microbial diversity present in the HMP reference collection .
For example , they found 29,693 previously undiscovered , unique proteins in the reference collection -- more proteins than there are estimated genes in the human genome .
They compared their results to the same number of previously sequenced microbial genomes randomly selected from public databases .
In the microbial genome from public databases , they found 14,064 novel proteins .
These data , the researchers say , suggest that the HMP reference collection has nearly twice the amount of microbial diversity than is represented by microbial genomes already in public databases .
One of the primary goals of the HMP reference collection is to expand researchers ' ability to interpret data from metagenomic studies .
Metagenomics is the study of a collection of genetic material ( genomes ) from a mixed community of organisms .
Comparing metagenomic sequence data with genomes in the reference collection can help researchers determine whether they are novel or already existing sequences .
To evaluate whether the reference collection of genomes was meeting the goal above , the researchers compared 16.8 million microbial sequences found in public databases to the genome sequences in the HMP reference collection .
They found that 62 genomes in the reference collection showed similarity with 11.3 million microbial sequences in public databases and 6.9 million of these -- about 41 percent -- correspond with genome sequences in the reference collection .

This analysis demonstrates that genomes sequenced as part of the reference collection add directly to an understanding of the human microbiome .
However , researchers cautioned that at least one - third of the metagenomic sequences are still not represented by any genome in the reference collection and that this analysis focused only on the gastrointestinal tract .
The authors added that additional genomes likely exist in other body sites and the completion of the reference collection should address many of the remaining organisms not accounted for in this analysis .
The initial stage of the HMP , which includes the current study , focused on bacteria , but future genome sequencing and human microbiome studies also will capture information about more complex microbes and viruses .
The effort so far also has allowed researchers to create a framework for data resources and standards .
In addition , the project is supporting the development of innovative technologies and computational tools , coordination of data analysis , and an examination of some of the ethical , legal and social implications of human microbiome research .
Genome sequencing work for the project is done by the HMP - funded large - scale sequencing centers : the Human Genome Sequencing Center , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston ; Washington University Genome Sequencing Center , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis ; The J. Craig Venter Institute , Rockville , Md. ; and the Broad Sequencing Platform , Broad Institute of MIT / Harvard , Cambridge , Mass .
The HMP is currently funding pilot demonstration projects by researchers that will sample the microbiomes of healthy volunteers and volunteers with specific diseases over the next year .
This will allow researchers to study changes in the microbiome at particular body sites in healthy controls compared to patients affected by diseases .
These studies will use samples collected from seven areas of the body : the digestive tract , the mouth , the skin , the nose , the vagina , the blood and the male urethra .
Genomes sequenced as part of the HMP and those generated by unrelated projects are publicly available from the National Library of Medicine 's National Center for Biotechnology Information , part of NIH , at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/MICROBES/microbial_taxtree.html.
HMP data may also be accessed from its Data Analysis and Coordination Center website , http://hmpdacc.org/.

Prisoners of Gravity
From seventeen years ago : the SANDMAN episode of , featuring a very young me , not to mention Mike Dringenberg , Jill Thompson , Charles Vess , P Craig Russell , Karen Berger , Kelley Jones , and Harlan Ellison .
Not the greatest quality video in the world .
Sometimes I dream about the ultimate DVD collection of Prisoners of Gravity , the one with every episode of that remarkable series .
Even the never - repeated Awards show .

If one wants to show " If A , then B " , first find an interesting consequence C of B that looks easier to prove than B itself , but not so simple that it can be immediately deduced from A .
Then try to prove " If A , then C " .
Finally , show " If A and C , then B " .
The point is that this factors the original problem into two simpler ones .
If one believes that the original implication is true , then the two sub-implications must be true also , so one is not " losing " anything by trying this method .
A variant approach , once one has successfully obtained " If A , then C " , is to deconstruct that proof in order to find out what made it work ; this can then give valuable clues as to how to then prove the stronger statement " If A , then B " .
This tends to work well when C acts as a " simplified toy model " of B .
DETROIT --
After holding a 38 - 32 edge in faceoffs in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinal playoff series against the San Jose Sharks , the Detroit Red Wings were dominated on the draw in
, with San Jose winning 43 - of - 69 faceoffs .
It is a huge point of emphasis for the Red Wings .
They hope playing on their home ice at Joe Louis Arena on Tuesday night in Game 3 will solve the problem , since the visiting team 's center must place his stick on the ice first in the faceoff circle .
" Hopefully , what happened in their building , the way the faceoffs went , we can do exactly the same thing , '' Detroit 's Kris Draper said .
" You 've just got to go at the drop of the puck .
And if you do n't stop , you 're going to have a lot of momentum , you 're going to have motion , you 're going to be a lot quicker and stronger . ''
Winning the faceoff is crucial for puck possession .
" It makes it a lot easier to have the puck instead of chasing the puck for awhile , '' the Red Wings ' Henrik Zetterberg said .
" It 's a big part of the game .
It 's one thing we have to improve on if we want to win the series . ''
Big 3 reunion pays off for Sharks
Sharks coach Todd McLellan reunited his big three forwards -- Joe Thornton , Patrick Marleau and Dany Heatley -- in the third period Sunday .
It paid off on Joe Thornton 's winning goal .
" They played a lot ( together ) all year .
When we needed big goals , they got them for us , '' McLellan said .
" There was a lot of talk of them being shut out the first round .
I thought by putting them back together it would be a challenge for them .
" In the third period , we were down one and they came through .
Yet , I liked our lines the way we played them in the first two periods as well . ''
History not on Red Wings ' side
The Red Wings have won just 5 - of - 19 best - of - seven series when losing the first two games : in the semifinals against Boston in 1945 ( 4 - 3 ) and Chicago in 1963 ( 4 - 2 ) , in the second round vs. Toronto in 1987 ( 4 - 3 ) and in the first round against Minnesota in 1992 ( 4 - 2 ) and Vancouver in 2002 ( 4 - 2 ) .
The Sharks have won 3 - of - 4 series in which they 've led 2 - 0 .
They defeated Calgary in 1995 ( 4 - 3 ) and beat St. Louis ( 4 - 1 ) and Colorado ( 4 - 2 ) in 2004 .
They lost to Edmonton in 2006 ( 4 - 2 ) .
​ The Brooks County Sheriff ’s Department has a marijuana problem .
They ’ve got 200,000 pounds of pot , and they ’re complaining that it would be too expensive to destroy it .
“ This is a problem that does n’t seem to be going away and anything we can get to help us to dispose of these cases once they ’re done and to get ready for the next one that are coming in would be a great help , ” said Deputy Daniel Davila .
Something tells me Toke of the Town readers could be of great assistance to the deputy .
After all , at a trying time like this , we all have to pitch in , people !
All of the confiscated cannabis comes from drug cases over the past decade , reports Manuel De La Rosa at KIII - TV .
And for now , all that unwanted weed sits in some storage trailers , awaiting an uncertain fate .
The marijuana dates back as far as 2000 .
According to authorities , the previous sheriff either did n’t keep good records , or did n’t get destruction orders from judges .
It ’s a priority for the current sheriff to get rid of the hundreds of thousands of pounds of pot .
Deputies destroyed some of the bundles of bud with two visits to the Department of Public Safety incinerator in McAllen , Texas last year , but it cost them nearly $ 30,000 .
The problem seems to be unwrapping the plastic off the marijuana , commonly used by Mexican drug smugglers , and Brooks County just does n’t have the manpower to do that .
The county has a small sheriff ’s department , with only seven patrol officers and one criminal investigator .
“ ( It ’s ) very time consuming , ” Deputy Davila said .
“ Probably for preparation to get it ready a week or more , whatever trailers we are going to use to transport it up there , and it would take several officers especially to remove the plastic from the contraband . ”
Just for the past 16 months , Brooks County has started keeping more marijuana seized from cases under Sheriff Rey Rodriguez .
Already , they ’ve filled two trailers with pot .
The problem is , the dank deluge continues ; the cannabis cases keep coming in , and the weed just stacks up higher and higher .
The only place deputies can currently destroy the pot is at the DPS Lab in McAllen , but plans are afoot to pool resources in the Coastal Bend to destroy the weed locally .
County officials believe that would be less costly and might solve their marijuana storage problems .
Suppose we put this spectrum up for sale .
( The local stations do not “ own ” this spectrum .
They have licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission . )
Although the details of how to conduct this auction are important , they do n’t make compelling reading on a Sunday morning .
Interested readers should examine a detailed proposal made to the F.C.C. by Thomas W. Hazlett , a professor at the George Mason University School of Law who was formerly the F.C.C. ’s chief economist .
Professor Hazlett estimates that selling off this spectrum could raise at least $ 100 billion for the government and , more important , create roughly $ 1 trillion worth of value to users of the resulting services .
Those services would include ultrahigh - speed wireless Internet access ( including access for schools , of course ) much improved cellphone coverage and fewer ugly cell towers .
And they would include other new things we can’t imagine any more than we could have imagined an iPhone just 10 years ago .
But some compelling technology that could use these frequencies already exists , like wireless health monitoring  to check diabetics ’ blood sugar regularly , for example  and remote robotic surgery that can give a patient in Idaho a treatment like that available in New York or Chicago .
Who would oppose this plan ?
Local broadcasters are likely to contend that they are providing a vital community service in return for free use of the spectrum that was put in their hands decades ago .
Whether the local news or other programs are vital services is up for debate , but their value is n’t the issue , because they can be made available via cable , satellite and other technologies , including improved broadband .
Say there are 10 million households that still get their television over the air , including those that ca n’t afford cable or satellite and some that generally just do n’t care for what ’s on TV .
( Yes , there are people who do n’t like “ American Idol . ” )
But about 99 percent of these households have cable running near their homes , and virtually all the others , in rural areas , could be reached by satellite services .
The F.C.C. could require cable and satellite providers to offer a low - cost service that carries only local channels , and to give vouchers for connecting to that service to any households that have n’t subscribed to cable or satellite for , say , two years .
Professor Hazlett estimates that $ 300 per household should do it : that amounts to $ 3 billion at most .
Compared with the gains from selling off the spectrum , it ’s a drop in the bucket .
Or , as an interim step , we could reduce the number of channels available in a community from 49 to , say , 5 .

The volcanic rock is 100ft wide and 70ft high and a 250 - mile boat trip from Stornoway on the Western Isles .
Adventurer Andy Strangeway , from Full Sutton , East Yorkshire , is behind the idea of installing the plaque .
Mr Strangeway specialises in visiting remote and inaccessible islands around the UK coast .
Western Isles council , Comhairle nan Eilean Siar , said there were no objections to the proposal and wished him well .
Earliest recorded
Last year , bad weather prevented a team of Belgian radio enthusiasts from landing safely on Rockall .
They had hoped to make a series of amateur communications from the islet .
The earliest recorded landing on Rockall was believed to be in 1810 , by an officer called Basil Hall from the HMS Endymion .
Its exact position was first charted by Royal Navy surveyor Captain ATE Vidal in 1831 .
In 1972 , the Isle of Rockall Act was passed , which claimed to make the rock officially part of Inverness - shire , Scotland .
UK sovereignty extends to the 12 nautical mile territorial sea around Rockall , under the provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .
In 1997 , Greenpeace activists opposed to oil and gas exploration landed on the island , stayed for 42 days , replaced the navigational beacon with a solar - powered one and declared Rockall the sovereign territory of Waveland .
AN ITALIAN mafia boss convicted of murdering a 13 - year - old boy and dissolving him in acid was released from prison after he complained of feeling depressed .
The decision to allow godfather Salvatore " Vito " Vitale , a member of Cosa Nostra , out of prison on compassionate grounds enraged victims of organised crime .
The mobster was part of a gang that kidnapped 11 - year - old Giuseppe Di Matteo in November 1993 to gag his father , a gangster who had become an informer .
They held the boy for more than two years in a bid to force his father to retract the testimony he had given to police .
When that failed , they strangled the youngster and dissolved his body in a tub of acid to get rid of the evidence .
Vitale , who allegedly supplied the acid , was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison .
However , the court accepted his lawyers ' arguments that he is suffering from diabetes , depression and a heart condition and should no longer be kept behind bars .
He is now back at home in Palermo , Sicily , after magistrates ruled he should be released on compassionate grounds .
An association of victims of mafia violence condemned the court 's decision as disgraceful .
Spokeswoman Giovanna Maggiani Chelli said : " Criminals who are condemned to life sentences , who then become sick , should be sent to hospital for treatment and then , as soon as they have recovered , be returned to prison . "

I 'm not sure of your reference to praising cops .
The traveling pertains to traveling of any kind .
Any time you drive , or you walk , you are traveling .
Knowing what the cops are looking for , and what areas they are most worried about messing up , gives you the chance to use those particulars to your advantage .
For instance .......
Never submit voluntarily to a search and never sign anything that states you do .
Constantly ask if you are being detained and if you are free to go .
They can only hold you for so long .
You can get more from the piece but you have to read between the lines sometimes .
I like that Obama has stopped most of the raids on med pot patients .
He has n't yet come out with a new war on cannabis or anything close to it .
I am most disappointed that Obama has n't recognized the strength of our movement , or the science , or sincerity of it .
I see and hear of a lot of people that are upset with Obama but I am glad we are not killing nearly as many innocent women and children in Iraq as we were .
Our government in our name killed many innocents with our shock and awe and all the other misguided war adventures .
I am still mostly satisfied with Obama .
It could be better ...... but it could be John McCain and Sarah Palin .
If we are to see real change we have to get more mobilized and visible .
" Change has to come from the bottom up . "
O .
We have to stop any silly turf wars or conflicts between the three factions of cannabis reform .
We all need it rescheduled and legal .
Cannabis for farmers !
Cannabis for patients !
Cannabis for a safer alternative to alcohol !
Keep fighting the good fight rchandar .
Legal like alcohol .
Couscous with onions and raisins and seasoned with cumin delivers many levels of flavor with rich little Cornish hens , massaged with spices .
How many birds you need for four guests will be determined by their size ( the birds ’ and perhaps the guests ’ , too ) .
Whether you grill or roast them depends on your mood , your kitchen and the weather .
The couscous could even be stuffing for smaller hens , one per person , roasted at 375 degrees for about 50 minutes .

Hedge fund Elliot Associates has made a bid to acquire software vendor Novell .
In a public letter to the company 's board of directors , the hedge fund offered $ 5.75 per share ( a 49 percent premium ) , placing Novell 's value at $ 2 billion dollars .
Elliot Associates is already one of the largest institutional shareholders of Novell , with roughly 8.5 percent of the company 's stock .
Novell 's NetWare platform was once a widely - used server operating system , but its popularity swiftly declined with the emergence of Linux .
Novell responded to that trend by entering the Linux market itself , acquiring Ximian and SuSE in 2003 .
Novell has made significant inroads in the Linux space , but has had difficulty competing with Red Hat on the server side .
Although Novell is still an active contributor to Linux desktop and server technologies , the company is gradually shifting its focus towards development tools — particularly the Mono framework , which has been modestly successful and is attracting a growing audience of commercial software developers due its suitability for mobile uses and embedding .
In the public letter to Novell 's board of directors , Elliot Associates portfolio manager Jesse A. Cohn describes Novell 's attempts at diversification as " unsuccessful " and contends that the company 's stock has underperformed .
Elliot Associates believes that it can turn Novell around by restructuring the company to wring more value out of its useful technologies .
The letter conveys a sense of urgency and uses the word " expedite " twice .
It 's pretty clear that they want this deal and they want to get the ball rolling as soon as possible .
" We are available to sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement and commence our due diligence review immediately .
Elliott is prepared to devote considerable resources to completing this transaction and we are confident that , with [ Novell 's ] cooperation , we will be in a position to execute a definitive transaction agreement on an expedited basis , " wrote Cohn in the open letter .
The fate of Novell has significance for the broader Linux and open source software communities because many other Linux distributions rely on Novell 's technology and code contributions .
For example , Novell 's AppArmor framework , F - Spot photo manager , and custom build of OpenOffice.org ( which has enhanced support for Linux ) are shipped by default in Ubuntu and other distros .
There is no way to know yet how Elliot Associates would manage these projects if the acquisition is successful .
In response to the proposal , Novell issued a public statement which indicated that the company 's board of directors is preparing to evaluate the offer with the help of its legal and financial advisors .
Novell has n't provide any specific details yet that provide insight into whether it is willing to accept the offer .
Although Novell has good technology and smart people , it has been short on execution .
The company 's controversial agreement with Microsoft proved to be profitable in the short term , but created friction between Novell and the broader Linux community .
Converging the highly disparate cultures and technologies of Ximian and SUSE has consistently posed challenges for Novell , but the combination could still potentially make the company a Linux powerhouse if it got the right kind of leadership .
It 's unclear , however , if that 's what Elliot Associates has in mind .
Die kreisförmigen Leuchterscheinungen sind offenbar eine reine Kopfsache .
Schuld daran sind die Magnetfelder , die bei langer Blitzentladung entstehen und das Gehirn täuschen .
Innsbrucker Physiker haben offenbar das Rätsel der sogenannten Kugelblitze gelöst : Die bei Gewittern häufig von Augenzeugen beobachteten kreisförmigen Leuchterscheinungen könnten demnach im Kopf entstehen .
Verantwortlich dafür soll ein bei langer Blitzentladung entstehendes Magnetfeld sein , das im menschlichen Gehirn den Eindruck leuchtender Kugeln erzeuge , berichteten die Physiker Josef Peer und Alexander Kendlin einer Aussendung am Montag .
Das Phänomen Kugelblitz hat der Wissenschaft lange Zeit Rätsel aufgegeben .
Mit den im Gehirn entstehenden Lichtwahrnehmungen - sogenannten Phosphenen - ließen sich viele der Beobachtungen von Kugelblitzen erklären , hieß es . Ihre Ergebnisse werden die beiden Physiker in der Fachzeitschrift " Physics Letters A " veröffentlichen .
Gleiche Wirkung wie psychiatrisches Verfahren
Peer und Kendl untersuchten elektromagnetische
Felder verschiedener , bei Gewittern typischerweise auftretender Blitze .
Dabei habe sich gezeigt , dass die Magnetfelder langanhaltender Blitze mit sich wiederholenden Entladungen " genau dieselben Eigenschaften " aufweisen , wie das in der klinischen und psychiatrischen Praxis gängige Verfahren der Transkraniellen Magnetstimulation ( TMS ) , das zur Anregung von Nerven im menschlichen Gehirn dient .
Die zeitliche Änderung von ausreichend starken Magnetfeldern verursacht im Kopf elektrische Felder an den Nervenzellen der Sehrinde , die Leuchteindrücke auslösen können .
" Aus klinischen Studien mit TMS sind real und hell erscheinende optische Sinneswahrnehmungen in verschiedenen Formen und Farben im Sichtfeld von Patienten und Versuchspersonen bekannt und gut untersucht " , erklärte Kendl .
Auch der nahe Einschlag langanhaltender Blitze könnte für derartige Leuchteindrücke verantwortlich sein .
Auch Gerüche können auftreten
" Einem Beobachter , der sich im Abstand von wenigen hundert Metern von einem langen Blitzeinschlag entfernt befindet , kann ein magnetisches Phosphen in Form eines hellen Lichtflecks für einige Sekunden erscheinen " , schilderte der Physiker .
Zusätzlich könnten dabei auch andere Sinneseindrücke wie Geräusche oder Gerüche auftreten .
Laut Kendl spricht für die
These auch ihre Einfachheit : " Im Gegensatz zu anderen Theorien , die schwebende Feuerkugeln beschreiben , sind keine neuen und weiteren Annahmen nötig " .

MAY 25 -- While we 're on the subject of drunken , vomiting sorority girls , here 's a letter detailing the debauchery at a recent formal held at a Cincinnati museum commemorating the Underground Railroad , the hidden network once used by escaped slaves .
The March 26 affair at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center was organized by the Alpha Xi Delta sorority chapter at Miami University in Ohio .
In an internal memo drafted three days after the booze - soaked event , a fuming Freedom Center official described how inebriated sorority sisters and their guests attempted to ' urinate on our artifacts , ' defaced restrooms , and vomited ' throughout our building . '
Describing the museum as a ' place of education and inspiration for visitors , ' Rhonda Miller noted that , a day after the formal , staffers were ' still finding hidden bottles of alcohol and new places where students had vomited from having too much to drink . '
Miller , the museum 's private event coordinator , wrote that she even had to stop one young man as he was preparing to relieve himself on the side of a ' priceless and sanctified ' slave pen .
The pen , pictured at left , was moved from a Kentucky farm and reassembled in the museum 's second - floor atrium ( slaves were imprisoned in the two - story log house prior to their auction ) .
Two weeks after the Alpha Xi Delta formal , another Miami University sorority was involved in a similar drunken escapade .
That event , described here by the owner of the lodge where the party was held , resulted in the suspension of the school 's Pi Beta Phi sorority chapter .

Happy 8th Vana'versary !
The Appreciation of Adventurers Begins !
( 05/11/2010 )
Long time no see , adventurers !
It 's me , Kupolette , nomad moogle extraordinaire , here to bring word that the Adventurer Appreciation Campaign is once again upon us , kupopo !
This year , we moogles have dug deep to deliver delightful difts — uh , gifts to show our objects of overt adulation — adventurers , obviously — our appreciation for their tireless efforts in making Vana ' diel a better place for one and all .
And as has become the institution , the M.H.M.U. has prepared a record of all your adventuring escapades for you to peruse with puffed - up pride , kupo !
Now here 's a piece of news that should set your heart astir : unearthing the eleven mog tablets during the festivities will unleash all the Super Kupowers !
That 's right , every single one , kupo !
Astute adventurers may notice that this phenomenon is occurring exactly one year after the fabled artifacts first resurfaced .
Could it be that — * gasp !*— the tablets , too , are sharing in our joy ?
Whatever the truth may be , the speculation has aroused academic ardor within the moogle community , kupo .
And what would an Adventurer Appreciation Campaign be without — you guessed it !— the reading of congratulatory letters ?
A considerable quantity of letters has been sent in from all over Vana 'diel by various personages of prestige .
Allow me to recite a select few this instant , kupo .
Ahem !
Our first letter comes to us from Her Royal Highness Princess Claidie of the Kingdom of San d'Oria , kupo !
Esteemed adventurers of Vana'diel .
I would like to express to you my deepest feelings of gratitude on this momentous occasion .
Your existence is as a pair of beating wings that lift our hearts to greater heights .
Truly , you are the pride and joy of all children of Altana .
Ever do I pray for your continued health and success .
Ah , such a cordial and earnest expression of affection from the lovely Princess Claidie .
Puts me in mind of a kind and caring older sister , she does , kupo !
Now , moving on to the next letter ...
Respected adventurers .
Please accept my humblest apologies for Naji 's indiscretions .
Hmm ?
What a weird way to start a letter , kupo .
Who could this be from ?
Ah , Mythril Musketeer Ayame of the Republic of Bastok !
She was alluding to the message her quirky colleague Naji sent us last year .
How very thoughtful of her , kupo .
Anyway , back to the rest of the letter .
A sheathed blade is a symbol of peace .
Yet even such a blade must stand ever ready to be drawn , lest it forever be bereft of its scabbard .
Let us fight as one , adventurers and musketeers alike , for the continued peace and prosperity of the land .
A message that demonstrates dignity and decorum well beyond her years !
Ayame truly deserves the honor of being the Mythril Musketeers ' youngest - ever inductee , kupo .
Hmm , I could n't help but notice that letters from the ladies seem to be the prevailing trend this year , kupo .
Let 's see who sends the next one ...
O -hohohohoho !
Uwaaaaaah , kupo !
Th - the sender of this letter requires absolutely no introduction : Doctor Shantotto !
* Gulp *
Tell me , by whose leave do you presume to celebrate ?
Think twice before raising a fuss , lest you make me irate .
But a word of praise I shall spare you who have remained unfazed
in the face of a curse that leaves many debilitated and dazed .
Now off you go , and give no less than your absolute best ,
if with all limbs attached you wish to survive my future tests !
Such a sumptuously sweet message ... by the good doctor 's sadistic standards , that is , kupo .
As tremendously touching as that last letter was , I think I 'll push my luck and see if we can end on an even higher note .
Frail though your mortal flesh may be , within it burns a fiery spirit worthy of my respect .
With great ardency do I await the glorious day your kind and I shall join together once more in the spilling of infidel blood .
For as the sun and the moon must converge in an ecliptic dance , so too are our fates intertwined ...
Drat , the sender 's name is partly obscured and I can't quite make it out , kupo .
Areu ...
Areuh ...
Aaah !
The entire letter was penned on parchment so brittle , it crumbled to bits and pieces in my little hands , kupo !
* Sigh * I suppose we 'll never know who the message is from ...
Master !
I 'd like to take this opportunity to make known the collective sentiments of all mooglekind , kupo .
My epistolary expertise may pale in comparison to the writers of these letters , but the gratitude we moogles bear toward adventurers is no less genuine .
Although our small size and timid temperament prevent us from aiding you in battle , we moogles will always be there to serve our strong and stout - hearted masters to the fullest extent our abilities allow , kupo !
Happy 8th Vana'versary !

Adv. Appreciation
A 22 - year - old economics student is reported to be facing a maximum of 20 years in prison and a fine of $ 500,000 ( £ 331,000 ) after being convicted last Friday of hacking into Sarah Palin 's private Yahoo !
email account and posting some of the contents online while she was campaigning to become the Republican vice - president in 2008 .
David Kernell , a college student from Tennessee and son of a prominent local Democrat politician , was found guilty of obstruction of justice by destruction of records and a misdemeanour of unauthorised access to a computer .
Sarah Palin welcomed the conviction , posting this message on her Facebook page :
My family and I are thankful that the jury thoroughly and carefully weighed the evidence and issued a just verdict .
Besides the obvious invasion of privacy and security concerns surrounding this issue , many of us are concerned about the integrity of our country 's political elections .
America 's elections depend upon fair competition .
Violating the law , or simply invading someone 's privacy for political gain , has long been repugnant to Americans ' sense of fair play .
As Watergate taught us , we rightfully reject illegally breaking into candidates ' private communications for political intrigue in an attempt to derail an election .
The length of time that Kernell could now face in jail might seem preposterously excessive , but there is no doubt he committed a crime by guessing Palin 's password and security questions and then posting screenshots of her private emails online under the pseudonym " Rubico " .
Prosecutors claimed that Kernell was politically motivated because he had hoped to damage Palin 's campaign for vice - president by proving that she used her private email account for her state business as governor as Alaska .
Kernell 's defence attorney said his action were nothing more than a " prank " .
But let 's rewind a few months and revisit an article Palin wrote for the Washington Post before the Copenhagen conference last December about the illegally released UEA emails :
With the publication of damaging emails from a climate research centre in Britain , the radical environmental movement appears to face a tipping point .
The revelation of appalling actions by so - called climate change experts allows the American public to finally understand the concerns so many of us have articulated on this issue .
" Climategate " , as the emails and other documents from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia have become known , exposes a highly politicised scientific circle – the same circle whose work underlies efforts at the Copenhagen climate change conference .
The agenda - driven policies being pushed in Copenhagen wo n't change the weather , but they would change our economy for the worse .
The emails reveal that leading climate " experts " deliberately destroyed records , manipulated data to " hide the decline " in global temperatures , and tried to silence their critics by preventing them from publishing in peer - reviewed journals .
What 's more , the documents show that there was no real consensus even within the CRU crowd .
So , let 's get this straight : Palin is more than happy to utilise the contents of stolen emails to score political points when it suits her own cause – in this case , attacking the " radical environmental movement " – but finds it " repugnant " when her own privacy is invaded " for political gain " ?
Why was she not calling in her article for whoever stole ( hacked , leaked , whatever ) the UEA emails to face a " just " punishment instead of jumping up and down with glee at their politically convenient content ?
Hypocrisy ?
You betcha .
The story of Apple and the lost , found , sold , and possibly considered stolen iPhone has the internet abuzz .
But there are quite a few even stranger stories of people finding missing cell phones .
1. In a Bar
An Apple engineer left an iPhone G4 prototype at a bar , where it was picked up by someone else who sold it to Gizmodo , which blogged about its features way before Apple intended .
Now police are investigating and seized computers belonging to Gizmodo editor Jason Chen .
Anyone who has ever lost a phone knows how unnerving it can be .
Here are more stories of cell phones that wound up in strange places .
You may say that the Apple prototype was the most valuable , but sports fans may argue that the next phone is priceless .
2. In a Thrift Store
Dave Checketts was president and general manager of the NBA 's Utah Jazz from 1984 to 1990 .
He has also been president of the Madison Square Garden Corporation , president of the New York Knicks , and vice president for development at the NBA .
Around ten years ago , he lost his Blackberry .
Just last month , a man bought an old cell phone in a thrift store in Provo , Utah , for 50 cents .
When he charged the phone up , he was surprised to find contact information for the biggest stars in basketball and sports broadcasting , and even hockey star Wayne Gretzky !
There were also saved email messages to the mayor of Salt Lake City and the governor of Utah .
The buyer , who wishes to remain anonymous , did not call any of the stars listed in the phone , and planned to return it to Checketts .
3 . In Food
Emma Schweiger of Janesville Township , Wisconsin , opened a bag of Clancy 's Ripple Potato Chips and started eating .
She was n't looking at the bag when she reached in and felt something hard .
It was a cell phone .
The blue and silver Nokia phone contained a T - Mobile SIM card in it and grease stains on the outside .
The chips were distributed by Aldi , who removed the rest of the lot from sales and said they would investigate .
Schweiger was offered a replacement bag of chips , but passed , explaining that she 'd lost her appetite for chips for the time being .
She added that in the future , she would pour them out into a bowl before eating .

4. Inside a Fish
Andrew Cheatle was playing with his dog at a beach in England when his phone slipped out of his pocket .
He thought it was gone for good , but a week later , someone dialed his girlfriend from that phone number .
Glen Kerley of Worthing , West Sussex , had caught a 25 - pound cod and found the phone inside the fish !
He retrieved the SIM card , inserted it into a dry phone , and found Cheatle 's saved numbers .
When Cheatle retrieved the phone and dried it out , it still worked — but not perfectly .
He had the circuit board replaced and still uses the phone , which has since lost its fishy smell .
5 . In a Cab
A phone found in a taxi cab sounds like an everyday story , but in at least one case it could help convict a murderer .
Taxi driver Brian Douglas Horn was arrested in connection with the murder of 12 - year - old Justin Bloxom in Bossier Parish , Louisiana .
A cell phone found in his cab contained records of text messages that were entered as evidence that Horn lured Bloxom into the cab the night he was killed .
This is not the first time a found cell phone was used as evidence in a murder case .
6. Inside a Dog
Nero is a Great Dane - Doberman crossbreed .
The rather large dog from Pretoria , South Africa , snatched a cell phone from his owner 's daughter 's hand and swallowed it in the blink of an eye .
Nero was immediately taken to the veterinary clinic , where he was X - rayed and then had surgery to remove the phone .
The vets found stones in Nero 's stomach along with the phone .
Nero recovered , but the cell phone never worked again .
7 . In a Body Cavity
Some may say the strangest place to find a cell phone is in someone 's rectum , but this is actually pretty common .
Even death row inmates have been caught hiding cell phones in their bodies .
In one case , a prisoner had to have extensive surgery after the phone broke apart inside him .
Then there 's the story from Pakistan in which 37 prisoners were found with phones stashed in their bodies .
Seven of those men required surgery to remove them .
My children are constantly misplacing their phones , which is one reason they are required to always have them charged and turned on .
We just call them and follow the ringing !
Curiously , they are always under something they should have already looked under .
One of the groups seriously impacted by the great recession is the " pre retirement " generation - currently the " Baby Boomers " - the workers between the ages of 45 and 64 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows the unemployment rates for two groups : 45 to 54 ( seasonally adjusted ) , and 55 to 64 ( only NSA data is available ) .
The unemployment rate for these age groups hit an all time high during the great recession ( highest since WWII ) .
Michael Winerip at the NY Times has a story about the plight of several " Boomers " who he has tracked for the last year :
Time , It Turns Out , Is n’t on Their Side ( ht Ann )
A YEAR ago , I wrote about a job fair at the Sheraton in Midtown Manhattan , where over 5,000 mainly white collar , middle - aged jobless men and women waited in the cold for more than two hours , hoping to find work .
...
For that column , I interviewed two dozen boomers .
Given recent reports from the federal government and Manpower , the employment agency , that the hiring outlook is beginning to improve , I thought it would be worthwhile to go back to those highly motivated people .
...
The short answer is , of the 16 I interviewed again , 9 describe themselves as still struggling .
Eight continue to be unemployed or are working part - time jobs that pay near minimum wage .
Several were so concerned about bias , they did not want to give their ages .
...
Of the 16 , only one , Mr. Kramer , who was unemployed eight months before being hired in July as a closing manager at a Best Yet supermarket , has found a job that pays more than his old position .
More typical of the seven who ’ve found full - time work is Ben Brief , 60 , a printing supervisor , who ’d been jobless two months when I interviewed him on Sixth Avenue in the 20 - degree weather .
Mr. Brief was out of work nine more months , before finding a printing job that paid 20 percent less than his previous position .
“ I ’m glad to be working , but people know they can pay you a lot less in this economy , ” he said .
Kind of hard to sing " Yeah , time time time is on my side ... " when you are 60 and unemployed or underemployed .

Less is More –
Taming the Power of Possessions
by Wendy Priesnitz Simplicity is becoming a 21st century buzzword , a pursuit that is being promoted as a cure for everything from the housework blues and global warming to spiritual and economic malaise .
But there is no mystery to or difficulty about the concept .
Simplifying your life is about gaining control of your life – creating more time , on the job and at home , to do the things you want to do .
It ’s also about gaining control of your finances and the impact your life makes on the planet .
Surveys show that more and more people feel that they are n’t spending their time on things they enjoy .
One poll found that 65 percent of people spend their leisure time doing things they ’d prefer not to do .
And many of these people are asking what ’s the point of leading a “ full life ” if you do n't have the time and energy to enjoy it , or if it ’s degrading the environment or other people ’s quality of life ?
Simple living is about streamlining your life so you have time for the people and things you love .
It means lightening your load , digging out from under your piles of clutter , as well as the debt and over - committed time required to pay for the stuff that makes up that clutter .
Everything you own costs you something , no matter how much or little you originally paid for it .
Aside from the cost of acquisition , there are costs associated with a space to store your stuff , the energy to transport it , and your attention to deal with it .
By having only the items that you need , you 'll gain a significant cost savings by avoiding the money , space , and energy costs of clutter .

Everything you own costs you something , no matter how much or little you originally paid for it .
Aside from the cost of acquisition , there are costs associated with a space to store your stuff , the energy to transport it , and your attention to deal with it .
If the opportunity to rediscover the richness of daily life does n’t make you want to start cleaning out closets , consider the economy .
Cutting back on spending on material goods and learning how to live well on less can be a sort of insurance policy in the face of an uncertain economy with the threat of job loss or falling wages .
I learned to live with fewer belongings a decade or so ago when my husband and I lived in another part of the world for a year - and - a - half .
Virtually all of our possessions went into storage ( after we purged quite a bit in order not to pay for storing things we did n’t need ) .
After a few months away , I started to forget exactly what we owned , let alone miss it .
When we finally returned home , we got rid of a lot more stuff , and left some of it in boxes for months after moving into our new home .
But once you ’re hooked on having lots of possessions , simplifying what you have can seem overwhelming .
Begin the process in one small part of your home , such as a closet or a corner of the basement or attic .
Examine each item you own and ask yourself if you really need it .
Ask yourself these three questions about each item :
Have I used this item recently ?
Will this item help me attain my life goals ?
Do I need to own this item or can I rent or borrow it ?
( Note that sentimental keepsakes you ca n’t bear to part with such as family photo albums or antique heirlooms , or beautiful pieces of art that bring joy to your life could fall under the second question , since they can fulfill an important emotional function along life ’s path ; just do n’t fall into the trap of keeping everything under the rationalization of nostalgia ! )
My rule of thumb is that if I have n’t used or looked at it in six months , I do n’t need or want it .
Other criteria to help you decide whether or not to pitch or save involves how you use the item in question .
Does it help you be more active , self - reliant , creative and social ?
Or does it promote passivity , dependence and alienation ?
Sort things into three piles : those you want to keep ; those you want to give away , sell or recycle ; and those suited only for the garbage ( and that should n’t be very big , should it ! ) .
You might also want a pile labeled “ not sure ” .
Wait a few weeks and go through that pile again ; you might feel less attached to these items the second time around or you might decide some of them are too precious to get rid of .
Pay special attention to things that are useful , but not in the quantity you have accumulated .
Examples from my home are five saucepans and four frying pans ; at least 100 pens ; four radios ( two of which do n’t work ) ; innumerable clocks and watches ; eight pairs of shoes ; four winter coats ... you get the idea .
Simple living is not about austerity or frugality ( although those traits can be important to some people ) .
It ’s about thoughtfulness and awareness , about not using more resources than you need to , about having the time to do what is really important to you .
Once you have simplified your possessions , examine ways not to re-acquire them .
If you thought you needed a bigger house , an addition to your garage , more shelves in the basement , or a remodeled kitchen with more cupboards , maybe having less stuff will eliminate that need .
If you are serious about simpler living , you ’ll likely have to change your shopping style .
Avoid compulsive buying at all costs .
One technique is to write down the name of an item that you think you simply must have , then wait for a month .
If you still want or need it at that time , go ahead and buy it .
You may find that you wo n’t be able to remember why you were so excited about the item in the first place !
Keep in mind that simple living is not about austerity or frugality ( although those traits can be important to some people ) .
It ’s about thoughtfulness and awareness , about not using more resources than you need to , about having the time to do what is really important to you .
If you truly need to acquire something , consider buying used .
If buying new , look for quality and durability , as well as standard , simple technology .
Avoid the latest fads , and shun equipment that locks you into expensive or hard - to - find replacement parts .
Buy compatible items in terms of style and color ( my wardrobe is all one color for this reason ) .
For most families , a second car is an unnecessary luxury – one which guzzles money , time and natural resources , in addition to contributing to global warming .
If you live in the city , consider getting by with no car at all .
Use public transit and pedal power .
For much less than the cost of buying and maintaining a car , you can rent a vehicle when you need one , and it will be suited to the task at hand , into the bargain .
Or join one of the many car sharing co-ops that are being formed in urban areas .
The borrow or rent principle works for other things too .
Do you have to own every book you read , or could you borrow them from the library ?
Do you need a fully stocked home workshop , or could you rent what you need ?
Or consider sharing ownership of big items like a lawnmower or mulcher with neighbors ; that ’s not only a great way to minimize possessions but an effective way of building community .
When you ’re so busy living your life , paying for and managing your possessions , it becomes impossible to imagine anything different .
But once you take some time to get rid of possessions that you do n’t use but that take up space , you will probably start thinking about simplifying other aspects of your life too – moving into a smaller home , simplifying your social life , your volunteer schedule , your finances and eventually your career .
Our lives can be cluttered by possessions that are no longer meaningful .
They can also be cluttered by social activities that are attended simply to be polite or out of duty , relationships that no longer work , or household and other duties that have lost meaning or purpose in our lives .
So why not begin to simplify now ?

Want to improve your guitar technique , play guitar clean and eliminate sloppy playing & unwanted string noise ?
You are not alone .
Sloppy guitar technique is a very common problem that often makes our playing sound a lot worse than it actually is .
Fortunately , it ’s quite easy to fix sloppy guitar playing ( even if you ’ve tried to improve your skills in the past but struggled to do so ) .
You do n’t need any special exercises to improve your guitar technique .
Cleaning up your guitar technique is about 3 things :
Focused Awareness .
This means seeing , hearing and feeling any imperfections in your guitar technique .
Picking Articulation .
This is the first half of your 2 - hand synchronization .
It means clearly articulating the notes you want to hear at the exact moment you want to hear them .
The Release .
This is the second half of your 2 - hand synchronization .
It means releasing the string after playing a note without any bleeding , scratches or open string noise .

Here is how to use these 3 things to fix to a common problem most guitarists struggle with ( notes bleeding together instead of sounding separately ) .
Check out this video to learn how to easily eliminate this issue from your technique :
Here is a deeper look at the 3 elements that help you clean up your guitar playing :
Focused Awareness -
The first step to cleaning up sloppy guitar playing is to identify what guitar technique imperfections are holding you back .
Many guitar players are not fully aware of every flaw in their technique .
You might sense that something does n't sound quite right , but are not sure exactly what your specific guitar technique challenges are .
Here are good ways to fix this :
1. Record yourself playing a guitar technique you want to improve .
Listen back ( carefully ) at 25%- 33 % speed .
Listen for any unclear notes , excess string noise , scratchy noises between the notes , sloppy 2 - hand synchronization or inconsistencies in your pick attack .
Do your best to keep track of :
What your sloppy guitar playing mistakes are , and
What notes they happen on .
Make a list of those things , so you know exactly what stands in the way of you playing guitar clean .
You may or may not be able to hear everything on your own ( many people simply ca n’t yet ) .
You also may not be able to correctly identify the cause of each imperfection present in your guitar technique .
If you ’re not sure how to do this step , then …
2 . Work with an expert guitar teacher .
A great guitar teacher can evaluate your playing and give you useful and unbiased feedback about your guitar technique .
Use your teachers ’ feedback to clean up your guitar playing and improve your guitar technique .
A good guitar teacher not only tells you what to do to play guitar clean , but should also notice problems that you may not really be hearing when you play guitar .
More importantly , a great teacher understands the root causes of the problem and knows how to prioritize which problems to fix first , second , third , etc .
This is very useful in order to help you improve your guitar technique fast .
A master guitar teacher also shows you easy tricks that make your guitar playing sound better while you are working to overcome your guitar technique challenges .
( Want to learn a few such guitar tricks right now ?

IF you have an excellent ear , you should be able to identify the fine details of your problem yourself .
If not , work with your guitar teacher .
Articulation - The First Half Of 2 - Hand Synchronization
The second step to improve your guitar technique is to focus on your articulation .
Articulation is the first half of 2 - hand synchronization .
To play guitar clean you need your hands to fret and pick each note at precisely the same time ( simultaneously ) .
There are 3 critical things you need to do to improve your guitar technique articulation :
Use a clean guitar tone when practicing ( no distortion and NO effects ! ) .
Distortion and effects mask any imperfections in your articulation , so do not practice with them when focusing on " Articulation " .
( The rules will change when we talk about " The Release " in the next section . )
Play loud enough so that you can truly hear what is happening as you play .
Tip : an easy way to make your playing louder is to dig the pick a little bit deeper into the strings .
This improves your guitar playing articulation without using more force from your picking hand .
Watch this video to see how digging the pick deeper into the strings makes your guitar playing sound better right away :
Question : “ But Tom Hess , I tried digging the pick deeper into the strings and I can’t play as fast as before !
What should I do ? ”
Answer :
Make sure you are not digging the pick into the strings too much .
1 / 4 of an inch is more than enough to produce a very loud note .
Also , angle the pick between 20 - 30 degrees towards the head of the guitar ( where the tuning pegs are ) .
This allows the pick to cut through the string like a knife , so you can play very fast with powerful articulation .
See the photo that shows how much you should angle your pick .
Note : do n't angle the pick more than 30 degrees .
This creates a very sloppy , scratchy sound ( especially on the thicker , wound strings ) .
When you are practicing something slowly , do NOT change ANYTHING about how you approach and articulate each note .
Most guitar players actually play very differently when playing slow compared to playing fast .
This is a big mistake .

If you change anything in the way you are articulating the notes , such as :
playing guitar with a lighter touch ,
using a weaker or stronger pick attack ,
changing your hand position ,
changing your pick angle ,
changing the fretting hand fingering ,
... you will NOT fully improve your guitar technique .
This is because the sound you make when playing will be different , making it harder to detect and identify any problems with your articulation .
The Release - The Second Half Of 2 - Hand Synchronization
The third step toward clean guitar playing is the release of the note you are playing .
For most guitar players , the release is the hardest problem to detect and correct .
This happens for 2 reasons :
Reason # 1 : Once guitar players articulate a note cleanly , they often ignore what immediately comes after ( either a small sloppy noise at the end of the note , or the end of a note slightly bleeding together with the start of the next note ) .
Reason # 2 : The noises between notes are very hard to hear .
This is true when you practice your guitar with a clean tone ( no distortion ) .
Playing guitar with a clean tone almost always masks problems in the release phase of playing a note .
This is why many people think their guitar playing sounds pretty clean when practicing without distortion , but sense something is wrong when they later play with distortion .
You might not be sure what the problem is … or worse , you do not hear the problem at all ( but other people do ) .
This is why focused awareness is so critical .
I use multiple steps to help my guitar students fully solve this problem ( not all of them can be fully demonstrated in an article ) .
That said , here are the absolutely necessary steps toward correcting problems with the release of a note .
Practice your guitar with distortion ( but NO EFFECTS ! ) now .
( Notice , this is the exact opposite of the advice I gave you about identifying articulation problems earlier in the article . )
Play your guitar at a loud enough volume to hear precisely what is coming out of your amplifier .
( Other noises in the room can mask the subtle things you need to be listening for . )
Practice slow ( but do NOT change ANYTHING in the way you articulate OR RELEASE a note compared to when you play guitar fast ! ) .
Listen carefully for any subtle noises in between your notes ( you will probably notice a scratchy sound just before you play the next note ) .
If you have a hard time hearing anything , record yourself and listen back to the recording at 1/2 , 1/3 or 1/4 of the speed ( I guarantee you will hear this short scratchy sound now ! ) .
Now that you know what mistakes to listen for , you will probably notice them all the time , whenever you listen very carefully .
You are now ready to begin correcting the problem …

How To Prevent Your Guitar Playing From Sounding Sloppy During The Release Of A Note :
There can be several reasons why your guitar playing is not clean during the release of a note .
The most common reason is this :
When you release a note , your brain is probably telling your finger to lift off ( make an upward motion away from the string you just played ) .
This can cause all sorts of nasty guitar technique problems ( fatigue , slower guitar playing speeds , and sloppy guitar playing ) .
The solution is to stop your brain from sending your fingers instructions to lift off of each note .
Instead , you want your brain to send a message to simply relax .
When your finger relaxes , it will naturally , immediately and effortlessly release the note you just played .
There are 2 main benefits to this :
Because the motion is now effortless , you can play guitar faster and for a much longer time ( and most importantly ) with greater ease .
Because your brain does not give the finger the instruction to make a ‘ lift off ’ motion , this actually prevents your finger from moving prematurely .
This is a major cause of the sloppy scratchy sound that may be present in your guitar playing .
Does n't it feel good to realize that you CAN improve your guitar technique and clean up sloppy guitar playing ?
Of course it wo n’t happen over night .
It will take some time and consistent practice .
But the benefits of being able to play guitar clean are well worth the patience required .

' This is without doubt the worst environmental disaster in our history , ' White House environmental adviser Carol Browner said Sunday .
W.H. : Ca n't trust BP on spill size
The Obama administration is adopting an increasingly confrontational approach with BP — accusing company executives of intentionally underestimating the scale of the Gulf oil spill to spare themselves billions in fines .
The White House , under withering fire for not pressuring the oil company more forcefully in the 40 days since the oil well blowout that led to the still - gushing spill , is stressing a new take - charge stance , revealing Sunday that it pressured BP into drilling a second relief well , which could stop the flow — in August .
Advertisement
“ BP has a financial interest … They will ultimately pay a fine on those [ spill ] rates , ” said Obama environmental adviser Carol Browner , director of Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy , speaking on CBS 's “ Face the Nation ” on Sunday .
“ BP has a vested financial interest in downplaying the size of this . ”
“ This is without doubt the worst environmental disaster in our history , ” Browner said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House environment committee , went even further , suggesting BP might have criminal liability for its actions since the April 20 sinking of its Deepwater Horizon platform .
“ The fine that can be imposed upon them is based on how many barrels [ leak out ] ; it could wind up in billions of dollars of fines , ” said Markey .
“ Their focus was not completely on the livability of the Gulf ; they had a stake in low - balling the number right from the beginning …
They were either lying or they were incompetent . ”
The White House has become increasingly angry with BP , which initially assured administration officials the spill would be no greater than 1,000 barrels per day ; estimates now range from 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day .
And Obama ’s team was incensed that the company kept them in the dark for a half - day last week after suspending their unsuccessful “ Top Kill ” efforts to plus the leak with mud and dross .
Yet even as the administration ramped up response efforts — which includes dispatching senior officials back to the Gulf for another round of visits next week —
Browner was the only top Obama adviser to take to the Sunday airwaves .
As it has several times since the April 20 oil well blowout that caused the spill , the White House took a back seat to BP on the Sunday shows , forcing company officials to defend themselves hours after announcing the failure of its highly touted “ Top Kill ” capping procedure .
BP Managing Director Bob Dudley , looking dejected , appeared on several networks , saying that he still believed the spill estimate was on the low side of the new estimated range — which would still be more than double the oil giant ’s recent estimates of 5,000 barrels a day — and stressing the company ’s determination to stop the spill as quickly as possible .
Dudley told Candy Crowley on CNN's " State of the Union " he was optimistic the new attempt to cap the well with a revamped five - story containment structure would capture a “ majority ” of the gusher .
And he maintained that a precursor to the plan — severing the kinked underwater pipe with diamond saws — could actually increase the flow of crude into the Gulf .
" If we can contain the flow of the well between now and August [ when a permanent relief well is completed ] , that ’s also a good outcome , " he said .
" That ’s not a bad outcome compared to where we are today . "
“ I think the engineering on this is more simple than the top kill , ” Dudley said on NBC .
But Browner , who has quarterbacked the White House response along with Homeland Security Adviser John Brennan , questioned that claim , saying experts told her there was actually a risk that the effort could make matters worse .
“ It is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August , ” she said , adding that experts have told her that removing a “ kink ” in the pipe could result in the release of “ as much as 20 percent more oil … for a period of four to seven days . ”
The back and forth took place as Louisiana officials continue to criticize the White House for what they say has been a sluggish response to protecting the state ’s fragile , oil - soaked coastline , a major habitat for fish and birds — whose bodies have been washing up in the brown tide by the thousands .
Gov. Bobby Jindal ( R ) told Jake Tapper on ABC ’s “ This Week ” that Coast Guard officials , who have been leading the federal response effort , seemed to be finally getting the message after weeks of what he described as foot - dragging .
Wednesday of this week , local Coast Guard officials told us we do n't have the personnel or the resources we need to get the job done here in Louisiana , ” Jindal said .
“ The next day I talked to the admiral .
He told me that we would see a significant improvement and difference literally in terms of tens of thousands of feet of hard boom , more personnel .
And so , we are supposed to be seeing an influx of resources . ”
He added : “ As I told the president , for us , it 's trust but verify .
You know , it 's that old saying that we 've heard promises , we want to see that happen on the ground . ”
Obama ally Colin Powell was equally pointed , lauding the president for staying on top of the spill — but chiding him for failing to project leadership and sympathy for the people in the Gulf region .
" I think the president correctly said the other day that he 's been monitoring and following and has essentially been on top of it from the beginning , but that impression was not conveyed to the American people , and the comprehensive speech he gave the other day I think he would have been better served and the nation would have been better served if he had given it a few weeks earlier , ” Powell told Tapper .
" I have watched a number of these kinds of crises come and go … and in every instance what I have sort of learned from all these is that the national government the federal government , the president has to get involved as quickly as possible , ” he added .
“ If you do n’t , public opinion starts to drag you , the media pushes you . ”
Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) , speaking on CNN , said it was " ludicrous " that the Army Corps of Engineers had , until recently , green - lighted only about 2 percent of the sand barriers requested by local officials to divert the ever - growing spill .
Yet even Vitter — an oil industry booster who 's received some of the lowest ratings from environmental groups of any legislator — turned up the heat on BP , saying the company " made enormous mistakes and probably cut corners . "
Dudley also said he does n't believe BP took risky short cuts in dealing with the well , even though it has been reported that the company chose a cheaper and potentially riskier casing for the well .
" I do n't believe they did , " he said .
Dudley also said that the company 's CEO , Tony Hayward , is doing a " fantastic job " and deserves to keep his post .
" Tony Hayward has been here since the very beginning , ” Dudley said on NBC .
In the “ very early days , he said we 're not going to stand behind statutory limits of liability .
We 're going to take full responsibility for it .
We 're going to make good for it .
We 've spent nearly $ 1 billion on this cleanup effort .
I think he 's done a great job of leading a company to stand up and do the right thing . "
But on “ Fox News Sunday , ” Dudley said the company is n’t passing any blame for the spill — “ yet , ” suggesting that the long - running feud between BP and its contractors over who is responsible for the initial explosion and the consequent environmental disaster is likely to continue for quite some time .
" We ’ve had this accident in the Gulf , which we ’re taking full responsibility for .
We ’re not blaming anyone yet for it , " Dudley said .
" The investigation of this will determine the causes .
…
Everyone 's going to step back and learn from this . "
Vitter said that BP , which withheld news that " Top Kill " was failing even as Coast Guard officials were expressing opposition , needed to provide " real - time " updates on progress or lack thereof .
" I do n’t think they have been transparent enough , real time enough , " he said .
" Why are n’t we knowing all the facts ... real time ?
Why does n’t BP and the federal government give an hourly report ? "
Browner , for her part , promised greater federal accountability and transparency .
" We are prepared for the worst .
We have been prepared from the beginning .
We will continue to assume that we move into the worst - case scenario , which is , as you point out , is there is some oil leaking up to the surface and then onto the beaches and shorelines , ” Browner said .
“ We will continue to prepare for that . "
But she also stressed that BP was answering to government officials , pointing to the decision to drill two relief wells rather than one , and government scientists ' insistence that BP was putting too much downward pressure into the well during its failed " top kill " effort .
" Do n't make any mistake here , " Browner said on NBC .
" The government is in charge . "
Elaine Joyce , a champion amateur golfer , made a federal case of being barred from playing in a 2007 men ’s tournament at Dennis Pines Golf Course , where she is a longtime member .
She sued the town of Dennis , Mass . , and others in 2008 .
Last week , the United States District Court in Boston , in a rare federal ruling involving a town , its public golf course and an accusation centering on sex discrimination , told her she had won .
Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton ruled that a municipality and its public golf course were liable under federal equal - protection laws if they engaged in sex discrimination through policy , conduct or custom .
“ It has been kind of a lonely road as far as support from other people , men or women , ” Joyce , 45 , said in a telephone interview .
“ For me , this decision means encouragement that I was right , and it certainly upheld what I took the law to mean .
Hopefully , that prevents other women from having to go through this . ”
Gorton said that his decision did not require all public courses to conduct only coed tournaments .
He stated that when a town ’s golf officials “ draw a clear distinction based upon gender and their only explanation is to deny that any distinction existed , they will not prevail . ”
He said the burden was with the club ’s officials “ to justify their conduct , and they have not done so . ”
As for the idea of sin : I never got the impression we were meant to obsess over our own sins to the point of grief .
Rather , I got the impression that we are to acknowledge our sins and try to overcome them .
But if we can't , do n't fret it !
We 're human after all .
The fact that a person is aware of his sins already puts that person in a league far ahead of the person who is reckless and careless towards himself and those around him .
Warner Bros. has been sued by a German technology firm which claims the movie and television production company pirated its anti-piracy technology .
German firm Medien Patent Verwaltung claims that in 2003 , it revealed a new kind of anti-piracy technology to Warner Bros .
that marks films with specific codes so pirated copies can be traced back to their theaters of origin .
But like a great , hilariously - ironic DRM Ouroborus , the company claims that Warner began using the system throughout Europe in 2004 but has n't actually paid a dime for it .
" We disclosed our anti-piracy technology to Warner Bros. in 2003 at their request , under strict confidentiality , expecting to be treated fairly , " the company said in a statement .
" Instead , they started using our technology extensively without our permission and without any accounting to us . "
Medien Patent Verwaltung originally claimed that Warner was infringing on patent 7,187,633 , called " Motion Picture and Anti-Piracy Coding , " but as The Hollywood Reporter discovered , the patent going by that particular name actually bears a different number and is held by none other than Warner Bros .
MPV's attorney in New York acknowledged the error and said that the suit will be refiled with the proper information .
Which has no bearing on the question at hand : Is Warner Bros. using pirated anti-piracy technology ?
This one could be fun to watch .
Stanley Fish has an astute analysis of last week ’s Supreme Court decision in Salazar v. Buono .
By a 5 - 4 decision , the Court disagreed with a federal judge ’s ruling that Congress promoted religion in a battle to prevent the removal of a 8 - foot - high cross standing in Mojave National Preserve .
The cross was erected in 1934 by the Veterans of Foreign Wars to commemorate American soldiers who had died in World War I .
In 2002 , a retired Park Service employee filed suit on the basis that the cross was an establishment of religion .
In order to keep the cross standing , Congress approved a swap , donating the cross and the land on which it stands to the VFW in exchange for another piece of property .
The District Court ruled that the “ the transfer was an attempt by the Government to keep the cross atop Sunrise Rock and so was invalid . ”
But in order to sell their case that the religious symbol — in this case the symbol of Christ ’s sacrifice and crucifixion on which Christianity is based — does n’t violate the First Amendment Establishment Clause , government attorneys had to first deny the symbol has religious meaning .
As Fish warns , it ’s a dangerous game :
It has become a formula : if you want to secure a role for religious symbols in the public sphere , you must de-religionize them , either by claiming for them a non-religious meaning as Kennedy does here , or , in the case of multiple symbols in a park or in front of a courthouse , by declaring that the fact of many of them means that no one of them is to be taken seriously ; they do n’t stand for anything sectarian ; they stand for diversity .
So you save the symbols by leeching the life out of them .
The operation is successful , but the patient is dead .
These kinds of cases are always intractably messy because they essentially pit the First Amendment ’s two clauses dedicated to religion against each other :
But that is what the religion clause drives you to when in one of its clauses — the free exercise clause — it singles out religion for special positive treatment , and in the other clause — the Establishment Clause — it places a warning label ( watch out for this stuff ; it ’s trouble ) on religion .
It ’s no wonder that the justices who try to deal with this schizophrenia tie themselves in knots and produce opinions that are as unedifying as they are disingenuous .
While I do n’t necessarily agree with all his points , I kinda like the way Alan Shore on Boston Legal points it :
Pam Robson was told she had cleaned up after the wrong dog A Wearside great - grandmother has won her fight against a £ 50 fine for picking up the wrong dog mess .
Pam Robson was accused by Sunderland Council wardens of failing to clean up after Derik , her Labrador , in a field in Houghton - le - Spring in January .
The council said the 60 - year - old had picked up mess from a different dog .
When she refused to pay a fixed penalty notice she was threatened with court action , but after speaking to her MP and a solicitor the case was dropped .
Mrs Robson , or Thurlow Way , Houghton - le - Spring , said she had been talking to her daughter on her mobile phone when her dog ran off and relieved itself .
After she cleared up she was approached by two men , one wearing a city council jerkin .
It felt like the worst kind of bullying
Pam Robson
She said : " He said it was the wrong mess and that he was going to issue me with a fine for £ 50 .
" I picked up the other mess too and put it in the bag but he said I 'd still be fined . "
Later she received a £ 50 fixed penalty notice threatening court action and a criminal record if she did not pay .
" It felt like the worst kind of bullying , " she said .
" I felt as if my integrity was being questioned , so I wrote to my MP , Fraser Kemp , and also went to see a solicitor .
" He told me to let the council take it to court and then we 'd show them up for how ridiculous it was . "
Sunderland City Council then wrote to Mrs Robson , saying : " Officers at the time were satisfied that an offence had been committed .
" However it appears you may have collected faeces belonging to another dog .
" I have considered your appeal regarding this offence , and can advise that on this occasion the council will not be pursuing the non payment of the fixed penalty notice in the magistrates courts . "

Beretta 92FS / M9 Frame
Page 1 Page 2
For my next project , I will be doing the Beretta 92 FS frame .
For those who are n't familiar with this pistol , the above pictures will give you an idea of what it looks like .
I recently purchased a used ( police trade - in ) Beretta 92 FS pistol to use as a reference while I make the solid model of the frame .
As of right now the only references I have for this project is the pistol I bought .
I also have the drawing below , but it does n't give near enough detail .
I 'm trying to get my hands on any reference information that will help me out while I 'm working on the solid model .
So if anybody has any useful information ( blueprints , sketches , etc. ) , please let me know .
I would really appreciate any help you can give me to help this project take its first steps .
I started to work on the solid model of this project .
So far I have the rough profile of the pistol .
Below is a pic of what I have done so far .
If you have any information you can share with me on this pistol I would really appreciate it .
I now have a pretty good start on the solidmodel .
I 've been using the Co-ordinate Measuring Machine ( CMM ) at our shop to measure some of the complex hole locations and surfaces .
Below you will see how far along I am with this solidmodel .
I got some more work done on the solidmodel .
About the only thing I have left is the back of the frame where the hammer slides in .
Some of this area is pretty complex , so it 's going to take some time to get all the measurements and transfer that data to the solidmodel .
Below is what the model now looks like .
I now have the solidmodel complete !!!
I 'm going to go back and triple check all my measurements before I start the machining to insure I did n't make any mistakes .
I created a Solidworks E - drawing of this frame if any of you would like to check it out to see if I 've missed any features .
Please let me know if you find anything wrong .
The E - drawing is located under Downloads .
Below is what the final model looks like .
Since I now have the solidmodel finished of this frame , I decided to have it " printed " out on a rapid prototype machine also know as stereolithography .
You can read more about stereolithography here .
Doing this will allow me to test fit some of the parts , and insure my solidmodel is correct before I start the complicated machining process .
I 've looked the prototype part over and everything seems to be ok so far .
I 'm now getting REALLY excited about starting the machining of this frame .
Below you can see a couple pics of what the " printed " frame looks like .
This frame is made of a clear type of material so it was hard to get a good picture , but maybe you can get an idea of what it looks like .
I had to use some " silly putty " to help stand the part up for the pictures .
I cut the aluminum blocks from a 12 foot bar of 6061 - T6 aluminum we had at the shop .
The dimension of the block is 5 " x 1 ½ " x 7.760 " Below you can see a pic of my reference Beretta 92 FS frame setting on top of the aluminum block .
I stripped my Beretta 92 FS pistol down to just the bare frame , and I used it to help make the solidmodel .
I hope to be able to turn this 5.7 pound block of aluminum into a working pistol frame .
I got the 1st operation programmed for the CNC machining center .
Here is a picture of the block of material in the machine ready to be machined ...
The first tool to run was the 1/2 " hog end mill .
This tool was used to rough out most of the material .
I stopped the machine mid-way through this tool to show how much material was being removed ...
The next picture I took was after the outside profile had been roughed out .
You can see the block of material is now taking the shape of the pistol frame ...
Below is a pic after the 1/2 " hog end mill was finished roughing the frame ...
You can't really see it from the pictures , but the 1/2 " hog end mill leaves a rough surface finish on the material .
So I used a 1/ 4 " carbide end mill to make the finish passes around the frame .
I used the flash on the camera for this picture to try and show how clean the outside of the frame now looks ...
The next picture is after all the holes were drilled ...
The next tool to run was the 1/4 " ball nose carbide end mill .
This is the tool that can really turn a block of material into a work of art .
This tool profiles across the whole frame by machining square corners into smooth surfaces .
This tool takes a really long time to run because it 's machining back and forth across the frame stepping over 0.006 " each time .
This tool made a total of 1260 passes back and forth across the profile of the frame .
Below are a few pics showing what the frame looked like after this tool ...
I then ran a couple different smaller end mills to finish up some minor details and to cut the rail for where the slide will fit .
Here is what it looked like after those tools ...
That 's the end of the 1st operation .
There are some other cuts I could have made on this operation , but I 'm saving those for further down the road .
If I made some of those cuts now , it would have made the frame really weak and hard to hold onto for future operations .
I bead blasted one of the frames to reduce the glare in the next pictures .
Below are some better pics , and the last pic is showing the difference between the freshly machine frame and the one that had been bead blasted ...
I hope to find time to program and machine the 2nd operation in the next few weeks .
I found time to test fit some of the parts to the " printed " stereolithography prototype frame .
I did n't add all the parts including some of the springs because the plastic frame would n't be able to withstand the forces put forth by some of the springs .
I did n't find any problems assembling the parts to the frame , so this far everything looks good to go .
Below are some pretty cool pics of how the clear plastic frame looks with the parts assembled ...
I got the 2nd operation machined .
I had to make a special fixture plate to hold the frame flat and square while I done the machining .
I designed the fixture plate so I could use it for both the left and right machining processes .
I also made the plate to where it would touch as many surfaces as possible , so it would help keep the frame level during the machining process .
Below you can see what the fixture plate looks like ...
After I got the fixture plate machined , it was time to start machining the 2nd operation on the frame .
Below you can see what the plate looked like in the vise before I clamped in the pistol frame ...
I then clamped the frame in the vise and used a machinist level to make sure the frame was flat in both the " X " and " Y " directions .
The plate worked perfectly , because everything came out exactly level .
Below you can see what the frame looked like before I started the machining process ...
First I used a 1/2 " hog end mill to cut around the outside of the frame to remove the slab of material left over from the 1st operation .
Here you can see what it looked like with the slab removed ...
Next , I used a 3 " shell mill to bring the frame to the correct thickness .
I stopped the shell mill while it was cutting to take a picture to show exactly what it was doing .
You can see this picture below and also the picture after the shell mill was finished cutting ...
Then I used the 1/2 " hog end mill again to rough most of the material away so I could run the 3 - D profiling process at a faster feed rate .
Here 's a pic of what it looked like after this tool ran again ...
Now for the fun part , to give the frame some curves and shapes ..
To do this , I used a 1/ 4 " ball nose carbide end mill running at 10,000 RPM and 125 IPM ( inches per minute ) with a 0.006 " step over .
This is the same process I used for 3 - D profiling the 1st operation .
Below are some pics after this tool ran ...
Click this link or on the picture below to watch a short video of the 3 - D profiling process .
You can see from the video that the profiling process can take a long time .
Each time the tool goes across the frame , it steps over 0.006 "
Then machines back across the frame , and steps over 0.006 " again .
It keeps machining back and forth until it reaches the end of the frame , making a total of about 1,300 passes .
I looked back at the program to see how long it was , and for the whole 2nd operation , the program is 58,976 lines long !!!
Good thing I did n't have to program each line by hand .
Next I used a 1/4 " carbide end mill to mill the slot for the slide release and to contour around the grip screw bosses .
I also contoured the relief hole for the hammer pin hole .
Here 's what it looks like now ...
Then I used a 3/32 " carbide end mill to cut the slide rails and to cut the relief for the trigger pin hole ...
The last thing to do was to drill the hole for the slide release lever .
Below are the pics after the 2nd operation was finished ...
I bead blasted the frame and took some better pics to show exactly what has been done this far .
Below are a couple pics to show how the fixture plate can support the pistol frame on both the left and right side ...
Here are a couple close up pics of the frame ...
Below you can see how I am able to slide the slide on the pistol frame .
Of course I can't slide it all the way back yet , because the top of the frame has n't been machined .
My plan for the next operation is to cut the top of the frame .
Hopefully , this will allow me to test fit the slide with the barrel in place .
I got the fixture plates made for the 3rd operation .
I will be able to use it for the 3rd operation as well as the operation where I stand the frame on end to machine down inside the dust cover .
The fixture plates have 2 bosses on each side to align the frame on the fixture .
This will insure the frame is setting exactly square in the vise when I start the machining .
Below are a few pics of what the fixture plates look like ...
I got the 3rd operation machined .
For the 3rd operation I had to do something I 've never done before .
I had to make a special broaching tool and try to broach on the CNC machining center .
I needed to use a broach to cut the corners square where the trigger falls in the frame .
Those corners are n't that big of a deal , since I could just file them square with a hand file like I 've done in the past with other frames , so the real reason why I needed the broach was to cut the ramp inside the frame where the bottom of the barrel locking block rides up .
Since I was going to make a broach tool , I wanted to make sure I could use it in more than one place .
So for this operation I used it to cut the ramp , and to also cut the corners where the trigger falls through .
I will also be using it on one more operation , it 'll be the operation where I make the relief cuts for the hammer slot .
Before you try to use a broach on a CNC machining center , you have to make sure the spindle will lock in position , so there is zero rotation of the tool in the machine .
Come to find out , broaching is no easy task on a CNC machining center .
Not only do you have to make your own special broach , you have to make a program with a tool that does n't necessarily cut on center .
By this I mean , when you grind the tool , you try your best to make sure the tool is on center , but it can be off a little bit because of how many times you have to flip and rotate the broach tool on the surface grinder .
And something that did n't help the situation was the fact that I 'm not a tool & die maker , and I 've never made a broach tool before .
I started out with a piece of 3/8 " square A2 tool steel blank .
I first set the blank up on the surface grinder to grind the end round , so I could have a round shank to hold on to in the CNC machining center .
Then I set the blank up to grind a 15 degree angle on the end of the tool , this will be the main cutting edge .
Next I ground a 7 degree relief cut on the front and sides of the tool .
And finally I ground the back of the broach flat so it would have clearance inside the trigger hole in the frame .
I have no idea if those are the correct angles for broaching aluminum , but they looked good when I modeled it up in Solidworks , and it ended up broaching perfectly .
I left a 0.125 " step where the square part of the broach meets the round part .
I done this so the tool would n't be trying to slide up inside the holder while I was broaching .
After I had the broach made , I wanted to heat treat it so it would last a long time .
Before heat treat , the steel was something like a hardness of Rockwell C30 .
After I finished heat treating the broach , it was Rockwell C62 .
Below are a few pics of what the broach tool looked like after it was finished ...
Now that I had the hard part finished , it was time to start cutting some aluminum .
I used some 4 " tall steel jaws to help hold the fixture plates and the frame in the vise .
I also used a c-clamp to hold the top of the vise tight , since using tall jaws usually makes the top of the jaws spring open when you try to clamp on a part .
Below you can see what the setup looked like at the start of this operation ...
I first used a 1/ 4 " carbide end mill to mill out the dust cover area , the trigger area , the slide release area , and also the hammer slot in the back of the frame .
Here 's what it looked like after that tool ran ...
Next I used a 1/4 " ball nose carbide end mill to 3 -d profile the dust cover and the rest of the frame ...
Then I used a 1/8 " carbide end mill to mill the slot where the hammer release lever and firing pin catch lever falls into place .
I also used this tool to clean up the corners down inside the frame where the trigger will fall in .
This will allow me to only broach out 1/16 " worth of material instead of 1/8 " worth of material that was left behind by the 1/4 " end mill .
Here 's what it looked like after those areas were cut ...
I also used the 1/8 " carbide end mill to mill two ramps on each side of the frame .
In the pic below you can see the arrow pointing to the area that was cut .
After the 1/8 " end mill , I used a 5/16 " x 0.060 " woodruff cutter to cut the undercut for where the lugs on the barrel locking block slides into the frame ...
Now it was time for the fun part .
It was time to see if my broach tool would work .
After I had the broach in a tool holder , I had to make sure it was square with the machine .
To do this , I locked the spindle in position so the tool would n't turn .
Then I took the tool down to right in front of the vise jaw .
At this point the spindle was locked , and I had the broach loose in the tool holder so I could turn it .
I kept stepping the tool forward and wiggling the broach until the broach was within about a thousandth of the vise jaw .
Then I tightened the broach in the tool holder .
So now the broach was exactly square with the vise jaw which meant it was square with the machine .
When I programmed the broaching tool path on the computer , I programmed it from the corner of the tool .
It would be hard to find the exact center of the broach compared to the tool holder , so it was easier to just program it from the corner .
To find the corner , I jogged the machine to the front and then the side of the vise jaw .
I knew where the exact corner was of the vise jaw , so after I touched off on the front and the side of the broach on these surfaces , I could then calculate the where the corner of the tool was in relation to the tool holder center .
Getting all of this setup was a lot of work , so after this operation I left the broach in the tool holder so I could use it on the operation where I 'll be broaching the area for the hammer slot .
I broached the left side of the trigger hole and the barrel locking block ramp , then I told the machine to rotate the tool 180 degrees and lock the spindle in again so I could broach the right side of the trigger hole .
To broach the trigger hole , the broach only had to make a up and down movement .
But to broach the angle , I had to not only program the broach where it would go up and down , I had to also program it where the broach would come down as it was also moving left to right .
Below are a couple pics of what the broach looked like before it started broaching .
In these pics , the broach is set to cut the left side of the trigger hole and the ramp ...
I shot a short video to show the exact movements the broach was taking as it was cutting the barrel locking ramp .
Click on this link or on the picture below to view the video ...
The broach tool ended up working perfectly .
I was really happy with the results of the first time I tried to make a broaching tool and broaching on a CNC machining center .
I took some better pics to show what the frame now looks like .
I also took a couple close up shots to show exactly what this operation done ...
I was excited to see how the slide and barrel fit in the frame , so I got some parts together and tested it out .
Below you can see what it looks like ...
So far everything is fitting perfectly .
I can't wait to get this thing finished and take it out for the first test shots .
That 's it for the 3rd operation .
The next operation I 'll be standing the frame on end , and machining down inside the dust cover so the guide rod and spring can slide in .

Hours before its arrival , the foreign minister lashes out at the Gaza flotilla .
Avigdor Lieberman said Friday afternoon that " the flotilla is an attempt at violent propaganda against Israel , and Israel will not allow a violation of its sovereignty at sea , in the air , or on land . "
Lieberman , who spoke during a visit to the Forgein Ministry 's situation room , added , " There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza , and despite the Hamas leadership 's war crimes and rocket fire , Israel is conducting itself in the most humanitarian manner , and is allowing the entrance of thousands of tons of food and equipment to Gaza . "
Summer Camp Gaza activists : Israel to put us in concentration camp Attila Somfalvi Free Gaza organizers say they are on schedule despite Cyprus ' refusal to allow them into its waters .
' People of Gaza are in concentration camp , we will also be placed in one if detained , ' leader says Gaza activists : Israel to put us in concentration camp
Meanwhile , in Gaza , Palestinians are preparing for the arrival of the ships .
Palestinian and Turkish flags have been hung at several locations across the Strip .
As the Free Gaza ships made their way to the shores of the Strip on Friday morning , the organizers broadcast live footage from one of the ships .
Moments after the footage was published on Ynet , the number of viewers tripled , and the organizers replaced the live feed with propaganda films displaying images from Gaza during Operation Cast Lead .
Minutes later , the broadcast from the ship was renewed .
The Israel Defense Forces said they would block access to the live footage as the ships near the shores of Gaza , meaning a takeover of the ships will be done secretly .
Before the live feed was replaced with the propaganda , a camera was planted on one of the ships broadcasting activity on it .
Flags of Algeria , Turkey , Sweden , Ireland and the Palestinian Authority could be seen in the background .
Turkish could occasionally be heard being spoken , and several of the activists could be seen looking to the waters of the Mediterranean and taking pictures .
A calm atmosphere was seen in the footage , with mattresses on the deck and occasional announcements to the passengers in Turkish .
On Thursday , the Israeli Navy prepared for the expected encounter with the aid flotilla making its way to Gaza .
IDF sources said they were concerned that terrorists may try to use the " Freedom Flotilla " to enter the Strip or smuggle in weapons .
In response to the reemergence of strains in U.S. dollar short - term funding markets in Europe , the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank , the Federal Reserve , and the Swiss National Bank are announcing the reestablishment of temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap facilities .
These facilities are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in U.S. dollar funding markets and to prevent the spread of strains to other markets and financial centers .
The Bank of Japan will be considering similar measures soon .
Central banks will continue to work together closely as needed to address pressures in funding markets .
Federal Reserve Actions
The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements ( swap lines ) with the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , and the Swiss National Bank .
The arrangements with the Bank of England , the ECB , and the Swiss National Bank will provide these central banks with the capacity to conduct tenders of U.S. dollars in their local markets at fixed rates for full allotment , similar to arrangements that had been in place previously .
The arrangement with the Bank of Canada would support drawings of up to $ 30 billion , as was the case previously .
These swap arrangements have been authorized through January 2011 .
Further details on these arrangements will be available shortly .

AS TEMPERATURES plummet , lotus leaves can remain surprisingly free of frost .
Their secret , which turns out to be related to their water - repelling properties , could be applied to building frost - repelling materials .
Water droplets roll off lotus leaves partly because of the roughness of their surface on the nanoscale .
The irregularities trap air beneath any water droplets on the surface , preventing them from making contact .
Artificial surfaces with similar properties are equally water - repellent , and also resist frost formation .
Now Yanlin Song and his team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing , have shown …

US scientists believe hearing your mother 's voice on the telephone has same stress - busting effect as a cuddle
Children know that mum's got the words when life seems to be getting too much .
Now it seems her voice on the phone can work the same soothing magic as when she is there to give her offspring a comforting cuddle .
US scientists believe hearing mother down the line produces the same stress - busting effect on her daughter as physical contact such as a hug or a loving arm round the shoulder .
In a study that will send phone companies into their own comfort zone , researchers found mothers ' calls released similar levels of the social bonding hormone oxytocin in girls as when they were in close proximity .
Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , the scientists report how they deliberately raised the stress levels of 61 girls aged seven to 12 .
The children had to make an impromptu speech and solve maths problems in front of strangers .
This sent their hearts racing and levels of stress hormone cortisol higher .
The girls were then divided into three groups , one comforted by physical contact with their mothers , another by phone calls from their mothers and a third by watching a film deemed emotionally neutral , the March of the Penguins .
Oxytocin rose to similar levels in the first two groups and did not increase in the third , saliva and urine tests revealed .
As this hormone 's presence grew , cortisol faded .
Leslie Seltzer , from the University of Wisconsin - Madison , who led the research , said : " The children who got to interact with their mothers had virtually the same hormonal response , whether they interacted in person or over the phone .
" It was understood that oxytocin release in the context of social bonding usually required physical contact .
But it 's clear from these results that a mother 's voice can have the same effect as a hug , even if they 're not standing there . "
The effects lingered too , said another member of the team .
" It stays well beyond the stressful task , " said Professor Seth Pollak , from the university 's child emotion laboratory .
" By the time the children go home they 're still enjoying the benefits of this relief and their cortisol levels are still low .
That a simple telephone call could have this physiological effect on oxytocin is really exciting . "
Girls were used in the study because oxytocin responses are stronger in females than in males .
In adult women the hormone plays a role in labour , preparing for birth and breastfeeding .
There might be an evolutionary reason for other responses , experts believe .
A threatened male is free to choose between " fight or flight " , but this may not be so easy for a female who is pregnant or caring for offspring .
It might be that females alleviate stress by making the peace .
Seltzer is investigating whether other forms of communication , such as text messaging , have an effect on oxytocin and hopes to expand the research into animals .
" Lots of very social species vocalise , " she said .
" On the one hand we 're curious to see if this effect is unique to humans .
On the other we 're hoping researchers who study vocal communication will consider looking at oxytocin release in other animals and applying it to broader questions of social behaviour and evolutionary biology . "
Now we 've announced our new Open Platform 's Content API and microapp framework , I can talk a bit more about how the Guardian Zeitgeist actually runs and how it 's using the APIs and the microapp framework .
People are generally pretty familiar with APIs but microapps may need a bit more explaining , so here 's a very quick overview .
First a screenshot of the Zeitgeist running on the Guardian ...
But wait , it 's really running off Google App Engine .
This is what it looks like naked on Google 's own servers ...
The microapp framework allows the Guardian to assign areas of a single page or , various types of pages to a microapp , which can be hosted elsewhere .
When the Zeitgeist page on the Guardian is loaded , it requests the content from the Zeitgeist application and places the results into the page , rather like this ...
Because I 'm running Zeitgeist on Google 's App Engine I 'm not that worried about scaling .
Even so , I can set cache headers at my end telling the Guardian to only grab new data from me once every 10 mins and I can adjust this as I need to .
If my app goes down or start throwing errors the Guardian can just use it 's latest cached version .
This is good for me as a developer , even an in - house one because I 'm not tied to the Guardian 's own internal platform .
My weapon of choice happens to be Python , but it could be coded in anything that serves up HTML .
I can also easily deploy updates outside of our internal deploy cycle , which is nice .
Ok , so what does the Zeitgeist do ?
Well I 've already covered that a bit in this blog post here :
What 's hot ?
Introducing Zeitgeist ,
Zeitgeist is a visual record of what people are currently finding interesting on guardian .
co.uk at the moment .
While other bits of the site are curated by editors ( like the front page , or individual sections ) or metadata ( like blogs , which display in reverse - chronological order ) , Zeitgeist is dynamic , powered by the attention of users .
We hope that this makes for an interesting alternative springboard into the content on this site , and those who have been playing with it behind the scenes can confirm that it's a great starting point when you 've got a few minutes spare and just want something to read but you 're not sure where to start .
This is roughly what 's going on under the hood ...
The Brain
The powerhouse behind Zeitgeist is a Python App Engine thingy called " The Brain " , this is the one that does all the serious number crunching .
Every hour our analytics system emails over the latest data from the site , across all sections , searches and so on .
The app has mail handlers waiting for the reports to arrive , it then parses the data , fetches additional information ( such as keywords , sub- sections and so on ) from the Guardian Open Platform API , for each item row in the reports .
It then ranks the news ( based on complex secret sauce algorithms , discussed more over here ) which form the base Zeitgeist scores .
The results are then stored again and indexed so we can find the top stories based on section ( i.e. technology , politics ) , type ( article , gallery ) or both .
Here 's the scary backend graph of it working ...
... and that 's basically The Zeitgeist .
The Layouterer
Because we generally try to keep the data layer and the presentation separate we have a different Google App that generates various HTML views of the data .
There are cron tasks set up to request information from The Brain via an API serving JSON , which is then stores locally and converts into HTML .
We hope to get this Zeitgeisty API endpoint into the Open Platform " soon " .
There 's two reasons for doing it this way ...
We want The Brain to just concentrate on the heavy number crunching .
If we want to add a new HTML view of the data we do n't need to touch The Brain , its left doing it 's own thing .
Also it means the CS ( frontend ) team can work with the code and not worry about breaking anything databasey .
If for some reason the backend Brain decided to crash and burn , the Layouterer still has latest copies of the results that it can continue to serve up to The Guardian .
Giving us time to diagnose any problems and restore data if we need to .
The Searcher
But wait , there 's more , the " Love Notes " ...
We also keep an eye on what 's happening out there on the Internet .
The Searcher watches for search terms that are being used to arrive at The Guardian , it also monitors Social Networking sites , OneRiot and Twitter for mentions of Guardian articles .
It 's very general at the moment , but again it can be worked on separately from The Brain without fear of breaking anything .
When it notices a lot of activity around a certain article , it sends a note to The Brain to keep an eye out for it .
The Brain can then boost the Zeitgeist score of articles based on this information .
This also works the other way round , if The Brain spots items that are rapidly trending : getting hotter at a much faster rate than normal , it sends a request to The Searcher to see if it can find out what 's going on .
The same thing happens if it notices that something is still ranking highly after a number of days , or if an old article reappears in the reports .
By sending these " Love Notes " between each - other the systems can keep updating hotness values independently of the reports arriving .
The Searcher is also a place where we can experiment more and ultimately , hopefully , be used to report information back to us - the news organization .
Letting us know when things are doing exceptionally well and more importantly an insight into why they are doing well .
The $ 1.24 Wrap -up
What we have here is a great combination of the Open Platform microapp framework allowing us to inline content hosted elsewhere , the APIs to get further information such as keywords to generate a better understanding of trending topics and Google App Engine to do the heavy lifting without needing the infrastructure in - house .
The Zeitgeist itself is still an evolving experiment , one that hopefully gives the reader of the Guardian 's website an interesting way to dip into the news , and through various back - end tools give us as a news organisation more information and insight into how people interact with our content .
The cost ?
Well Google App Engine sets us back a whole $ 1.24 a day , or 84 pence ( and that 's without a huge amount of hardcore optimization ) .
Which I think is easily worth it .
The Guardian 's Content API is free to play with and you do n't even need to sign up or get an API key to start , although we 'd love it if you did :)

If you 've been thinking of getting the newest addition to the Sprint family on June 4th , the HTC EVO 4G , you 're probably aware of the new $ 10 charge that Sprint will be requiring of you .
However , the situation is n't nearly as bad as it sounds .
In fact , you may be getting much more than you thought you were paying for .
Under the heading of " Worry - Free Pricing " in their press release , they say it plain and simple :
In order to provide the best experience , HTC EVO 4G will use Sprint 's industry - leading Everything Data or Business Advantage Messaging and Data plans that include unlimited Web , texting and calling on the Sprint Network to every mobile in America with Any Mobile , AnytimeSM .
So far , so good .
But then the dollar signs start to rear their ugly heads , and that 's where everyone started to get a little upset , especially considering Dan Hesse , the CEO of Sprint , himself implied otherwise back in March .
Everything Data plans start at $ 69.99 per month .
A $ 10 per month Premium Data add - on will apply allowing customers to take advantage of a richer data experience than ever before .
As we wrote earlier this week , Sprint has tacked on an extra $ 10 just to use the EVO 4G , whether or not you have 4G in you area .
But put down your pitchforks !
What they did n't say ( at least not clearly enough ) , is what the definition of richer is .
That is , this extra 10 bucks does n't just get you data on your EVO 4G : it gets you unlimited data .
Richer means unlimited .
And here 's the kicker : Sprint has confirmed that both 3G and 4G data plans will be unlimited with the added $ 10 , not just 4G .
That means , in all capital letters , NO MORE CAPS .
Download to your heart 's content .
We 've been waiting for official confirmation which finally arrived a few minutes ago in a tweet from a Sprint representative , clearing everything up :
If you only get 3G in your area , but you 're using the EVO 4G , you still have to pay the extra $ 10 , but it goes a long way ... a really long way .
So , instead of throwing a fit , thank Sprint that you can finally download , as they say , " worry free . " while still having a plan that is cheaper than any comparable plan any other carrier can offer .
Not too bad after all , now , is it ?

Original Post : I have n't been active on dA for a while because I 've been busy with finals but now that it 's over , I come back to see that my drawing " Selfish " has been plagiarized and won 2 gold awards at the Alliance for Young Artists and Writers Competition www.artandwriting.org
You can see the plagiarized drawing at www.artandwriting.org/ORGGalle… but you have to go to " FILTER " , then click on " Art " , then " Painting " .
The thief in question is Kasey Bowman who copied my drawingand renamed it " Stolen Wings " .
Is it just me or is this oh so ironic ?
She even copied the poem word for word ...
Here 's a screen capture : There 's even an article about her www.democratherald.com/news/lo… and all the awards she won and how she got to go to New York for it .
And in another article , she comments on " her " work , and how it was inspired by a poem .
Yeah , because reading my poem inspired her to draw something that looks almost exactly like the drawing ?
What are the chances of that ?
And she will be awarded by her school www.albany.k12.or.us/district/…
If she plagiarized my work , maybe her other winning painting " If Wolves Could Fly " might be plagiarized as well .
I do not recognize it myself but perhaps you guys have seen it somewhere else ?
bloximages.chicago2.vip.townne…
Sad thing is , that 's not the real problem ... I actually found out about this art theft on April 6th and e-mailed the Scholastic people at info@artandwriting.org about the issue with all the info required on the the " COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM NOTICE AND PROCEDURE " , but I did not receive a reply .
I was too busy with studying and research essays to look into why , but now I do know and it 's really pissing me off .
If you check their current Terms of Service page www.artandwriting.org/terms , you 'll see they 've changed the copyright infringement procedure to " do not send such notice to our e-mail address " , instead we must mail to the address or fax them ( without providing a fax # ) .
There 's a statement saying they can change the procedure anytime they want without prior announcement .
I will be writing a mail to them ... ONCE THEY PUT UP A PROPER ADDRESS TO MAIL TO !
This is exactly what they have on the site : " Legal DepartmentAlliance for Young Artists & Writers , Inc.557 Broadway  Room ______New
York , NY 10012
Or send us your written communication by facsimile to : [ FAX Number ] " Room ???
So we 're not suppose to e-mail , there 's no fax # ( just the words " FAX Number " ) and the address is incomplete ?
Why am I so angry ?
Let 's see , the Scholastic Alliance for Young Artists and Writers is the leading organization in helping young artists getting noticed , yet they take copyright infringement issues so lightly .
I know for a fact that the person who informed me about art theft also contacted the the Scholastic people ; she told me that even her AP art teacher and fellow classmates wrote to them about the unfairness of the competition .
Yet we were all ignored because the plagiarized drawing is still on their site and people are still noting me about the issue .
Is this how young artists should be seen ?
Winning a contest held by people who are so irresponsible that anyone can cheat their way to the top ?
Even Myspace has a better copyright protection program ; at least when I e-mail them about it , I get a reply within a few days , and they do n't randomly change the procedures to make it my fault for not sending in the complaint properly .
I would really appreciate it if you guys could e-mail them at info@artandwriting.org or a&wGeneralInfo@scholastic.com and tell them how you disapprove of their poor copyright protection procedure .
Though seeing as how they like to ignore e-mails , I 'm not sure if it'll work but I want to try .
I really do n't want any future contestants to loose to an art thief and be ignored .* sigh * I just needed to rant this out .
I 'll be sorting through all the notes and e-mail in the next fews days and hopefully put up some new drawings as well .
Chapter 2 of Knite will be out within a month , and since I 'll be on break , I can finish a new chapter every month .
Thanks for being so patient with me , guysNew Update : Thanks for all the support and help !!!
I 've e-mailed Kasey Bowman 's art teacher and I 'll hopefully get a reply on Monday .
Since all the helpful people on dA found other contact info for me , I 'm also planning to mail / call / fax the Scholastic people on Monday as well .
I 'll keep you guys updated on what happens by then !
Thanks again for the overwhelming amount of help

Republicans Scream for Obama to Take Over Private Sector
In calling the BP oil spill “ Obama ’s Katrina ” ; conservatives infer that the President did not act fast enough .
However , not only has this meme been debunked , but it goes to the central hypocrisy of the current conservative moment , whose only consistent value is to oppose Obama in order to destroy his Presidency .
Conservatives are attempting to foist all responsibility for the clean up of the private sector caused oil spill onto the President .
In fact , the conservative effort to label this as Obama ’s Katrina represents the Conservative endorsement of socialism .
Obama originally voted against expansion of off - shore drilling as a senator , though he did signal his willingness to compromise on the issue if it could be tackled in an environmentally sensitive manner , in order to achieve a comprehensive energy policy that could bring down gas prices .
Advertisements
Later , as President , Obama broke his campaign promise to retain the moratorium on off - shore drilling in a horse trade with Republicans in order to get a broader climate change bill through Congress .
“ Obama said the decision to allow oil rigs off the Atlantic coast was a painful one , but that it would help reduce US dependence on imported oil . ”
“ This is not a decision that I ’ve made lightly , ” the president said .
“ But the bottom line is this : given our energy needs , in order to sustain economic growth , produce jobs , and keep our businesses competitive , we ’re going to need to harness traditional sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of renewable , homegrown energy . ”
Clearly , these are not the words or actions of a man who embraced “ Drill , Baby Drill ” as an entire energy platform and yet conservatives are rushing to blame him for the tragic BP spill .
Obama begrudgingly embraced their energy policy in order to get votes for his environmentally friendly energy policy .
If you ’re waiting for their ownership of the problems inherent in Drill , Baby , Drill , you ’ll be waiting a long time because once again , instead of reasonable debate about the issues , we ’re being treated to the screech and blame game .
The facts are that the spill appears to be a result of massive safety deregulation for oil rigs .
Obama is a Democratic President who believes government plays a role in the lives of the people ; hence he has accepted this responsibility ( while noting that BP will pay for the clean - up ) .
However , this notion that government has a role to play is a value that Conservatives do not share .
In fact , they want the government out of everything these days .
So why do they suddenly want to hold the federal government accountable for the private sector ?
Conservatives and in particular Teabaggers have been accusing the President of “ socializing ” private sector business both through health care reform and the Bush bail - outs ( yes , I know ) .
So , they are supposedly against socialization as they define it , which would be government having any role in the lives of the people and government interfering in private business .
In the past , conservatives stood for free market principles but the modern day conservative movement has taken this to an extreme , which now includes careless and ruthless deregulation in addition to the notion that corporations rights to make a profit automatically override civil rights , workers rights and social justice .
Given these principles , it is manifestly hypocritical and disingenuous for them to be screaming that Obama is responsible at all for the BP clean up the oil spill , especially since it was Republican President George W. Bush who signed off on lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling in 2008 .
Furthermore , in suggesting that Obama allowed this to happen , they are saying that regulations and oversight should have been in place to avoid this .
Thus , conservatives are arguing that government has a role to play in our lives , which goes against the very tenets of modern day conservatism .
Were they to stay true to their principles , they would be upset that federal money was being spent to help BP clean up after their own accident , an accident which they would defend as the cost of “ energy independence ” ( never mind that the concept of energy independence being solely defined as drilling here and drilling now is patently absurd ) .
Free market principles would dictate that BP would fail as a result of their own irresponsibility , not that Obama would bail them out .
The facts are that the energy lobbyists have been recklessly and systematically deregulating their industry for the last 15 years .
Deregulation is a free market value , which is a conservative value .
In a sane world , reasonable oversight and regulation would be balanced with free market principles .
But the conservatives have abandoned all of their principles in in the Neo-con push for Profit as King and indeed , their effort to derail the Obama presidency .
The irony is that in pushing for no oversight , they ’ve created companies that will fail .
When Profit is King , safety , accountability and honesty are pushed aside , as without any reason to protect their reputations even , companies will continue to feed their bottom line first .
The possibility of bad PR for many of these companies should have been the mitigating factor in a free market economy , and yet they are largely protected from bad PR by the modern day conservatives ’ notion of socializing the downside for the private sector .
When these companies fail as BP did , conservatives are now pushing for the Democratic president who votes AGAINST off shore drilling to clean up after their private sector mess .
In other words , in calling BP ’s massive oil spill “ Obama ’s Katrina ” , conservatives are once again socializing the down side of their free market ideology .
That kind of ignorance and arrogance must end .
We need to audit the Fed .
And now we 're closer than ever .
The House passed our bill to conduct the first independent audit of the Fed in its 96 - year history .
Now it 's time for the Senate to act .
A bipartisan group of Senators is pushing for an amendment to audit the Fed .
This amendment is similar to the legislation that we passed in the House last year .
It 's called the Federal Reserve Accountability Amendment .
It will ensure that the American people know to whom the Fed is lending our money .
The amendment is simple .
If it passes , the Fed finally will be audited .
Regarding all those billions that the Fed hands out like party favors , we will find out who , what , when , where and how .
( We already know " why " – the answer to that question is " Wall Street Greed " . )
But if this amendment fails , the Fed can continue to make hand out our money to whomever it wants , without telling Congress or the American People .
We think we can pass the Senate Amendment , with your help .
The amendment is already cosponsored by progressive heroes like Bernie Sanders , Pat Leahy and Russ Feingold .
And joining us in this strange - bedfellows coalition are John McCain , Jim DeMint , David Vitter and Sam Brownback .
( We hesitate to use the terms " bedfellows " and " David Vitter " in the same sentence , but that would be changing the subject . )
With such bipartisan support , you 'd think that passing this legislation would be a slam dunk .
Wrong .
Wall Street bankers and their lobbyists are twisting arms and pouring millions into the campaign coffers of politicians on both sides of the political divide , to keep their sweetheart Fed loans under wraps .
It 's time to counter their influence - peddling by making the Senate listen to the united voice of the American People .
( That would be you . )
A vote on the amendment is imminent .
Time is of the essence .
Visit UnmaskTheFed.com NOW to contact your Senators , and call on them to cosponsor and support the Federal Reserve Accountability Amendment .

NSW Minister David Campbell has resigned from his road and transport portfolios this evening , citing personal reasons and apologising to his family and friends .
Mr Campbell 's resignation came after accusations he used a taxpayer - funded government car to visit a gay sex club in the state premier ’s eastern suburbs electorate .
Tonight Channel Seven aired footage of Mr Campbell allegedly visiting the club in Kensington , Ken ’s at Kensington , on Tuesday night for about two hours .
Mr Campbell excused his driver and drove himself to the sex club in his ministerial car .
With American secretary of state Hillary Clinton underway to the East Asia , a crisis is looming in the waters of the Yellow Sea where a South Korean corvette sunk last March , killing 46 .
South Koreans authorities have ascertained that a North Korean torpedo was responsible for the sinking .
The North has denied any involvement , threatening with “ all out war ” should the South respond militarily .
The White House agreed that the sinking constituted an “ act of aggression ” that is “ one more instance of North Korea ’s unacceptable behavior and defiance of international law . ”
The ROKS Cheonan went down near the disputed inter-Korean maritime border on March 27 .
Tensions flared between the two Koreas that remain formally at war but the issue faded until this Thursday when international investigators , including experts from Australia , Britain , Sweden and the United States , found that the remains of the torpedo that sunk the Cheonan “ perfectly match ” those of a CHT - 02D torpedo which North Korea sells abroad .
What ’s more , markings were found similar to those engraved on a previously recovered North Korean torpedo .
“ The discovery , ” reports The Economist , “ combined with intelligence reports indicating North Korean submarines were out of port during the attack , allowed the investigators to conclude on May 20th that the Cheonan ‘ was sunk as the result of an external underwater explosion caused by a torpedo made in North Korea . ' ”
The news has sent shockwaves through the region with South Korean President Lee Myung - bak announcing “ firm , responsive measures against the North . ”
South Korean stocks and currency plummeted on Thursday amid mounting fears of a renewed confrontation .
It will become harder for North Korea ’s sole , though lukewarm ally in the region , China , not to accept the regime ’s culpability .
A senior official in Beijing reportedly called the incident “ very unfortunate ” while The Wall Street Journal quotes a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman as calling on all parties to “ stay calm and exercise restraint — to avoid escalation of the situation . ”
Secretary Clinton is set to meet officials in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday in what are likely to become some pretty uncomfortable diplomatic meetings for the Chinese .
Previous attempts to impose UN sanctions on North Korea have been thwarted by the belief that China would veto them .
With the regime in Pyongyang so unmistakably exposed an an aggressor in recent days , Chinese leaders will be hard pressed to maintain their position when they confere with their Japanese and South Korean counterparts on May 29 and 30 .
So far , China has only supported economic penalties against the North , reluctantly .
In the wake of the Cheonan sinking , North Korean leader Kim Jong - il made a hasty trip to Beijing to beg for continued economic support .
“ At that point , Beijing had an excuse , ” according to The Economist , “ in public at least , to take his claims of innocence at face value .
It no longer does . ”
Beyond diplomatic measures , South Korea ’s retaliatory options are limited .
The country may break remaining business ties with the North or close off a shipping shortcut to North Korean vessels though considering the regime ’s bellicosity in response to the incident —
“ Our army and people will promptly react to any ‘ punishment ’ and ‘ retaliation ’ and to any ‘ sanctions ’ infringing upon our state interests with various forms of tough measures ” — and the danger of the United States being dragged into a new war between the two Koreas , it seems more likely that former businessman turned president Lee wo n’t push for aggressive measures that threaten to upset politicos in the Hermit Kingdom .
The South Korean people do n’t seem into a fight either , notes The Economist .
“ Indeed , despite a national outpouring of grief , the senseless attack aroused surprisingly few public demonstrations of wrath with the North . ”
With an election for local and provincial seats scheduled in less than two weeks , the incident has been caught up in the political fray .
The opposition alleges that Lee and his ruling party timed the investigation to influence voting on June 2 .
In either event , the president may expect to gain victory which economically , at least , is good news for the South which has expertly weathered the global turndown under Lee ’s leadership .
With a victory at Anfield for Chelsea the pressure was on United to come away with at least a win today as their title hopes have become very slim this year .
United traveled to the Stadium of Light today to face a Sunderland side that has been in excellent form at home only losing to Chelsea and Aston Villa .
A few surprising returns to the squad were made today as Rooney started for the Red Devils while Owen Hargreaves and Rio Ferdinand both stepped on for the last few seconds of the game .
Fletcher and Scholes held central midfield as Nani and Giggs ran the wings .
Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney were partnered up front as the Red Devils hoped to keep their title hopes alive .
The Red Devils created a number of chances but Dimitar Berbatov failed to convert multiple times as United looked to put the pressure back on Chelsea .
United would take the lead on a 28th minute strike from Nani as the Portuguese winger would give United the lead for the second game in arrow .
The Portuguese winger , who has been creating positive results for the Red Devils , has picked up the nickname “ Bob the Builder ” around the training grounds because of his carpentry skills off the field .
His performance this year has brought light into the United attack after the departure of his compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo .
Despite Chelsea ’s win over Liverpool the United Manager is staying focused on next week ’s match at home saying that “ all we can do is keep winning . ”
His positive outlook gives United fan ’s hopes of winning their 4th Premiership title in a row and the 19th for the club overall .
United ’s match - winner Nani also has positive outlook to the Red Devil ’s chances of winning stating that , “ We have a chance to win the league and we will fight until the end . ”
It ’s hard to see Wigan winning at Stamford Bridge next week where Chelsea has only dropped 5 points all season .

Back in 1945 , cryptographer Fritz Sennheiser founded a professional electronics company in an abandoned WWII German laboratory .
Today , we 've received the sad tidings that Dr. Sennheiser has passed away at the age of 98 .
Despite his firm 's humble origins building voltmeters from spare parts , his continued innovation led to products like the shotgun microphone and supra-aural headphones , and soon propelled Sennheiser to become a respected audio brand .
He is remembered by his son Jörg , in whose hands he left the company in 1982 , and by users of the many , many headphones that bear his name .
You 'll find his official biography at the source link ; but first , a moment of silence for this pioneer .
Considering the volume he 's afforded us over the years , we think it 's only fair .
NATO code compromise
The recent crash of a Polish military transport that killed most of Warsaw ’s senior civilian and military leaders was not only a human catastrophe for a key U.S. ally .
NATO sources said that , in addition to the loss of nearly 100 pro-U.S. Polish leaders , the crash provided Moscow with a windfall of secrets .
The crash killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski in western Russia on April 10 and decapitated Poland ’s military , killing two service chiefs , key military aides and several national security officials , many of whom were carrying computers and pocket memory sticks that contained sensitive NATO data .
Perhaps the most significant compromise , according to a NATO intelligence source , is that the Russians are suspected of obtaining ultrasecret codes used by NATO militaries for secure satellite communications .
RELATED STORIES :

• Senators seek new terror security measures
• Chinese deal with Pakistan hems Obama
• Iran eases grip on al Qaeda
• U.S. forces train African armies
The compromise of the codes is considered what electronic spies call a “ break ” for Moscow code - breakers .
New NATO codes almost certainly were issued to allied militaries immediately after the crash .
But if the Russian electronic intelligence service , known as the Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information , was able to recover and use the communication key code from the wreckage , electronic spies will be able to decode months ’ or perhaps years ’ worth of scrambled communications that are routinely gathered electronically for just such an occasion .
The coded communications , if decrypted , would reveal some of NATO ’s most intimate secrets , such as plans for defenses and even the identities of agents or allied eavesdropping sources .
Other Polish and NATO secrets also were believed to be aboard the jet , and so far Russia ’s government is refusing to cooperate fully with Poland ’s government in providing details on the cause of the crash , or even to turn over the Polish jet ’s black boxes .
Additionally , Poland ’s interim government has not pressed the Russians for answers to questions about the crash , such as why Russian aviation authorities , without any investigation , ruled that pilot error caused the crash minutes after the jet crashed short of the runway in fog at Russia ’s Smolensk airport .
Polish security and aviation authorities also were denied access to the crash site .
Public pressure is mounting on Warsaw to call for an international commission to investigate the crash .
Tens of thousands of Poles already have signed a petition calling for the international probe .
Many Poles , who need little encouragement to be critical of the Russians based on past enmity , have taken to calling the crash the “ second Katyn , ” after the 1940 Katyn Forest massacre when Russian agents killed more than 21,000 Polish officers in an effort to decimate the Polish military .
Mr. Kaczynski , who was viewed as politically more anti-Russian than current leaders , was on his way to Katyn , about six miles from Smolensk , to mark the anniversary of the massacre .
Afghan update
Amid the glad - handing and friendly atmospherics surrounding this week ’s meeting between President Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai , a senior military officer in Afghanistan provided Inside the Ring with a situation report on the conflict that presents a sober background assessment .
The officer said the biggest problem in Afghanistan remains corruption within the Kabul government , a problem that if left unaddressed “ will defeat our mission there faster than the Taliban . ”
The U.S. strategy for stabilizing the war - torn country is developing legitimacy for the Afghan government , the officer said .
Gen . Stanley McChrystal , commander of U.S. forces in the country , is banking on a major shift of focus , from establishing national institutions to working at the district and local level to create government organs that are pro-U.S. and anti-Taliban .
As for the enemy Taliban forces , “ They are there , they are fighting and they have [ improvised explosive devices ] networks as their biggest weapon , ” the officer said .
To limit IED attacks , the Afghan government recently banned the importation of ammonium nitrate , the key ingredient in homemade bombs , mainly from Pakistan .
Replacement fertilizers have been brought in for Afghan farmers .
According to the officer , the problem in the past was that U.S. and allied forces conceded too much freedom of movement to the Taliban at the local level , as national institutions were set up .
“ The focus has now shifted to the local , tactical level , ” the officer said .
“ If we can win at the local level and bring legitimacy to local government , the Taliban will become weaker . ”
The Taliban does not enjoy widespread popular support , and local Afghans are “ hedging their bets ” by tacitly supporting the Taliban at the same time expressing support for the Afghan national government and the allied coalition .
“ There are lots of Afghans sitting on the fence , ” the officer said .
“ They ’ll do their smiley face with us , but if it looks like the Taliban are ahead , they ’ll do the smiley face with them . ”
As for efforts to convert some Taliban to support Kabul , the officer said there are some enemy groups that want to demobilize , but at a high price .
“ The Taliban leaders [ who want to switch sides ] want to bring their organizations and clans over but they want to be placed in positions of political or security influence , such as positions within the police forces , ” the officer said , noting that any such move might actually create more problems for the Afghan government .
Mixon ’s gay counseling
Army Secretary John McHugh has put the matter of Army Lt. Gen. Benjamin Mixon , and his rebellious letter to the editor , to rest .
Gen .
Mixon angered the Obama administration in March by writing a letter to Stars and Stripes newspaper revealing his opposition to repealing the ban on open homosexuals in the ranks .
He also urged soldiers and their families to express their opposition .
Washington ’s military hierarchy came down hard on the combat veteran , who now commands the U.S. Army , Pacific .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen , Joint Chiefs chairman , both publicly admonished Gen . Mixon for urging opposition to one of President Obama ’s pet projects .
Their stern language led some to believe Mr. McHugh might discipline Gen. Mixon , whose letter stirred sympathy among the rank and file .
But the secretary told a group of defense reporters recently the matter was handled quietly with phone calls to Gen .
Mixon from himself and Gen. George Casey , the Army chief of staff , reports special correspondent Rowan Scarborough .
“ I think it is both the chief of staff of the Army ’s and my judgment that he went beyond what can be fairly described as the norms of command in those kinds of circumstances , ” Mr. McHugh said .
“ His actions , at a minimum , exceeded the spirit of the directive that the chief and I sent out on the way ahead a number of weeks ago . ”
Mr. McHugh said Gen. Mixon confessed that he had crossed the line .
Gen .
Mixon “ recognizes it was inappropriate for him to become an advocate and to try to shape the opinion of the force rather than to reach out and ascertain the opinion of the force , [ and ] that he has said he is perfectly capable and willing and will make every effort to carry forward within the manner we expect in the future , ” Mr. McHugh said .
Air Force suicides
Gen. Norton A. Schwartz , Air Force chief of staff , said the service is facing a “ surge ” in suicides in a May 4 speech to a conference of senior enlisted airmen .
“ This includes active , Guard and Reserve airmen , as well as Air Force civilians and family members , ” Gen. Schwartz said .
“ We have more suicides so far this year than we did last , which itself exceeded each year before that .
We collectively in this room have to act to arrest this trend . ”
He urged the airmen to care for their fellow airmen , noting that “ now is the time . ”
“ Make it your business to identify stress and failed relationships among your people , ” the general said .
“ Encourage our people to ask for help , and intervene in cases where they are reluctant to do so .
Do not for a single moment accept the needless loss of a teammate as the cost of doing business .
It is n’t — not now , not ever . ”
According to the Air Force website , the suicide rate for 2009 was 12.5 suicides for every 100,000 airmen .
The problem is not limited to the Air Force .
The Marine Corps in 2009 had the highest suicide rate in the military , with 24 per 100,000 .
The active - duty Army had 21.7 per 100,000 .
Analysts attribute the high rates for the Army and Marines to those services ’ roles in ground combat in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Navy also has suffered from high suicide rates .
Its suicide rate for 2009 was 13.8 per 100,000 sailors .

Exelon Corp. is one of the largest , most powerful utilities in the world , typically worth some $ 30 billion .
For a brief moment Thursday , the stock market said it was worthless .
Exelon was just one of a number of stocks that produced bizarre , and presumably garbled , market quotes during the " Flash Crash " of the afternoon .
Another was Boston ...
Obama follows the advice of Kissinger , Nunn , Schultz , Reagan , Matlock , Gorbachev , Kennedy , et al ad infinitum and reduces the role of nuclear weapons in foreign policy , with the goal and vision of complete abolition and disarmament .
This is a very very very positive step in the right direction , and will help future efforts to negotiate in the common interest of all countries and all people to put the nuclear genie back in the bottle and achieve total elimination of nuclear weapons , " the scourge of humanity " as described by Jack Matlock , former Reagan ambassador to the Soviet Union .
I really do n't understand arguments against nuclear abolition and disarmament .
By changing the Nuclear policy of the United States , along with signing the new START treaty with Russia , the upcoming Nuclear Security Summit next week as well as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Review Conference in May are strengthened and it will be easier to work toward the shared goal and vision of a world free from the danger and threat of nuclear weapons , that President Obama articulated last year in Prague .
Facts from the White House : The New Start Treaty and Protocol
" Finally , this day demonstrates the determination of the United States and Russia -- the two nations that hold over 90 percent of the world ’s nuclear weapons -- to pursue responsible global leadership .
Together , we are keeping our commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , which must be the foundation for global non-proliferation .
While the New START treaty is an important first step forward , it is just one step on a longer journey .
As I said last year in Prague , this treaty will set the stage for further cuts .
And going forward , we hope to pursue discussions with Russia on reducing both our strategic and tactical weapons , including non-deployed weapons .
President Medvedev and I have also agreed to expand our discussions on missile defense .
This will include regular exchanges of information about our threat assessments , as well as the completion of a joint assessment of emerging ballistic missiles .
And as these assessments are completed , I look forward to launching a serious dialogue about Russian - American cooperation on missile defense .
But nuclear weapons are not simply an issue for the United States and Russia -- they threaten the common security of all nations .
A nuclear weapon in the hands of a terrorist is a danger to people everywhere -- from Moscow to New York ; from the cities of Europe to South Asia .
So next week , 47 nations will come together in Washington to discuss concrete steps that can be taken to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years .
And the spread of nuclear weapons to more states is also an unacceptable risk to global security -- raising the specter of arms races from the Middle East to East Asia .
Earlier this week , the United States formally changed our policy to make it clear that those [ non ] - nuclear weapons states that are in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and their non-proliferation obligations will not be threatened by America ’s nuclear arsenal .
This demonstrates , once more , America ’s commitment to the NPT as a cornerstone of our security strategy .
Those nations that follow the rules will find greater security and opportunity .
Those nations that refuse to meet their obligations will be isolated , and denied the opportunity that comes with international recognition .
That includes accountability for those that break the rules -- otherwise the NPT is just words on a page .
That ’s why the United States and Russia are part of a coalition of nations insisting that the Islamic Republic of Iran face consequences , because they have continually failed to meet their obligations .
We are working together at the United Nations Security Council to pass strong sanctions on Iran .
And we will not tolerate actions that flout the NPT , risk an arms race in a vital region , and threaten the credibility of the international community and our collective security .
While these issues are a top priority , they are only one part of the U.S. - Russia relationship .
Today , I again expressed my deepest condolences for the terrible loss of Russian life in recent terrorist attacks , and we will remain steadfast partners in combating violent extremism .
We also discussed the potential to expand our cooperation on behalf of economic growth , trade and investment , as well as technological innovation , and I look forward to discussing these issues further when President Medvedev visits the United States later this year , because there is much we can do on behalf of our security and prosperity if we continue to work together .
When one surveys the many challenges that we face around the world , it ’s easy to grow complacent , or to abandon the notion that progress can be shared .
But I want to repeat what I said last year in Prague :
When nations and peoples allow themselves to be defined by their differences , the gulf between them widens .
When we fail to pursue peace , then it stays forever beyond our grasp . "
President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty in Prague .
The treaty commits the U.S. and Russia to reduce the number of strategic nuclear warheads by one - third and decrease the number of missiles , bombers , and submarines carrying them by more than one - half .
Following the signing , the two leaders took questions from reporters .
President Obama in his comments said , " It sends a signal around the world that the United States and Russia are prepared to once again take leadership . "
The White House Blog : Key Facts about the New START Treaty
Verification and Transparency : The Treaty has a verification regime that combines the appropriate elements of the 1991 START Treaty with new elements tailored to the limitations of the Treaty .
Measures under the Treaty include on - site inspections and exhibitions , data exchanges and notifications related to strategic offensive arms and facilities covered by the Treaty , and provisions to facilitate the use of national technical means for treaty monitoring .
To increase confidence and transparency , the Treaty also provides for the exchange of telemetry .

Soon the treaty will go to the Senate , where it must receive support from two - thirds of the chamber before it can take effect .
President Obama : " The pursuit of peace and calm and cooperation among nations is the work of both leaders and peoples in the 21st century "
Saying that " the pursuit of peace and calm and cooperation among nations is the work of both leaders and peoples in the 21st century " and that " we must be as persistent and passionate in our pursuit of progress as any who would stand in our way , " President Barack Obama just joined Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in signing a new arms control deal that cuts both their nations ' nuclear arsenals by about one - third .
" We hope humanity will reach the moment when there is no need for nuclear weapons , when there is peace and calm in the world , " Arkady Brish , father of Soviet A - bomb supporting Obama 's efforts toward global nuclear disarmament and abolition
" I fully support Obama 's proposal to cut nuclear weapons .
This needs to be done because it reduces the risk of nuclear war , " Arkady Brish , 92 , said when asked if he backed Obama 's call for a world free of atomic weapons .
" We hope humanity will reach the moment when there is no need for nuclear weapons , when there is peace and calm in the world , " he told reporters at a Moscow atomic research institute in a rare public appearance .
Foreign journalists were given an opportunity to speak with Brish during a Kremlin - organized tour of two nuclear - related sites ahead of the signing Thursday of a new US - Russia nuclear disarmament treaty .

The point is to have a phased and verifiable reducing of arms by all nuclear powers as part of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty with the ultimate goal of complete global nuclear abolition and disarmament , which makes us much much much safer in the context of rogue states such as Iran and North Korea .
Joseph Cirincione 's analysis :
My opinion of Reagan has changed dramatically recently , probably like many other people .

Global Zero leaders reacted to the President Obama 's signing of the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) in Prague earlier in the day and responded to reporter 's questions .
The group supports the elimination of nuclear weapons .
They also discussed President Obama 's upcoming April 12 - 13 , 2010 , Nuclear Security Summit .

It is interesting that a broad range of foreign policy experts and former ambassadors , politicians , and public figures including Colin Powell , George Schultz , Sam Nunn , Henry Kissinger (! ) , Nuclear Threat Initiative , Jack Matlock ( former Reagan ambassador to Soviet Union ) , and many many many others , including about eighty percent of Americans and thousands of mayors across the world and even Reagan himself supported the goal and vision of complete global nuclear abolition and disarmament .
So , for all the people that are against the promise and possibility of nuclear disarmament , I ask you , " why ? "
Why oppose the majority of people of the world ?
Why oppose Reagan , the patron saint of conservatives ?
Jack Matlock expounds upon the necessity of putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle , calling nuclear weapons " the scourge of humanity . "
According to Matlock , Putin offered to help the United States deal with terrorism before 9/11 happened , but Bush essentially ignored the offer of support from the Russians .
The Russians are our friends , not our adversaries .
As Reagan himself quoted many times from the Russian proverb , " Trust , but verify . . . . "
The treaty contains verification framework , much more advanced and detailed than the first START treaty negotiated by Reagan and Gorbachev .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates almost breaks into tears when describing his own personal experience with the transition from arms control during the Cold War to disarmament in the world today , and uses his memory and personal story to illustrate how much the world has changed now that Russia and the United States are friends and no longer enemies .
Last year I was hesitant to support Gates remaining as Defense Secretary in President Obama 's administration , but now Gates truly does seem to have a good heart and a right mind for his job , and is committed to the principle , goal , and vision of complete global nuclear disarmament and abolition .
" We live in a troubled world , and the United States and China , as two great nations , share a special responsibility to help reduce the risks of war .
We both agree that there can be only one sane policy to preserve our precious civilization in this modern age : A nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought .
And no matter how great the obstacles may seem , we must never stop our efforts to reduce the weapons of war .
We must never stop at all until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of this Earth . "

And once again a link to the petition that many organizations in partnership with Global Zero , including Myspace , Avaaz , National Resources Defense Council , International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons , and Greenpeace , are collecting signatures for the upcoming Nuclear Nonproliferation Review Treaty conference as well as conference on disarmament issues ( With 47 or more countries attending and taking part , including Russia and China )
Global Zero : Stop the Nuclear Threat
Next week , President Obama is hosting a crucial Nuclear Security Summit in Washington .
With 23,000 nuclear weapons worldwide , experts are clear : we either eliminate all nuclear weapons or accept living in a world where virtually any country or terrorist group can get one .
Last year , over 115,000 of us helped secure a historic commitment by Russia and the US to reduce their nuclear arsenals by a third - - a commitment affirmed in the new US - Russia treaty .
But only a massive surge of people power can persuade world leaders to take bolder steps to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons .
We cannot miss this historic opportunity !
Sign the declaration below , then spread the word -- the petition numbers will be announced at the summit in 4 days ! :
" WE believe that to protect our children , our grandchildren and our civilization from the threat of nuclear catastrophe , we must eliminate all nuclear weapons globally .
We therefore commit to working for a legally binding , verifiable agreement , including all nations , to eliminate nuclear weapons by a date certain . "
Here is a link to a White House press conference with information about the upcoming Nuclear Security Summit

Nuclear Security Summit May Bring U.S. , China Closer
" The two leaders [ Presidents Obama and Hu ] reached a new and important consensus on U.S. - China relations and other matters of common concern .
They agreed to respect each other 's core interests , appropriately handle disputes and sensitive issues and increase dialogue and cooperation in all areas . "
- China 's Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai
Largest Peace Group : Signing New START
Treaty is Good ; More Needed to Finish
" The New START treaty is a modest , but good step toward reducing the threat from nuclear weapons .
The Senate should quickly and deliberately advise and consent to its ratification .
Fewer nuclear weapons makes Americans safer and sends the right message to the rest of the world .
President Obama should continue his push for a nuclear weapons - free world not by beginning another round of negotiations for a further incremental cut to 1,000 nuclear weapons on each side , as has been reported , but by taking executive actions to reduce the U.S. nuclear stockpile . "
The road to ratification in the Senate is complicated by conservatives such as Sen. John Kyl ( R - AZ ) , yet even he has not ruled outright the possibility of voting for the treaty , provided his pet projects are taken care of . . .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) does a good job of supporting the new START treaty as well as making clear that no new nuclear weapons will be built , even to win over waffling Republican senators .
And , so , to change that adversarial relationship , to build the trust and build the confidence , and also , over time , seek to reduce what are huge , huge still , and very large nuclear weapons , I think , is a significant step forward .
Yet John Kyl does not argue for making new weapons , at the very least , yet he wants funding to " modernize . "
We shall see if Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were and will be able to come to an agreement to ensure speedy ratification of the treaty .

Darkness can not put out darkness .
Only light can do that . "
" You know my friends , there comes a time when people get tired of being trampled by the iron feet of oppression ...
If we are wrong , the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong .
If we are wrong , the Constitution of the United States is wrong .
And if we are wrong , God Almighty is wrong .
If we are wrong , Jesus of Nazareth was merely a utopian dreamer that never came down to Earth .
If we are wrong , justice is a lie , love has no meaning .
And we are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water , and righteousness like a mighty stream . "

Inspirational Educational Martin Luther King , Jr. Quotes for Liberals , Progressives , Creative Radicals , Positive Extremists , Leftist Anarchists , etc. , etc. , etc. :
" We may have all come on different ships , but we 're in the same boat now .
When you are right you cannot be too radical ; when you are wrong , you can not be too conservative .
We must accept finite disappointment , but never lose infinite hope .
We must build dikes of courage to hold back the flood of fear .
Take the first step in faith .
You do n't have to see the whole staircase , just take the first step .
We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools .
Almost always , the creative dedicated minority has made the world better .
The hope of a secure and livable world lies with disciplined nonconformists who are dedicated to justice , peace and brotherhood .
The question is not whether we will be extremists , but what kind of extremists we will be ...
The nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists .
Darkness cannot drive out darkness ; only light can do that .
Hate cannot drive out hate ; only love can do that .
Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into friend .
At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love .
Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies - or else ?
The chain reaction of evil - hate begetting hate , wars producing more wars - must be broken , or else we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation .
The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict .
Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will .
Rarely do we find men who willingly engage in hard , solid thinking .
There is an almost universal quest for easy answers and half - baked solutions .
Nothing pains some people more than having to think .
The means by which we live have outdistanced the ends for which we live .
Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power .
We have guided missiles and misguided men .
Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek , but a means by which we arrive at that goal .
Life 's most persistent and urgent question is , ' What are you doing for others ? '
The first question which the priest and the Levite asked was : " If I stop to help this man , what will happen to me ? "
But ... the good Samaritan reversed the question : " If I do not stop to help this man , what will happen to him ? "
Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity .
Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon .
which cuts without wounding and ennobles the man who wields it .
It is a sword that heals .
Nonviolence means avoiding not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit .
You not only refuse to shoot a man , but you refuse to hate him .
Never succumb to the temptation of bitterness .
History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people , but the appalling silence of the good people .
Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted .
I have decided to stick with love .
Hate is too great a burden to bear .
If we are to go forward , we must go back and rediscover those precious values - that all reality hinges on moral foundations and that all reality has spiritual control .
In the End , we will remember not the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends .
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere .
Whatever affects one directly , affects all indirectly .
I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
This is the interrelated structure of reality .
Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge , aggression and retaliation .
The foundation of such a method is love .
It is not enough to say we must not wage war .
It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it .
Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal .
Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter .
The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically .
Intelligence plus character - that is the goal of true education .
That old law about ' an eye for an eye ' leaves everybody blind .
The time is always right to do the right thing .
This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism .
Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy .
He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it .
He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it .
We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive .
He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love .
There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us .
When we discover this , we are less prone to hate our enemies .
No , no , we are not satisfied , and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream .
I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality .
This is why right , temporarily defeated , is stronger than evil triumphant .
As you press on for justice , be sure to move with dignity and discipline , using only the weapon of love .
Let no man pull you so low as to hate him .
Always avoid violence .
If you succumb to the temptation of using violence in your struggle , unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness , and your chief legacy to the future will be an endless reign of meaningless chaos .
Men often hate each other because they fear each other ; they fear each other because they do n't know each other ; they do n't know each other because they cannot communicate ; they cannot communicate because they are separated .
The moral arc of the universe bends at the elbow of justice .
It is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world ; it 's nonviolence or nonexistence . "

Tell global leaders :
It 's time to work toward zero !:
Hopes for the next week 's Nuclear Security Summit in Washington , DC are high .
With the U.S. and Russia leading the way , 2010 could mark the beginning of the end of nuclear weapons .
But public support at this crucial moment is critical to build the foundation of a binding and verifiable global zero agreement .
If the world fails to come together now , when the biggest nuclear powers are taking unprecedented steps , we might lose our best chance yet to do away with one of the greatest threats to our civilization .
Achieving global zero will take years and require tremendous amounts of political will .
Leaders at the summit need to hear that we , their constituents , care about this issue .
Today we have a chance to tell them when it matters most .
We invite you to join our partner Global Zero , an international movement of activists , experts , political and religious leaders , in calling for immediate steps the leaders at the summit can take now .
Global Zero activists will hold a rally outside the Summit and deliver the petition and action plan .
Click to sign the petition !
The Global Zero petition and action plan are backed by hundreds of former heads of state , foreign ministers , national security advisers and military commanders , supported by grassroots activists from around the world .
" The leaders at the Nuclear Security Summit have the power to take immediate steps to begin eliminating all remaining nuclear weapons , " say Global Zero organizers .
" But they need to hear from us first .
Please sign the petition and forward it to all your friends and family -- we need to have as many signatures as possible when we deliver it April 12 . "

Daily Kos : Martin Luther King , Jr. : It 's Always The Right Time , To Do What Is Right
All I 'm saying is simply this : that all mankind is tied together ; all life is interrelated , and we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality , tied in a single garment of destiny .
Whatever affects one directly , affects all indirectly .
For some strange reason I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
And you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be - this is the interrelated structure of reality .
John Donne caught it years ago and placed it in graphic terms :
No man is an Island , entire of itself ; every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main ...
And then he goes on toward the end to say : any man 's death diminishes me , because I am involved in mankind ; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; it tolls for thee .
And by believing this , by living out this fact , we will be able to remain awake through a great revolution .
I would like to mention , secondly , that we are challenged to work passionately and unrelentingly to get rid of racial injustice in all its dimensions .
Anyone who feels that our nation can survive half segregated and half integrated is sleeping through a revolution .
The challenge before us today is to develop a coalition of conscience and get rid of this problem that has been one of the nagging and agonizing ills of our nation over the years .
Racial injustice is still the Negro's burden and America 's shame .
We 've made strides , to be sure .
We have come a long , long way since the Negro was first brought to this nation as a slave in 1619 .
In the last decade we have seen significant developments - the Supreme Court 's decision outlawing segregation in the public schools , a comprehensive Civil Rights Bill in 1964 , and , in a few weeks , a new voting bill to guarantee the right to vote .
All of these are significant developments , but I would be dishonest with you this morning if I gave you the impression that we have come to the point where the problem is almost solved .
We must face the honest fact that we still have a long , long way to go before the problem of racial injustice is solved .
For while we are quite successful in breaking down the legal barriers to segregation , the Negro is now confronting social and economic barriers which are very real .
The Negro is still at the bottom of the economic ladder .
He finds himself perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity .
Millions of Negroes are still housed in unendurable slums ; millions of Negroes are still forced to attend totally inadequate and substandard schools .
And we still see , in certain sections of our country , violence and man 's inhumanity to man in the most tragic way .
All of these things remind us that we have a long , long way to go .
For in Alabama and Mississippi , violence and murder where civil rights workers are concerned , are popular and favorite pastimes .
Let nobody give you the impression that the problem of racial injustice will work itself out .
Let nobody give you the impression that only time will solve the problem .
That is a myth , and it is a myth because time is neutral .
It can be used either constructively or destructively .
And I 'm absolutely convinced that the people of ill will in our nation - the extreme rightists - the forces committed to negative ends - have used time much more effectively than the people of good will .
It may well be that we will have to repent in this generation , not merely for the vitriolic works and violent actions of the bad people who bomb a church in Birmingham , Alabama , or shoot down a civil rights worker in Selma , but for the appalling silence and indifference of the good people who sit around and say , " Wait on time . "
Somewhere we must come to see that human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability .
It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals .
Without this hard work , time becomes an ally of the primitive forces of social stagnation .
So we must help time and realize that the time is always right to do right .
There is another reason why we must get rid of racial injustice .
Not merely because it is sociologically untenable or because it is politically unsound , not merely to meet the communist challenge or to create a good image in the world or to appeal to African and Asian peoples , as important as that happens to be .
In the final analysis racial injustice must be uprooted from American society because it is morally wrong .
Segregation is morally wrong , to use the words of the great Jewish philosopher , Martin Buber , because it substitutes an I - it relationship for the I - thou relationship .
Or to use the thinking of Saint Thomas Aquinas , segregation is wrong because it is based on human laws that are out of harmony with the eternal natural and moral laws of the universe .
The great Protestant theologian , Paul Tillich , said that sin is separation .
And what is segregation but an existential expression of man 's tragic estrangement - his awful segregation , his terrible sinfulness ?
And so in order to rise to our full moral maturity as a nation , we must get rid of segregation whether it is in housing , whether it is a de facto segregation in the public schools , whether it is segregation in public accommodations , or whether it is segregation in the church .
We must see that it is morally wrong .
We must see that it is a national problem .
And no section of our country can boast of clean hands in the area of brotherhood .
We strengthen our nation , above all we strengthen our moral commitment ; as we work to get rid of this problem .
Now there is another problem facing us that we must deal with if we are to remain awake through a social revolution .
We must get rid of violence , hatred , and war .
Anyone who feels that the problems of mankind can be solved through violence is sleeping through a revolution .
I 've said this over and over again , and I believe it more than ever today .
We know about violence .
It 's been the inseparable twin of Western materialism , the hallmark of its grandeur .
I am convinced that violence ends up creating many more social problems than it solves .
This is why I say to my people that if we succumb to the temptation of using violence in our struggle , unborn generations will be the recipients of a long and desolate night of bitterness .
There is another way - a way as old as the insights of Jesus of Nazareth and as modern as the techniques of Mohandas K. Gandhi .
For it is possible to stand up against an unjust system with all of your might , with all of your body , with all of your soul , and yet not stoop to hatred and violence .
Something about this approach disarms the opponent .
It exposes his moral defenses , weakens his morale , and at the same time , works on his conscience .
He does n't know how to handle it .
So it is my great hope that , as we struggle for racial justice , we will follow that philosophy and method of non-violent resistance , realizing that this is the approach that can bring about that better day of racial justice for everyone .
In international relations , we must come to see this .
We must find some alternative to war and bloodshed .
In a day when man -made vehicles are dashing through outer space , and guided ballistic missiles are carving highways of death in the stratosphere , no nation can win a world war .
It is no longer a choice between violence and non-violence ; it is either non-violence or non-existence .
The alternative may well be a civilization plunged into the abyss of annihilation , our earthly habitat transformed into a tragic inferno that even Dante could not imagine .
So this is our challenge : to see that war is obsolete , cast into limbo .
I do not wish to minimize the complexity of the problems to be faced in achieving disarmament and peace .
But we shall not have the courage , the insight , to deal with such matters unless we are prepared to undergo a mental and spiritual change .
It is not enough to say we must not wage war .
We must love peace and sacrifice for it .
We must fix our visions not merely on the negative expulsion of war , but upon the positive affirmation of peace .
We must see that peace represents a sweeter music , far superior to the discords of war .
Somehow we must transform the dynamics of the world power struggle from the negative nuclear arms race which no one can win to a positive contest to harness man 's creative genius for the purpose of making peace and prosperity a reality for all of the nations of the world .
In short , we must shift the arms race into a peace race .
All that I 've said is that we must work for peace , for racial justice , for economic justice , and for brotherhood the world over .
We have inherited a big house , a great world house in which we have to live together - black and white , Easterners and Westerners , Gentiles and Jews , Protestants and Catholics , Moslem and Hindu .
If we all learn to do this we , in a real sense , will remain awake through a great revolution .
I would recommend watching at least the last ten minutes or so of this wonderful talk / discussion with Rep. John Lewis , William Cohen , and Janet Cohen about race and reconciliation :
In summer 2008 , the Cohens conducted a forum on race relations in America with a long list of participants .
That forum is encapsulated in their book , which they discuss with Congressman , civil rights activist and forum participant John Lewis of Georgia .
There is a definite connection between the inhumanity of racism and the inhumanity of war / murder / elimination of whole peoples .
Janet Cohen wrote a play that is a theoretical conversation between Anne Frank and Emmett Till , both young victims of their respective societies that could not protect them from evil / darkness .
Beyond that , Martin Luther King 's message and vision is really a continuation of Gandhi and Thoreau 's message and vision , and many many many people before that .
Among other things , it takes good people standing up to darkness in order to not only make a change toward good , but also ensure that war / murder / oppression does not happen in the future , also by remembering the lessons of history .
As George Santayana so famously said , " those who can not remember the past are doomed to repeat it . "
It is a fact that we cannot have another world war or the earth and humanity as we know it would cease to exist , as well as the rest of life on earth .
So , in order to ensure the future survival and health of the human race as well as the earth , we must learn to control the dark side of our own natures , and live in peace , as Martin Luther King Jr. says in the speech at Oberlin college .
" Dreams are the touchstones of our characters . " - Henry David Thoreau
" Truth alone will endure , all the rest will be swept away before the tide of time .
I must continue to bear testimony to truth even if I am forsaken by all .
Mine may today be a voice in the wilderness , but it will be heard when all other voices are silenced , if it is the voice of Truth . "
- Mahatma Gandhi
" When we let freedom ring , when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet , from every state and every city , we will be able to speed up that day when all of God 's children , black men and white men , Jews and Gentiles , Protestants and Catholics , will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual , " Free at last !
Free at last !
Thank God Almighty , we are free at last ! " " - Martin Luther King , Jr.
O , let America be America again --
The land that never has been yet --
And yet must be -- the land where every man is free .
The land that 's mine -- the poor man's , Indian's , Negro's , ME --
Who made America ,
Whose sweat and blood , whose faith and pain ,
Whose hand at the foundry , whose plow in the rain ,
Must bring back our mighty dream again .
Sure , call me any ugly name you choose --
The steel of freedom does not stain .
From those who live like leeches on the people 's lives ,

And yet I swear this oath --
America will be ! "

" Come , come , come
My endless desires
Come , come , come
Come my beloved
Come my sweetheart
Come , come , come
Do n't talk about the journey
Say no more of the path
The path one must take
You are my path
You are my journey
Come , come , come
You stole from this earth
A bouquet of roses
I am hidden in that bouquet
Come , come , come
As long as I am sober
And keep talking about good and bad
I am missing the most important event
Seeing your face
Come come come
I must be a moron
Missing this life
If I do n't cast my mind
In the fire of love
Come , come , come " - Mawlana Rumi

" An affectionate disposition not only makes the mind more peaceful and calm , but it affects our body in a positive way too .
On the other hand , hatred , jealousy and fear upset our peace of mind , make us agitated and affect our body adversely .
Even our body needs peace of mind and is not suited to agitation .
This shows that an appreciation for peace of mind is in our blood . "

Song of Joy for Paradise
Born in the Ocean of Worlds , Galaxies , Universes
Thousands of rose petals drift
In the sweet sunlit air and sky
Brought down from the mountains
On the wind change from across
The oceanic tides and the stories
Of sailors who wandered far
So that everything brings me to tears
And the thought and fear that I will never
Leave my birth country for distant lands
In search of the promise of treasure
For I am tied to my friends and family
Yet there are many winds to tempt
The imagination of a poor man's son
And I am the same as any other inside
With just the same chances to succeed
My family 's advice is permanent isolation
From myself as well as the rest of the world
But I will search for exquisite solitude instead
Go to the secret places in my mind
Where loneliness cannot corrupt me
Nor sorrow , fear , darkness , evil , hate
My heart is tied to the earth , love , poetry
The source of all that is , was , and shall be
Where my ancestors came from
To found a better life than the one
They had known across the ocean
From far away the wind brings its tales
Sailors who have wandered far from home
Myself among them , lost in the ether
The land of my birth only a memory
And all lost for the promise of treasure
My heart remains tied to my father 's country
But I have chosen to cross the ocean
In the desert temptations of flesh are many
The imagination of a poor farmer 's son is great
Yet I cannot deny the destiny of my soul

“ A phenomenal story of exploration and science .
Stunningly fascinating . " – Jon Stewart
Did you know there are at least 52 Ways to Die in a Cave ?
James M. Tabor 's new book , Blind Descent : The Quest to Discover the Deepest Place on Earth is a fascinating real - life adventure story .
In 2004 , two great scientist - explorers attempted to find the bottom of the world .
American Bill Stone took on the vast , deadly Cheve Cave in southern Mexico .
Ukrainian Alexander Klimchouk targeted Krubera , a freezing nightmare of a supercave in the war - torn former Soviet republic of Georgia .
Both men spent months almost two vertical miles deep , contending with thousand - foot drops , raging whitewater rivers , monstrous waterfalls , mile - long belly crawls , and the psychological horrors produced by weeks in absolute darkness , beyond all hope of rescue .
Based on his unprecedented access to logs and journals as well as hours of personal interviews , James Tabor has crafted a thrilling exploration of man ’s timeless urge to discover — and of two extraordinary men whose pursuit of greatness led them to the heights of triumph and the depths of tragedy .
Blind Descent is an unforgettable addition to the classic literature of true - life adventure , and a testament to human survival and endurance .

If there is such an insurance it is probably a term insurance .
Since all marriages are on the verge of breaking at the 7 - year mark , one should ladder marriages and corresponding insurances in 6 - year blocks .
You could even divorce and marry the same woman more than once ; just not adjacent times to avoid accusations of the insurance fraud .
Let 's say that over your lifetime you will marry 6 different women , A , B , C , D , E , and F .
The pattern of marriages ( and divorces ) could be as follows :
A , B , A , C , A , D , C , E , D , F .
You get ten 6 - year marriages from the ages of 29 to 89 , at which time you divorce F and immediately die .

Every joke has a bit of a joke .
...
The rest is the truth .
( Marat F )
Are you ready for a lot more turmoil ?
You had better be -- because there 's a good chance that 's what you 're going to get .
Nobody knows for certain , of course .
All stock - market predictions need to be taken with a little salt .
But there are reasons to suspect that the sudden plunges of the past few weeks may be unhappy omens of what 's to come .
...
I have to admit : I am a sucker for nice APIs .
And , yes , I am sort of in love with some of my own creations .
Well , at least until I find the flaws and cannot remove them due to binary compatibility issues ( see Soprano ) .
This may sound a bit egomaniac but let ’s face it : we almost never get credit for good API or good API documentation .
So we need to congratulate ourselves .
My new pet is the Nepomuk Query API .
As its name says it can be used to query Nepomuk resources and sets out to replace as many hard coded SPARQL queries as possible .
It started out rather simple : matching a set of resources with different types of terms .
But then Dario Freddi and his relatively complex telepathy queries came along .
So the challenge began .
I tried to bend the existing API as much as possible to fit in the features he requested .
One thing let to another , I suddenly found myself in need of optional terms and a few days later things were not as simple as they started out any more .
ComparisonTerm already was the most complex term in the query API .
But that did not mean much .
Basically you could set a property and a sub term and that was it .
On Monday it became a bit more beastly .
Now you can invert it , force the name of the variable used , give it a sort weight , change the sort order , and even set an aggregate function .
And all that on only one type of term .
At least I implemented optional terms separately .
To explain what all this is good for I will try to illustrate it with a few examples :
Say you want to find all tags a specifc file has ( and ignore the fact that there is a Nepomuk : : Resource : : tags method ) .
This was not possible before inverted comparison terms came along .
Now all you have to do is :
Nepomuk : : Query ::ComparisonTerm tagTerm ( Soprano :: Vocabulary :: NAO ::hasTag( ) , Nepomuk : : Query :: ResourceTerm(myFile ) ) ; tagTerm.setInverted ( true ) ; Nepomuk : : Query : : Query ( tagTerm ) ;
What happens is that subject and object change places in the ComparisonTerm , thus , the resulting SPARQL query looks something like the following :
select ?r where { < myFile > nao: hasTag ?r . }
Simple but effective and confusing .
It gets better .
Previously we only had the clumsy Query : : addRequestProperty to get additional bindings from the query .
It is very restricted as it only allows to query direct relations from the results .
With ComparisonTerm::setVariableName we now have the generic counterpart .
By setting a variable name this variable is included in the bindings of the final query and can be retrieved via Result : : additionalBinding .
This allows to retrieve any detail from any part of the query .
Again we use the most simple example to illustrate :
Nepomuk : : Query ::ComparisonTerm labelTerm ( Soprano :: Vocabulary :: NAO:: prefLabel( ) , Nepomuk : : Query :: Term ( ) ) ; labelTerm.setVariableName( " label " ) ; Nepomuk : : Query ::ComparisonTerm tagTerm ( Soprano :: Vocabulary :: NAO ::hasTag ( ) , labelTerm ) ; tagTerm.setInverted ( true ) ; Nepomuk : : Query : : Query query ( tagTerm ) ;
This query lists all tags including their labels .
Again the resulting SPARQL query would look something like the following :
select ?r ?label where { < myFile > nao: hasTag ?v1 . ?v1 nao : prefLabel ?label . }
And silently I used another little gimmick that I introduced : ComparisonTerm can now handle invalid properties and invalid sub terms which will simply act as wildcards ( or be represented by a variable in SPARQL terms ) .
Now on to the next feature : sort weights .
The idea is simple : you can sort the search results using any value matched by a ComparisonTerm .
So let ’s extend the above query by sorting the tags according to their labels .
labelTerm.setSortWeight( 1 ) ;
And the resulting SPARQL query will reflect the sorting :
select ?r ?label where { < myFile > nao: hasTag ?v1 . ?v1 nao : prefLabel ?label .
} order by ?label
Here I used a sort weight of 1 since I only have the one term that includes sorting .
But in theory you can include any number of ComparisonTerms in the sorting .
The higher the weight the more important the sort order .
We are nearly done .
Only one feature is left : aggregate functions .
The Virtuoso SPARQL extensions ( and SPARQL 1.1 , too ) support aggregate functions like count or max .
These are now supported in ComparisonTerm .
They are only useful in combination with a forced variable name in which case they will be included in the additional bindings or with a sort weight .
If we go back to our tags we could for example count the number of tags each file has attached :
Nepomuk : : Query ::ComparisonTerm tagTerm ( Soprano :: Vocabulary :: NAO ::hasTag( ) , Nepomuk : : Query :: ResourceTypeTerm( Soprano:: Vocabulary:: NAO::Tag( ) ) ) ; tagTerm.setAggregateFunction ( Nepomuk :: Query ::ComparisonTerm:: Count ) ; tagTerm.setVariableName(" cnt " ) ; Nepomuk : : Query : : Query ( tagTerm ) ;
And the resulting SPARQL query will be along the lines of :
select ?r count ( ?
v1 ) as ?
cnt where { ?r nao: hasTag ?v1 . ?v1 a nao : Tag . }
Now we can of course sort by number of tags :
tagTerm.setSortWeight(1 , Qt:: DescendingOrder ) ;
And we get :
select ?r count ( ?
v1 ) as ?
cnt where { ?r nao: hasTag ?v1 . ?v1 a nao : Tag .
} order by desc ?
cnt
And just because it is fun , let us make the tagging optional so we also get files with zero tags ( be aware that normally one should have at least one non-optional term in the query to get useful results .
In this case we are on the safe side since we are using a FileQuery ) :
Nepomuk : : Query ::ComparisonTerm tagTerm ( Soprano :: Vocabulary :: NAO ::hasTag( ) , Nepomuk : : Query :: ResourceTypeTerm( Soprano:: Vocabulary:: NAO::Tag( ) ) ) ; tagTerm.setAggregateFunction ( Nepomuk : : Query ::ComparisonTerm:: Count ) ; tagTerm.setVariableName(" cnt " ) ; tagTerm.setSortWeight( 1 , Qt:: DescendingOrder ) ; Nepomuk : : Query :: FileQuery ( Nepomuk :: Query : : OptionalTerm::optionalizeTerm(tagTerm ) ) ;
And with the SPARQL result of this beauty I finish my little session of self - congratulations :
select ?r count ( ?
v1 ) as ?
cnt where { ?r a nfo : FileDataObject .
OPTIONAL { ?r nao: hasTag ?v1 . ?v1 a nao : Tag . } . } order by desc ?
cnt
I do n’t know about you , but I ’m tired of this series .
At first they were fresh and a decent translation from a video game into a film .
While the series has enjoyed enough success to warrant a shameful third outing and even a fourth , it makes one wonder why ?
They are n’t terrible films , but they are n’t great either , and at this point , they ’ve veered so far from the video game series , that I seriously wish they ’d change the name .
That being said , this new trailer does manage to spark an interest in me , and the hope that they ’ve fixed the issues they encountered with the last film .
See , it could be worse .
The flick is set to come out on Sept 10th of this year , so we ’ll just have to wait and see .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Ever wonder why overhearing a cellphone conversation is so annoying ?
American researchers think they have found the answer .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Whether it is the office , on a train or in a car , only half of the conversation is overheard which drains more attention and concentration than when overhearing two people talking , according to scientists at Cornell University .
“ We have less control to move away our attention from half a conversation ( or halfalogue ) than when listening to a dialogue , ” said Lauren Emberson , a co-author of the study that will be published in the journal Psychological Science .
“ Since halfalogues really are more distracting and you can’t tune them out , this could explain why people are irritated , ” she said in an interview .
Last year Americans spent 2.3 trillion minutes chatting on cellphones , according to the U.S. wireless trade association CTIA -- a ninefold increase since 2000 .
Worldwide , there are about 4.6 billion cellphone subscribers , according to the International Telecommunications Union , a U.N. agency .
The number is equal to about two - thirds of the world ’s population , leaving few corners of the globe where public spaces are free of mobile - tethered babblers .
China has the most cellphone users with 634 million , followed by India with 545 million and the United States with 270 million , figures from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) show .
Emberson said people try to make sense of snippets of conversation and predict what speakers will say next .
“ When you hear half of a conversation , you get less information and you ca n’t predict as well , ” she said .
“ It requires more attention . ”
The findings by Emberson and her co-author Michael Goldstein are based on research involving 41 college students who did concentration exercises , like tracking moving dots , while hearing one or both parties during a cellphone conversation .
The students made more errors when they heard one speaker ’s side of the conversation than when overheard the entire dialogue .
The study shows that overhearing a cellphone conversation affects the attention we use in our daily tasks , including driving , Emberson said .
“ These results suggest that a driver ’s attention can be impaired by a passenger ’s cell phone conversation , ” according to the study .
It recommends similar studies should be conducted with driving simulators .

New Orleans , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
A fisherman who was hospitalized after becoming ill while cleaning up oil in the Gulf of Mexico has filed a temporary restraining order in federal court against oil company BP .
John Wunstell Jr. , is asking BP to give the workers masks and not harass workers who publicly voice their health concerns .
Wunstell , a shrimper , said he was paid by BP to use his boat , Ramie 's Wish , to clean up oil that has been gushing into the Gulf since an oil rig sank about 40 miles off the Louisiana coast , gushing an estimated 19,000 barrels ( 798 , 000 gallons ) of crude a day .
In an affidavit , Wunstell wrote he started experiencing severe headaches and nasal irritation on May 24 .
Over the next few days , he also developed nosebleeds , an upset stomach , and aches .
On Friday , Wunstell was airlifted to West Jefferson Medical Center in Marrero , Louisiana , where he remained hospitalized Sunday .
Eight other workers were brought to the hospital this week and were all released .
" We need to start protecting these guys , " said Jim Klick , Wunstell 's lawyer .
In his affidavit , Wunstell described his experience at the hospital .
" At West Jefferson , there were tents set up outside the hospital , where I was stripped of my clothing , washed with water and several showers , before I was allowed into the hospital , " Wunstell said .
" When I asked for my clothing , I was told that BP had confiscated all of my clothing and it would not be returned . "
The restraining order requests that BP refrain from " altering , testing or destroying clothing or any other evidence or potential evidence " when workers become ill .
Graham MacEwen , a spokesman for BP , said he could not comment on the restraining order , or on allegations that BP confiscated clothing .
He denied accusations from Clint Guidry , president of the Louisiana Shrimpers Association , that BP has been threatening workers who speak out about health concerns .
Fishermen contacted by CNN have declined to speak publicly .
Some , who are making as much as $ 3,000 a day cleaning up the oil , have said they fear losing their jobs with BP .
" The BP oil spill wiped out their professions and their jobs this year and possibly years down the road , " Klick said .
" The only work they can get right now is with BP . "
The BP spokesman said there have been no threats against workers for speaking out .
" If they have any concerns , they should raise them with their supervisors , " MacEwen said .
" They can also call the joint information center and make complaints anonymously . "
Wunstell is one of nine clean - up workers who were sent to the hospital with symptoms such as shortness of breath , nose and throat irritation , headaches , and dizziness .
The restraining order requests that BP stop using dispersants without providing " appropriate personal protective equipment " to workers .
Corexit , a dispersant , is being sprayed into the Gulf to break down the oil .
The safety data information sheet from the manufacturer states that people should " avoid breathing in vapor " from Corexit , and that masks should be work when Corexit is present in certain concentrations in the air .
BP has not supplied workers with masks when they work near the oil and dispersants .
" We 're been carrying out very extensive air quality since early on in this exercise , to make sure that we have working safe conditions , and thus far not found situations where there are air quality concerns that would require face masks , " MacEwen said .
He added that workers who want to wear masks are " free to do so " as long as they receive instructions from their supervisors on how to use them .
According to Guidry from the shrimpers ' association , BP told workers they were not allowed to wear masks .
" Some of our men asked , and they were told they'd be fired if they wore masks , " he said .
Tony Hayward , the chief executive officer of BP , offered another explanation for the fishermen 's illness : spoiled food .
" Food poisoning is clearly a big issue , " Hayward said Sunday .
" It 's something we 've got to be very mindful of .
It 's one of the big issues of keeping the Army operating .
You know , the Army marches on their stomachs . "
An expert on foodborne illness cast doubt on Hayward 's theory .
" Headaches , shortness of breath , nosebleeds -- there 's nothing there that suggests foodborne illness , " said Dr. Michael Osterholm , a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health .
" I do n't know what these people have , but it sounds more like a respiratory illness . "

Who said babies have to be expensive ?
I am due in a few weeks with baby # 3 and let me tell you that I have learned that you do n’t need most of the baby stuff that stores try to sell .
Especially when it comes to toys .
Babies tend to want to play with everything and anything and it does n’t matter if it is a $ 50 toy or one that you make for free .
I love these simple DIY baby toys from around the web .
Most can be made for free or nearly free with items that you already have at home .
Your little one is sure to love playing with these toys and best of all , when they outgrow them you wo n’t have to feel bad about putting them in the recycling bin .
Are There Too Many Deal Of The Day Sites Around ?
It ’s a familiar Internet store model : a single product at a discounted price , on sale for just 24 hours .
But just how many such sites can Australia sustain ?
Picture by sally_12
At media blog Mumbrella , Camille Alacorn discusses the recent glut of new sites such as Ouffer .
Her conclusion ?
This could be a case of too much of a good thing :
Do n’t get me wrong , it ’s a great idea and in the US it ’s now estimated to be worth $ 5 bn per annum .
But Australia is nowhere nearly as big as that market .
In order for these sites to survive , much less expand and grow around the country – as some of cases may be – aggressive brand differentiation will be key .
But even having said that , my guess is the likelihood of all of these sites surviving will be slim indeed .
It ’s a fair argument , but it makes me wonder : what kind of features and products would you want on this kind of site ?
Are there already too many out there , or do the existing players need shaking up with some competition ?
Tell us your thoughts in the comments .
Did you see that gap in the market ?
Oh wait , it ’s gone [ Mumbrella ]
600 light years away , in the constellation of Auriga , there is a star in some ways similar to our Sun .
It 's a shade hotter ( by about 800° C ) , more massive , and older .
Oddly , it appears to be laced with heavy elements : more oxygen , aluminum , and so on , than might be expected .
A puzzle .
Then , last year , it was discovered that this star had a planet orbiting it .
A project called WASP - Wide Area Search for Planets , a UK telescope system that searches for exoplanets -- noticed that the star underwent periodic dips in its light .
This indicates that a planet circles the star , and when the planet gets between the star and us , it blocks a tiny fraction of the starlight .
The planet is a weirdo , for many reasons ... but it wo n't be weird for too much longer .
That 's because the star is eating it .
What WASP 12b may look like .
OK , first , the planet .
Called WASP 12b , it was instantly pegged as an oddball .
The orbit is only 1.1 days long !
Compare that to our own 365 day orbit , or even Mercury 's 88 days to circle the Sun .
This incredibly short orbital period means this planet is practically touching the surface of its star as it sweeps around at over 220 km/sec ( 130 miles / sec ) !
That also means it must be very hot ; models indicate that the temperature at its cloud tops would be in excess of 2200 °C ( 4000° F ) .
Not only that , but other numbers were odd , too .
WASP 12b was found to be a bit more massive and bigger than Jupiter ; about 1.8 times its size and 1.4 times its mass .
That 's too big !
Models indicate that planets this massive have a funny state of matter in them ; they are so compressible that if you add mass , the planet does n't really get bigger , it just gets denser .
In other words , you could double Jupiter 's mass and its size would n't increase appreciably , but since the mass goes up , so would its density .
But WASP 12b is n't like that .
In fact , it has a lower density than Jupiter , and is a lot bigger !
Something must be going on ... and when you see a lot of weird things all sitting in one place , it makes sense to assume they 're connected .
In this case it 's true : that planet is frakking hot , and that 's at the heart of this mess .
Heating a planet that much would not exactly be conducive to its well - being .
When you heat a gas it expands , which would explain WASP 12 b's big size .
It 's puffy !
But being all bloated that close to a star turns out to be bad for your health .
Astronomers used Hubble to observe the planet in the ultraviolet and found clear signs of all sorts of heavy elements , including sodium , tin , aluminum , magnesium , and manganese , as well as , weirdly , ytterbium * .
Moreover , they could tell from the data that these elements existed in a cloud surrounding the planet , like an extended atmosphere going outward for hundreds of thousands of kilometers .
That 's a long way from the planet .
Any atom of , say , manganese that far from the planet would be caught in a tug - of - war between the gravity of the planet and the star ... and the star would win .
The gravity of the star is drawing material off the planet in a vast stream , or , in other words , the planet is getting slowly eaten by its star .
If astronomers ever get around to giving this planet an actual name , I suggest Sarlacc† .
This explains the peculiar high abundance of heavy metals in the star I mentioned at the beginning of this post ; they come from the planet !
But not for long .
Given the mass of the planet and the density of the stream , it looks like it has roughly ten million years left .
At that point , supper 's over : there wo n't be anything left for the star to eat .
In reality it 's hard to say exactly what will happen ; there may be a rocky / metal core to the planet that will survive .
But even that is so close to the star that it will be a molten blob of goo .
The way orbits work , the way the dance of gravity plays out over time , the planet itself may actually be drawn inexorably closer to its star .
Remember , too , the star is old , and will soon start to expand into a red giant .
So the planet is falling and the star is rising ; eventually the two will meet and the planet will meet a fiery death .
All in all , it sucks to be WASP 12b .
But it 's cool to be an astronomer !
Only 15 years ago we had no idea that there were other planets orbiting Sunlike stars , and now we know of over 400 , and a lot of them are really , really bizarro .
When I was a kid I watched Star Trek and read a lot of science fiction , and I remember thinking that the planets in them were too weird ; there was no way anything like them could actually exist .
Ha !
The Universe , as usual , is smarter and more clever than we are .
There 's a lot of strange out there , and the more we look , the more we find .
^* Admit it : you did n't even know that was an element .
^† Yes , I know , Star Wars fanbois , that that would be a better name for the star and not the planet , since Sarlacc was the creature that did the digesting , and was not itself digested .
But if the star were Sarlacc , the planet would have to be named Boba Fett , and that 's just silly .

Aboriginal elders are calling a dead creature that washed up on the shores of their remote community a bad omen of things to come -- although nobody seems to be able to identify the water - logged carcass from photos .
Not that there 's a lack of opinion on the matter .
Some think it may be kin to a mythical creature like Ogopogo .
But most theories on the Internet , including on CTV.ca , peg it as a beaver , a muskrat , a possum , or any other rodent - like animal that may have been diseased or misshapen by decomposition .
The photos went viral after an Ontario First Nations community south of Hudson Bay released pictures of the rat - like creature that a dog sniffed out from a local creek earlier this month .
Pictures posted to the website of the Big Trout Lake community show a long and skinny creature with brown fur and a bald , pale face .
The animal is about " a foot long " according to the official community website .
The creature was found when two nurses were hiking near a local creek .
Their dog Sam saw something in the water and dragged the creature out .
Darryl Sainnawap , a First Nations council member for Big Trout Lake , said he can't confirm stories by some community members -- including his great uncle -- about sightings of a strange animal roaming swampy areas and feeding on beavers .
" Keep in mind that was about 60 years ago , " Sainnawap told CTV News Channel from Big Trout Lake , adding : " I 've never seen the creature myself , nor has my grandfather or most of the community . "
Sainnawap did say , however , that this creature 's appearance is being interpreted by some elders as a " bad omen " for the community .
The community website states : " No one knows what it is but our ancestors used to call it the Ugly One .
Rarely seen but when seen , it 's a bad omen .
Something bad will happen according to our ancestors . "
Sainnawap said one of the two nurses – who are n't from the area -- described a " foul odour " emanating from the creature 's carcass .
The pair did not attempt to move the creature because they believed it was an animal common to the area .
The nurses eventually realized they had taken photos of an unfamiliar , possibly rare animal .
But when they returned to the rocky shoreline it was gone .
And their photos are the only evidence left of the mystery creature .
The story of the creature found in the Oji-Cree community of 1,200 has started to be picked up by news organizations and websites across the world including The Herald Sun in Australia , China 's Xinhua News Agency and The Sun in London .
Online commenters have suggested the mystery creature could be either a water - logged bear cub or an otter .
NASA 's basic research capabilities are lagging to the point that they 're putting the space agency 's missions in jeopardy , according to a National Research Council report released this week .
On Tuesday , the council , which is associated with the National Academy of Science , the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine , called on Congress and NASA to upgrade the space agency 's research equipment and operations .
The report noted that more than 80 % of the research facilities at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Glenn Research Center , Langley Research Center , Ames Research Center , Marshall Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory are more than 40 years old and need " significant " upgrades .
It also said that improvements to annual maintenance procedures are needed .
Moreover , the council found that the declining state of NASA 's research facilities has forced the agency to increasingly rely on third - party contractors to work on projects .
" Solid basic research has always been a critical component for advancing NASA 's missions , " said John Best , co-chair of the committee that wrote the report , in a statement .
" To ensure future success , it 's imperative that NASA restore and maintain its basic research laboratories . "
The report does not say how much NASA needs to spend to upgrade its facilities .
NASA officials have not yet responded to a request for comment on the report .
The report comes on the heels of the release of President Barack Obama 's proposed budget that calls for NASA to abandon plans to return humans to the moon and instead focus on sending astronauts to Mars and farther into the solar system .
The proposed fiscal 2011 federal budget also calls for NASA to contract with commercial companies to build space taxis .
The administration 's plan , though , does call for spending more money on robotics research , and for developing next - generation engines to run the commercially built spacecraft .
Yesterday 's report might put another crimp in the administration 's plans if money needs to be rerouted to upgrading NASA 's research facilities .
According to the report from the National Research Council , NASA is looking at a " staggering " repair and maintenance bill .
Federal funding for maintenance , repairs and upgrades of NASA research facilities is currently " well below " accepted industry guidelines .
The maintenance problem has already compromised safety at NASA facilities , especially for personnel who work with the space agency 's massive , high - powered equipment .
" NASA should find a solution to these issues before any catastrophic failures occur that could seriously impact missions and research operations , " the report adds .

This is Vic Gundotra , vice president of engineering with Android .
And he 's about to say something you need to listen to .
Something you all need to listen to .
And when he 's finished , go back and listen to it again .
And when your ears are done steaming and you 're through stomping your feet into the ground , listen to it again .
Carriers need time to organize and test software updates , people .
Your phone is just one of many , and it needs to be done right .
And Vic does an excellent job explaining why carriers need time to get out the latest and greatest version of Android .
All that said , we definitely feel your frustration at the wait , and there are some phones -- cough , Xperia X10 -- that take far longer to update than is practical for a consumer to consider .
Anyhoo , check out the video after the break .
Frazil ice looks like patches of snow , nestled among the trees .
But it 's actually a Slushee - esque mixture of ice crystals that form in bitterly cold waters — like the kind that run through Yosemite National Park in early spring .
Watching this video , you can see how frazil ice can appear to be just your average slushy creek water , and , the next minute , turns into what looks like solid ( if snowy ) ground .
And then the ground moves .
If you 're thinking that it 's potentially dangerous , you 'd be right .
In the video , park rangers talk about the risk of falling through frazil ice into frigid water deeper than your head .

Strange nature at Boing Boing :
Some 33 days , nearly a billion dollars of expenditure , and umpteen official statements after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig blew up in the Gulf of Mexico – and the world is still none the wiser about how many millions of gallons of oil are leaking into the ocean every day , how much has already been discharged into the sea , and – more to the point – how this , maybe the world 's worst oil disaster , can be stopped .
As scientists revise upward their guesstimates of the daily spill of crude into the sea ( with some putting it as high as three million gallons a day ) , and BP halving its assessment of how much of the leak it is capturing , the attempts to deal with the disaster are , despite America 's best efforts alongside one of the world 's premier corporations , proving unequal to the task .
On Tuesday , BP engineers will attempt to plug the spewing well 5,000 ft down on the ocean floor by spraying mud and cement into it .
If that fails , there is a back - up plan which sounds about as hi-tech as throwing snowballs at the moon .
It is called the " junk shot " , and consists of trying to clog the well with golf balls , shredded tyres , and other refuse up to and including human hair .
It has , more than a month after the calamity began , come to this .
And , with the frustration and impotence comes anger .
President Obama raised the possibility of criminal prosecutions in his weekly radio address yesterday , saying : " First and foremost , what led to this disaster was a breakdown of responsibility on the part of BP and perhaps others , including Transocean and Halliburton . "
Meanwhile , untold quantities of oil are creeping slowly ashore .
Yesterday , sheets of rust - coloured heavy oil started to clog fragile marshlands on the fringes of the Mississippi Delta , damaging fishing grounds and wildlife .
Brown and orange globs and sheets of foul - smelling oil the consistency of latex paint have also begun coating the reeds and grasses of Louisiana 's wetlands , home to rare birds , mammals and a rich variety of marine life .
A deep , stagnant ooze sat in the middle of a particularly devastated marsh off the Louisiana coast , where Emily Guidry Schatzel of the National Wildlife Federation was examining stained reeds .
" This is just heartbreaking , " she said .
" I ca n't believe it . "
And on Grand Isle , Louisiana , officials closed the public beach , as thick gobs of oil resembling melted chocolate washed up .
BP , in charge of the cleanup , said that it will be at least Tuesday before engineers can shoot mud into the blown - out well .
This has been tried on land , but never 5,000 ft underwater .
Crews will shoot the mud into a crippled piece of equipment atop the well .
Then engineers will direct cement at the well to stop the oil permanently .
BP executives say the only guaranteed solution to stop the leak is a pair of relief wells crews have already started drilling , but the work will not be complete until August .
As if BP were n't facing enough financial exposure , an exclusive report by a US news bureau yesterday warned that the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is considering banning the company from new government contracts , which could cost the oil giant billions in future revenues .
Supplying the US army with oil is one of BP 's biggest markets , and further exploration in the oil - rich Gulf of Mexico is part of its long - term strategy .
David Strahan , oil specialist and author of The Last Oil Shock , said yesterday : " If the US does ban BP from new contracts , this is serious bad news for it , as it could prompt other countries to boycott the company .
The US is crucial to BP and the irony of the latest catastrophe is that it has happened in a safe country , whereas BP is used to battling it out in more dangerous countries like Russia and Iraq . "
BP is already fighting to salvage its reputation after the oil spill which has seen its shares plunge as the daily cost of the rescue operation mounts .
Around £ 27bn has been wiped off the value of the energy giant since the Gulf disaster , and BP estimates the daily cost is around £ 6 m while independent analysts have put the total cost of the clean - up as high as $ 12bn .
It has become reality that you do n’t have time for your house and not able to manage the cleanliness of your house and you have to get the services from the cleaning services and have to pay for it .
So then how you would manage your office defiantly you have to hire the cleaning services for your house too and why not you should get the services for office because it has so much benefits …

Timo Glock and Lucas di Grassi will both be given five - place grid penalties at the Spanish Grand Prix after their Virgin Racing team failed to notify the FIA about its intended gear ratios in time .
F1 teams are supposed to notify the FIA 's technical delegate about the gear ratios that the team will be using for the rest of the weekend within two hours of the end of Friday 's free practice session .
Virgin Racing failed to do that , which is a breach of the sport 's technical regulations .
The race stewards issued a statement on Saturday morning stating that both Glock and di Grassi would be handed five place grid penalties .
With the Gulf Coast dying of oil poisoning , there ’s no space in the press for British Petroleum ’s latest spill , just this week : over 100,000 gallons , at its Alaska pipeline operation .
A hundred thousand used to be a lot .
Still is .
On Tuesday , Pump Station 9 , at Delta Junction on the 800 - mile pipeline , busted .
Thousands of barrels began spewing an explosive cocktail of hydrocarbons after “ procedures were n’t properly implemented ” by BP operators , say state inspectors “ Procedures were n’t properly implemented ” is , it seems , BP ’s company motto .
Few Americans know that BP owns the controlling stake in the trans - Alaska pipeline ; but , unlike with the Deepwater Horizon , BP keeps its Limey name off the Big Pipe .
There ’s another reason to keep their name off the Pipe : their management of the pipe stinks .
It ’s corroded , it ’s undermanned and “ basic maintenance ” is a term BP never heard of .
How does BP get away with it ?
The same way the Godfather got away with it : bad things happen to folks who blow the whistle .
BP has a habit of hunting down and destroying the careers of those who warn of pipeline problems .
In one case , BP ’s CEO of Alaskan operations hired a former CIA expert to break into the home of a whistleblower , Chuck Hamel , who had complained of conditions at the pipe ’s tanker facility .
BP tapped his phone calls with a US congressman and ran a surveillance and smear campaign against him .
When caught , a US federal judge said BP ’s acts were “ reminiscent of Nazi Germany . ”
This was not an isolated case .
Captain James
Woodle , once in charge of the pipe ’s Valdez terminus , was blackmailed into resigning the post when he complained of disastrous conditions there .
The weapon used on Woodle was a file of faked evidence of marital infidelity .
Nice guys , eh ?
Two decades ago , I had the unhappy job of leading an investigation of British Petroleum ’s management of the Alaska pipeline system .
I was working for the Chugach villages , the Alaskan Natives who own the shoreline slimed by the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker grounding .
Even then , a courageous , steel - eyed government inspector , Dan Lawn , was hollering about corrosion all through the BP pipeline .
I say “ courageous ” because Lawn kept his job only because his union ’s lawyers have kept BP from having his head .
It was n’t until 2006 , 17 years later , that BP claimed to have suddenly discovered corrosion necessitating an emergency shut - down of the line .
It was pretty darn hard for BP to claim surprise in August 2006 that corrosion required shutting the pipeline .
Five months earlier , Inspector Lawn had written his umpteenth warning when he identified corrosion as the cause of a big leak .
BP should have known about the problem years before that … if only because they had taped Dan Lawn ’s home phone calls .
BP : Red , White and Bush
I do n’t want readers to think BP is a foreign marauder unconcerned about America .
The company is deeply involved in our democracy .
Bob Malone , until last year the Chairman of BP America , was also Alaska State Co-Chairman of the Bush re-election campaign .
Mr. Bush , in turn , was so impressed with BP ’s care of Alaska ’s environment that he pushed again to open the state ’s arctic wildlife refuge ( ANWR ) to drilling by the BP consortium .
You can go to Alaska today and see for yourself the evidence of BP ’s care of the wilderness .
You can smell it : the crude oil is still on the beaches from the Exxon Valdez spill .
Exxon took all the blame for the spill because they were dumb enough to have the company ’s name on the ship .
But it was BP ’s pipeline managers who filed reports that oil spill containment equipment was sitting right at the site of the grounding near Bligh Island .
However , the reports were bogus , the equipment was n’t there and so the beaches were poisoned .
At the time , our investigators uncovered four - volumes worth of faked safety reports and concluded that BP was at least as culpable as Exxon for the 1,200 miles of oil - destroyed coastline .
Nevertheless , we know BP cares about nature because they have lots of photos of solar panels in their annual reports – and they ’ve painted every one of their gas stations green .
The green paint - job is supposed to represent the oil giant ’s love of Mother Nature .
But CEO Tony Hayward knows it stands for the color of the Yankee dollar .
In 2006 , BP finally discovered the dangerous corrosion in the pipeline after running a “ smart pig ” through it .
The “ pig ” is an electronic drone that BP should have been using continuously , though they had not done so for 14 years .
Another “ procedure not properly implemented . ”
By not properly inspecting the pipeline for over a decade , BP failed to prevent that March 2006 spill which polluted Prudhoe Bay .
And cheaping out on remote controls for their oil well blow - out preventers appears to have cost the lives of 11 men on the Deepwater Horizon .
But then , failure to implement proper safety procedures has saved BP , not millions but billions of dollars , suggests that the company ’s pig is indeed , very , very smart .
Greg Palast investigated charges of fraud by BP and Exxon in the grounding of the Exxon Valdez for Alaska ’s Chugach Natives .
Palast ’s investigation of Chevron ’s oil drilling operations in the Amazon for BBC Television Newsnight is included in the DVD compendium Palast Investigates .
Palast ’s investigations are supported in part by the Puffin and Cloud Mountain Foundations and the Palast Investigative Fund , a 501c3 charitable trust .

The Blank - Check Boom Poses Pitfalls for Investors

From David Rosenberg , and verbatim agreement with what Zero Hedge has been discussing for almost one year .
Also , even with gold down , note the price action in PHYS .
Here ’s the deal on gold .
When we had the post - Lehman collapse , gold fell from $ 900 to $ 720 an ounce but it still managed to outperform other commodities and rise in many other currencies , outside the U.S. dollar .
That post - Lehman collapse phase was a giant margin call where investors sold their winners , like precious metals , and on top that , there was insatiable appetite for dollars from the global banking system caught short of greenbacks .
What is happening today is truly fascinating .
Gold has broken out to the upside even as the U.S. dollar has done likewise on the back of a renewed flight - to - safety bid .
What this means , of course , is that gold has managed to hit new highs even as , ( i ) the U.S. dollar has risen , which means gold is breaking out against all major currencies ; and , ( ii ) other industrial commodities , such as oil and copper , have slumped from their recent highs .
So what this all means is that gold is no longer being considered as part of a resource complex that is outperforming the segment but is increasingly being viewed as a currency of its own .
Moreover , with the growth rate of fiat currencies globally being met with a skeptical eye by investors , especially now that we know that if the ECB , of all central banks , can engage in debt monetization ( those clinging to the belief that this was modeled after the Bundesbank have been clearly duped ) , the one thing we do know about gold is that most of it is already above ground and that production peaked a decade ago .
In other words , investors have more faith in what the shape and direction of the supply curve for bullion looks like relative to individual country money supply growth .
This is why deflation is good for gold — the reflationary efforts provide a big boost .
Even without the interventionist efforts to monetize the debts , as long as policy rates are near - zero , gold leasing rates will do likewise .
While FDR fixed the dollar price of gold in the 1930s , we know that bullion doubled in Sterling terms during that deflationary cycle .
Gold is a hedge against instability of all kinds — do n’t think for a second that deflation does not engender instability whether it be financial , economic or political .
To be sure , gold is also a hedge against inflation — but that is going to come much , much later and will be the icing on the cake .
While I am concerned near - term that gold is overbought and could be ripe for a setback ; however , unlike the equity market , bullion is in a secular bull market , which means dips , when they occur , are to be bought .
Gold can trade down to $ 1,130 an ounce and none of the trendlines would be broken .
More to the point , secular bull markets usually end in parabolic blowoffs and we are nowhere near that point — see the chart below for what long - term trough / peak moves across different asset classes looked like in the past and tell us that gold is now in a bubble .
Not a chance .
And , as we have said in the past , if central banks were to ever be compelled to hold the same share of gold in reserves to back up their respective monetary aggregates , the gold price would rise to $ 3,000 an ounce .
Believe it or not , $ 3000 an ounce on gold may yet prove to be a conservative forecast .
If the gold price to world GDP ratio were to ever scale up to the peak three decades ago , it would imply an ultimate peak of $ 5,300 an ounce .
Even better if the relationship between gold and the M3 money measure where to revert to the 1990 high , gold would move to $ 5,700 an ounce .
A more cautious projection would merely put gold on the same footing as the CPI , and heading back to the previous peaks in this ratio would suggest $ 2,300 as the peak in gold — only a double from here .
Or perhaps the gold price - M1 ratio is one that should be considered and even here gold would go to $ 3,100 per ounce under the proviso that prior highs get reestablished .

spotting the illuminati on saturn ’s north pole
Mike Adams thinks he might have found an Illuminati symbol on Saturn .
But not really .
But totally yes .
But maybe not .
But maybe .
If you ’re interested in space in any way , shape or form , you ’ve probably heard of the hexagon on Saturn , a very odd phenomena in which storm clouds swirling around the planet ’s north pole are arranged in a very neat , six sided formation .
Ok , it ’s pretty and there are a lot of complex fluid dynamics involved in making storms line up in a hexagon but hey , weather on gas giants is really bizarre in the first place .
Other than the odd shape , what could be so special about these clouds ?
Well , according our favorite self - appointed guru of all things natural and unnatural , Mike Adams , not only does the hexagon on Saturn bear the manifestation of the All Seeing Eye , it ’s also persuasive proof of intelligent design in the universe around us .
To say that the woo is strong with our airheaded New Age crusader would be an understatement , especially after seeing how his train of what I quite honestly hesitate to call thought unfolds into an exercise in pseudoscientific and spiritual pareidolia .
First , let ’s establish the facts of the matter .
The figures regarding the hexagon on Saturn are correct and it ’s an immense structure about 15,000 miles across and 60 miles thick .
If it were placed on our world , it would start at ground level and end somewhere around the Karman line , the recognized beginning of space .
Almost four Earths could float on the hexagon ’s surface and the cyclone ’s gusts can reach about 300 miles per hour .
It ’s a very powerful and complex storm , but scientists have been able to replicate how it could form a hexagon , as well as a variety of other shapes in the lab by simulating the dynamics which affect gas giants with very thick atmospheres .
It all comes down to the difference in the rotational speeds of different storm belts and with the right conditions , you can not only get hexagons but triangles , ovals and septagons too .
Cool ?
Absolutely !
The kind of miracle that could only be indicative of supernatural design ?
Not in the slightest .
But of course , it ’s not just the hexagon that has Mike ’s attention , but something even stranger …
Inside the hexagon there ’s a three - sided pyramid shape .
It appears quite clearly as a triangle set against the background of the hexagon .
Imagine a pyramid placed on top of the hexagon and you ’ll see it .
There ’s even more :
Inside the pyramid is the shape of the all - seeing eye .
You can clearly see it in the center of the pyramid shape , which is inside the hexagon .
Do you recognize this all - seeing eye with the pyramid ?
If not , just whip out a dollar bill from your pocket and glance at the back .
There it is !
Yes , your U.S. currency contains the exact same image .
Wow .
Did he really just connect the hexagon on Saturn to the Great Seal of the United States ?
Hold on , let me get out my conspiracy bingo card and start playing Six Degrees of Illuminati .
Since when has a triangle been a pyramid ?
Sure , there are three sided pyramids but they look very different from the kind of pyramid Mike has in mind .
All he did was declare that a triangle shape he sees when he squints his eyes is a pyramid and that it ’s an accurate representation of the Great Seal .
Even if there was a triangle on Saturn , we already have a clue of how it would ’ve formed and we know that not every single triangle has something to do with conspiracy fodder for a crank with a mind that ’s so open , his brain is teetering on the verge of falling out completely .
So far , I have not presented anything other than what is evident .
There is a spinning hexagon of clouds on Saturn ’s north pole .
Inside the hexagon is a triangle ( pyramid ) .
Inside the triangle are two concentric circles that look a lot like a human eye .
This shape looks a lot like the pyramid with the all - seeing eye on the back of the U.S. dollar .
Notice I have n’t mentioned anything about any conspiracy , or aliens , or anything of that kind .
These are just observations of the world around us .
Ah yes , the good old just - asking - questions method , the conspiracy theorist ’s equivalent of saying that he ’s not hiding anything up his sleeve .
Of course this is nonsense .
Mike has n’t met a conspiracy theory with which he has n’t fallen in love , be it 9/11 Truthism , or cold fusion suppression .
He ’s putting on his tinfoil hat while telling us that he ’s just putting on his regular old cap to take a jog around the Ecuadorian jungle .
Few of the things he said are evident since he ’s been telling you what you can see , where and how along the way .
This is a known tactic in persuasion and it ’s used with great success because human brains like to seek patterns and when a certain caption is placed under the right image , it makes our eyes much more prone to recognize patterns that just are n’t there .
Every scientific investigator knows this happens , but then again , when confronted with actual science , Mike tends to throw temper tantrums like a spoiled brat and pound himself on the chest .
From this point in the article , he goes off on vague , pseudoscientific tangents , hinting that the hexagon on the gas giant could be anything from aliens to a deity while adamantly insisting that he ’s not saying that any of it is true in any way , shape or form .
The only people he ’s deceiving with this are his loyal fans who believe anything he says , just as long as he indulges their New Age woo-isms in the process , and himself .
He ’s not as vague , cunning or insightful as he fancies himself to be .
Instead , he ’s just a clumsy conspiracy monger who sells the modern day equivalent of snake oil and imagines himself a counter - culture visionary .
If he really wanted to try his hand at presenting something interesting to his readers , he would ’ve read the scientific explanation for the hexagon rather than stare at pictures until he saw seals , triangles and circles .
And if he really did n’t know why there ’s a hexagon on Saturn , does n’t want to consult the experts on the matter , and is n’t saying anything about it , why did he write an article ?
Just to waste some more bandwidth with his version of whale .

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve late Sunday opened a program to ship U.S. dollars to Europe in a move to head off a broader financial crisis on the continent .
Other central banks , including the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank , are also involved in the effort .
The action reopens a program put in place during the 2008 global financial crisis under which dollars are shipped overseas through the foreign central banks .
In turn , these central banks can lend the dollars out to banks in their home countries that are in need of dollar funding to prevent the European crisis from spreading further .
The Fed said action is being taken " in response to the re-emergence of strains in U.S. dollar short - term funding markets in Europe . "
The debt crisis first erupted in Greece and there are fears that it could spread to Spain , Portugal and other eurozone countries .
The crisis has pushed up demand for the U.S. dollar and has sharply weakened the value of the euro , the currency used by 16 European countries .
The Fed said the action was being taken to " prevent the spread of strains to other markets and financial centers . "
The Bank of Japan will be considering similar action soon , the Fed said .
A so - called " swap " line with the Bank of Canada provides up to $ 30 billion .
Figures were n't provided for the other central banks .
The arrangements are authorized through January 2011 .
The Fed had wound down these crisis - era programs with other central banks in February , along with other emergency programs to get lending flowing more freely again and return stability to financial markets .
At that time , financial strains in the United States were easing , and the Fed began to take steps to move policy closer to normal .
It also had begun to lay out a plan to reel in the unprecedented stimulus money pumped out during the crisis .
The Fed 's balance sheet ballooned to $ 2.3 trillion , more than double where it stood before the crisis struck .
The program reopened on Sunday will expand the Fed 's balance sheet , economists say .
However , the program poses little credit risk to the Fed because the arrangements are with other central banks , they added .
WASHINGTON , April 29 , 2010  -- Surrounded by cheering supporters , Florida Governor Charlie Crist announced today at a press conference he was dropping out of the Florida Republican Senate primary race to run as an independent .
" My decision to run for the United States Senate as a candidate without party affiliation in many ways says more about our nation and our state , than it does about me , " Crist announced .
" For me it 's never been about doing what 's easy , " he said today , " it 's about doing what is right for the people first . "
" Unfortunately our our political system is broken , " he said .
" I have n't supported an idea because it 's a Republican idea or it's a Democratic idea , I support ideas that I believe are good ideas for the people . "
The primary is not until Aug. 24 , but polls showed Crist badly trailing former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio , a Tea Party favorite .
Republican Senate leaders immediately slammed his decision , demanding Crist return money they donated to his campaign .
" Elections are about trust and frankly , it is unclear whether Governor Crist deserves any , " said a joint statement from the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
" We plan to put our resources and support behind Marco Rubio . "
Crist 's pollsters , the Republican polling firm of Public Opinion Strategies , announced today that it is resigning from his campaign .
" Governor Crist 's decision has been ceaselessly speculated on in recent weeks .
Despite his difficulties in the Republican primary , we were loyally working for him as long as he was a Republican .
With his announcement that he is not running as a Republican , we will no longer be involved , " said Glen Bolger , a partner in the firm who worked with the Crist campaign .
Many question whether Crist 's switch is a warning sign for moderate Republicans across the country running for reelection this year .
But Rubio told ABC
News in an exclusive interview today that he thought Crist 's move had more to do with political convenience than ideology .
" In fact this has nothing to do with ideas or principles or ideology , it 's about quite frankly political convenience .
It 's about someone who wants to continue his career in politics and does n't believe he can do that this year within the Republican party , " Rubio said .
Watch Terry Moran 's day - in - the - life profile of Rubio tonight on ABC's " Nightline , " at 11:35 pm ET , or go to www.abcnews.com/nightline.
The move sets up a tight three - way race between Crist , Rubio , and likely Democratic nominee Rep. Kendrick Meeks .
Crist previewed his move a week ago , when he told reporters he was listening to advice to make the switch .
" I think I 'll take the advice of people in Florida instead of the advice of people in Washington , " Crist told reporters last week .
" They try to tell us a lot , and I do n't think we need to listen .
...
Things change . "
Crist was once a rising star of the GOP -- much as his challenger Rubio is now .
The Republican Party in turn made him one of the most powerful political figures in Florida , but he 's since lost that support .
Many say the cause of the governor 's slipping Republican support was Crist 's embrace of President Obama -- literally .
In February 2009 , the president visited Florida to promote the economic stimulus program , and invited Crist -- who supported it -- to appear onstage .
After Crist finished his remarks , he and the president exchanged a quick embrace that Republican critics quickly seized upon .
More damaging than the embrace itself was Crist 's support of the president 's stimulus plan , blasted by many Republicans .
Republicans in Washington have been bracing for Crist to leave the GOP .
They tried -- apparently in vain -- to persuade him to remain with the party .
But some Republicans say as Novembers mid-term elections draw closer , candidates are likely to move toward the party 's core principles , and those like Crist are sure to be left out .
" I think that this has less to do with Crist being a Republican and feeling he has to take this set of Republican principles , " Republican strategist Kevin Madden told " Good Morning America 's " George Stephanopoulos .
" Instead this has more to do with Crist and his political expediency .
He cares more about his career than he does about his political party . "
A Florida Republican source , who claimed not to have been notified personally of Crist 's plans , told ABC News that the internal polling Crist got back this week showed that the only possible path for him to win the Senate seat was to run as an independent .
Democrats hope a split of the conservative vote will help their man , Rep. Kendrick Meek .
" Some people feel running against two Republicans is better than running against one , " said Meek .
An April 13th Quinnipiac public opinion poll in Florida asked people how they would vote in a three - way race with Crist as an independent .
The poll showed a tight contest : Crist with 32 percent , Rubio with 30 , and Meek with 24 .
ABC News ' Teddy Davis , David Chalian and Gary Langer contributed to this report .
Greenpeace is accusing one of the nation 's largest conglomerates of sowing confusion around scientific assertions behind climate change , a broadside that comes amid waning public engagement on human - caused emissions .
Koch Industries , a sprawling private corporation based in Wichita , Kan. , and run by two brothers , is the primary sponsor of the " climate denial machine , " the environmental group asserts in a 44 - page report .
A company spokeswoman said Greenpeace is mischaracterizing Koch 's efforts to facilitate " an open and honest airing of all sides " on the climate debate .
Koch subsidiaries own refineries , oil pipelines , fertilizer facilities , coal and cement transportation systems , and other industrial operations .
The company also has several foundations through which it gave $ 24.9 million to conservative groups between 2005 and 2008 , the report says .
" The combination of foundation - funded front - groups , big lobbying budgets , [ political action committee ] donations , and direct campaign contributions makes Koch Industries and the Koch brothers among the most formidable obstacles to advancing clean energy and climate policy in the U.S. , " Greenpeace says .
The group calls Koch the " financial kingpin of climate science denial , " saying the brothers , Charles and David Koch , who jointly own 84 percent of the company , have replaced Exxon Mobil Corp. as the leader in stirring controversy around climate conclusions .
Greenpeace portrays the company 's efforts as a secret campaign to keep climate doubts pinging around an " echo chamber " that includes groups like the Cato Institute , the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute .
Koch - funded groups have developed " junk science " asserting that polar bears are not threatened by climate - induced melting of Arctic sea ice , promoted the notion that climate scientists are suppressing alternative findings , and financed studies that misinform the public on renewable energy benefits , Greenpeace says .
Company embraces ' sound science '
The company appears willing to embrace its controversial viewpoints .
It notes on its Web site that several theories exist in the debate around climate change , including the idea that Earth is " entering a cooling period . "
" We believe the political response to climate issues should be based on sound science , " the company spokeswoman , Melissa Cohlmia , responded by e-mail .
" Both a free society and the scientific method require an open and honest airing of all sides , not demonizing and silencing those with whom you disagree .
We 've strived to encourage an intellectually honest debate on the scientific basis for claims of harm from greenhouse gases . "
The company is taking its message to Congress .
Oil and gas sector lobbying has more than tripled since 2004 , reaching $ 168.3 million last year , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Koch spent $ 12.3 million on lobbyists in 2009 , ranking it fifth behind Exxon , Chevron Corp. , ConocoPhillips Co. and BP PLC .
Environmentalists , meanwhile , have increased their lobbying expenditures fourfold during that same period , spending $ 22.5 million last year .
Greenpeace spent $ 46,291 on lobbyists in 2009 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
The Koch brothers are devoted to " free market " solutions , and they 've been deeply involved in the libertarian think tank Cato Institute , which received more than $ 1 million from Koch Industries since 2005 , according to Greenpeace .
Cato 's ecological climatologist , Patrick Michaels , a critic of mainstream assertions around global warming , appeared in more than 20 media interviews within two weeks of the " Climategate " e-mail breach at the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit , the report says .
Michaels has called the CRU scientists a " mob " that has worked to bias climate science to support warming conclusions .
Cato founder and President Edward Crane said in a statement that " no funds from the Kochs have ever been designated for a specific project . "
" I 'm concerned that Greenpeace appears to be more interested in our funding sources than in the accuracy of the research that is being funded , " he added .
" Climategate ( not to mention peer - reviewed publications ) would vindicate that accuracy . "

American Left / Right politicians do n't care about this issue and pop culture icons only talk in favor of this to gain attention from the fools who think they actually care for anything except taking your money .
Its why I watch all current movies online for free .
Do the mentioned people care if they can't get married or see a dying loved one ?
Hell no they want this shit to happen because that way they can be relevant and feel good when they watch others suffering .
This stuff wo n't be fixed by the system because if it is the government will be even more useless then it is now .
Both sides oppress and whine about shit for our attention and continued reason to exist .
The government fears not being paid attention to like media icons when things are fixed they will have to work instead of getting money for absolutely no work .
Its why I am a libertarian if my way goes this shit will be a chapter in a history book , and politicians will actually do some work .

Now you may be wanting to turn your robot on and off with the push of a button .
The Arduino itself will run code in an endless loop until you unplug it , which can be quite frustrating when you plug in your robot on the table and it starts running away from you !
Integrating the button is a great step in this process because you 'll also learn how to use buttons for other things , like creating a bumper to detect when the robot hits a wall .
As a note , you 'll notice I removed the servos from the solderless breadboard for most of my pictures .
This just helps make the image more clear when I 'm showing different steps .
1 . To begin , disconnect power from the servo motors before doing any more work .
Remember to do this every time you add something to this project .
2 . Now you may want to be able to turn your robot on and off as opposed to having the robot immediately start moving when you connect the power .
3 . Identify a strip on the opposite side of the solderless breadboard to be power for on / off button ( and later the sensors ) .
4 . Using a long jumper wire connect the power ( +5V ) from the Arduino to the strip you just identified .
5 . Connect two jumper wires to the momentary switch and plug one end into the ( +5V ) power
6 . Plug the other end of the momentary switch into a smaller strip in the middle of the solderless breadboard .
7 . From that same strip connect a 10 K ohm resistor to the strip and the other end into ground
8 . Finally , connect a wire from the strip with the switch and the resistor on one end and place the other end in digital input 7 on the Arduino .
9 . Now , with the code you should be able to use the button to turn on and off the robot .
If you use the code with the LED ( digital output 13 ) you will see the on - board LED turn on and off with the robot .
This is a great way to test the Arduino code if you have the power to the motors disconnected .
Saving money on entertainment purchases is something most Americans can get behind .
But not all agree that buying stuff on the Internet should be tax and duty free .
However , many people in the “ anti- Tea Party movement ” who champion paying taxes to help government work draw the line if privacy is potentially breached .
“ The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of North Carolina today sent a letter to North Carolina Secretary of Revenue Kenneth Lay reiterating concern over a recent request by the state Department of Revenue ( NCDOR ) for the private records of Amazon.com customers , ” an ACLU press release sent to RAW STORY notes .
“ The letter informs Lay that the ACLU will take legal action on behalf of North Carolina residents who are Amazon.com customers if NCDOR persists in its demand for their constitutionally protected private information .
Specifically , the letter says the ACLU and its clients will intervene in an existing lawsuit brought by Amazon.com to stop NCDOR from collecting individually identifiable information that could be linked to specific purchases made on Amazon.com . ”

According to the lawsuit filed by Amazon in the Western District of Washington in April , NCDOR issued a request to Amazon for the purchase records since August 2003 of customers with a North Carolina shipping address in order to impose taxes on the purchases .
Amazon has apparently already provided the NCDOR with product codes that reveal the exact items purchased Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including books on the subjects of mental health , alcoholism and LGBT issues .
Amazon has withheld individually identifiable user information , including names and addresses that could be linked back to the individual purchases , but asserts that the NCDOR continues to insist that such information be disclosed .
In its letter today , the ACLU asserted that such disclosure would violate the constitutional rights of thousands of North Carolina consumers to read and purchase the lawful materials of their choice , free from government intrusion .
The following can be attributed to Aden Fine , staff attorney with the ACLU ’s Speech , Privacy and Technology Project : “ The Constitution guarantees Americans the right to read and buy the lawful materials of their choice without the government keeping tabs on the details of their purchases .
Amazon was right to stand up for the rights of its customers and to refuse to turn over their personal information to the North Carolina Department of Revenue . ”
The following can be attributed to Jennifer Rudinger , Executive Director of the ACLU of North Carolina : “ The ACLU is not taking issue with the Department ’s authority to collect taxes on the value of these purchases , but there is no legitimate reason why government officials need to know which North Carolina residents are reading what books or purchasing which specific brands of products .
We hope to be able to work out a satisfactory resolution to this matter so that consumers in North Carolina can rest assured that their privacy is protected .
”
Last week , Newsweek ’s Emily James noted , “ Nationally , the research shows , the collective loss from untaxed e-commerce is about $ 9 billion a year .
It ’s a hefty savings on books , CDs , and electronicsÃ¢â‚¬â€ but it could come at the expense of hospitals , parks , and bridges . ”

Microsoft looks to be on a bit of a hot streak with innovations lately , and though this here project has n't received much hype ( yet ) , we 'd say it 's one of the most ingenious user interface concepts we 've come across .
Skinput is based on an armband straddling the wearer 's biceps and detecting the small vibrations generated when the user taps the skin of his arm .
Due to different bone densities , tissue mass and muscle size , unique acoustic signatures can be identified for particular parts of the arm or hand ( including fingers ) , allowing people to literally control their gear by touching themselves .
The added pico projector is there just for convenience , and we can totally see ourselves using this by simply memorizing the five input points ( current maximum , 95.5 percent accuracy ) , particularly since the band works even if you 're running .
Make your way past the break to see Tetris played in a whole new way .
An investigation has failed to determine who caused the collision between the Sea Shepherd 's anti-whaling speedboat and a Japanese whaling ship in the Southern Ocean earlier this year .
The New Zealand trimaran Ady Gil eventually sank after it collided with the Japanese whaling ship Shonan Maru 2 in the Southern Ocean in early January .
The Ady Gil was sliced in two .
Six crew members were almost thrown overboard and one crew member suffered broken ribs .
Both the Japanese whalers and the Sea Shepherd crew blamed each other for the incident .
A report by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said Japan had refused to answer any questions and seized navigation information from the whaling ship as part of its own inquiry .
Greens Senator Bob Brown says the report is a political cop out .
" This is just a report which is written with an eye to giving the government an out from its responsibility for taking legal action , " he said .
" The Ady Gil left Hobart , it was on the high seas , the law is any country can take action against a breach of international law on the high seas . "
Japanese and New Zealand authorities are also investigating the collision .
It was a simple idea : take a collection of independent games , offer them with no DRM , and allow people to pay whatever they 'd like .
The result ?
123,182 people have paid for the bundle so far , and the total raised is now an incredible $ 1,126,563 .
That generosity will be rewarded .
" As of 5/11/10 , Aquaria , Gish , Lugaru HD , and Penumbra Overture pledge to go open source , " the developers blogged .
" We are preparing the sources right now and will be releasing them ASAP . "
The sale was a huge success , began many conversations , and it provided insight into the behavior of gamers .
Here 's a look at what comes next .
Much larger than expected
" It 's still pretty surreal .
Once it was launched , it was immediately clear that we were on to something , " Jeffry Rosen , the cofounder of Wolfire Games , told Ars .
Raising a million dollars was seen as possible , but it was certainly a best - case scenario .
" At the end , people really , really wanted to support the bundle and push it to make the million dollar milestone — we started seeing donations as large as $ 3333.33 and $ 1337.00 come in at the last few hours , " Rosen explained .
" Reddit completely lit up : I would estimate redditors to be the single largest benefactor , by far . "
A lot of people were talking about DRM and piracy , but fewer were talking about the actual games in the bundle .
Did the games themselves — which are more than worth your time — get lost in the shuffle ?
" I think we introduced a huge number of gamers to the indie community , and I hope they like what they see , " Rosen said .
" All of our forums are extremely busy now with activity .
With Lugaru , people are actually already contributing patches , now that it is open source , and improving it . "
That 's the bonus prize : the games that are now open source .
You 'll want to check back for the licenses — no one is going to get rich reselling modified games — but poking around the code and improving the experience or trying your hand at creating content is going to be a great thing for the independent gaming community .
" When I saw this flurry of positive contributions , it immediately reminded me of its mirror image — the rush to be the first cracker to crack each new DRM scheme ...
It makes me a little sad to see all this effort expended on games with DRM .
Could it work the same way in reverse ? "
Rosen wrote on the blog .
" When Aquaria , Gish , and Penumbra Overture open up , I hope the community will help build them up with the same vigor that crackers tear DRM down . "
What did we learn ?
Just as impressive as the money raised was the amount of information gained about the community that picked up the bundle .
There was a blog post detailing the popularity of the bundle on Linux and Mac OS X systems — much higher than assumed .
The piracy rate was also explored , and that launched a heated conversation in our comments about what those numbers mean .
Publishers complain about piracy , and gamers complain about DRM , but in this case something new and novel was attempted , and the end result was profits for the developers , a ton of publicity , and another lump of cash for two very deserving causes .
" We are still finishing up , but whether it 's us or someone else — I guarantee you will see more of these .
We 've already gotten a number of requests to purchase the website 's code , " Rosen told Ars .
" You can bet there are many others already in development whether it 's from developers directly or from other people . "
What 's next now that the sale has reached its conclusion ?
You can still donate and receive the games , but Rosen is going to return to his passion .
" I have not really slept properly in over a week , so it will be great to be able to relax and rejoin my brother , working on our game . "
At this point , us twenty - somethings and younger would be hard pressed to find a parent who has n't at least played computer Solitaire .
It may not even be that big of a stretch to assume that a fair amount of 40 - to - 50 somethings have touched a joystick at some point in their lives .
There is something to be said about how fair games have come when we can finally acknowledge that , yes , there is a generation gap .
Explaining how a game filled with desolate grays and browns could be appealing to a group of people who played in a generation where putting as many limited colors on screen may be a difficult task .
I can safely assume my mom's taste in games now have not changed since her gaming addiction then .
Though I am sure I could show my mother the ' technical ' advancements and achievements games have made in the past twenty years -- her question , though simple , can be applied to any child explaining any media to their parents .
" Why would I want to play this ? "
Alexander 's parents are versed in very specific genres of games .
Which , i believe , makes the task more difficult .
This past weekend I went home and seen my mom rifle through her cabinets in order to show me how much fun she and my sister were having playing Wii Sports Resort .
Considering my mom forced an old , battered NES controller in my hand as punishment when I did n't do so well on a test as a youth -- only to then be dominated in a twenty - minute game of Double Dribble or Ms. Pac Man .
By now , many of you have already read Leigh Alexander 's article on that other site .
Within the article , she goes into great detail as to how difficult it was to translate her excitement for Fallout 3 to her parents .
Aside from the fact that Fallout 3 is n't the most accessible game for -- well , gamers -- its slightly perturbing to see the conclusion Alexander comes to .
Because of the lack of a developed language or lexicon in describing games in simplified terms [ no matter the complexities that currently exist ] , Alexander feels that she has in some way failed games , by not being able to at least convey how a post - apocalyptic world from a first person perspectivecould be appealing .
just a generation gap .
Non-gamers are usually non-gamers for a reason , much like non-classical music listeners may not want to hear piano keys being pounced upon for minutes on end .
Trying to explain the core concept of BioShock to a non-gamer could be just as difficult as explaining Chopin 's relevance to classical hoity - toity douche bags punching a keyboard and calling it beautiful .
It will take years of refinement of the media and subsequent years of writing about said media , for a game of any genre to attract the average non- gamer 's eye .
But maybe Alexander has a point .
Maybe it " is n't a generation gap either . "
I would partially agree and add , it isn' ta generation gap .
Non-gamers are usually non-gamers for a reason , much like non-classical music listeners may not want to hear piano keys being pounced upon for minutes on end .
Trying to explain the core concept ofto a non-gamer could be just as difficult as explaining Chopin 's relevance to classical music .
It has taken years and plenty of hard working pianists to convince me that classical music is n't just a bunch ofdouche bags punching a keyboard and calling it beautiful .
It will take years of refinement of the media and subsequent years of writing about said media , for a game of any genre to attract the average non-eye .
Here We See Leigh Alexander Playing Games .
Adorable , But I 'm Not Seeing Her Hand Being Held .
So why is it so much easier to " get " a game like GTA or by extension , Red Dead Redemption , than other titles , even those with far fewer elements going on ?
It 's because GTA is universal : everyone 's wished they could just act out against their environment without real - world consequences , just for fun , from time to time .
Not all games are built on such accessible ideas – nor should they be .
We could explain to our friends why we relate to them anyway , if only we had the right words .
The crux of Alexander 's argument is something I can only partially agree with , because I strongly believe that we can have as many words in as many different languages -- there will always be a barrier of entry when it comes to games [ much like any media ] .
The concept of GTA is n't actually accessible .
Its design is .
And I 'm willing to argue to the death that this cultural phenomena of GTA did n't occur , wholly , until GTA III .
The game had the same concept , the same personality , but once the design of this game was shown in a more presentable manner [ a little controversy does n't hurt either ] , more eyes were intrigued .
GTA was n't always universal , but hats off to the Rockstar guys for working hard in making the series as universal as it is now .
Look at Super Mario Brothers for the NES .
Look at Castlevania : Symphony of the Night .
Games that are quite ridiculous when explaining to anyone -- gamer or non -- words of any kind will only get you so far .
Sometimes it is best to just be as vague as possible or in most cases , pass the controller .
Super Mario : Modern Warfare -- Maybe It 's Time Mario Got A Unnecessary Reboot .
To the more complex stories and concepts of gaming there is indeed a failing of language .
This failing is n't applicable to just non-gamers .
There are several gamers that I know who have no interest in playing BioShock simply because it does n't look like something familiar .
It is good that our crowd of nerds and geeks are getting more diverse .
It is also good to hear that more and more gamers are sharing with others our hobby [ or obsession ] and subsequently running out of words to paint the picture of our very intricate pixallated experiences .
Though our language in describing games could stand for a tune - up it is my firm belief that explaining any media with words pales in comparison to a one - on - one experience with it .
Then Alexander travels down a road set with pitfalls and traps buy exclaiming , " The language does need to improve .
Not just for the sake of attracting outsiders , but to make sharing within our fragmented community more popular .
I am sure there were a lot of women [ and some men ] who got into gaming because of their significant others .
As much as it takes words and sharing we have to give more credit to peoples ' capacity to be generally inquisitive .
The concept of a plumber jumping down a sewer to save a princess by butt - stomping mushrooms and defeating a reptilian overlord takes more of an adventurous personality than a shmuck like me writing about the fun factor of the game .

A Sino-American study looked at the effects of a patented cinnamon extract called CinSulin from Chinese company Tang An Medical to reduce glucose levels in people with insulin resistance .
Insulin resistance occurs when cells become less sensitive to the glucose - lowering effects of insulin , which results in increases in blood levels of glucose .
When glucose levels become abnormal ( hyperglycemia ) type - 2 diabetes occurs .
According to findings presented at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology ( FASEB ) Annual Meeting in Anaheim , hyperglycemic subjects receiving daily supplements of the cinnamon extract showed decreased fasting blood levels of glucose of 7.5 percent , compared with 1.6 percent in the placebo group .
“ This clinical trial adds to the growing evidence that aqueous cinnamon extract may be beneficial for insulin - resistant populations , ” ​ said senior researcher Dr Barbara Stoecker from Oklahoma State University .
The study , funded by the USDA - ARS , Tang - An Medical and Oklahoma State , adds to a growing body of research reporting that active compounds in cinnamon may improve parameters associated with diabetes .
With the number of people are affected by diabetes in the EU 25 projected to increase to 26 million by 2030 , up from about 19 million currently – or 4 per cent of the total population –approaches to reduce the risk of diabetes are becoming increasing attractive .
The statistics are even more startling in the US , where almost 24 million people live with diabetes , equal to 8 per cent of the population .
The total costs are thought to be as much as $ 174 billion , with $ 116 billion being direct costs from medication , according to 2005 - 2007 American Diabetes Association figures .
Study details ​
Dr Stoecker and her co-workers recruited 137 hyperglycemic patients with an average age of 61 to participate in their double - blind , placebo controlled study .
Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or a 500 milligram daily dose of the cinnamon extract for two months .
Results showed that fasting glucose levels decreased from an average of 8.85 to 8.19 mmol / L in the cinnamon group , while the placebo group experienced a decrease from 8.57 to 8.44 mmol / L .
Furthermore , blood sugar levels two hours after a carbohydrate - rich meal decreased by 12 percent following cinnamon supplementation , compared to only 3.1 percent in the placebo group .
The data was presented as part of the scientific program of the American Society for Nutrition at the Experimental Biology 2010 meeting in Anaheim .

Cinnamon and diabetes ​
Despite numerous studies championing the role of cinnamon for diabetes management , a recent meta- analysis questioned the potential benefits of cinnamon for type 2 diabetes .
The analysis considered only five randomised placebo - controlled trials involving 282 subjects , and found no significant benefits of cinnamon supplement on glycated haemoglobin ( A1C ) , fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) , or other lipid parameters .
The Scandinavian researchers make reference to the potential in diabetes , while also acknowledging the meta - analysis results .
“ Clearly , a long - term clinical trial involving a larger number of diabetes patients is needed to evaluate the effects of cinnamon supplementation in type 2 diabetes , ” wrote Hlebowicz and her co-workers .

One week later than scheduled , the Fedora Project has released the first and only alpha version of its Fedora 13 Linux distribution , aka Goddard , which is scheduled for release in mid May .
With the feature freeze having come into effect a month ago , the first pre-release version of the distribution , which is being advertised under the release slogan " Rock it " , now contains all major features likely to find their way into Fedora 13 .
A pre-release version of GNOME 2.30 , for example , adds new programs for managing users and for colour calibration of monitors , scanners and printers .
The development team has also enhanced integration of PulseAudio into KDE , version 4.4 of which is now included in the distribution .
Moblin desktop fans can install a preview edition of version 2.2 .
NetworkManager now offers the option of being controlled using a command line program and has improved support for establishing dial - up Bluetooth connections .
The distribution now installs printer drivers and language packs semi-automatically where required .
The alpha version uses a pre-release version of Linux 2.6.33 , but the final version is already available as an update .
As reported previously , the distribution includes an experimental version of the open source Nouveau driver which provides 3D support for more recent GeForce graphics cores .
Most of the distribution 's Python programs use Python 2.6.4 , but Python 3.1.1 can now be installed in parallel .
Debugging options have been enhanced in both versions .
The beta version is scheduled for release in four weeks time and one or more release candidates should be available in late April , though these will be less widely distributed than the alpha and beta versions .
Users installing one of the pre-release versions will be kept up to date with the development version , amended pretty much daily , and subsequently the final version through regular updates .
It is also possible to install the current development version directly from the internet via special installation media .
Users who want a foretaste of Fedora 14 can switch from the alpha to the main development tree , Fedora Rawhide , which , under the new release scheme introduced during the Fedora 13 release cycle , is already being used to prepare the alpha version of the next - but - one version of Fedora .
The main Fedora developer mailing list is currently buzzing with activity , as those involved in the project eagerly debate , across several threads , the best way of updating the software .
Topics under discussion include administrative issues , such as requiring updates to first pass through an ' updates - testing ' repository before they can be distributed to all users of the relevant Fedora version in the form of regular updates .
There is also the issue of where new versions of applications should be accepted as updates for finished versions of Fedora and where they should wait for a forthcoming version .

Two of the team ’s biggest players , Patrick Marleau and Evgeni Nabokov , will become unrestricted free agents on July 1st .
Marleau made $ 6.3 million this season , while Nabokov made $ 5.375 million .
The Sharks need to let Evgeni Nabokov walk come July 1st .
Nabokov has played well in the regular season , but has only twice posted better than a .910 % in six playoffs as a starter .
His penchant for giving up back - breaking goals that deflate the Sharks has been the main reason the Sharks routinely fall short of expectations in the playoffs .
To replace Nabokov the Sharks can sign a free agent goalie like Dan Ellis or make a bolder move like acquiring Tim Thomas from the Boston Bruins .
Thomas lost the starting job in Boston to Tuukka Rask and it does n’t seem like the young Fin has any intention of relinquishing that title .
Thomas will make $ 5 million for the next three seasons , which is cheaper than Nabokov ’s current contract .
While it might be a risk trading for a 36 - year - old goalie that has three years left on his contract we should remember that Thomas is only one season removed from a Vezina Trophy .
The Bruins also ca n’t demand much for Thomas because they have cap space issues and Thomas has effectively become a backup goalie in Boston .
This could effectively be a cash dump for the Bruins .
The Sharks could be able to get a top - tier goalie on the cheap .
However , Thomas just underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his left hip and will require three to four months for recovery and rehabilitation .
This makes the deal riskier for the Sharks considering it is not a guarantee that Thomas will be healthy in time for the start of the 2010 - 2011 season .
The Sharks ’ other major free agent , Patrick Marleau , had an excellent post - season where he scored 8 goals and 13 points in 14 games ( 2 were game winning goals ) .
He played a terrific series against the Blackhawks , but did n’t receive nearly enough support from his teammates .
The Sharks need to re-sign Patrick Marleau .
He had a reputation changing playoffs where he looked like the most dangerous player on the ice in many games and he played a physical style of game that included actually sacrificing his body by blocking shots .
Of the big three ( Marleau , Heatley , and Thornton ) , Marleau is the easiest to get rid of considering he ’s a UFA , but the Sharks would receive no compensation and would be a worse team next season because of it .
The Sharks need to have Marleau next year in order to have a chance of winning the Stanley Cup .
Dany Heatley is signed for four more years at $ 7.5 million per season and is probably not a likely candidate to be traded considering that the Sharks just acquired him ( not to mention his contract ) .
If the Sharks are serious about making a major change ( and they should be ) then the best move they could make is trading Joe Thornton .
Thornton had his best post - season this year , but it still was n’t enough for the Sharks to advance past the Blackhawks .
After a great series against Detroit , Thornton managed to tally only one assist against the Blackhawks and was frustrated all series long by Dave Bolland ( who Thornton at one point said was small and easy to play against ) .
Thornton has one more year left on a $ 7.2 million contract and would immediately attract widespread attention from across the league .
Despite his playoff struggles , this is a player who has accumulated 447 points over the previous five seasons ( that ’s an average of 95 per season ) .
There are many teams who need the services of a number one centre and the Sharks could trade Thornton and fill many of the team ’s holes in the process .
One hole the Sharks may have is on the blueline .
Rob Blake is 40 - years - old and may decide that he ’d rather not return for another season of hockey .
He ’s also a UFA and maybe the Sharks will decide that they do n’t want to play a 40 - year - old as their second defenceman .
Losing Thornton ’s production would hurt , but the Sharks would still have two top - tier players in Marleau and Heatley , plus rising players like Ryan Clowe , Devin Setoguchi , and Joe Pavelski .
This would certainly be a bold move , but one that I think is necessary for the Sharks to eventually win a Stanley Cup .
At some point you have to recognize that the players you have just are n’t capable of getting the job done .
At that point you need to make changes .
Calgary Flames fans should be nodding their heads right now .
This article appears in the May 31 Travel Issue of ESPN The Magazine .
It is an excerpt from Rick 's book , which you can find out about and order in the sidebar to the right .
Okay kids , today 's activity is to go down to your local Pizza Hut , have the oven set for 261° and insert your body into it .
The tips of your ears start to ignite .
The backs of your arms scream .
Your throat burns as if somebody had stuck a tiki torch down it .
Your lips feel bitten by large , unseen raccoons .
And you have n't hit 30 seconds .
Now do it for 10 minutes or more , and that 's what it 's like to compete in quite possibly the world 's dumbest sport : the Sauna World Championships .
I know .
I entered .
The eighth annual championships were held in August 2007 in Heinola , Finland , a lake - riddled town 87 kilometers north of Helsinki .
As my wife , The Lovely Cynthia ( TLC ) , and I drove up , my mind reeled at what kind of things competitors would say to sportswriters afterward : " I just got hot .
What can I say ? "
I went over the rules .
Competing in six - person heats -- written without irony -- the 84 contestants battle to see whose skin boils last .
You may wear only a bathing suit that goes eight inches down the leg and absolutely nothing else .
You can wipe sweat from your face but not your body .
You can not cover your ears with your hands .
You may not lean over too far .
Ambulances will be standing by .
Good luck !
In doing some prematch research , TLC discovered that there was an Australian gambling site that set the odds .
Three - time defending champ Timo " The Great " Kaukonen was a 2.15 - 1 favorite .
I was listed at 101 - 1 . Nobody but a Finn has ever won the title .
In fact , nobody but a Finn has ever been in the six - man final .
There are 5.2 million people in Finland , and nearly two million saunas .
This is a nationally televised event .
At the registration table , officials asked me to remove my shirt , then scrawled my number , 82 , on each of my biceps .
I learned I was in a heat with Timo the Great .
And that 's when -- as if on cue -- his sauna - company - sponsored mobile home , complete with a sauna inside , pulled up .
Timo waded through some autograph seekers and arrived at the table carrying a quart of water .
His skin is permanently cherry and shiny hard , like a newly painted model car .
He has long blond hair ( to protect the ears ) and is stout and thin lipped ( also a very good trait for a saunist ) .
Timo 's pulse rises to 200 beats per minute when he competes , and he actually trains aerobically , riding a bike and running a lot .
He is also very quiet .
In this game you do n't want to be a person who needs a lot of movement .
With the help of an interpreter , I interviewed him .
Me : " How much time have you been spending in the sauna ? "
Timo : " About 20 sessions a day . "
Me : " Oh , my god !
At what temperature ? "
Timo : " Lately it 's been at about 140 °C [ 284 °F ] . "
Me : " Oh , good lord !
Do you drink a lot of water coming into the competition ? "
Timo : " Oh , yes , about 10 liters [ 2.6 gallons ] a day the past three days .
[ He smiles at my reaction . ]
You too , I 'm sure , yes ? "
Me : " Do you count beer ? "
Timo : " No . "
I was so screwed .
The only other American entered was software designer Rick Ellis , formerly of the Soviet Union , who'd built his own sauna at his upstate New York home .
" I even considered putting $ 2,000 down on myself , " he told me .
" But I could n't figure out how . "
He said he 's been training at 110 °C ( 230 °F ) and lasted 16 minutes once .
His wife looked at him ruefully and shook her head .
He turned to her , exasperated , and said , " What ? "
Suddenly it was time for the heats to begin , and more than 500 fans took their places in the open - air theater .
Onstage were two hexagonal , glass - faced saunas and two giant viewing screens .
The gladiators in the opening heat were trotted out , all soaking wet from their freezing preheat showers .
Ominously , a little man opened the sauna door , and the six marched in , like drumsticks into a fryer .
Fans chanted wildly .
Reilly was no match for the hot box .

You'd be amazed at how much fun it is to watch a grown man come apart like a $ 9 sweater .
A Belarusian started out sane , just sitting there .
Every 30 seconds a pitiless stream of water came out from a ceiling shower in the center of the sauna and splashed on the molten - hot rocks , creating a 100 % humidity level in the room that would melt gold .
About two minutes in our man started rocking a little .
At three his eyes started blinking oddly .
At four he began twitching .
At five his eyes got huge .
At six he started swallowing each breath like a gulp of scorching soup .
Then he started glancing around wildly , as if to say to the others , Are you mad ?
Do n't you see what 's happening ?
They 've locked us in a Crock - Pot !
He started wiping his eyes and mouth .
He moved his hands out toward his thighs to rub them , then realized that 's not allowed and did so anyway , crazily , as though he were covered in lice .
The judges flagged him once , then twice .
Then he lurched for the door , and he was out .
Sanity and cool air whooshed back into his brain , and suddenly he was normal and smiling again .
In each opening heat only two of the six moved on .
Our friend Rick Ellis from New York went 8:03 , to advance .
I was waiting to congratulate him when I noticed something awful .
There were two big patches of skin missing on his upper lip , just under his nostrils .
" Dude , were you breathing through your nose ? " I asked .
" Yeah , why ? " he said .
" Your skin is all gone under your nose !
It 's burned off ! "
He felt his upper lip in horror .
He ran to the mirror .
The tops of his ears were split open and bubbling .
Under his arms and on his back were bright purple patches .
His forehead was painted bright red and blistering in front of his eyes .
" Man , I 'm burning up .
Even my tongue is burned . "
His wife begged him to quit , but he refused .
Said he had trained too hard .
She shook her head .
" What ? " he asked .
And that 's when they called my heat backstage .
I vowed to do whatever Timo did .
He took a drink .
I took a drink .
He stretched his neck .
I stretched my neck .
Three times he took a freezing - cold shower backstage , so three times I took one .
By the time I was introduced , I was shivering like a newly shaved Chihuahua .
I drew seat No. 6 , near the door .
Timo was No. 2 . We went in , and it was so instantly , shockingly , insanely hot , my brain just stopped working .
It was like walking into a bonfire and pulling up a chair in the middle of it .
My strategy was to go in and keep time by the 30 - second water splashes , but that plan was scrapped approximately seven seconds in .
Thinking literally hurt .
I tried to stare at the rocks and not blink , because blinking hurt .
I tried to take very few breaths , because breathing hurt .
I was sure flames were coming out of my mouth .
My back seemed to have ignited .
I was convinced my ears were literally on fire , but if I moved even slightly , they hurt more .
I tried sitting up higher , but it was even hotter .
I tried crouching down more , but then I was nearer to the unforgiving rocks .
It was so awful I wished Barry Bonds were in there .
Then came the hideous , cruel , pitiless splashes of water , each one lasting three seconds .
I decided to think of something to get my mind off the torturous pain , so I began naming every National League team .
I counted the Jets twice .
I was just about to bolt into the fresh air when -- miraculously -- the tall , skinny guy next to me ran out .
Amazing !
I was n't last !
I had no idea how much time had elapsed -- four minutes ?
Six ?
I promised myself :
When I get to the point where I can no longer stand it , I 'll count 60 seconds and go .
Four seconds later , I decided I could no longer stand it .
So I started counting .
One , two , three ...
It was the longest minute of my life .
At 60 I went barreling out .
Watching other heats , I 'd wondered why even losers came out grinning and raising their hands in victory , but now I knew .
The cool air was so beautiful , so redeeming , so life giving .
You could French - kiss Osama bin Laden .
I looked at the clock .
3:10 ?
That was it ?
When did the first guy bolt ?
" 2:40 , " I was told .
Which meant I 'd counted my 60 seconds in 30 .
I took a gloriously freezing shower , then watched the rest of the heat on TV .
Timo , wearing a spa-maker 's name across the front of his Speedo , made the quarterfinals .
Backstage he was surprisingly pink .
I went up to him , chummy , and slapped him on the back in congratulation .
He turned as if he wanted to knife me .
Note to self : Slapping backs a definite no - no among saunists .
Then there was Ellis , who entered the quarterfinals with dozens of blisters on his body .
" Man , I knew I was in trouble right away , " he later said .
" When I felt this big , half - dollar - size blister behind my back , I said , ' Okay , that 's enough .
I gotta get out . ' "
He was the first out , at 4:15 , and he was melting like the wicked witch .
His forehead , his lips and his ears were giant lumps of pus .
His triceps were riddled with pebble - size blisters , dozens of them .
So much skin was hanging off him he looked like the world 's most successful gastric - bypass patient .
His forehead was a science - fiction movie .
His nose was cooked like a forgotten kielbasa .
And this was just what we could see .
He lifted up his shirt and there it was : this horrible , huge , pus - filled sac -- the size of a $ 3 pancake -- just hanging off his armpit .
His wife gasped .
TLC turned away in horror .
When we dragged him to first aid the guy said , " You must go to the hospital .
When these blisters break , you will lose lots of fluid and be highly susceptible to infection .
We can't do anything for you here .
It is too serious . "
TLC and I piled him into our rented Volvo and took him to the hospital .
As we left , his wife shook her head .
They 'll be turning his sauna into a shoe closet .
The two favorites -- Timo the Great and Markku Mustonen -- made the final .
Each of them just sat and sweated and took furtive glances at the other , waiting to see if he'd do him the great favor of expiring so he could get the hell out .
Ten minutes .
Eleven .
Twelve .
It was a Hades standoff .
Suddenly , out of nowhere , Markku stuck his hand out for Timo to shake .
Timo looked down and shook it , whereupon Markku jumped up and flew out the door , followed like a noon shadow by Timo , champion again , in a winning time of 12:26 .
The winner was humble .
" I was guessing he was better than me today , " the great man said afterward .
" So I was surprised he shook my hand and left .
Nobody 's ever done that before . "
And what did Timo the Great get for suffering longer than every other person ?
Sauna speakers .
The meme today about how RSS may or may not “ break through ” is the perfect example of the new media vanguard not having a clue about real media .
( Dave Winer opines on how RSS can break through , Scoble says it already has , Dion Hinchcliffe thinks it can but it has to be easier to use )
Reality Check : People who use RSS readers to any degree will always be “ edge cases ” simply because your average person does n’t consume enough media or care enough about their media to go to the trouble of building their own reading lists or even consuming somebody else ’s reading list .
What they care about is finding a small number of sources , and usually it ’s one or two ‘ big picture ’ sources plus a couple of specific - interest sources , who they can trust and who reflect their general outlook on life .
Think about almost anyone you know who is an average media consumer .
They may have have a newspaper they read and a couple of magazines they buy about their special interests .
That ’s typical media consumption levels .
( In fact , these days just being a newspaper reader almost makes you an edge case because so many people will simply rely on their favourite television news broadcast ) .
One of the first things you learn as a journalist , is that the last thing your typical reader notices is the byline .
The assumption that your RSS crowd makes , is that people give a damn as to who you are and why your opinion matters .
And that people actually want to be that much more informed .
Try this experiment .
Set up the computer of your nearest and dearest who is n’t actually a geek with an ideal RSS environment .
Find all the feeds they might be interested in and pull it altogether for them .
See if it catches on .
I bet it does n’t .
Your best hope is if you choose one or two RSS feeds and feed it into something they already use like like GMail .
That push facility is quite useful to remind a user to consume media but it does n’t mean everybody is suddenly going to want to aggregate dozens of sources .
Another reality check :
How many non -techie do you know , who even consume media via email , which is the medium RSS is supposed to be replacing ?
In media land , you ’ve already had your rabid consumers and your average consumers .
Your rabid consumers like to be informed .
They like to think they know more than the bloke next door .
They ’ll probably use RSS in one form or another .
However , your average consumer actually does n’t need , or want to be , that informed .
Television news flashes are enought to satiate their information requirements .
And it ’s not a technology issue .
It ’s a media consumption issue .
This is why reading lists will never catch on .
If you ’re a sophisticated enough media consumer , you ’ll want to build your own .
If you ’re not , you wo n’t want a reading list at all .
